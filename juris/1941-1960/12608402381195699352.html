The complaint was filed  with the Court of  First Instance  of Manila on August 15, 1952. <br><br>Defendant answered  denying any and  all liability in favor of  the plaintiff, upon the ground that the former had already paid the latter everything due to  him, that he had never  rendered  any  overtime services,  and that he had voluntarily quit  his job, and assailing  the jurisdiction  of the  Court of First  Instance of  Manila to hear and  decide the  case,  the  claim  involved  therein  being allegedly  within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation  Commission. <br><br>After  appropriate proceedings,  said  court rendered  a decision finding  that it  had no jurisdiction  to  entertain plaintiff's  claim  for  sick and vacation leave of  absence, medical aid  and actual  and  compensatory damages,  and dismissing his claim for overtime pay,  upon the  ground of insufficiency of the evidence, without special pronouncement as  to costs.  Plaintiff appealed  from this  decision to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the records to this Court, the jurisdiction of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> being involved  in the  appeal. <br><br>With respect to this decision, appellant  contends  that, despite section 46  of Act No.  3428, as  amended,  by Republic Act No. 772,  reading: <br><blockquote>"The Workmen's Compensation Commissioner shall have <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusive</span> jurisdiction to  hear and decide  claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation  Act,  subject to appeal  to  the  Supreme Court, in the  same manner and in the  same period as  provided by law and by rules of court for appeal from the Court  of Industrial Relations to the  Supreme  Court."   (Italics ours.)</blockquote>the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a  quo</span>  had  jurisdiction to  hear  and  decide his claim for sick and vacation leave of  absence, medical aid and actual and compensatory damages, his  cause of action in relation thereto having  accrued  before  June 20, 1952, when  said  Republic Act  No.  772 was  approved and  became  effective.   A  similar pretense was rejected by this Court  in Castro vs. Sagales,   (94  Phil.,  208), and we  do not find sufficient reasons  to depart from the view adopted in our decision therein, from which we  quote:<br><blockquote>"Republic Act  No, 772 effective  June  20, 1952 conferred  upon the Workmen's Compensation  Commission 'exclusive jurisdiction' to hear and decide claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act,  subject  to  appeal  to this  Supreme Court.  Before  the pasage of said Act demands  for compensation  had to be submitted to the regular courts.<br><br>"It is  true that the right arises  from the  moment of the  accident, but such  right must  be declared  or confirmed by the  government agency empowered by law  to make the  declaration. If  at the time the petition for such declaration is  addressed to the court, the latter has no  longer  authority to  do  so,  obviously  it  has  no power to entertain the petition.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic Act No. 772 is very  clear  that  on and. after June 20, 1952 all claims  for compensation shall be decided exclusively by  the  Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.  This claim having  been formulated for the first time in August, 1952 in the Court  of  First Instance of Bulacan,  the latter had no  jurisdiction, at that time, to act  upon it.</span> No constitutional objection may be interposed  to the  application of the law conferring jurisdiction upon the  Commission, because  the statute does not thereby operate retroactively; it is made to operate upon claims <span style="font-style: italic;">formulated</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the  law's  approval. *  * *  'A retrospective  law, in a legal sense, is  one wbich takes, away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing lawst or creates a  new obligation and imposes a new duty, or attaches a new  disability, in respect of transactions or considerations   already  past.  Hence,  remedial, statutes, or statutes relating to remedies or modes  of  procedure, which  do not create new or take  away vested rights but  only operate in furtherance of the remedy or confirmation of rights already existing, do not come within  the legal conception of a retrospective  law,  or the general  rule  against the  retrospective operation of statutes.'  (50 Am. Jur., p. 505). <br><br>"It is  argued that Republic Act No. 772 should  not be enforced as to accidents happening before  its approval, because  it has introduced changes affecting  vested rights  of  the parties.  Without going in to details, it might be admitted that changes  as to substantive  rights will  not govern such 'previous' accidents.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Yet here we are dealing with remedies and jurisdiction which the Legislature has power  to determine and apportion.</span>  And  then  it is  hard to imagine  how one litigant could acquire a vested right to be heard by one particular court, even before, he  has  submitted  himself to that particular court's jurisdiction."  (Italics  supplied).</blockquote>It is urged,  however,  that  "sick and vacation leave  of absence are not specially provided in the Workmen's Compensation  Act;"  that "actual and compensatory damages is provided for in Chapter 2 of the Civil Code of the Philippines;" that "medical aid, although provided in section 13, Workmen's Compensation Act, is also provided in  Act 3961, Commonwealth Act 324 and Republic Act No. 46;" and that "the Workmen's  Compensation Law cannot and should not be interpreted  to mean that labor can no longer invoke the provisions of the Civil Code * * *  and other Labor Law."<br><br>Apart from the fact that  the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act have been <span style="font-style: italic;">specifically invoked</span> in paragraph 16  of appellant's  complaint,  his contention is refuted by the first paragraph  of section 5 of  said Act, which  provides:<br><blockquote>"Exclusive right to compensation.—The rights and remedies granted by one  particular court, even before, he has submitted himself to him to  compensation shall   exclude  all other rights and  remedies accruing to the  employee, his  personal representatives,  dependents or nearest of kin  against the  employer under the Civil Code and other laws, because of said injury."  (Italics ours.) </blockquote>It should be noted that the right to compensation of employees pursuant to the foregoing section, was exclusive in nature since the <span style="font-style: italic;">original</span> Workmen's Compensation Act (No. 3428).  At any rate, although we have  held  that, under Commonwealth Act No. 103, the Court of Industrial Relations could require an employer to grant its employees and laborers vacation and sick leave with pay, if the employer's financial condition justify it (Leyte Land Transportation Co. vs. Leyte Farmers' Laborers' Union, 80 Phil., 842; Dee C. Chuan &amp; Sons, vs. Court of  Industrial  Relations, 85 Phil., 365, 47 Off.  Gaz.,  3476) (see, also, Sunripe Coconut Workers Union vs. Sunripe Coconut Products, CIR No. 33-V),  there has never been any order or decision  of said Court imposing such obligation upon defendant herein, and the ordinary courts of justice have, under  our  laws, no authority to assume the jurisdiction thus vested in the Court of Industrial  Relations by  Commonwealth Act No. 103.  What is more, the work  cited by appellant in support of his  pretense  (Labor Laws by Francisco)  states that "with the abolition of the court's general jurisdiction over labor disputes",  upon the enactment  of Republic Act No. 875, said power  of the Court  of Industrial Relations  "has also been <span style="font-style: italic;">abolished</span>", in the absence of certification by the President, pursuant  to section 10 of the latter  act  (The Law Governing Labor  Disputes  in  the  Philippines, by Vicente J. Francisco, Vol.  I, p. 166). <br><br>It is  next urged that: <br><blockquote>"The lower  court erred in  denying  plaintiff-appellant claim for overtime pay  and in dismissing plaintiff-appellant's claim."  (2nd assignment of error, Appellant's Brief, p.  25, Record.)</blockquote>It appears that the evidence for appellant, on this point, consisted of  his  testimony and that  of his wife Dolores Pelaez, which were contradicted by the testimony of  Tan Pui Koa and Sy Kiat, appellee's assistant cashier  and  paymaster,  respectively, and that  His Honor, the trial Judge, was not satisfied  with said evidence for plaintiff-appellant, for the reasons  stated in the  decision appealed  from,  in the following language: <br><blockquote>"* * * What the Court  has to decide finally  is whether plaintiff had really been working daily even on nightshifts for more  than twelve working hours continuously  as he  has alleged under oath in his complaint and as he has testified during the trial or whether as set up by defendant by way of special  defense, plaintiff's regular shift has always been 8  hours only and that whenever he rendered overtime service he  was duly paid for it. <br><br>"In this connection, in consonance with  the social justice program of the government, such as  the Court  sympathizes with the cause of  plaintiff  because he  is a  laborer, the Court deeply regrets to state that the  plaintiff  has  failed to  satisfactorily  convince the Court of  his  pretensions. <br><br>"To begin with,  if it were really true  that  plaintiff  had  been rendering overtime work since December 7, 1946 until May, 1952, he  would not  have continued  rendering  such overtime service without  receiving  the corresponding pay and  instead allowed  his claim to  accumulate to  thousands  without the expectation of  collecting the same. <br><br>"In the second place,  it is  to be  noted, that plaintiff during the trial first claimed that he never received any overtime pay yet, when confronted with his several overtime receipts he had to admit that he  collected and received overtime  pay more than  once. <br><br>"Finally,  the Court cannot help  but doubt plaintiff's  claim for overtime because in his complaint,  plaintiff  alleged  under oath that from December 7, 1946  to March  31,  1947, he  worked from  6:00 p.m. to  6:00 a.m., but during the trial  he declared that he used to work at 7:00 o'clock a.m., up  to 7:00 o'clock p.m. Needless to state, plaintiff's testimony, contradicted as it  is by his own verified  complaint cannot be the basis of an award for overtime pay in favor of plaintiff  and against  defendant  whose  evidence on the matter is clear and free from contradictions. Indeed, plaintiff's  contradiction covers only the period from December 7, 1946 up to March 31, 1957, but the doubt engendered in the  mind of  the  Court extends to plaintiff's whole claim."</blockquote>Upon review of the  record  we  do  not  feel  justified  in disturbing this finding  of the  lower court. <br><br>Wherefore,  the  decision   appealed from  is  hereby affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.   It is so ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B.
