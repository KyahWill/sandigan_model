				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the respondent judge of the Court of&nbsp; Agrarian&nbsp; Relations, Third Regional District.<br><br>In March 1956, Emilio&nbsp; Cano and twenty-five&nbsp; other persons,&nbsp; tenants of Salvador&nbsp; de Jesus on the&nbsp; sharing basis of 45-55, petitioned&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Agrarian&nbsp; Relations for change beginning that year, of their crop sharing arrangement, from 45-55&nbsp; to 30-70.&nbsp; They cultivated&nbsp; rice lands located in Concepcion, Tarlac.&nbsp; The landholder opposed the petition alleging they had a written contract fixing their shares up to and including the year 1959-1960.<br><br>After the hearing, and after considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; report of the Commissioner, the Judge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; District&nbsp; authorized the change desired by the tenants—and ordered the landholder to agree thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for reasons unnecessary&nbsp; to mention, he said&nbsp; the&nbsp; alteration shall&nbsp; commence only from the year&nbsp; 1958-1959.&nbsp;&nbsp; De Jesus&nbsp; did not appeal; but the tenants appealed,&nbsp; insisting that the&nbsp; new arrangement should start&nbsp; from the year&nbsp; 1956-1957 as they&nbsp; had requested.&nbsp; Their demand rests upon section 14 of Republic Act 1199, which for&nbsp; convenience&nbsp; is hereby quoted (as amended&nbsp; recently by Republic Act 2263).<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 14. Change of&nbsp; System.—The tenant&nbsp; shall have the right to change the tenancy&nbsp; contract from one of share&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; to lease-hold&nbsp; tenancy and&nbsp; vice versa&nbsp; and from one&nbsp; crop&nbsp; sharing arrangement to another of the share tenancy.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> If the share tenancy contract is in writing and is duly&nbsp; registered,</span> the right to change from one crop sharing arrangement to another or from one tenancy system to&nbsp; another may&nbsp; be exercised at least one month before the beginning of the next agricultural year <span style="font-style: italic;">after the expiration of the period of&nbsp; the contract.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of any registered written contract, the&nbsp; right may&nbsp; be exercised at least one&nbsp; month before the&nbsp; agricultural year when the change shall be effected."&nbsp; (Italics ours)<br></blockquote>There is no&nbsp; question that each and every one&nbsp; of the herein tenants had executed a&nbsp; written&nbsp; contract&nbsp; with the landholder in the language and form prescribed by sec. 12 of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; 1199; and that all the documents&nbsp; had been registered as provided therein.&nbsp; All the contracts fix a 45-55&nbsp; division, contain the same&nbsp; provisions on other tenancy matters and state (part. IV) "this agreement shall remain in force as long as the&nbsp; tenancy relationship exists, unless otherwise&nbsp; amended or altered through or&nbsp; by the agreement between the&nbsp; landholder and&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant."&nbsp; At the end of each contract, there are four additional agreements; the first reads&nbsp; "We the landholder and tenants, by virtue of this contract, mutually agreed that the foregoing palay tenancy contract will remain in force for agricultural year 1956-1957"; and the other three, in the same words refer respectively to 1957-1958,&nbsp; 1958-1959, and 1959-1960.<br><br>On the strength of the above stipulations,&nbsp; De Jesus the landholder objected to any change prior to&nbsp; the 1960- 1961&nbsp; agricultural year.&nbsp; He contended:&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as the parties had a sharing contract up to 1959-1960, the tenants' right to alter may be exercised only "at the expiration of the period of the contract" as&nbsp; declared by section 14, as amended.<br><br>Overruling this contention, the court held, more or less: First proposition.—The body&nbsp; of the contract contained no stipulation as to the date it will expire; therefore, the landlord may not invoke that part of section 14, referring to&nbsp; change "at the&nbsp; expiration of the contract."<br><br><i>Second proposition.</i>—Although par. IV says "this agreement shall remain in force as long as the tenancy relationship exists" such paragraph may not&nbsp; be&nbsp; enforced as to continuance of the sharing basis, because it deprives the tenants of the freedom to change, which section 14 explicitly confers upon them.<br><br><i>Third proposition</i>.—The additional stipulations for the years&nbsp; 1956-1957,&nbsp; 1957-1958, 1958-1959,&nbsp; and 1959-1960 merely confirm the tenants'&nbsp; allegation&nbsp; that the contract "as regards&nbsp; sharing&nbsp; arrangement lasts from year to year starting from 1956-1957."&nbsp; Such stipulations may not be regarded as fixing the sharing ratio for the five-year period from 1955 to 1960, for this&nbsp; specific reason; Salvador de Jesus being merely a lessee of the owners of the hacienda <span style="font-style: italic;">for the same period&nbsp; of five years,</span> his contract with these tenants <span style="font-style: italic;">can only be for five years.</span>&nbsp; Wherefore, the sharing arrangement would in effect govern <span style="font-style: italic;">during&nbsp; the entire term of&nbsp; their tenancy relationship,</span> and this court&nbsp; (Agrarian), for the reason explained in the second proposition, believes it to&nbsp; be contrary to sec.&nbsp; 14.<br><br>To repeat, the above&nbsp; three propositions&nbsp; substantially restate the main grounds of the appealed decision.<br><br>Now, it is probably true that, if the landholder&nbsp; and the tenant agree in&nbsp; a written contract that the&nbsp; sharing or leasehold&nbsp; agreement therein provided shall be observed "so long as the relationship exists" such stipulations&nbsp; will be contrary to the spirit of section 14.&nbsp; However, a stipulation that such arrangement shall be observed "during the period of the written contract" or during the period fixed in such contract, is entirely a different matter.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the tenancy relationship is not extinguished by the expiration of the written contract&nbsp; (Sec. 9, Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 1199 as&nbsp; amended).&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; right to change given&nbsp; to the tenant by sec. 14, may still be exercised during&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; tenancy relationship, after the period of, or fixed&nbsp; in, the written contract.<br><br>In this particular case, it is reasonably clear that the above-quoted provisions of the contract between the parties, specially the&nbsp; additional&nbsp; stipulations&nbsp; established&nbsp; a sharing&nbsp; basis&nbsp; for the five&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; years indicated. We perceive no reason to invalidate a written stipulation adopting a fixed sharing arrangement for&nbsp; five years.&nbsp; Section 14 impliedly permits it.&nbsp; To the argument that, as the written contract is to be enforced<span style="font-style: italic;"> for five&nbsp; years</span> only, such stipulation fixing an unchangeable arrangement for five years barters away the&nbsp; right to the tenant under sec. 14, the answer is: after the five years the tenancy relationship still exists, (sec. 9) as already explained, and then the tenant may make use&nbsp; of&nbsp; the privilege to demand a new arrangement.<br><br>This answer holds good even if Salvador de Jesus were only a lessee for five years expiring in 1960, as the lower court found.&nbsp; This is so, because nothing prevents his obtaining an extension of the lease; and&nbsp; the continuation of the tenancy relationship between him and these tenants beyond 1960 is possible, with a&nbsp; modified system if the latter so desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This&nbsp; leads to an equitable consideration:&nbsp; Very probably, not to say certainly, in making&nbsp; these contracts, Salvador&nbsp; de Jesus fixed the share basis in relation to the sums he himself&nbsp; has&nbsp; to pay the owner of the hacienda for five years.&nbsp; Would it&nbsp; then be fair to alter such&nbsp; basis during the five-year period without a corresponding alteration&nbsp; in the amounts he has to deliver in turn to the owner.<br><br>All the above considerations impel us to hold there was error in ordering the change to start in the year 1958- 1959; such change could take place only after 1959-1960.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the error may not presently be corrected, because De Jesus has not appealed.<br><br>On the other hand, the appellants have no cause to complain against the decision; after&nbsp; all,&nbsp; it favored&nbsp; their interests.<br><br>Judgment&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; appellants, except Antonio Punsalang, Bienvenido Santos, Segundo Victoria, Calixto Bondoc, Pedro Guiso, Juan Dungca, Ireneo Santos and&nbsp; Norberto Pineda who have heretofore&nbsp; withdrawn their respective appeals.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Endencia</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><i>Concepcion</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur in the&nbsp; result.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> If the lease is not&nbsp; extended, they might even&nbsp; claim tenancy relationship (perhaps) under sec. 9 with the hacienda owner, under a different way of dividing the crop.</div>
