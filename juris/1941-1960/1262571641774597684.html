				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Dionisio Leong was sued, in 1955, in the Court of  First  Instance  of Davao by  Mandian  (Manoba),  the widow and second consort of  his late  father Leon Lung (Civ.  Case  No. 1533  of  that  Court).  She  charged  him with having usurped a parcel of land and coconut plantation  in  Trinidad,  Davao,  registered in her name  under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 561 of Davao, and asked for an accounting  of fruits,  for damages and  attorney's fees.  <br><br>Answering the complaint, Dionisio denied any usurpation, and pleaded that he possessed and  administered  the disputed property as part  of the estate of his late  father Leon, by agreement with plaintiff.  <br><br>Subsequently, defendant's brother Celestino Leong, upon his petition,  was permitted by the court to intervene as defendant, and on June  6, 1955, filed an answer in intervention,  pleading  that  the lot in  question was acquired during his father's  second marriage to plaintiff Mandian, but that the title was placed in her exclusive name because the husband  was not a Filipino citizen.  The answer also  contained  a  cross-claim against the  original  defendant Dionisio Leong, averring  his  exclusive possession  of  the estate of the father and his  failure to  give his co-heirs any share in its fruits, and  prayed for their accounting  and distribution and for attorney's fees.  Copy  of  this answer was served on counsel  for cross-defendant Dionisio  Leong on June 6, 1955.  By order of June 27, 1955,  the  answer in intervention was admitted and plaintiff ordered  to answer the cross-complaint.                                    <br><br>On July 1, 1955,  a motion was filed <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> by counsel  for defendant-intervenor, alleging that no answer had been filed  by Dionisio Leong to Celestino's cross-claim up to  July  1,  i.e.,  notwithstanding  the  lapse  of 26  days;  and prayed that  Dionisio be declared in default. Conformably to this motion, the court, on July 2, 1955, declared Dionisio in default.                                                 <br><br>On July 11, Dionisio sought reconsideration of the order of default, on the ground  that his period to answer Celestino's crossclaim should be counted not  from the time he was  served  copy  of the answer in intervention but from the time the court admitted it, i.e., from June 27.  The court  below, however, denied reconsideration and Dionisio Leong  appealed to this Court.                                           <br><br>The appeal must be dismissed. <br><br>The order declaring appellant in default is interlocutory and preliminary to the hearing of the case on  the merits  (Sitchon <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Prov. Sheriff of Occidental Negros, 80 Phil., 397), and remains under the control of the court, and may be modified or rescinded by it on  sufficient ground at any time before final judgment (I Francisco, Rules of Court, Part II, p. 642).   Besides, the cross-plaintiff may, for aught we know, fail to establish his claims against appellant with requisite evidence, and the trial court may dismiss the cross-claim,  notwithstanding  the  default.   In  such  event, the appellant would have no cause for complaint, and his appeal would  be useless. Thus, the appeal at this stage is premature and improper. <br><br>This Court  has ruled that it is a prerequisite to defendant's  right to appeal that he file  a motion Rule 38 asking that the order   of default  entered  against him be  set aside  (Lim Toco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Go Fay, 80  Phil., 166; Rodrigo  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Cabrera, 95 Phil., 790; Tecson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Melendres, 88 Phil., 703, and  others).  Once  such  motion  is  filed, the  defendant, even if his motion is  denied, becomes entitled to notice of all further proceedings  including  final judgment  (Reyes Calingo  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Tan, G. R.  L-10336, May 31, 1957) and may duly appeal  therefrom.  Cross-defendant-appellant,  Dionisio Leong, has not  yet  filed any such motion, since his petition  for  reconsideration  of  July 11, 1955,  did  not aver any surprise,  fraud, mistake and excusable neglect. But  even assuming that his petition  to reconsider may be held to be one under Rule 38, still appellant should wait the judgment  on the  merits of the cross-claim, and if any such judgment is rendered against him, only then may he appeal, from the order of default  as well as from the final judgment based  upon such default order. <br><br>This appeal is, therefore, dismissed, and the  trial court ordered to proceed with the hearing of the case, including the cross-claim  against  appellant Dionisio Leong.  Costs against appellant.  So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, Bengzon,  Montemayor,  Reyes, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion, Endencia </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span>  concur. <br><br></div>
