				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; a judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Bulacan,&nbsp; dismissing plaintiff's&nbsp; action for&nbsp; the recovery of&nbsp; a&nbsp; fishpond through&nbsp; annulment of certain contracts&nbsp; of lease&nbsp; and sublease.&nbsp; The appeal has been certified to this court on the ground that it involves only questions of law.<br><br>The&nbsp; material facts&nbsp; are&nbsp; not in dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fishpond in question formerly belonged to&nbsp; three co-owners who had taken&nbsp; turns in leasing it&nbsp; to 'the same&nbsp; person, Bernardo Enriquez.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last lease&nbsp; was&nbsp; signed in 1931&nbsp; and&nbsp; was to last "until June 1, 1967."&nbsp; After the death of Bernardo Enriquez,&nbsp; his&nbsp; widow, Esperanza Guillen,&nbsp; subleased&nbsp; the fishpond, first, to Dr. Macario Cuerpo Cruz and thereafter to the present defendant Simeon Salazar,&nbsp; the sublease to the&nbsp; latter to commence from May 81, 1947 and&nbsp; last until May 31, 1967.&nbsp; In 1952, with the co-owners of the fishpond already dead, their&nbsp; sole heir, plaintiff Eduardo Manlapat, brought the present action in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan againat the aubleasee Simeon Salazar to recover possession of the fishpond,&nbsp; alleging that the sublease to the defendant, as well as the leases executed&nbsp; by plaintiff's predecessors in interest, was null and void.&nbsp; But the court decided that those&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; were&nbsp; valid and&nbsp; dismissed plaintiff's&nbsp; action&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the present appeal, which, however, involves only the sublease to&nbsp; the appellee, the. appellant contending&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; erred in declaring the same valid and&nbsp; binding.<br><br>The appellant impugns the validity of the sublease to the appellee on the theory that it is not really a <i>sublease,</i>—- which, under both the old and the new Civil&nbsp; Code, would be valid even though entered&nbsp; into without the&nbsp; consent of the lessors since&nbsp; there&nbsp; was no prohibition against&nbsp; it in the contract of&nbsp; lease—but a veritable assignment of&nbsp; lease, which, in&nbsp; appellant's opinion,&nbsp; is&nbsp; void for&nbsp; want of such consent.<br><br>The essential difference between an assignment of lease and a mere sublease is given by Manresa thus:<br><blockquote>"* * *En la cesioin al arrendatario transmits en absolute) su derecho, au&nbsp; personalidad desaparece,&nbsp; quedan Bolamente en la relacion juridica dos personas, el arrendador&nbsp; y el eesionario, que se eonvierte en&nbsp; arrendatario.&nbsp; En el subarriendo&nbsp; no&nbsp; deaaparece personalidad alguna; hay dos&nbsp; arriendos y dos&nbsp; relaciones juridicas diferentea, aunque intimamente ligadas y&nbsp; relacionadas&nbsp; la una&nbsp; con 1ft&nbsp; otra." (10 Manresa 1950 ed., p. 510.)<br></blockquote>To the same effect is the following from Valverde:<br><blockquote>"El stibarriendo supone&nbsp; un mlevo arrendamiento, eonvirtiendo al arrendatario en arrendador, pero sin que el subarrendador se desligue por corapleto del arrendamiento primitivo; mientras que&nbsp; en la eesion del arrendamiento, el eesionario se eoloca&nbsp; en&nbsp; lugar del eedente, continuando el arrendamiento&nbsp; en las&nbsp; mismas condicionea y quedando el (arrendatario, en&nbsp; virtud do la&nbsp; cesiyri de&nbsp; su derecho, completamente desligado de responsabilidad con el arrendador.&nbsp; Estos dos contratos se parecenrel primero al arrendamiento, y el segundo a la venta.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Valverde, Tratado de&nbsp; Dereeho Civil Español, Tomo 3, pag. 474.)<br></blockquote>To determine&nbsp; then whether a given contract constitutes an assignment of lease and not a mere sublease, the test is whether the lessee has by said&nbsp; contract made&nbsp; an&nbsp; absolute transfer of his interest as such lessee, thus dissociating himself from the original contract of lease, so&nbsp; that, as Manresa would say, his personality disappears and there remain only in the juridical relation two persons, the lessor and the assignee, who is converted into a lessee.<br><br>The same teat&nbsp; is applied at common law,&nbsp; where the transfer of a leasehold by the lessee is deemed&nbsp; an assignment of lease only if he cedes&nbsp; his entire interest in the estate; whereas, if he retains a reversionary interest, however small,&nbsp; the transfer is deemed a mere sublease.&nbsp; (32 Am. Jur.'290;51 C. J. S. 553.)&nbsp; So, if&nbsp; the lessee underlets for a period less than the&nbsp; entire term or&nbsp; reserves for himself a reversionary interest in the term, the transaction is a subletting. (51 C. J. S. 555.)<br><br>With the&nbsp; above distinction in&nbsp; mind, it seems obvious from an examination of the terms of the document executed by&nbsp; Esperanza Guillen in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellee—identified in evidence as Exhibit "5"—that the said document is one of sublease.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; first place, the original lease, is, as already stated, to last "until June 1, 1967."&nbsp; On the other hand, the&nbsp; sublease is to last only until May&nbsp; 31 of&nbsp; that year.&nbsp; The sublease is thus for a shorter period&nbsp; than the original lease.&nbsp; A reservation of even&nbsp; so short a period as the last day of the term is&nbsp; enough to make the transfer a sublease.&nbsp;&nbsp; (35&nbsp; C. J. 990; Davis <i> vs.</i> Morris,&nbsp; 36 NY 569.) Indeed, it is held that "the mere fact&nbsp; that the lessor is to /receive a surrender of the premises on the last day of the term prevents the transfer from being an&nbsp; assignment." (Murdock&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Fishel et al., 121&nbsp; NYS 624; 35 C.&nbsp; J. 989.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that the sublessor states in Exhibit "5" that&nbsp; her possession under the original&nbsp; lease would last up to&nbsp; May 31,&nbsp; 1967 ("tatagal&nbsp; pa&nbsp; hanggang sa Mayo&nbsp; 31, 1967"), and from this appellant argues that in fixing the term of the sublease so that it would expire on May 31, 1967, the sublessor must have intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; transfer her entire interest in the&nbsp; lease.&nbsp; The argument, however,&nbsp; is based upon mere conjecture.&nbsp; Actually, the sublessor has not&nbsp; transferred her interest for the entire period of the original lease, and&nbsp; this may well be&nbsp; due to a desire to repossess the fishpond earlier so&nbsp; that she could&nbsp; prepare it for delivery to the owner.<br><br>The terms of&nbsp; the sublease Exhibit "5", also&nbsp; furnish further proof that the lessee, now sublessor, has&nbsp; not dissociated herself from the original lease and that, as Manresa&nbsp; would&nbsp; say, her&nbsp; personality&nbsp; has&nbsp; not disappeared. Condition No. 2,&nbsp; which binds her to respect the sublease and&nbsp; to pay damages should she again sublease the fishpond to another person, is inconsistent with the id&amp;s that she had&nbsp; entirely given up her interest in the. estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally inconsistent with this idea are&nbsp; condition No. 3, in which the sublessor binds herself to pay the land taxes on the fishpond and&nbsp; such other taxes as may be&nbsp; exacted by the Government;&nbsp; condition No.&nbsp; 4, which&nbsp; forbids the&nbsp; cutting of any tree in the fishpond without the sublessor's&nbsp; written consent; and&nbsp; lastly, condition No. 5,&nbsp; which requires the sublessee to return the fishpond&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; expiration of the sublease in as good a condition as when he&nbsp; took possession of it.&nbsp; With regard to the condition last&nbsp; named, appellant observes that it does not specify that it is to the sublessor that the fishpond is to be returned by&nbsp; the sublessee.&nbsp; But how could the sublessor determine the&nbsp; condition of the fishpond if&nbsp; the same were&nbsp; not to be returned to&nbsp; her? Moreover, as&nbsp; the contract is between&nbsp; sublessor and&nbsp; sublessee, the return of the property object of the contract would naturally,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of a different stipulation, have to be made to&nbsp; the sublessor.<br><br>Notice may also be taken&nbsp; of the fact that the sublessor has,&nbsp; in her contract with the sublessee, used the Tagalog word pabubuwisan (will lease).&nbsp; She says:&nbsp; "*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * <i>aking isasalin, ililipat&nbsp; at&nbsp; pabubiiwisan ang&nbsp; aking position&nbsp; at pamumuwisan sa nabtanguit na palaisdaan</i>&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *."&nbsp;&nbsp; This clause clearly means that the lessee is transferring&nbsp; possession of the&nbsp; fishpond under lease to&nbsp; her and renting it (i.e. subleasing it)&nbsp; to the transferee.<br><br>It being clear that&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; Exhibit "5" is a sublease, the trial court did not err in considering it as such and in&nbsp; declaring it valid, there being nothing against&nbsp; it. in the original&nbsp; contract of lease. <br><br>Having arrived at this conclusion, we deem&nbsp; it unnecessary to go into the question of whether the contract embodied in Exhibit "5" would be void or not if considered as an assignment of lease.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.,</i> and <i>Endeneia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
