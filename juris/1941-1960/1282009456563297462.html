				<H3>CONRADO MELO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Conrado Melo was charged in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, 
on December 27, 1949, with frustrated homicide, for having allegedly inflicted 
upon Benjamin Obillo, with a kitchen knife and with intent to kill, several 
serious wounds on different parts of the body, requiring medical attendance for 
a period of more than 30 days, and incapacitating him from performing his 
habitual labor for the same period of time. On December 29, 1949, at eight 
o'clock in the morning, the accused pleaded not guilty to the offense charged, 
and at 10:15 in the evening of the same day Benjamin Obillo died from his 
wounds. Evidence of death was available to the prosecution only on January 3, 
1950, and on the following day, January 4, 1950, an amended information was 
filed charging the accused with consummated homicide. The accused filed a motion 
to quash the amended information alleging double jeopardy, motion that was 
denied by the respondent court; hence, the instant petition for prohibition to 
enjoin the respondent court from further entertaining the amended 
information.
<p>Brushing aside technicalities of procedure and going into the substance of 
the issues raised, it may readily be stated that the amended information was 
rightly allowed to stand. Rule 106, sec.13, 2d paragraph, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If it appears at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in 
charging the proper offense, the court may dismiss the original complaint or 
information and order the filing of a new one charging the proper offense, 
provided the defendant would not be placed thereby in double jeopardy, and may 
also require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the 
trial."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this provision, it was proper for the Court to dismiss the first 
information and order the filing of a new one for the reason that the proper 
offense was not charged in the former and the latter did not place the accused 
in a second jeopardy for the same or identical offense.</p>
<p>"No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same 
offense," according to Art. III, section 1 (20) of our Constitution. The rule of 
"double jeopardy" had a settled meaning in this jurisdiction at the time our 
Constitution was promulgated. It meant that when a person is charged with an 
offense and the case is terminated either by acquittal or conviction or in any 
other manner without the consent of the accused, the latter cannot again be 
charged with the same or identical offense. This principle is founded upon the 
law of reason, justice and conscience. It is embodied in the maxim of the civil 
law <em>non bis in idem</em>, in the common law of England, and undoubtedly in 
every system of jurisprudence, and instead of having specific origin It simply 
always existed. It found expression in the Spanish law and in the Constitution 
of the United States and is now embodied in our own Constitution as one of the 
fundamental rights of the citizens.</p>
<p>It must be noticed that the protection of the Constitutional inhibition is 
against a second jeopardy for the <em>same offense</em>, the only exception 
being, as stated in the same Constitution, that "if an act is punished by a law 
and an ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to 
another prosecution for the <em>same act</em>." The phrase <em>same 
offense</em>, under the general rule, has always been construed to mean not only 
that the second offense charged is exactly the same as the one alleged in the 
first information, but also that the two offenses are identical. There is 
identity between the two offenses when the evidence to support a conviction for 
one offense would be sufficient to warrant a conviction for the other. This 
so-called "same-evidence test" which was found to be vague and deficient, was 
restated by the Rules of Court in a clearer and more accurate form. Under said 
Rules there is identity between two offenses not only when the second offense is 
exactly the same as the first, but also when the second offense is an attempt to 
commit the first or a frustration thereof, or when it necessarily includes or is 
necessarily Included in the offense charged in the first information. (Rule 113, 
sec. 9; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Lim Suco, 11 Phil. 484; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Ledesma, 29 
Phil. 431; People <em>vs</em>. Martinez, 55 Phil. 6). In this connection, an 
offense may be said to necessarily include another when some of the essential 
ingredients of the former as alleged in the information constitute the latter. 
And vice-versa, an offense may be said to be necessarily included in another 
when all the ingredients of the former constitute a part of the elements 
constituting the latter. (Rule 116, sec. 5). In other words, one who has been 
charged with an offense cannot be again charged with the same or identical 
offense though the latter be lesser or greater than the former. "As the 
Government cannot begin with the highest, and then go down step by step, 
bringing the man into jeopardy for every dereliction included therein, neither 
can it begin with the lowest and ascend to the highest with precisely the same 
result." (People <em>vs</em>. Cox, 107 Mich. 435, quoted with approval in U.S. 
<em>vs</em>. Lim Suco, 11 Phil. 484; <em>see</em> also U.S. <em>vs</em>. 
Ledesma, 29 Phil. 431 and People <em>vs</em>. Martinez, 55 Phil. 6, 10).</p>
<p>This rule of identity does not apply, however, when the second offense was 
not in existence at the time of the first prosecution, for the simple reason 
that in such case there is no possibility for the accused, during the first 
prosecution, to be convicted for an offense that was then inexistent. Thus, 
where the accused was charged with physical injuries and after conviction the 
injured person dies, the charge for homicide against the same accused does not 
put him twice in jeopardy. This is the ruling laid down by the Supreme Court of 
the United States In the Philippine case of Diaz <em>vs</em>. U.S., 223 U.S. 
442, followed by this Court in People <em>vs</em>. Espino, G.R. No. L-4-6123, 69 
Phil., 471, and these two cases are similar to the instant case. Stating it in 
another form, the rule is that "where after the first prosecution a new fact 
supervenes for which the defendant is responsible, which changes the character 
of the offense and, together with the facts existing at the time, constitutes a 
new and distinct offense" (15 Am. Jur. 66), the accused cannot be said to be in 
second jeopardy if indicted for the new offense.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of "double jeopardy" as intended by our Constitution for 
it was the one prevailing in the jurisdiction at the time the Constitution was 
promulgated, and no other meaning could have been intended by our Rules of 
Court.</p>
<p>Accordingly, an offense may be said to necessarily include or to be 
necessarily included in another offense, for the purpose of determining the 
existence of double jeopardy, when both offenses were in existence during the 
pendency of the first prosecution, for otherwise, if the second offense was then 
inexistent, no Jeopardy could attach therefor during the first prosecution, and 
consequently a subsequent charge for the same cannot constitute second jeopardy. 
By the very nature of things there can be no double jeopardy under such 
circumstance, and our Rules of Court cannot be construed to recognize the 
existence of a condition where such condition in reality does not exist. General 
terms of a statute or regulation should be so limited in their application as 
not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence. It will always, 
therefore, be presumed that exceptions have been intended to their language 
which would avoid results of this character. (<em>In re</em> Allen 2 Phil. 
641).</p>
<p>When the Rules of Court were drafted, there was absolutely no intention of 
abandoning the ruling laid down in the Diaz ease, and the proof of this is that 
although the said Rules were approved on December 1939, yet on January 30, 1940, 
this Court decided the Espino case reiterating therein the Diaz doctrine. Had 
that doctrine been abandoned deliberately by the Rules of Court as being unwise, 
unjust or obnoxious, logically it would have likewise been repudiated in the 
Espino case by reason of consistency and as a matter of justice to the accused, 
who should In consequence have been acquitted instead of being sentenced to a 
heavy penalty upon the basis of a doctrine that had already been found to be 
throng. There was absolutely no reason to preclude this Court from repealing the 
doctrine in the Espino case, for as a mere doctrine it could be repealed at any 
time in the decision of any case where it is invoked. The fact that it was not 
so abandoned but reiterated, is a clear proof that the mind of the Court, even 
after the approval of the Rules, was not against but in favor of said 
doctrine.</p>
<p>For these reasons we expressly repeal the ruling laid down In People 
<em>vs</em>. Tarok, 73 Phil., 260, as followed in People <em>vs</em>. Villasis, 
46 Off. Gaz. (Supp. to No. 1), p. 268. Such ruling is not only contrary to the 
real meaning of "double jeopardy" as intended by the Constitution and by the 
Rules of Court but is also obnoxious to the administration of justice. If, in 
obedience to the mandate of the law, the prosecuting officer files an 
information within six hours after the accused is arrested, and the accused 
claiming his constitutional right to a speedy trial is immediately arraigned, 
and later on a new fact supervenes which, together with the facts existing at 
the time, constitutes a more serious offense, under the Tarok ruling, no way is 
open by which the accused may be penalized in proportion to the enormity of his 
guilt. Furthermore, such a ruling may open the way to suspicions or charges of 
collusion between the prosecuting officers and the accused, to the grave 
detriment of public interest and confidence in the administration of justice, 
which cannot happen under the Diaz ruling.</p>
<p>Before closing, it is well to observe that when a person who has already 
suffered his penalty for an offense, is charged with a new and greater offense 
under the Diaz doctrine herein reiterated, said penalty may be credited to him 
in case of conviction for the second offense.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the petition is denied, and the respondent Court may 
proceed to the trial of the criminal case under the amended information. Without 
costs.</p><i>Ozaeta, Pablo, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, </i>and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.

<p><br><br>BENGZON, <i>J.</i>, concurring and dissenting:</p>
<p>I agree that People vs. Tarok and People <em>vs</em>. Villasis should be 
overruled. But I submit that the effect of such overruling should be 
prospective, in the sense that it should not affect the herein petitioner who 
has relied thereon in presenting his case. (Moncado <em>vs</em>. Tribunal del 
Pueblo, 45 Off. Gaz., p. 2850.) </p></div>
