				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Cagayan 
dismissing the complaint  but ordering plaintiff Santiago Sambrano to 
pay the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, by way of accrued rentals of
 the Aparri Electric Plant, the sum of P5,827.88, with legal interest 
thereon from the date the decision becomes final. Both plaintiffs and 
defendant  Jose M. Torres have appealed directly to this Court 
apparently because the amount involved is more than P50,000.00. 
Considering that the sum claimed to P155,000.00, whereas defendant 
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, by way of counterclaim, claims only 
the aggregate sum of P70,000.00, as damages and attorney’s fees only 
amounts, while defendant Torres, in his answer, claims the aggregate 
amount of P36,000.00 as damages and attorney’s fees, which respective 
claims can only be considered in the alternative form for purposed of 
determining the jurisdiction of the court, and considering further that 
in some of the errors assigned some questions of fact are involved, it 
is evident that this case comes within the jurisdiction of the Court of 
Appeals in line with the provisions of Section 2 of Republic Act 2613.
  <p> The case is ordered certified to the Court of Appeals for 
adjudication in accordance with law. </p>
