				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On February 18, 1949,  Guardalino C. Mosqueda sold to Jose Marquez Lim his parcel of land in the City of Iloilo, containing 9,460 square meters, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2794 issued by the Register of Deeds of the province of Iloilo, for the sum of P65,605.   Claiming that Mosqueda had previously  contracted her services to sell the same  land with a  commission of 5  per cent  on the sales  price, and that thru her efforts she could bring together Mosqueda and Lim who finally agreed upon and consummated the sale  of the land, and because Mosqueda refused to pay her commission of 5 per cent she commenced this action in the  Court of First  Instance  of  Iloilo  to recover from  Mosqueda the  sura of P3,280.25  representing 5 per cent of the sales price with interest from the date of the filing  of the complaint. After hearing,  the  trial court rendered judgment in her favor ordering defendant Mosqueda to pay  to her P3,280-25 with interest  of 6  per cent from March  7, 1949,  with costs.  On appeal to  the Court  of  Appeals,  said Tribunal reversed the  appealed decision and dismissed the complaint without costs.  Plaintiff Reyes is now petitioning for the revision of said decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The Court  of Appeals  thru Justice Dionisio  de Leon states the position  taken  and  the evidence presented by both parties in support of their respective claims as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Plaintiff Vicente Reyes alleges  that  on February 16,  1949,  she was contracted by  defendant  Guardalino Mosqueda to  sell the land of the latter, with an area of 9,460 square  meters, situated in Iloilo City, and covered by transfer certificate of title No. 2794, for the sum of P7.50  per square meter,  at a commission  of 5  per  cent on the total purchase price (Exhibits  A and D).  She offered the sale of the land to Jose Marquez Lim who, after an ocular inspection of the  premises,  said that the price  of P7.50 per square meter was high as the land was covered with water, Dut he was willing to buy the land for a lower price.  Reyes  went baek to Mosqueda and informed him about what her buyer had told her about  the land. Mosqueda reduced the price to P7.30 per square  meter.  On this occasion, Reyes  told  Mosqueda that  inasmuch  as  the purchase price has already been settled, she was  now  free to disclose, as she did that her buyer was Jose Marquez Lim who would see Mosqueda personally about  the consummation  of the sale.</p>
  <p>"Appellant  Mosqueda  said that on February 16, 1949, he went to see Jose Marquez Lim, Manager of the Philippine-American Insurance Co. in Iloilo City, about a loan offering his land  covered by transfer certificate  of  title 2794 as  security,  as he  was in   urgent need of  money to pay his debt with a bank which was due  on February 18,  1949.   Lim  informed Mosqueda that only  the  Manila  office of  the Company could  grant  loans.  Lim, however, offered  to buy Mosqueda's land as it adjoined his  own land.  Mosqueda replied that he was willing to sell his land to him at P8 per square meter.  Lim asked for  time  to think it over  as  Mosqueda's  price  was  high. Anxious to buy the land, Lim requested Vicente Reyes,  who, together with  her   husband,  were  employees  in  his  office,   to  approach Mosqueda  on  his behalf and exact from him  the last price he could offer for his  land.  Reyes went to see  Dr. Mosqueda  and told him that she had1  a buyer for his land without divulging the identity of her said buyer, resulting in  the  execution of  Exhibits  A  and D. Also on that  same day, Vicenta Reyes informed Lim that the price on Mosqueda  was now P7.50 per square meter.   Lim still considered this as high, so that he again sent  Vicenta  Reyes  to  ask for a lower price from Mosqueda.  Mosqueda  reduced it to  P7.30.  Reyes told  Lim  about Mosqueda's  last  quotation.  Apparently,  Lim  was still not agreeable to the price of P7.30 per square meter,  so that he told Vicenta Reyes to desist from further contracting Mosqueda on his behalf  as he, himself, would deal directly with Mosqueda as he had initially  done  earlier  on the  same day.  Lim offered  to pay P500 to Reyes' for her efforts, but the latter demanded P1,000, after which she left Lim's  office evidently  in an  angry  mood.  Reyes went back to  Mosqueda and told him that her buyer was  not willing to buy his land at P7.30 per square meter, and that she would not sell  any more  the land because of the disagreement between  her and her buyer, whom she disclosed for the first time to be Jose Marquez Lim.  Mosqueda wanted to withdraw the  authority which he had  given Vicenta Reyes, but the latter pleaded that she  be given until the afternoon of the  following days, February 17, within which to find  another buyer.  The following  day,  due to the failure  of Reyes to find another buyer for his land,  Mosqueda informed Reyes that he was' definitely cancelling her authority to find a buyer for his land.  The  following  day,  February  18, Lim went personally to the clinic of Dr.  Mosqueda, resulting  in the execution  of  the deed of sale (Exhibit 1  or  F)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then said Court makes the following findings or observations :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We have  gone carefully  over the  evidence  of record, and we have arrived at the  conclusion that the same  fairly  preponderates in favor of the appellant. Jose  Marquez  Lim  and Alejandro  Santiago companion   of the  appellant  when  the  latter went  to  see Lim about a loan, corroborated the claim of the appellant that Lim had  offered to buy the appellant's land.  Vicenta Reyes  did not testify  how she came to learn that Mosqueda was looking  for a buyer of his land.  Perhaps, when  she was requested by him  to intercede in his behalf with respect to the sale of  Mosqueda's land, Vicenta Reyes grabbed this opportunity to make spare  money as a sideline. It must also be noted  that  while  Reyes  said  Lim was willing to buy  the  land  for a price less  than P7.50 per  square meter,  she did  not testify that  Lim was willing to buy the property  for P7.30, or  that  Lim  authorized  her to close the deal with Mosqueda at  any price lower than  P7.50 per  square meter.</p>
  <p>"There  is no dispute that the appellee was  contracted  by  the appellant  to  find  a  buyer  for  his  land, with a  commission  of 5  per  cent.  Mosqueda reduced his original price of P8  to P7.30 per square meter  through the intervention of Vicenta Reyes.  The question, however, is whether  it  was also through the efforts  of the appellee that the  sale (Exhibit 1 or F)  was finally effected at the price  of P65,605, or  less than P7  per square meter,  on  February 18, 1949.</p>
  <p>"Vicente Reyes was hired  as  a  broker,  not as  commercial agent.   *  * * At  the ,time the contract of sale  (Exhibit  1  or F) was  signed by  the parties on February 18, 1949, the authority of Reyes  as  a broker for Mosqueda has  already been withdrawn by the latter.  *  * *  At the time  the  authority of the appellee was withdrawn, there  was still no meeting  of  the  minds between Mosqueda and Lim with respect to the price and terms of  the  sale; Again, the land was  sold at price and terms arrived alt by the contracting parties  without  the  appellee's  intervention and  Lim bought the property independently of  the  efforts  of  Reyes.  Vicenta  Reyes was told by Lim to leave him alone in the transaction. We have every reason to believe Lim's testimony as this action for recovery  of a sum  of money is not directed against him, and ha has nothing to lose or gain by telling the truth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accepting, as we have to,  the findings of the Court of Appeals, we find its judgment of reversal to be supported by  the  facts and the law.   If  as  found  by the Court of Appeals plaintiff Reyes was engaged only  as a broker, then in order to earn her  commission, it was  not sufficient for her to  find a prospective buyer but to find one who  will actually buy the property on  the terms and conditions imposed by  the owner.  In the case  of Danon <em>vs. </em>Brimo &amp; Co., 42 Phil., 133, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The broker must be the efficient agent or the procuring cause of the  sale.  The means employed by him  and his efforts must result in the sale. He must find the purchaser, and the sale must proceed from  his efforts acting  as  a  broker.  (Cases cited.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, according to the findings of the Court of Appeals, the actual sale was  perfected  and consummated  without the intervention  of  plaintiff  Reyes,  and what is more, before  that, her  authority  to sell  the property had been withdrawn, at a time when  there was still no meeting of the minds of buyer and  seller.</p>
<p>We realize that there are  times when  the  owner of  a property for sale may  not legally  cancel or revoke  the authority given by  him to a  broker when the negotiations through the broker's efforts have reached such a stage that  it would be unfair to  deny the  commission  earned, especially when the property owner acts  in  bad faith  and cancels the authority only  to evade the  payment of said commission.   Such  was  our holding in the same  case of Danon <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Brimo &amp; Co., <em>supra:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * the right  of the principal to terminate  his authority  is absolute and unrestricted,  except only that he  may not  do  it in bad faith, and as a mere device to  escape  the payment of the broker's commissions.  Thus, if in the midst of negotiations  instituted by the broker, and which were plainly and evidently approaching success, the seller should  revoke the authority of the broker, with the view of concluding the bargain without his aid, and avoiding the payment  of commission about to be earned, it might be well said that the due performance of his obligation by the broker was purposely prevented by the principal.  But if the latter acts in good faith, not seeking to  escape the payment of commissions, but moved fairly by a  view of his own interest, he has the absolute right  before  a bargain is made while negotiations  remain unsuccessful, before  commissions are earned,  to  revoke the  broker's authority,  and the latter cannot thereafter claim compensation for a sale  made by the principal even though it  be to a customer with whom  the broker  unsuccessfully  negotiated, and even  though, to some extent, the seller might  justly be  said to have availed himself of the fruits  of  the broker's labor."  (Danon <em>vs.</em> Brimo, 42 Phil., 133, 141-142, citing Sibbald  <em>vs</em>.  Bethlehem Iron Co.,  83 N.Y. 378, 38 Am. Rep.  441, 444-446.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present case, there is nothing to show that bad faith  was involved  in  the  cancellation  of the  authority of  plaintiff  Reyes before  the consummation  of the  sale. Not only this,  but the actuations  of  plaintiff  Reyes are not entirely above  suspicion.  As observed by the Court of  Appeals  she  did not explain  how  she came to know that  defendant  Mosqueda  was  interested  in selling his land  and was looking for  a buyer thereof.   It is highly possible  that after  Reyes was commissioned by her employer Lim to  approached Mosqueda with a view to reducing the price of P8  per square meter, it was then and only  then that  Reyes  came to know  about the desire of Mosqueda to sell his land to cover his obligations with the bank  inasmuch  as  he  failed  to  secure  a loan  from the Insurance Company, and as said by the Court of Appeals—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * *,  Perhaps, when she was requested by Lim to intercede in his behalf with respect to the sale of Mosqueda's land, Vicenta Reyes grabbed this opportunity to make spare money as a  sideline."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the  decision of the Court of Appeals  appealed from is hereby  affirmed, with costs in both instances.</p>
