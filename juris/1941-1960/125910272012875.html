				<H3>MARLI  PLYWOOD & VENEER  CORPORATION, PETITIONER,  VS. JOSE ARANAS, AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, AND THE COURT OP TAX APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Marli Plywood  and  Veneer  corporation,  holder  of a certificate of exemption as  a new and  necessary industry (plywood manufacturing business),  seeks the review of the  decision of the Court of  Tax Appeals denying  its petition for refund of  the  sum of P4,774.58  paid by it to the respondent  Collector of Internal Revenue as  compensating tax in connection with its importation of a "Yanmar" marine diesel engine and air compressor.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement between the parties as to the fact  that petitioner's  plywood-manufacturing  business, having been  declared a new and necessary industry, was exempted from payment of certain internal revenue taxes. The tax-exemption certificate  issued by the Secretary of Finance in favor of  petitioner, among others, provides: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The exemption herein  intended  refers to  the following taxes <em>directly payable by you  in respect to the above-mentioned industry:</em></p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"3. The compensating  tax on machinery  and equipment <em>to be used exclusively in  the new and necessary industry.</em></p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>(Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, there is no question that the machinery involved herein  were actually  installed in  the  boat  "Marli II," belonging to petitioner, used  exclusively to transport its manufactured products from its factory m Bayawan, Negros Oriental, which  is  not a port of call, to Cebu or  Manila, and to bring, in its  return trips, fuels  and stocks  for use in the factory.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends  that upon  these undisputed  facts the  imported machineries  come within the exemption  because marketing of the finished products is essential to the exemption of plywood-manufacturing.</p>
<p>We agree with  the  Court of Tax Appeals that this is not  so.  The exemption   (which should be  interpreted strictly as all exceptions) clearly refers  only to "machinery and equipment to be  used exclusively in the new and necessary industry," <em>not  merely in  connection  therewith.</em> The industry exempted  is  the manufacture  of plywood.  As far  as this business  is concerned, it is  fully accomplished with the turning out or production of the finished articles. With or  without petitioner's owning  any transportation facility,  the tax-exempt industry  could  be operated.  As a  matter  of fact,  the transportation activity was commenced  only in 1956  although petitioner  was already in the  business since  1953.  In other  words, the  operation of the transportation,  while it may bring convenience and economy to  petitioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is not indispensable to, or form a part of  the business of, manufacturing plywood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> This is certainly not the  use or purpose for which the exemption was granted.  For the privilege to be availed of,  it must be shown that the imported machinery or equipment is directly  necessary,  not merely incidental, to the operation of the industry itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we affirm the decision appealed from, with costs against the petitioner.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,  J.  B. L., Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
<br>

<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Apparently, there are  some means of transportation available to petitioner, only it complains that the expenses add much to the cost of production.
