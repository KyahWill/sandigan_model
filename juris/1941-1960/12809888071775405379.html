				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila finding Hanson C. Chang guilty of the crime of estafa and 
sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from 4 months of <i>arresto
 mayor</i> to 1 year and 8 months of <i>prison correccional,</i> with 
the accessory penalties provided for by law, to indemnify the offended 
party in the sum of P480.83, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs.
  <p>    This appeal was originally taken to the Court of Appeals, but 
was later certified to this Court on the ground that it involves merely a
 question of law.</p>
  <p>    Appellant was an agent of the American Factors (Phil.) Inc. in 
the years 1946 and 1947, and as such, he collected from different 
customers the value of certain merchandise amounting to P5,736.83.  As 
appellant failed to turn over this amount to the company, he was 
prosecuted for estafa in the Court of First Instance of Manila under 
Criminal Case No. 3777.  During the pendency of the case, an amicable 
settlement was reached between appellant and the offended party whereby 
appellant was allowed to pay the amount of P5,736.83 in installments at 
the rate of P200 a month.  In view of this amicable settlement, the case
 was provisionally dismissed.</p>
  <p>    Of the amount of P5,736.83, appellant was only able to pay the 
amount of P3,456.  After the provisional dismissal of the case, the Alto
 Surety and Insurance Company paid the amount of P1,800 leaving a 
balance of P480.83.  When appellant failed to pay this balance, he was 
prosecuted for estafa under Criminal Case No. 7344, origin of the 
present appeal.</p>
  <p>    Appellant waived his right to present any evidence and 
preferred to submit the case on the facts as submitted by the 
prosecution.</p>
  <p>    The only question posed by appellant in this appeal is 
contained in the following statement that appears in his brief: "We 
agree with the trial court that payments effected by the accused affects
 only his civil but not the criminal aspect of the case.  This is true 
with reference to Criminal Case No. 3777.  In other words, even if the 
defendant-appellant has already made arrangements for the payment of the
 amount embezzled in Criminal Case No. 3777.  But, the People instead of
 prosecuting to the full extent Criminal Case No. 3777 petitioned the 
Court for its dismissal.  In so far, therefore, as Criminal Case No. 
3777 is concerned, the criminal liability of the defendant had been 
extinguished not because of his payment but because the People sought 
the dismissal of the case against him." In other words, appellant seems 
to contend that the dismissal of the first information is tantamount to 
his acquittal, and that his prosecution under the second information 
places him twice in jeopardy.</p>
  <p>    This contention is untenable if considered in the light of the 
facts of the present case.  It appears that the first information was 
provisionally dismissed because appellant had asked the offended party 
to drop the case against him on condition that he would pay the whole 
amount he misappropriated and provided further that his obligation be 
guaranteed by a bonding company.  The amicable settlement was predicated
 upon the understanding that, once arrived at, the case would be 
dropped.  It is apparent therefore that the first information was 
dismissed not only with his express consent but upon his own initiative.
  And as such dismissal was ordered with his express consent, it follows
 that the same does not operate as a bar to another prosecution (Section
 9, Rule 113.)</p>
  <p>    Finding no error in the decision appealed from, the same is 
hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Jugo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
