				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; first information&nbsp; filed by the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal of Cavite in the Court of First Instance of the province after&nbsp; conducting&nbsp; a&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; charged Dominador M. Camerino, Nicasio Camerino <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Nicasio Camerino, Alejandro Lacson <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Bernardo&nbsp; alias Andong, John Doe,&nbsp; Richard Doe and Henry Doe&nbsp; with murder. After another preliminary investigation conducted by&nbsp; the same&nbsp; prosecuting&nbsp; officer, as&nbsp; provided for in&nbsp; Republic Act No. 732, an amended information&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed charging Dominador&nbsp; M. Camerino, Nicasio Caminero alias Nicasio Camerino, Alejandro Lacson alias Bernardo&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Andong, Marcelino Esguerra, Cecilio Esguerra, Manuel Pakingan, Antonio&nbsp; Martinez,&nbsp; Arsenio Corcillo&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Artemio, Elias Culitis, Raymundo Advincula, Lucia Yambao and Crisanto Saratan&nbsp; with murder&nbsp; for the&nbsp; death of Jacinto Morales. The Provincial Fiscal prayed for the issuance of a warrant to arrest the defendants&nbsp; which was granted.&nbsp; The defendants,&nbsp; except Antonio&nbsp; Martinez who&nbsp; is&nbsp; still&nbsp; at large, were apprehended.&nbsp; Upon arraignment they entered a plea of&nbsp; not&nbsp; guilty.&nbsp; Arsenio&nbsp; Corcillo <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Artemio&nbsp; escaped from detention and had not&nbsp; been apprehended&nbsp; up to the date&nbsp; of arraignment&nbsp; of his co-defendants, Nicasio Camerino <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Nicasio Caminero asked&nbsp; leave to&nbsp; withdraw his&nbsp; plea of not guilty and to enter a plea of guilty. Leave prayed for having&nbsp; been&nbsp; granted, and upon&nbsp; being arraigned again, he entered a plea of guilty to the charge set out&nbsp; in the amended information.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced accordingly.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; motion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of sufficient&nbsp; evidence to support their conviction, on 7&nbsp; May, 12 July&nbsp; and 16 July 1954 the Court dismissed the amended information against Crisanto Saratan, Elias Culitis and Raymundo Advincula.&nbsp; After trial,&nbsp; on 26&nbsp; June 1954 the Court rendered a verdict&nbsp; acquitting&nbsp; Dominador M. Camerino, Alejandro Lacson&nbsp; alias&nbsp; Bernardo Lacson&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Andong and Lucio&nbsp; Yambao with&nbsp; costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, and&nbsp; a judgment finding&nbsp; the—<br><blockquote>* * * accused Manuel Pakingan, Cecilio Esguerra&nbsp; and Marcelino Esguerra guilty beyond a reasonable&nbsp; doubt of the crime of murder charged&nbsp; in the same amended information, with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and with the presence of the aggravating circumstance of having committed this offense by a band, and&nbsp; hereby sentences (sentencing) said Manuel Pakingan, Gecilio Esguerra and Marcelino Esguerra to suffer each the penalty of life imprisonment, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased Jacinto Morales&nbsp; in the sum of P6,000.00, with the&nbsp; accessories&nbsp; of the law, and to pay proportionately&nbsp; the costs of this action.<br></blockquote>The convicted defendants have appealed.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution shows that at&nbsp; about 11:30 o'clock in the morning of 10 November 1953, Election Day&nbsp; of that&nbsp; year, armed men, about&nbsp; thirty in&nbsp; number, riding&nbsp; in three jeeps stopped at and&nbsp; near the corner of&nbsp; the&nbsp; concrete highway&nbsp; and Niog barrio road opposite the store of Roman Antonio, within&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality of Bacoor, province of Cavite.&nbsp; After a&nbsp; short while a&nbsp; sedan car arrived&nbsp; and suddenly&nbsp; stopped in&nbsp; front of&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of&nbsp; Zoilo Morales.&nbsp; Three&nbsp; men in khaki shirt came&nbsp; close to&nbsp; the&nbsp; car and talked to&nbsp; a man&nbsp; in the car who was said to be&nbsp; Governor Camerino of Cavite and reported to&nbsp; him&nbsp; that "the vice is already&nbsp; dead."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Governor, visibly angered, uttered cursing words, ordered the three men&nbsp; who talked to him&nbsp; and the rest riding in the three jeeps to "attack that."&nbsp; Whereupon they fired at the house of&nbsp; Zoilo&nbsp; Morales.&nbsp; After the volley of&nbsp; fire,&nbsp; the Governor said&nbsp; "Let us go that is enough."&nbsp; The Governor, followed by the three jeeps of armed men,&nbsp; left in the direction of Zapote.&nbsp; After the shooting, Briccio de Le6n came down from his house&nbsp; and&nbsp; saw Jacinto&nbsp; Morales bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to&nbsp; his succor and&nbsp; with the&nbsp; aid&nbsp; of Elpidio&nbsp; Morales and&nbsp; Zoilo Morales, father of the victim, brought him in a jeep to the Philippine General Hospital in&nbsp; Manila where he expired&nbsp; at&nbsp; 3:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the&nbsp; afternoon of that day. Dr. Ernesto G. Brion, medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, who had performed an autopsy on the cadaver, reported&nbsp; the following postmortem findings:<br><blockquote>Pallor of integument and&nbsp; mucos surfaces.<br><br>Abrasions, 1.2&nbsp; x 0.7 cm. postero-medical aspect, upper third, forearm right; 0.6 x 0.4&nbsp; cm. antero-medial aspect, knee, left; 2.0 x 1.2 cm. anterior aspect, upper third, leg right;&nbsp; 0.8 x 0.6 cm. healing, with&nbsp; scab and&nbsp; violet medication, mucosa,&nbsp; upper&nbsp; lip, right side.<br><br>Gunshot wound, entrance,&nbsp; 2.7 x 1.4 cm.&nbsp; sutured, lateral&nbsp; aspect, chest right, at level&nbsp; of 8th&nbsp; rib, along mid-axiliary line,&nbsp; 118.5&nbsp; cm. from right heel, with contusion collar 0.8 wide at&nbsp; inferior border and 0.1 cm. wide at superior&nbsp; border, with extensive hematoma about 13.0 x 12.0 cm. just&nbsp; above said Wound,&nbsp; directed upwards, medially and slightly anteriorly, non-penetrating, pursuing an intramuscular course at&nbsp; the pectoral&nbsp; and axiliary&nbsp; region right,&nbsp; fracturing completely&nbsp; the 5th rib, with spicules inwards, and chipping fractures of&nbsp; 4th&nbsp; and 3rd&nbsp; ribs&nbsp; right and&nbsp; communicating&nbsp; the middle third of right clavicle, where a communicating slit like 2.2 cm. sutured wound is&nbsp; located, at clavicular&nbsp; region right,&nbsp; 7.5&nbsp; cm. from&nbsp; the anterior median line, 139.0 cm. from&nbsp; right heel.<br><br>Hematoma&nbsp; extensive, intra-muscular,&nbsp; right axiliary and pectoral<br><br>regions; second to fifth intercostal spaces, right.<br><br>Hemothorax right—800 cc.<br><br>Contusion lung right.<br><br>Stomach filled with partly digested&nbsp; food&nbsp; material,&nbsp; mixed with dark-brown material.<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH:&nbsp; Hemorrhage secondary to gunshot wound. (Exhibits B, C,&nbsp; C-l, D, D-l, E.)<br></blockquote>Eulogio San Jose testified that at about 11:30 o'clock in the morning&nbsp; of 10 November 1953&nbsp; while he was at the corner of the concrete highway and&nbsp; Niog barrio road, Bacoor, Cavite, waiting for a bus bound for Las Piñas, a&nbsp; group of armed&nbsp; men&nbsp; riding&nbsp; in three&nbsp; jeeps&nbsp; arrived. Two of the jeeps were parked on the&nbsp; concrete highway&nbsp; facing Zapote and the third on Niog barrio road (Exhibit F).&nbsp; A few minutes later,&nbsp; a car arrived&nbsp; and stopped on the right side of the highway&nbsp; going to Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of the armed men approached the car&nbsp; and talked to a man&nbsp; inside the&nbsp; car.&nbsp; Then he&nbsp; heard&nbsp; a&nbsp; shot, and&nbsp; the passengers of the jeeps, about thirty in number, alighted&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; fired at the house of&nbsp; Zoilo&nbsp; Morales for about&nbsp; a&nbsp; minute.&nbsp; Among&nbsp; the armed men that fired at the house&nbsp; of Zoilo&nbsp; Morales were&nbsp; Marcelino Esguerra, Manuel&nbsp; Pakingan and&nbsp; another whose name he (the witness) learned&nbsp; later&nbsp; on is&nbsp; Cecilio Esguerra.&nbsp; On cross-examination,&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; declared that he knew&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Pakingan&nbsp; and Marcelino Esguerra&nbsp; but he did not know&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of Cecilio&nbsp; Esguerra&nbsp; then although he&nbsp; knew&nbsp; him by&nbsp; face;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he came&nbsp; to know Manuel Pakingan at Carmelita's Place, a bar in Las&nbsp; Piñas where he&nbsp; (the witness) used to work&nbsp; as bartender from 1952 to&nbsp; August 1953; that he used to meet him at Zapote; that he knew Marcelino Esguerra&nbsp;&nbsp; for a long&nbsp; time&nbsp; already in&nbsp; Zapote where he often met&nbsp; him&nbsp; while&nbsp; visiting&nbsp; with his parents&nbsp; who&nbsp; were&nbsp; living&nbsp; there; that they&nbsp; used to&nbsp; nod at&nbsp; each&nbsp; other everytime&nbsp;&nbsp; they met&nbsp; although they never talked to&nbsp; each other; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the&nbsp; shooting incident&nbsp; Pakingan was armed with&nbsp; a carbine; that Pakingan, Marcelino Esguerra and Cecilio&nbsp; Esguerra&nbsp; was near each other while firing&nbsp; (Exhibit 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that he saw Cecilio&nbsp; Esguerra firing at the house of Zoilo&nbsp; Morales. <br><br>After the prosecution had rested its&nbsp; case, the defense presented Eulogio San Jose as its&nbsp; witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the witness stand he&nbsp; repudiated his previous&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; and denied that at about 6:20 o'clock in the evening of 26&nbsp; April, 1954,&nbsp; he and Roberto Calinisan went to the house of the judge hearing the case, Hon.&nbsp; Antonio G. Lucero, and in the presence of the Judge and his wife, wrote the following letter in his own&nbsp; handwriting addressed to the Judge:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">April 26, 1954<br></div><br>Hokum Antonio G. Lucero<br><br>Sinior Juez&nbsp; noong ako ay magdiklara&nbsp; sa inyo ay hindi maamin ng aking kunsencia&nbsp; sapagkat walang katotohanan&nbsp; ang aking&nbsp; sinasabi sa inyo sapagkat ako ay nasa bahay noong magputukan.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Gumagalang<br>(Sgd.)&nbsp; Eulogio San Jose<br></div></blockquote><br>(Exhibit 1—Esguerra &amp; Pakingan.)<br><br>which he&nbsp; handed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Judge personally and&nbsp; later&nbsp; on confirmed under oath; that he was asked by Zoilo Morales, whom he owed&nbsp; some favors, to testify for the prosecution and it was&nbsp; only&nbsp; upon his insistence&nbsp; that&nbsp; he yielded&nbsp; to his&nbsp; request; that&nbsp; Zoilo&nbsp; Morales and&nbsp; Captain&nbsp; Adamos taught him&nbsp; what to&nbsp; say at the witness stand; that&nbsp; he was afraid&nbsp; of&nbsp; Captain Adamos;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that his&nbsp; previous testimony&nbsp; in court was "not&nbsp; his true testimony," because he was&nbsp; not&nbsp; present when the&nbsp; incident took place.<br><br>The appellants now contend that&nbsp; by giving "two opposing and conflicting testimonies, one of which&nbsp; is necessarily false," Eulogio San Jose's previous testimony alone cannot be relied upon to support a&nbsp; verdict&nbsp; "that&nbsp; they are guilty of the crime charged."<br><br>When there&nbsp; are&nbsp; two&nbsp; contradictory testimonies&nbsp; given by a&nbsp; witness who&nbsp; retracts or recants&nbsp; his previous testimony&nbsp; and swears that his previous&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; is not true because he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not present when the incident&nbsp; or event&nbsp; took&nbsp; place, the&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration all the circumstances and the probable reason or reasons that prompted&nbsp; the witness&nbsp; to&nbsp; repudiate&nbsp; his&nbsp; previous testimony, may rely&nbsp; upon what it&nbsp; believes&nbsp; is true and correct&nbsp; given by the witness freely&nbsp; and voluntarily and disregard&nbsp; the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The witness disavowed&nbsp; his former testimony in court because he&nbsp; was afraid&nbsp; of reprisal from the appellants who&nbsp; were all out on bail.&nbsp; Not only was he apprehensive about his own personal safety but also he was afraid that his mother&nbsp; would&nbsp; be harmed. In his&nbsp; second&nbsp; testimony, he said that&nbsp; his&nbsp; mother did not want him to be a witness in this case.&nbsp; He claimed that he was compelled to testify in the manner&nbsp; he did for the prosecution because&nbsp; he was&nbsp; harassed by army men and afraid of Captain Adamos.&nbsp; There is no evidence tending to&nbsp; show that Captain Adamos and his&nbsp; men were interested or had&nbsp; a motive to send innocent men to jail upon perjured testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, while on the witness stand&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; although the&nbsp; witness was subjected to rigorous cross&nbsp; examination by the&nbsp; respective counsel for the appellants and their-co-defendants, he did not waiver in his testimony.<br><br>The&nbsp; appellants'&nbsp; identical&nbsp; defense is alibi.&nbsp; Manuel Pakingan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>claims that from 11:00 o'clock to 12:00&nbsp; o'clock in the&nbsp; morning of 10&nbsp; November 1953&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; at his house&nbsp; in barrio&nbsp; Anabu, Imus, attending to his&nbsp; sick wife who suffered&nbsp; a relapse&nbsp; after giving&nbsp; birth&nbsp; to a&nbsp; child. Cecilio&nbsp; Esguerra&nbsp; says that&nbsp; from 9:30&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the morning of 10 November 1953 to 12:30 o'clock&nbsp; in the morning of the&nbsp; next day, he acted as poll&nbsp; inspector&nbsp; at Precinct No. 14 in Medicion, Imus, Cavite, as a&nbsp; substitute for Jose Gonzales,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; inspector&nbsp; for the&nbsp;&nbsp; Nacionalista Party who&nbsp; was absent; and that he never left&nbsp; the place during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcelino Esguerra testifies that&nbsp; at 9:00 o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the morning of 10&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1953 hi boarded a LTB bus to go to Batangas, Batangas,&nbsp; to see his three children at barrio Libhok, arriving in&nbsp; Batangas at 1:00 o'clock in&nbsp; the afternoon&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; day, and returned to Imus in the morning of 12 November 1953.<br><br>The&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; alibi&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; cases&nbsp; is inherently weak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eulogio San Jose positively and categorically identified the appellants as among the armed men that fired at the house of Zoilo Morales at about 11:30 o'clock in the morning of 10 November 1953, resulting in the death of&nbsp; Jacinto Morales.&nbsp; No&nbsp; motive has&nbsp; been shown why Eulogio San Jose should falsely testify and point to them if he&nbsp; had not seen them during&nbsp; the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manuel Pakingan himself&nbsp; said that he had no quarrel with him, that he knew&nbsp; him only by face.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; the appellants have a&nbsp; motive in firing at the house of Zoilo Morales.&nbsp; They were the&nbsp; henchmen&nbsp; and&nbsp; loyal followers of&nbsp; Governor&nbsp; Camerino,&nbsp; the&nbsp; leader of the&nbsp; Liberal Party in Cavite.&nbsp; In the morning of 10 November 1953, before the death of Jacinto Morales, Eduardo Ocampo, vice-mayor of Bacoor, a&nbsp; member of the Nacionalista&nbsp; Party who had defected to the Liberal Party, was killed in an encounter with members and sympathizers of the Nacionalista Party. To&nbsp; avenge his death,&nbsp; the Governor's armed henchmen, numbering about&nbsp; thirty, including&nbsp; the three appellants, proceeded to barrio Niog, Bacoor, and fired at the house of Zoilo Morales, leader of the Nacionalista Party in that barrio.<br><br>The reasons and considerations given by the trial court to arrive at&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion that there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; sufficient evidence to&nbsp; show&nbsp; conspiracy&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendant Dominador N. Camerino and not to the herein appellants.<br><br>The fact that&nbsp; the band of armed men, including the appellants, riding in jeeps stopped in the vicinity&nbsp; of the house of Zoilo Morales at&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; Niog, Bacoor, Cavite, and fired simultaneously at his house,&nbsp; show that they had conspired together in carrying out the&nbsp; premeditated plan&nbsp; of killing&nbsp; Zoilo&nbsp; Morales&nbsp; and&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of his family&nbsp; or inflicting harm upon them.<br><br>The crime committed is murder qualified by&nbsp; treachery and aggravated by the aid&nbsp; of armed men, penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> in its maximum period to death.&nbsp; There being no mitigating circumstance to offset the aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty of&nbsp; death should&nbsp; be imposed.<br><br>Nevertheless, for lack of sufficient number&nbsp; of&nbsp; votes&nbsp; to impose&nbsp; the death&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; proportionate&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras C.
