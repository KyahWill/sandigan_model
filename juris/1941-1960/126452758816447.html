				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On July 15, 1945, respondent Judge Mamerto Roxas rendered judgment ordering petitioners to vacate the premises at No. 1135 Avenida Rizal,  Manila, on or before October 15, 1945,  in accordance with  an agreement entered into between the petitioners and respondent Eugenio Quesada.</p>
<p>Petitioner Agustin Alonzo has no place to which foe can transfer, his house, belongings and furniture having been burned  on February 11, 1945, and seeks  to be  given a period of three months after October 15, during  which the order of execution should not  be  issued in order to give him sufficient time for locating a vacant house or a vacant room where he can transfer himself and his family. In view of the expiration of the period within which petitioner should vacate the premises in question as ordered in the judgment rendered by respondent judge, in accordance with an agreement entered into between the petitioners and respondent Eugenio Quesada, Judge Roxas issued the writ  of  execution.  Petitioner  alleged  that  respondent judge, in  ordering the execution  of his judgment, committed a grave abuse  of discretion, considering  the fact that it is of common knowledge that there is now a housing problem in Manila and, therefore,  prays that respondent judge be  ordered to desist from  ordering the execution of the judgment in question.</p>
<p>Respondent Quesada  answered, alleging that the decision rendered by respondent judge was based  on a gentleman's agreement by which petitioners were  given a period of three months and six days to vacate the premises in question from  the date of the decision rendered on July 9, 1945.</p>
<p>Quesada alleges also that petitioners were required to vacate the premises in question as  early as February 15;</p>
<p>That  they were ordered  to vacate the premises by the municipal court 15 days after March 31, the date of mid court's decision;</p>
<p>That petitioners have had more than seven months within which to get  another  house;</p>
<p>That petitioner Francisco de la  Cruz has long since vacated the premises in question, leaving therein his house guest Agustin Alonzo, who is unknown to  and has never been a lessee  of  Quesada;</p>
<p>That Francisco de la Cruz has a residential house of his own at No, 1218 Felix Huertas, big enough to accommodate his house guest Agustin Alonzo;</p>
<p>That petitioners have leased the basement floor of the property in question to some Chinese merchants for business purposes;</p>
<p>That respondent Quesada, being  a well-known local manufacturer of  chemical  products  bearing  his  name, has since July 24 secured  a license to  resume his business, and needs the basement floor in question as a display room for his chemical products, and the  upper floor of the premises in question  to  accommodate  the  big family of Dr. Joaquin Mara√±on, of the Bureau of  Science, whose house, formerly at No.  552 Pennsylvania,  was shelled and burned during the liberation of the City of  Manila and who now temporarily lives in a  very congested  house at  No. 651 Lipa;</p>
<p>That respondent Quesada has no other  suitable house for the storage and display of his chemical products and to  accommodate  the  family  of  aforesaid  Dr.  Joaquin Mararion;</p>
<p>That to grant the petition  would nullify the practical use of, and exposing to public ridicule, the otherwise wholesome agreements  arrived at voluntarily by parties in court chambers during pre-trials, and would  inevitably  encourage bad  faith and dilatory tactics on  the  part of many bad-intentioned parties.</p>
<p>In an affidavit presented  by respondent  Quesada as  part of his  answer, Deputy Sheriff Getulio  Pantoj a of Manila deposes that on October 22, when he personally served the writ of  execution  upon petitioner  Agustin Alonzo, he found that the family of said petitioner was occupying the upper floor of the premises in question, while the basement floor was being  occupied by some Chinese merchants, who refused to give their names and to inform since when they have been occupying the premises and how much they are paying  therefor.</p>
<p>The facts  alleged in  the answer were not  denied  by petitioners.</p>
<p>Upon the facts shown in the petition and in the answer of respondent Quesada,  we are of opinion  that the  petition has absolutely no merit. Francisco de la Cruz, .the real tenant, has left the premises  already.  His  house guest,  petitioner  Alonzo,  from the  point of  view of owner Quesada,  is no  more than a mere intruder.  If  he has  any right to stay in  the house that right was subsidiary to that of tenant  Francisco  de la Cruz, he being a mere house guest of the same.  After Francisco de la  Cruz left the house, Alonzo has  absolutely no legal standing to remain, in the house.</p>
<p>In this question, besides the legal  aspect, there  is  a moral aspect that should not be left without some comment from us.</p>
<p>Alonzo  had more than seven months within  which  he could look for another  place.   If he failed to locate another place after such a long  time, there  is absolutely  no reason for him to impose upon owner Quesada,  after said Alonzo entered into a gentleman's agreement to vacate the premises not later than October 15, agreement which was the basis  of the decision rendered by Judge Roxas.   The fact  that  the basement  floor  of the house is  occupied  by Chinese merchants,  does  not strengthen the moral position of petitioner Alonzo, as it gives rise to the respondent conjecture  that he  insists  in  remaining in the  premises  in order to  continue  profiting by the rents  the  unknown Chinese merchants might have been paying and may him.</p>
<p>We cannot be unmindful of the hardships of tenants in Manila under present circumstances and we are willing1 to grant said tenants, who might come to us  for relief, any liberal concession compatible with law.   But we revolt against the idea of being a party to a violation  of a gentleman's agreement,  and of trampling upon the word of honor of honorable  citizens.  We cannot countenance the breach of a voluntary promise given with  all the judicial and  gentlemanly solemnities  by petitioner Alonzo in tha present case.</p>
<p>We cannot grant the petition without violating the legal and moral  principles which are of primary importance for the orderly intercourse in human society.  Those are principles that spring from the very essence of personal dignity.</p>
<p>Petition  dismissed with costs.</p>

<p><strong>PABLO, M.,</strong>  Concurrente y Disidente:</p>
<p>Conformo con el sobreseimiento de la solicitud; pero no por las razones  expuestas en  la decision, sino porque hay remedio ordinario faeil y expedite: la Ley No. 689.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISIDENTE</em></p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.,</strong></p>
<p>No estoy conforme con la decision de la mayoria  por los siguientes fundamentos:</p>
<p>(1) Creo que se  comete  una  injusticia  con el peticionario Agustin Alonzo con la  insinuacion de que trata de lucrarse con los alquileres que le pagan sub-arrendatarios chinos que ocupan la planta baja de la casa.  A falta de prueba positiva  e inconcusa en autos sobre este  respecto, no solo estimo superflua tal  insinuacion, sino que la considero injustincada.</p>
<p>(2)  La infraccion del llamado convenio de caballeros no tiene  para  mi  la  importancia que  se  Ie  atribuye en la opinion de  la mayoria.  La escasez de viviendas en Manila resultante de la  devastation causada por la guerra ha creado un problema de proporciones tan tremendas  que no creo deba indignarse nadie cuando  un pobre  inquilino se ve obligado a faltar a su palabra por no encontrar inmediatamente un cobijo para el y su familia.   El recurrehte acude  a nosotros  en demanda de un plazo razonable para cumplir la sentencia del  tribunal inferior.  Creo que  no hay  motivo para  dudar de su buena fe.</p>
<p>(3)  La mejor prueba de que lo solicitado por el recurrente tiene buen fundamento en derecho y  en equidad es que  eso mismo se halla estatuido  ahora en la ley sobre alquileres  aprobada recientemente por el Congreso.<br>
