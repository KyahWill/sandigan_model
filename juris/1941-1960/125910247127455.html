				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case is  an  offshoot of our  decision in G. R.  No. L-6191, Republic of the Philippines <em>vs</em>.  Cirilo P. Baylosis, et al., promulgated January 31, 1955 (96 Phil., 461; 51 Off. Gaz., No. 2, 722), sustaining the motions to dismiss of appellants and ordering the dismissal of the  expropriation proceedings filed by the Republic of the Philippines in the Court of First Instance of Batangas (C. C. No. 84) to expropriate seven lots formerly constituting part of the  Lian  Estate (Hacienda Lian) in the municipality of  Lian,  Batangas.</p>
<p>It appears that after the records were returned by  this Court to the Court a quo, the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines filed on June  30,  1955  a motion to withdraw its preliminary deposit of P27,105.22 made pursuant to section 3, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court, and by  virtue of which it was placed in the possession  of the parcels in question, on the ground that whatever claims  for damages  the defendants  might have, had already become barred  by the finality of our decision in G. R. No. L-6191,  which made no pronouncement  on  nor contained a  reservation  of defendants' right to claim damages.  Defendants opposed the motion, claiming that their losses and damages resulting from the transfer of the possession of their lands to plaintiff and which they alleged  in their motions to dismiss had  not yet been  determined by the trial court.   Notwithstanding the opposition, the  court below, on  July 25, 1955, ordered the return of the  aforesaid  deposit to  plaintiff,  for the reason  that "the  defendants have  not  taken any step towards the recovery of such  damages,"  nor "is there any assurance that they would do so  in the immediate future, on the  assumption that their right to pursue such  claim for  damages  is not  yet barred by  laches".  Defendants accordingly moved for  the  reconsideration of such order, and before their motion for reconsideration was resolved, also moved that their  counterclaims for  damages be  set for  hearing.  Both motions  were denied by the  court; whereupon, defendants  interposed the present  appeal  to this Court.</p>
<p>We find merit in the appeal.</p>
<p>Firstly, appellants  are right in claiming that  the lower court should not have authorized the withdrawal of plaintiff's preliminary deposit before their right to recover the damages allegedly suffered  by  them  by  reason  of the filing of the expropriation  suit is finally  determined and adjudicated.   For as  we said in Visayan Refining Co.  <em>vs</em>. Camus,  40 Phil., 562, said deposit protects the defendant "from any danger of loss resulting  from the temporary occupation of the land by the Government,  for it is obvious that this preliminary deposit  serves the  double purpose of a prepayment upon the value of the  property, if finally expropriated, and  as  an indemnity against damage in the eventuality that the proceedings should fail of consummation."   To return  this  deposit  to  plaintiff  now  would, therefore, be depriving defendants of this legal safeguard for the  payment of their damages in case  they are finally held to  have the  right to collect said damages in these same proceedings.</p>
<p>The decisive question in this appeal, therefore, is whether or not appellants can still prove and recover their damages in this same action. Appellee and the lower court entertain the view that appellants are now barred from claiming any damages in  this case, because our decision in G. R. No. L-6191  made no reservation of their right to do so, and said decision is now  res judicata.  Appellants,  upon the other hand,  maintain  that the only issue involved in that appeal was plaintiff's right to expropriate their lands, and as their right to damages was not brought up and litigated therein, the decision of this  Court in said appeal can not be <em>res judicata</em> as to such matter.  Again we find appellant's position on this matter the more  tenable.</p>
<p>The records show that all of appellants' motions to dismiss contained  counterclaims for damages supposedly suffered by them as a result of the filing of the  expropriation proceedings.  When the motions to dismiss were called for trial, however, the hearing  was confined to the  issue of plaintiff's right to expropriate, and evidence was accordingly  adduced  by the parties on this question alone (see Decision of the court below, R. A., pp. 162-163).  In fact, defendants at this hearing started to prove their damages, but they were prevented from doing so by the lower Court, saying that such matter "will be  for the commissioners" (t.s.n.  of  Feb. 18,  1952, p. 293);  and  for  that reason, defendants,  through counsel,  repeatedly  manifested  that they  were  reserving their  right to  present  evidence  on their  damages  (t.s.n.,  ibid, pp. 293, 297, 298), and the reservation was approved by the Court (ibid, p. 298).  Unfortunately for defendants, the trial court upheld plaintiff's right  to expropriate; and from this finding exclusively, they appealed to this Court in G. R. No.  L-6191.</p>
<p>In view of the antecedents, it can not be said that appellants are now barred  from proving their alleged damages in this case simply because their right to do so  had not  been reserved in our decision in G. R. No.  L-6191.  The reservation had already been made in the court below and  duly approved therein; the reservation  was not  questioned by the Government, and it did not appeal therefrom.   As there was already that reservation, it was needless for appellants to raise such matter  on appeal or ask for a reservation of their right to prove damages in  our decision in  G. R. No. L-6191. In a similar case wherein defendants agreed to the appointment of  commissioners  and  presented  evidence before them, upon the understanding that said hearing was without prejudice to discussing later the question relative to the right of plaintiff to expropriate, we held that the reservation was "very  expressive  in the  sense  that in  the mind of the court,  defendants never had the intention of waiving that defense as otherwise it would have not stated in its order such reservation.  Such reservation negatives the  idea of waiver."   (Republic <em>vs</em>.  Gabriel, G. R. No. L-6161, May 28, 1954.)   The reservation made  by appellants and approved by the court in this case can not be any less effective than the reservation in the Gabriel case.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellee cites two cases to support its contention that the absence of a reservation  of appellants' right to recover damages in our decision in G. R. No. L-6191 forecloses such right,  but the cases cited are inapplicable to  this case because  of  the  substantial  differences  in  the  facts  and issues in said cases and the present one.  In the first place, both cases  cited involved, not motions to dismiss filed by defendants  wherein they expressly included counterclaims for damages as in this case, but motions to dismiss at  the instance of plaintiff, the very party that filed the expropriation proceedings.  In the first case, Metropolitan Water District <em>vs</em>.  De los Angeles, 55 Phil., 776, plaintiff's motion to dismiss was even filed after the lower court had already decided the case in its favor, and an appeal already taken by both parties on the question of just compensation.  In view of the motion to dismiss filed by plaintiff on appeal, the only question presented for decision was whether or not plaintiff should be allowed to dismiss  the proceedings at that stage,  since defendants had already  suffered great damages by reason of their dispossession and incurred into great expenses by reason of the long and protracted litigation.  In sustaining plaintiff's right to dismiss, we had, of necessity and  in  justice  to defendants, to reserve to them the right to recover their damages either in the same or in another action.   While in the case of City of Manila <em>vs</em>. J. C. Ruymann, 37 Phil., 421, the lower court sustained plaintiff's motion to dismiss the expropriation proceedings,  reserving to defendants  their  right to  prove damages  in another action,  so that defendants appealed, urging that they should be allowed to recover their damages in the same proceedings since they had claimed damages in their motions to dismiss.  As the precise question presented to us in  the appeal was defendants' right to claim and recover damages in the same proceedings, it was necessary for us to declare in our decision that they had  said right.  These cases can not be invoked in the case at bar, not only because the only question presented in G. R. No. L-6191 was whether or  not plaintiff was entitled to expropriate defendants' properties, but also because, as already stated,  the right of defendants to prove, in the  same proceedings the damages alleged in their motions to dismiss had already been reserved to them by the trial court.</p>
<p>The remaining question  involves  the denial by the court below of appellants' motion to  set for hearing their counter-claims for  damages, for the reason given that "the motion of the defendants to set for hearing their counterclaim  for damages would in effect be to  reopen a case decided by  the Supreme Court unconditionally and with finality"  (R.  A., p. 208).  This order will also have to be reversed, in view of what we have already said upholding appellants'  right to prove and recover their  damages in these  same proceedings.  As  for  appellee's  contention  that appellants  are guilty of laches in the prosecution of their claims for damages, we do not think the delay of four months  in  their asking for  the trial of their counterclaims (see Appellee's Brief, p. 8) is such unreasonable length of time  as would justify us to dismiss said  claims on the ground of laches or non-suit. Anyway, no prejudice could have been caused plaintiff by this  delay.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed, and  the records  are remanded to the  court a quo for trial on  appellants'  counterclaims for damages and other reliefs contained in their motions to dismiss.   Costs against plaintiff-appellee.</p>
