				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Sergio Gabucan, Julian Kho, Victoriano Canoy and Pedro Flores were 
charged with illegal possession of firearms (case No. V-1527) and 
attempted robbery in band with homicide (case No. V-1975) in the Court 
of First Instance of Cebu.  While awaiting trial the last three 
defendants escaped from jail.  Julian Kho was rearrested.  A joint trial
 of the two cases was held for the two defendants Sergio Gabucan and 
Julian Kho.  After trial, both were found guilty of the crimes charged 
and sentenced for illegal possession of firearms, under Rep. Act No. 4, 
to suffer from 5 years and 1 day of <i>prision correccional</i> as 
minimum to 7 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum and for 
attempted robbery in band with homicide from 17 years, 4 months and 1 
day as minimum to 20 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum, the 
trial court compensating the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity with
 the mitigating circumstance of not having intended to commit so serious
 a crime, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P2,000 
and to pay the costs.  Only Sergio Gabucan has appealed.
  <p>    It appears that on 13 March 1948, between 2:30 and 3:00 o'clock
 a.m., two prowlers, one armed with a pistol and the other with a 
flashlight and a knife, succeeded in opening the door of a room enclosed
 by wooden and bamboo sidings in the groundfloor of the house of 
Gregorio Sevilla situated at No. 269-C Mango Avenue, city of Cebu, where
 Abundio Carungay was sleeping, by raising the lock lever, entered the 
room, woke him up and told him not to shout.  By the beams of the 
flashlight Carungay was able to recognize Julian Kho who held the 
flashlight and Pedro Flores, shorter in height, who carried a pistol 
which he tried to cock.  When Carungay went to bed that night he left 
the light on but when he was awakened by the two intruders the light was
 out.  Carungay could not help but shout "Robbers, robbers, Mr. 
Sevilla." These shouts woke up Gregorio Sevilla and his wife Ruth 
Sevilla who were sleeping in the second floor of the house and Carungay 
and the two intruders ran away.  After being awakened by the shouts of 
Carungay, Ruth Sevilla jumped out of her bed, ran to the kitchen and 
opened the door.  At that moment she saw standing on the yard behing the
 house a man who looked at her.  A little while, when her husband joined
 her and was about to raise his gun to fire, she heard five or six gun 
shots coming from a corner of the yard behind the kitchen and left side 
of the house and saw her husband fall.  She shouted for help and the 
neighbors came to the house and later went to the P.C.  After that she 
was told that her husband was dead.  After the firing of the gunshot 
Carungay went up to the house and found Gregorio Sevilla dead in the 
room adjoining the kitchen.</p>
  <p>    According to the doctor who made the necropsy of the deceased 
Gregorio Sevilla, the gunshots hit the deceased in the chest and the 
point of entry of the wound was at the eight interspace mid-axiliary 
line, left side, and the point of exit at the third rib, mammary line, 
right side, passing through the left ventricle, left auricle and right 
auricle of the heart; the gun must be a .30 caliber; and the cause of 
his instantaneous death was a sever hemorrhage (Exhibit J).</p>
  <p>    The police authorities of the city started to work on the case.
  They posted several operatives in the neighborhood where the house of 
the deceased was located.  The owner of a store in the neighborhood 
informed the sleuths that the night previous to the killings of Sevilla,
 Julian Kho, Victor Canoy, Pedro Flores and another, whose name he did 
not know, came to his store and drank coca-cola and "tuba" and chewed 
gum but did not pay for them.  In the afternoon of that day three of 
them returned to the store and were arrested on suspicion that they had 
something to do with the killing of Sevilla, taken to the police station
 and investigated.  They confessed they were the authors of the killing 
of Gregorio Sevilla whose house they had intended to rob.  Victorinao 
Canoy indicated the place where they hid the arms they used that night 
which was near the house of Sergio Gabucan.  Victoriano Canoy was 
brought to the place and he pointed to a foxhole dug out by the 
Americans and covered by dried leaves, where they hid the arms they used
 that night.  In the foxhole 20 or 30 meters from the house of Sergio 
Gabucan, they found an Ediston rifle caliber .30, U. S. model, serial 
No. 991345 (Exhibit L); a Japanese rifle caliber .25, serial No. 9211 
(Exhibit M); a carbine caliber .30 with its serial number tampered 
(Exhibit N); a hand grenade (Exhibit O); a hunting knife (Exhibit P); a 
wire cutter (Exhibit Q); and an invasion pistol caliber .45 (Exhibit R).
  A revolver caliber .45 (Exhibit T) was found in the yard of the house 
of Gregorio Sevilla in the morning of 13 March which, according to Pedro
 Flores, Victoriano Canoy and Julian Kho, Sergio Gabucan carried and 
fired and, according to Victoriano Canoy and Julina Kho, Gabucan dropped
 when they ran away after the firing of the shots.  In the afternoon of 
13 March Sergio Gabucan left for Cagayan, Oriental Misamis, was arrested
 there and brought back to Cebu on 29 October 1948.  He was asked about 
the weapon he used on the night of 13 March and he said he had placed it
 somewhere near his house.  They repaired to that place but they did not
 find it because the field was cleared of the grass.  On their way back 
to jail he pointed to the foxhole where they hid the arms.  These were 
taken by them from the office of the deputy clerk of court where they 
were kept, being the exhibits presented at the trials of criminal cases.
  According to Victoriano Canoy, on the night of 13 March he carried a 
rifle caliber .30 serial No. 5846032 (Exhibit S) and 15 rounds of 
ammunition (Exhibit S-1) which he hid in a bamboo grove.  A small piece 
of blue denim cloth was found hooked to the wire fence of the deceased's
 house which was the cloth of the trousers worn by Sergio Gabucan that 
night.  Four bullet holes were found in the kitchen and in the ceiling 
of the house of the deceased.</p>
  <p>    On 23 January 1948, Sergio Gabucan, Julian Kho, Victoriano 
Canoy and Pedro Flores, who were prisoners then, were brought to the 
office of the deputy clerk of court to remove cabinets and safes.  The 
cabinets, some of them containing arms and ammunition, were opened and 
emptied of their contents by the prisoners.  After emptying them the 
prisoners moved the cabinets to another room in the building and put 
back their contents.  In the morning of 13 March the deputy clerk of 
court, Vicente E. Zosa, found the cabinets forced open and the firearms 
and ammunition kept therein missing.</p><p>All the defendants made statements sworn to before the municipal 
judge of the city, Filomeno B. Ibañez, admitting participation in the 
taking of the arms from the office of the deputy clerk of court on the 
night of 12 March and in the attempt to rob the house of Gregorio 
Sevilla which resulted in the latter's death early in the morning of 13 
March.</p>
  <p>    After testifying that ill-treatment and threat of further 
bodily injury forced him to sign the affidavit before the municipal 
judge, Sergio Gabucan swears that on the night of 12 March 1948 he was 
in his house from 7:00 p.m. until the following day; and that he left at
 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 13 March for Mindanao to visit his 
brother, although he admits that at 10:00 o'clock in the morning of 12 
March he met Julian Kho, Victoriano Canoy and Pedro Flores, who were his
 companions in the provincial jail, in a restaurant near the capitol, 
and all of them brought cigarettes to their frien and companion Lucio 
Caballes who was still in jail that day.  He was released from prison on
 2 March and his three co-defendants on 11 March (Exhibit W).</p><p>The testimony of Julian Kho is substantially a reiteration of the 
evidence for the prosecution and of his statement sworn to before Judge 
Ibañez, on how they planned to commit robbery, how they took the 
firearms from the office of the deputy clerk of court and brought them 
to a banana grove near the house of Sergio Gabucan and how they entered 
the room in the groundfloor of the house of Gregorio Sevilla except as 
to the one who fired the shots that killed Sevilla.  He says it was 
Victoriano Canoy.  Further recounting what took place that night he says
 that while they were walking, Canoy and Flores armed with carbines and 
he with a revolver, a hunting knife and a flashlight, decided to rob any
 one they would meet on the way and went to Mango Avenue to watch for 
passers-by; that near a bridge they met a car the light of which blinded
 them and caused them to jump to a ditch; and that they continued their 
way passing through a corn field until they reached the house of 
Sevilla.  Victoriano Canoy then proposed to rob the house of Sevilla.  
They all agreed.  Victoriano Canoy stood in the yard of the house near 
the fence and Pedro Flores climbed the house and tried to open the 
window but failed.  Flores came down and both he and Flores went to the 
groundfloor, put out the light and entered the room of a boy who shouted
 for help.  When the boy shouted they ran away.  A short while after 
they heard gun shots.  The one who fired was Victoriano Canoy who was 
stationed outside of the room as guard.  The revolver found near the 
house was the one Canoy dropped when he ran away.</p>
  <p>    The only substantial difference then between his testimony on 
the stand and his affidavit Exhibits AA, A-1 and A-2 refers to the 
confederate who fired the gunshots which killed Sevilla.  In the former 
he says it was Victoriano Canoy to free Sergio Gabucan; in the latter he
 says it was Sergio Gabucan.</p><p>The evidence is clear that the four defendants conspired to rob and 
to carry out their plan in the evening of 12 March they stole the arms 
and ammunition which they knew were kept in the office of the deputy 
clerk of court and before that in the afternoon of 12 March they drank 
and ate in a small restaurant located near the capitol building.  Sergio
 Gabucan was released from jail on 2 March and his three companions nine
 days later, after serving a court sentence for theft (Exhibit W).  
Sergio Gabucan left Cebu in the afternoon of the day of the commission 
of the crime and went to Cagayan, Oriental Misamis.  His departure 
reveals guilty conscience.  The extrajudicial confession or admission by
 Sergio Gabucan that he took part in the commission of the crimes 
charged (Exhibit C) voluntarily made as testified to by the municipal 
judge, Filomeno B. Ibañez, before whom it was subscribed and sworn to, 
corroborated by the disappearance of arms and ammunition from the office
 of the deputy clerk of court on the night of 12 March; by the finding 
thereof in the foxhole indicated by his confederate Victoriano Canoy on 
13 March and by him after his arrest and confinement on 29 October; by 
the admissions made by him to detective Hilarion Vestil; and by his 
flight from the scene of the crime late in the afternoon of the same 
day, 13 March, despite denial by him on the stand that it was voluntary,
 leads us, as it led the trial court, to conclude that Sergio Gabucan in
 conspiracy with his three co-defendants committed the crimes charged 
against him.  Conspiracy having been established it is immaterial 
whether it was Victoriano Canoy and Sergio Gabucan who fired the fatal 
shot.  All the defendants are guilty of the crimes charged.</p>
  <p>    The penalty imposed for illegal possession of firearms is 
within the range provided for in section 2692 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, as amended by Com. Act No. 56 and Rep. Act No. 4 
but it is neither <i>prision correccional</i> for the minimum nor <i>prison
 mayor</i> for the maximum.  It should be just from 5 years and 1 day of
 imprisonment as minimum to 7 years and 1 day of imprisonment as 
maximum.</p>
  <p>    The penalty for attempted robbery with homicide, pursuant to 
article 297 of the Revised Penal Code, is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in 
its maximum period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  Two aggravating 
circumstances concurred in the commission of the crime, to wit: that of 
more than three armed malefactors took part therein and that of 
nocturnity, which are not offset by any attenuating circumstance because
 that taken into account by the trial court of not having an intent of 
committing so grave a wrong as that committed would not apply to 
robbery, and even if it deemed applicable to the incidental crime of 
homicide, there would still be one aggravating circumstance which is not
 offset.  The penalty provided by law should be imposed in its maximum 
period which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  The Indeterminate Sentence 
Act does not apply to convicted persons of offenses punished with life 
imprisonment or <i>reclusion perpetua</i> (sec. 2, Act No. 4103, as 
amended by Act No. 4225).</p>
  <p>    We modify the judgment appealed from by striking out <i>"prison
 correccional"</i> and <i>"prision mayor"</i> from the penalty imposed 
for illegal possession of firearms and by writing the word 
"imprisonment" in lieu thereof; and by sentencing the appellant to 
suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for attempted robbery with homicide, 
the accessories of the law, and affirm the rest of the judgment, with 
costs against the appellant.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes</i> 
and <i>Jugo, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>
    Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> no part. </p>
