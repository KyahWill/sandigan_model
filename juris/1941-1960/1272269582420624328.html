				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by&nbsp; certiorari under Rule 46 from a judgment of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On 8&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1948&nbsp; Inma Rohde Shotwell, successor- in-interest of the late William H. Rohde, the lessor,&nbsp; sued the lessee and the assignee in the Court of First Instance of Manila to&nbsp; recover from them allegedly due&nbsp; and unpaid rentals from 1 January 1942 to 30 November 1945. After hearing, the Court rendered judgment—<br><blockquote>* * *&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff and against the&nbsp; defendant Manila Motor&nbsp; Co., Inc., ordering the latter to pay&nbsp; the former the sum of P175.00 (rental for the month of January 1945),&nbsp; with&nbsp; interest at the rate of&nbsp; six per <span style="font-style: italic;">centum per annum</span>&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid; and declaring the contract of lease&nbsp; terminated as of the destruction of the buildings in February, 1945.&nbsp; The case against&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; Chartered Bank of India, Australia &amp; China is dismissed for&nbsp; lack of&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; The payment of the rental due from the defendant Manila Motor Co., Inc., is suspended until the Moratorium Law has been lifted, unless the said defendant waives its right Tinder&nbsp; said Law.&nbsp; With costs against&nbsp; the above named defendant.<br></blockquote>From this&nbsp; judgment the plaintiff appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The judgment appealed from was affirmed,<br><blockquote>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * with the only modification that the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of P175.00 as rental of the&nbsp; property involved in this litigation for the month of January, 1945, is&nbsp; not suspended&nbsp; and should be made as soon as this decision becomes final.&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs are taxed&nbsp; against the appellants.<br></blockquote>The findings of the Court&nbsp; of appeals are, as follows:<br><blockquote>*&nbsp; * * on Septempber&nbsp; 1, 1937,&nbsp; William H.&nbsp; Rhode,&nbsp; now deceased, father of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Inma&nbsp; Rohde Shotwell,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Manila Motor Co., Inc., entered&nbsp; into a contract of lease for 14&nbsp; years, covering three parcels of land together with&nbsp; all&nbsp; buildings and improvements thereoit,&nbsp; situated on&nbsp; Ongpin, Manila, the buildings fronting on Tambakan alley (Exh. A same as Exh. 10), at a monthly rental of&nbsp; P1,,050.00 for the first four&nbsp; years&nbsp; and P1,100.00 for the succeeding years.&nbsp; Two months and five&nbsp; days&nbsp; later, or on November 6,&nbsp; 1937,&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; Motor Co., Inc.&nbsp; assigned, with, the&nbsp; express consent of William H. Rohde (Exh. B), said lease to the defendant Chartered Bank of&nbsp; India, Australia &amp; 'China&nbsp; under the following reservations:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"1.—That this&nbsp; assignment does not carry with&nbsp; it&nbsp; any of the&nbsp; liabilities and obligations undertaken - and assumed by the Manila Motor Co., Inc. in&nbsp; said lease;&nbsp; but&nbsp; that the Chartered Bank of India,&nbsp; Australia &amp; China has&nbsp; the option at any time to undertake&nbsp; and assume the said liabilities&nbsp; and&nbsp; obligations upon written&nbsp; notice by registered&nbsp; mail to&nbsp; the lessor, William H. Rhode;<br><br>"2.—That this assignment shall&nbsp; in no way absolve or release the&nbsp; Manila Motor Co., Inc. from the&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; and&nbsp; liabilities&nbsp; it has contracted in said&nbsp; lease."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B.)<br></div><br>There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; denial that the defendant Chartered Bank of India, Australia &amp; China&nbsp; never exercised its option&nbsp; on&nbsp; said lease, and in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the contract aforequoted, We declare that the assignment thereof Was made&nbsp; just to&nbsp; benefit said defendant Bank and not to work against it unless said Bank would&nbsp; have exercised&nbsp; the option.&nbsp; Consequently, the dismissal&nbsp; of the complaint with&nbsp; regard to this&nbsp; defendant was proper&nbsp; and is hereby affirmed.<br><br>As to the other defendant, the Manila Motor Co.,&nbsp; Inc., the questions at issue to be determined are whether&nbsp; or not (1) the lease contract&nbsp; (Exh. A)&nbsp; was novated; (2) the destruction of the buildings of&nbsp; the&nbsp; leased properly during&nbsp; the battle of liberation&nbsp; in February of 1945, caused the termination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; the Executive Order on moratorium still&nbsp; affects&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of any of the rentals that might be due&nbsp; the plaintiffs;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4) there is any&nbsp; balance of the accumulated rentals of the premises that the Manila Motor Co.,&nbsp; Inc. is bound to pay to the plaintiffs, with interests thereon from the filing of this action.<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>As held&nbsp; by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>,&nbsp; "the&nbsp; main portion&nbsp; of the leased premises was sealed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese military forces, such that the defendant Manila&nbsp; Motor&nbsp; Co., Inc., was not able to continue engaging in&nbsp; automobile business during the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; occupation, and that the said main portion of the ground floor was occupied by the&nbsp; Central Garage which belonged to the then puppet government. A&nbsp; small&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the&nbsp; groundfloor was occupied by the&nbsp; Manila Food Industry which was owned and&nbsp; operated by&nbsp; the defendant Manila&nbsp; Motor&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; through&nbsp; its&nbsp; president,&nbsp; Mr. Bachrach." It is part of the history&nbsp; of said occupation days that the&nbsp; rentals of all buildings&nbsp; in general were&nbsp; reduced at least to half, and the amount&nbsp; of P125.00 or P175.00 paid monthly by the defendant Manila Motor Co., Inc. must have been accepted by the lessor in full payment&nbsp; of said rentals, not only because&nbsp; the reduction&nbsp; thereof was in consonance with the general policy on rentals then prevailing, but because the lessor was&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; maintain the lessee in its right to occupy without hindrance&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; premises leased to the latter.&nbsp; Anyway, the plaintiffs have not proved that defendant Manila Motor Co.,&nbsp; Inc. and plaintiffs'&nbsp; predecessor in interest, or Mrs. Isabel Salgado de&nbsp; Rohde, agreed that the reduced&nbsp; monthly rental of P125.00 or P175.00 that said defendant continued&nbsp; paying during&nbsp; the Japanese occupation was only in partial satisfaction of the monthly rental stipulated in the contract (Exhibit A), with the understanding that the balance would be fully liquidated after the war.<br><br>It has been stated before that the buildings on the property leased were totally destroyed in the battle for the liberation of Manila in February of 1945,&nbsp; and the next question for Us to pan upon and, decide is whether&nbsp; such destruction caused&nbsp; the&nbsp; termination&nbsp; of the lease.&nbsp; The old Civil Code prescribes: , <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Art. 1543. In the lease&nbsp; of things one of the parties thereto binds himself to give to the other <i>the enjoyment&nbsp; or use of a thing for a definite period and for a certain price"</i>',<br><br>and two of the&nbsp; duties or obligations of the&nbsp; lessor are: <br><br>"2. To make thereon, during the lease, all&nbsp; repairs necessary in order. to keep&nbsp; it in serviceable condition for&nbsp; the purpose for which it was&nbsp; intended;&nbsp; and<br><br>"3. To maintain the lessee in the peaceful&nbsp; enjoyment of the lease during the entire term of the contract."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 1554.)<br></div><br>When the contract of lease (Exhibit A) was entered into between William H. Rohde and the Manila Motor Co., Inc., there were already buildings on the land,&nbsp; and We believe with the trial judge that said defendant would not&nbsp; have entered into the contract were&nbsp; it not for the suitableness of those buildings which&nbsp; it could and&nbsp; did use in&nbsp; its automobile business, and that&nbsp; the conditions of the lease would have been different if there were no such buildings thereon. As the record shows,&nbsp; the reason on the part of the&nbsp; Manila Motor Co., Inc., to&nbsp; enter into that contract on&nbsp; September 1, 1937, was "that&nbsp; these buildings were substantial and&nbsp; the&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; were suitable&nbsp; for the business in which we were going into, selling and repairing automobiles" (t. s. n.&nbsp; p. 908).<br><br>It is true that according to the terms of the contract (Exhibit A), the lessee had the <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span> to make alterations and improvements in the buildings <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span> situated on the above described premises, <span style="font-style: italic;">as it may desire and&nbsp; may replace all or&nbsp; any of&nbsp; said buildings with a new </span>building or buildings&nbsp; of&nbsp; equal&nbsp; or greater value,&nbsp; and that all the repairs and renewals shall be for the&nbsp; account of the leasee which shall&nbsp; keep the premises in reasonable good repair, but these covenants which certainly were made for the benefit of the Manila Motor Co., Inc., do not and could not bind&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease to&nbsp; make any renewals if the. latter did not so desire.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; the&nbsp; repairs and renewals referred to&nbsp; in the contract were those to be carried out <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> the expiration of the term or other determination of the lease, which were to become the property of the lessor,&nbsp; and it certainly would&nbsp; be most&nbsp; unfair to&nbsp; give any other&nbsp; interpretation to the contract, for it would&nbsp; be tantamount&nbsp; to transferring&nbsp; the&nbsp; losses&nbsp; of the owner and the&nbsp; lessor&nbsp; for the&nbsp; destruction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; buildings, which&nbsp; he ' or&nbsp; his successors-in-interest could&nbsp; have&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; from the&nbsp; War Damage&nbsp; Commission, to the shoulders of the lessee&nbsp; that was not at fault in the devastation caused by the ravages of war.&nbsp; If under the obligation "to make all repairs&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; in order to keep the property leased in serviceable condition for the purpose for which it was intended"&nbsp; (Art. 1554, No. 2, of the Civil Code), the lessor cannot, be compelled to rebuild the property destroyed by fortuitous event&nbsp; (Lizarez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hernaez, 40&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 981),&nbsp; We do&nbsp; not&nbsp; see any reason why the lessee&nbsp; could be obliged to make the renewal, replacement&nbsp; or&nbsp; rebuilding: of the improvements for&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefit of&nbsp; the lessor&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; make the lease continue in operation under circumstances&nbsp; that might be disadvantageous to the lessee, when&nbsp; the contract itself left that reconstruction&nbsp; or replacement at&nbsp; the will of the latter.&nbsp; Article 1568 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Civil Code prescribes&nbsp; that:<br><blockquote>"If the thing leased&nbsp; should be lost&nbsp; or either of&nbsp; the contracting parties fails to comply with his undertaking, the provisions of Articles 1182&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1183&nbsp; and of&nbsp; Articles 1101 and 1124 respectively shall&nbsp; be observed,"<br></blockquote>and Article 1182&nbsp; provides that:<br><blockquote>"An obligation which consists in the delivery of a determinate thing shall be extinguished&nbsp; if such&nbsp; thing should be&nbsp; lost or destroyed without fault on the part&nbsp; of the debtor and&nbsp; before he is in default (<i>mora</i>)."<br></blockquote>In this connection&nbsp; appellees' counsel&nbsp; quotes the following&nbsp; from Manresa:&nbsp; "There&nbsp; is no room for doubt that the loss&nbsp; of the thing extinguishes the&nbsp; lease contract * * * " and that "by&nbsp; loss of the thing&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be understood not only its&nbsp; material and&nbsp; complete&nbsp; destruction, but also such essential&nbsp; change of condition or state that renders it&nbsp; unfit&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; being used" (Translation-Appellees' brief, p.&nbsp; 111).&nbsp; Such being the case, We cannot declare that the lower court committed the&nbsp; second1 of the errors assigned to&nbsp; it,&nbsp; and, consequently, the defendant-appellee, the Manila Motor&nbsp; Co., Inc., cannot be held liable for any rents after the liberation of the City of Manila, or from February&nbsp; 1 to November 30, 1945, as pretended by appellees.<br><br>The part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision that suspends the payment of the rental due from the defendant&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Motor Co., Inc.., until the moratorium would be&nbsp; lifted, unless the said defendant waives its right under&nbsp; such&nbsp; law,&nbsp; was in&nbsp; accordance with previous&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of the Supreme Court, but&nbsp; the doctrine&nbsp; has&nbsp; been recently&nbsp; changed (Royal L. Rutter <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Placido 3.&nbsp; Esteban—SC-G.&nbsp; R. L-3708, May 18,&nbsp; 1953, and other decisions that followed), and there is now&nbsp; no reason&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; such&nbsp;&nbsp; suspension.&nbsp; Defendant-appellee&nbsp;&nbsp; Manila&nbsp;&nbsp; Motor Co., Inc. is, therefore, in&nbsp; duty bound to&nbsp; pay the sum of f 175.00 as rental&nbsp; of the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; for the month&nbsp; of January,&nbsp; 1945.&nbsp; Anyway, said defendant in its answer admits its obligation to pay that rental for said month.<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals found that there were buildings on the land when the contract of lease&nbsp; (Exhibit A)&nbsp; was entered into between William H. Rohde and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila Motor Co.,&nbsp; Inc. and that the reason the latter entered into such lease&nbsp; contract was "that these buildings were substantial and the improvements were suitable for the business&nbsp; in which we were&nbsp; going into, selling&nbsp; and&nbsp; repairing automobiles;" and both the trial and appellate Courts are of the opinion&nbsp; '"that said defendant would not have entered into the contract were it not for the suitableness of those buildings which it could and did use in&nbsp; its automobile business, and that the conditions&nbsp; of the lease would have been&nbsp; different&nbsp; if there were no such&nbsp; buildings thereon."<br><br>The destruction of the buildings during&nbsp; the battle for liberation in February 1945 terminated the lease contract. Article 1568 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>If the thing leased should be lost or&nbsp; either of the contracting parties fails&nbsp; to comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; his undertaking, the provisions of Articles 1182 and 1183 and&nbsp; of Articles 1101 and 1124 respectively shall be observed.<br></blockquote>Article .1182&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; Code provides:<br><blockquote> An&nbsp; obligation which consists in the delivery of a determinate thing shall be extinguished if such thing should be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the&nbsp; debtor and before he&nbsp; is in default (<i>mora</i>).</blockquote>The petitioner contends&nbsp; that the destruction&nbsp; of the buildings&nbsp; has not terminated the&nbsp; lease contract because not only the buildings&nbsp; but also the land on which they had been erected formed part of the&nbsp; consideration or <span style="font-style: italic;">causa</span> of&nbsp; the contract of&nbsp; lease.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; buildings&nbsp; and the land constitute an indivisible unit and the&nbsp; destruction of the buildings has extinguished the obligation or terminated the lease contract.&nbsp; The stipulation on the rebuilding of the destroyed improvements is potestative on the part of the lessee.&nbsp; The latter, is not bound to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that in view of the sealing of a&nbsp; large part&nbsp; of the leased premises by&nbsp; the Japanese military forces; occupation of a large part of the ground floor&nbsp; by the Central&nbsp; Garage&nbsp; owned and&nbsp; operated by the then&nbsp; puppet Government, a small part only of the ground floor&nbsp; having been left in&nbsp; possession of the Manila&nbsp; Food Industry which was&nbsp; owned and operated by the Manila Motor Co., Inc.; and&nbsp; the reduction at least to half of the rentals&nbsp; then prevailing, the amount of P125 or P175 paid monthly by the defendant Manila Motor Co., Inc. must have been&nbsp; accepted by the&nbsp; lessor in full payment of the rentals. The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; found "that the monthly rental during the Japanese occupation was reduced by mutual agreement between the lessor&nbsp; and the lessee&nbsp; from P1,100 to P125&nbsp; or P175."&nbsp; On&nbsp; appeal, the Court of Appeals found that "the evidence on record fully justifies the conclusions arrived&nbsp; at by the trial judge as stated in the paragraph preceding the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision quoted above."&nbsp; In view of this agreement the point whether the sealing&nbsp; and&nbsp; occupation of a large part of the leased premises by the Imperial Japanese Army and by the.Central&nbsp; Garage of the Japanese-sponsored Government was just&nbsp; a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; trespass (<i>perturbation de&nbsp; mero&nbsp; hecho</i>)&nbsp; or juridical disturbance (<i>perturbation de derecho</i>) need not be passed upon.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that, with the express consent&nbsp; of William H. Rohde, the lessor, the Manila Motor Co., Inc., the lessee,&nbsp; assigned said lease to the defendant Chartered Bank of India, Australia &amp; China, under the following terms and&nbsp; conditions:<br><ol><li>That this assignment does not carry with it any of the liabilities&nbsp; and obligations&nbsp; undertaken and&nbsp; assumed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila Motor Co., Inc. in said lease; but that the Chartered Bank of India, Australia &amp; China has&nbsp; the option at any time to&nbsp; undertake and assume the said liabilities&nbsp; and obligations upon written notice by registered mail&nbsp; to the lessor, William H. Rohde;<br><br></li><li>That this assignment&nbsp; shall&nbsp; in no way absolve or release the Manila Motor Co.,&nbsp; Inc. from the obligations and liabilities it has contracted in said lease.&nbsp; (Exhibit B.) </li></ol>and that the&nbsp; Bank did not&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; its&nbsp; option to under take and assume&nbsp; the&nbsp; liabilities&nbsp; and obligations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; Motor Co.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that reason&nbsp; the Bank cannot be held liable for any amount&nbsp; of rental allegedly due&nbsp; from and unpaid by the lessee to&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessor or his successor-in- interest.<br><br>Finding&nbsp; no error in&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment under&nbsp; review we affirm it, with costs against&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
