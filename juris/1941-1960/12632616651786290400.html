				<H3>IN  THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR THE SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF THE ESTATE  LEFT BY THE  DECEASED  CARIDAD PEREZ.  BERNANDINO PEREZ,  PETITIONER'  AND APPELLEE, <I>VS.</I> CONRADA PEREZ, ET AL.,  OPPOSITORS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; appeal does not belong here.&nbsp; Involving, as it does, the summary settlement of a testate estate worth P6,000.00 according to petitioner, or P10,000.00 according to oppositors, it should not have been brought directly to this Court from the Iloilo Court of First Instance, inasmuch as several questions of fact are raised in relation&nbsp; with&nbsp; testimonial evidence: for example, the soundness of the mind of&nbsp; the testatrix and her freedom from constraint in signing&nbsp; the will. <br><br>The printed brief makes no assignment&nbsp; expressly challenging the court's jurisdiction; but&nbsp; in discussing their second&nbsp; error, oppositors-appellants insist the lower court did not "acquire jurisdiction to receive the evidence for&nbsp; the allowance of the alleged will" because two&nbsp; heirs (Melanio Perez, Jr. and Milagros Perez) had not been notified in advance of the hearing for the allowance&nbsp; of such will.<br><br>In reply to this, the petitioner-appellee says the persons mentioned were not entitled to notice, since they were not forced heirs—grandnephew and niece—and had not been mentioned as legatees or devisees in the will of the deceased (Manahan <i>vs.</i> Manahan, 58 Phil., 448).&nbsp; And as to Milagros Perez, petitioner&nbsp; asserts that notice had been addressed to her last known residence&nbsp; in this country.<br><br>Thus it appears&nbsp; that such "no notice"&nbsp; argument has no legal foundation.&nbsp; At any rate the omission, if any, did not affect the jurisdiction of the court: it constituted a mere procedural-error that may&nbsp; or may not be the basis of,Reversal (Jocson <i>vs.</i> Nable, 48&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 90). Indeed, this Tribunal has ruled that the court acquires jurisdiction over all persons interested in the estate through the publication of the petition in the&nbsp; newspapers&nbsp; (In re Estate of Johnson, 39 Phil., 159; Joson <i>vs.</i> Nable,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>)—which in this&nbsp; case admittedly&nbsp; took&nbsp; place.<br><br>Service of notice on individual heirs&nbsp; or legatees or&nbsp; devisees&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter of procedural convenience, not jurisdictional requisite&nbsp; (Joson <i>vs.</i> Nable, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>) So much so that even&nbsp; if the names&nbsp; of some&nbsp; legatees or heirs had&nbsp; been omitted from the petition for&nbsp; allowance of the will and therefore were not&nbsp; adviced—the&nbsp; decree allowing the will does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>&nbsp; become void for want&nbsp; of jurisdiction- (Nicholson <i>vs.</i> Leathan, 153 Pacific Reports, 965; Moran, Rules of Court, 1957 Ed., Vol.&nbsp; II, p. 355; see also In re Estate of Johnson, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, and Manalo <i>vs.</i> Paredes, 47 Phil., 938.)<br><br>The result is that the matter&nbsp; of "jurisdiction"&nbsp; discussed by oppositors appears to be so unsubstantial as to furnish no reason to bypass&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals authority to appraise the&nbsp; factual issues in&nbsp; the&nbsp; litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cf.&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Imas, 64 Phil., 419; Uy <i>vs.</i> Villafranca, 64 Phil., 561.) Needless, to add, in fine, the jurisdictional question directly appealable to this Court refers to jurisdiction&nbsp; over the subject matter, not mere jurisdiction over the persons, (Reyes <i>vs.</i> Diaz, 73 Phil., 484;&nbsp; Bernabe <i>vs.</i> Vergara, 73 Phil., 676; Sy Oa <i> vs.</i> Co Ho, 74 Phil., 239.)<br><br>Wherefore, this record will be referred to the Court of Appeals for&nbsp; disposition&nbsp; in accordance with law.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Barrera JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
