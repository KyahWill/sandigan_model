<p>On January 4, 1956, plaintiff A. U. Valencia &amp; Co., a real estate broker, 
filed an action in the Municipal Court of Manila against defendants Herminia C. 
Layug and her husband, Marcial Layug, to recover the sum of P1,510.00, as 
commission for the sale of the property of Herminia to one Lope Yutuc, in 
accordance with a brokerage or exclusive agency contract between the plaintiff 
and Herminia. A copy of the said agency contract was annexed to the complaint. 
Defendants filed an answer with a counterclaim. After hearing, judgment was 
rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P1,510.00 with interest, plus 
P100.00 as attorney's fees, and costs. The defendants appealed to the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, where they filed a motion to dismiss on the ground 
that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. 'The theory behind the 
motion was that the property sold belonged to the conjugal partnership and only 
her husband Marcial Layug, as the administrator thereof, had the authority to 
enter into the agency contract; that Herminia had no such authority, and 
consequently, said agency contract was void. Acting upon the motion, the trial 
court, accepting the theory of the defense, and holding the agency contract to 
be null and void, by order of June 23, 1956, dismissed the complaint, with 
costs. Plaintiff is appealing said order directly to us.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the complaint does it appear that the property in question is 
conjugal property. On the contrary, the agency contract wherein defendant 
Herminia authorized the plaintiff to find a buyer, referred to said property as 
her own. Not only that, but according to the deed of absolute sale of the said 
property, a copy of which is attached to the Memorandum in Lieu of Oral Argument 
filed by plaintiff-appellant, the vendor therein is Herminia. In other words, 
she appears as the owner of the property, and her husband signed the deed only 
to show his marital consent. We therefore find no justification whatsoever for 
the dismissal of the complaint, which to all appearances is sufficient to 
constitute a cause of action or to serve as a basis for granting the relief 
sought by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The complaint was dismissed not on the basis of any evidence adduced by the 
parties or as the result of a trial on the merits because there has been neither 
a trial nor any presentation of evidence, but only a motion to dismiss. If the 
property really belonged to the conjugal partnership, that would be a matter of 
defense for the defendants to prove in a regular trial. The test of the 
sufficiency of facts alleged in the complaint to constitute a cause of action 
is, whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a valid 
verdict in accordance with the prayer of said complaint. (Paminsan vs. Costales, 
28 Phil., 487, 489; Blay vs. Batangas Transportation Co., 80 Phil, 373; De Jesus 
vs. Belarmino, 50 Off. Gaz. No. 7, p. 3064).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order appealed from is set aside and this case 
is hereby remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The defendants 
will pay the costs.</p>
