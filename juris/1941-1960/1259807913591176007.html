				<H3>RIO  Y  COMPANIA   (SUCCESSOR TO  RIO  Y OLABARRIETA), PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ELVIRA MASLOG, ETC., ET AL. DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts&nbsp; of this case may be summarized as follows: On January&nbsp; 15, 1939, Rio y Olabarrieta&nbsp; (predecessor-ininterest of appellant Rio y Compania)&nbsp; and the late Anastacio Manalo, father of the defendant-appellee&nbsp; Elvira Maslog, entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a "Contrato de&nbsp; Servicios&nbsp; Personates" wherein the&nbsp; personal services of Anastacio Manalo were engaged by plaintiff-appellant for the administration and exploitation of its&nbsp; forest concession.&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; contract, plaintiff-appellant was to extend to&nbsp; agent&nbsp; Manalo a credit not exceeding P5,000.00 with interest at&nbsp; 9%&nbsp; per annum. On May&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1941, Anastacio&nbsp; Manalo&nbsp; died intestate at Puerto Princesa, Palawan.&nbsp; Elvira Maslog carried on the account of her late father and made payments thereon up to December&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 1941, the balance of the account stood at P18,614.58 due and owing to&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant.&nbsp; On January 29,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Palawan for the recovery of said amount from Elvira Maslog (joined with her husband) in her&nbsp; capacity as her father's only heir,&nbsp; because through&nbsp; an affidavit of extrajudicial settlement of November 19, 1953 she had adjudicated to herself all the properties&nbsp; of the late Anastacio Manalo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the case was set for hearing, defendants-appellees filed a motion&nbsp; to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that&nbsp; the cause of action has already&nbsp; prescribed. The trial&nbsp; court rendered a decision,&nbsp; holding that the complaint was filed late and consequently dismissed the same. Whereupon the creditor plaintiff appealed to&nbsp; this Court.<br><br>We find it unnecessary to discuss in detail the various errors assigned by plaintiff-appellant for it is apparent that this action has become barred through the laches of appellant company.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that Anastacio Manalo&nbsp; died intestate, and at the time&nbsp; of his death at Puerto Princesa, Palawan, on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1941, he&nbsp; had an outstanding obligation in plaintiff-appellant's favor in&nbsp; the total sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P18,614.58. This&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; being for&nbsp; money and&nbsp; arising&nbsp; from&nbsp; contract, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; survive&nbsp; and&nbsp; should have&nbsp; been&nbsp; filed promptly against&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the deceased debtor&nbsp; (Sees. 2&nbsp; and 5, Rule&nbsp; 87).&nbsp; Plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; aware of the death of Anastacio Manalo on&nbsp; said date, and it&nbsp; is not claimed that Rio y Compania&nbsp; (successor to the&nbsp; original creditor) did not&nbsp; know the existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manalo's obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a creditor, it was appellant's duty to&nbsp; present its claim within a reasonable time after Anastacio Manalo's death in the estate&nbsp; proceedings, and&nbsp; if none were&nbsp; had to file a petition for letters of&nbsp; administration, as&nbsp; authorized by sec.&nbsp; 6(b) of Rule&nbsp; 79.&nbsp; But in&nbsp; spite&nbsp; of&nbsp; the creditor's knowledge of the debtor's death on May&nbsp; 30, 1941&nbsp; and its&nbsp; awareness of&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; obligation, it did not take steps to&nbsp; institute administration proceedings, or collect the debt&nbsp; in question until January 29,&nbsp; 1954, more than&nbsp; 12&nbsp; years from the death of the&nbsp; decedent.<br><br>The law strictly requires the prompt presentation&nbsp; and disposition of claims against the decedent's&nbsp; estate in order to settle the affairs of the estate as soon as possible,&nbsp; pay off&nbsp; its debts and&nbsp; distribute the&nbsp; residue.&nbsp; In the case of Tan Sen Guan&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Ga Siu San,&nbsp; 47 Phil.,&nbsp; 96,&nbsp; this Court held:<br><blockquote>"The purpose of the rule&nbsp; is to settle the affairs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate with dispatch, so that the residue may be&nbsp; delivered to the persons entitled&nbsp; thereto without&nbsp; their being afterwards&nbsp; called upon&nbsp; to respond in actions&nbsp; for claims, which&nbsp; under the ordinary statute of limitations, have not yet&nbsp; prescribed.<br><br>"The purpose of the law in fixing a definite period&nbsp; within which claims against an&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; a deceased person must&nbsp; be&nbsp; presented is to&nbsp; insure a speedy settlement of&nbsp; the estate and the early distribution&nbsp; and&nbsp; delivery of the property to the persons who are legally entitled to&nbsp; receive. The settlement&nbsp; and distribution of the estate of&nbsp; deceased persons&nbsp; should not be unnecessarily delayed by the lethargy and negligence of those who have a direct interest in the same."&nbsp; (In re Estate of Tangco 39 Phil.,&nbsp; 967-968.)<br></blockquote>In consonance with this policy, it has been held that—<br><blockquote>"Where&nbsp; a&nbsp; creditor, knowing of a debtor's death and the fact that no administrator is&nbsp; appointed allows three years&nbsp; to elapse&nbsp; without asking for the appointment of an administrator or institute intestate proceedings in the competent court he is guilty of laches&nbsp; and his claim prescribes."&nbsp; (Sikat <i>vs.</i> Villanueva, 57 Phil., 486; Chuakay &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Oh Tiong Keng's Heirs, 62 Phil., 883; Magbanua <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Akol, 72 Phil., 567).<br><br>"To hold otherwise would he to permit&nbsp; a creditor having knowledge&nbsp; of his&nbsp; debtor's death to keep the latter's estate&nbsp; in&nbsp; suspense indefinitely, by not instituting&nbsp; either testate or intestate&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to present his&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; to the prejudice of the&nbsp; heirs and legatees."&nbsp; (Sikat <i>vs.</i> Vda.&nbsp; de Villanueva, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; fact that the obligation arose&nbsp; from a written contract,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a prescriptive&nbsp; period of ten years is irrelevant to the policy&nbsp; of speedy liquidation&nbsp; of decedent's estates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Moran,&nbsp; has&nbsp; noted that Sec.&nbsp; 5, Rule&nbsp; 87&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; a&nbsp; special limitation that overrides the ordinary rules of&nbsp; prescription :<br><blockquote>"Under this provision, not only claims due, but also&nbsp; claims not due or contingent, should be filed otherwise they are barred forever. So that&nbsp; even where a claim arises upon&nbsp; a written&nbsp; contract&nbsp; and, therefore its&nbsp; period&nbsp; of limitation is ten years, if&nbsp; the debtor&nbsp; dies, such claim should be presented in the estate or intestate proceeding of&nbsp; the deceased debtor within the time1&nbsp; fixed by&nbsp; the court, otherwise it is barred. * * *".&nbsp; (Moran, Commentaries on the Rules of Court Vol. II,&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; ed., p. 436.)<br></blockquote>Nor does the <span style="font-style: italic;">moratorium </span>constitute a good excuse for delaying&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of this appellant's&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the consequent&nbsp; speedy settlement of the&nbsp; debtor's estate&nbsp; and delivery of&nbsp; the&nbsp; net residue "to the persons entitled thereto without their being afterwards called to respond in actions for claims&nbsp; which, under&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; statute of&nbsp; limitations have not yet prescribed." (Moran, Commentaries on the Rules&nbsp; of Court, Vol. II [3rd Ed] p. 400.)<br><br>We have heretofore&nbsp; ruled that—<br><blockquote>"The general objective of&nbsp; the moratorium law,&nbsp; which is rehabilitation of debtors, must give way to the more&nbsp; urgent&nbsp; necessity of settling the estate of a decedent and distributing its residue among his&nbsp; heirs as soon as&nbsp; possible thereby minimizing if not avoiding altogether, expenses of administration."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Jison&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Warner, Barnes &amp; Co.&nbsp; Ltd., 89 Phil., 239; 48 Off. Gaz. No. 9, p. 3873.)<br></blockquote>It appearing that more than&nbsp; 12 years had elapsed from the death of Anastacio&nbsp; Manalo before a&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; was filed&nbsp; to recover the&nbsp; indebtedness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; and without the&nbsp; filing of any&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; the court, the plaintiff-appellant's action is&nbsp; now&nbsp; barred and was correctly dismissed by the&nbsp; court below.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed.&nbsp; Costa against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
