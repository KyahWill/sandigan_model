Upon the above quoted stipulations of facts, the Court of First
Instance of Leyte rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which is—
<blockquote>
  <p> (<em>a</em>) Declarando a los recurrentes Teodulo
Orais, Eulalio Bernades, Dominador Cordoves, Domingo Saligo, Teotimo
Mullet, Ramon Cadavero, David Lim, Nicomedes Conejos, Vedasto Cabales,
Meliton de Gracia, y Margarito Basuga, sin derecho a los cargos de
sargento de la guardia provincial y guardias provinciales ocupados por
los recurridos Isidro Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera,
Narciso Ravago Crisanto Cab, Dalmacio Cortel, Rafael Galleon, Filomeno
Adobas, Jacinto Barro, Tereso Caindoy y Arcadio Maglines y sobreseyendo
su accion.</p>
  <p>      (<em>b</em>) Declarando a los recurrentes
Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte con derecho de continuar en sus cargos como
guardias provinciales y que los nombramientos extendidos a favor de los
recurridos Bienvenido Gonzales y Constancio Acasio son contrarios a la
ley, y ordenando a estos dos ultimos que entreguen sus puestos a los
referidos recurrentes Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte.</p>
  <p>      (<em>c</em>)
Ordenando al tesorero provincial Sr. Melecio Palma, o a su sucesor que
pague los sueldos de los recurrentes Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte desde al
primero de Noviembre de 1950 y mientras dichos recurrentes continuen
desempeñando sus cargos legalmente.</p>
  <p>      (<em>d</em>) Sobreseyendo la accion de los recurrentes Manuel Kangleon y Alfredo Lucin.</p>
  <p>      (<em>e</em>) Absolviendo libremente de la demanda a los recurridos Mamerto S. Ribo y Francisco P. Lopez; y</p>
  <p>      (<em>f</em>) Condenando a los recurrentes, excepcion de Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte, a pagar las costas del juicio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> From this judgment the petitioners, with the exception of Felipe
Enelo and Luis Marte, appealed. Respondents Bienvenido Gonzales and
Constancio Acasio appealed from the decision in so far as the trial
court found them not entitled to the positions claimed by them.</p>
<p> The respondents Isidro Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera
and Narciso Ravago, all civil service eligibles, replaced the
petitioners Teodulo T. Orais, David Lim, Domingo Saligo and Eulalio
Bernades, respectively, who are not civil service eligibles. The rest
of the respondents, not civil service eligibles, replaced the rest of
the petitioners, except Manuel Kangleon and Alfredo Lucin are also not
civil service eligibles. Respondents Bienvenido Gonzales and Constancio
Acasio, not civil service eligibles, replaced Felipe Enelo and Luis
Marte who though not civil service eligibles are veterans.</p>
<p> Petitioners invoke in support of their claim section 682 of the
Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 177
and 281. Said section provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Temporary appointment without examination and
certification by the commissioner of civil service on his local
representative shall not be made to competitive position in any case,
except when the public interests so require, and then only upon the
prior authorization of the Commissioner of Civil Service; and any
temporary appointment so authorized shall continue only for such period
not exceeding three months as may be necessary to make appointment
through certification of eligibles, and in no case shall extend beyond
thirty days from receipt by the chief of the bureau or office of the
Commissioner's certification of eligibles; * * *.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Appointments made under the section are temporary, when the public
interests so require and only upon the prior authorization of the
commissioner of civil service, not to exceed three months and in no
case shall extend beyond thirty days from receipt by the chief of the
bureau or office of the commissioner's certification of eligibles. The
fact that the petitioners held the positions for more than three months
does not make them civil service eligibles. Also the fact that the
acting commissioner of civil service authorized their appointments
"under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code to continue only
until replaced by any eligible" does not make them eligibles. The
holding of a position by a temporary appointee until replaced by an
eligible in disregard of the time limitation of three months is
unauthorized and illegal. The temporary appointment of other
non-eligibles to replace those whose terms have expired is not
prohibited. Hence the replacement of Teodulo T. Orais, David Lim,
Domingo Saligo and Eulalio Bernades, who are non-eligibles, by Isidro
Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera and Narciso Ravago, who are
eligibles, is in accordance with law. The replacement of non-eligibles
by non-eligibles is lawful under the pursuant to section 682 of the
Revised Administrative Code. The replacement of Felipe Enelo and Luis
Marte, non-eligibles but veterans, by Bienvenido Gonzales and
Constancio Acasio, who are no-eligibles, is unlawful. The former are
preferred under Republic Act No. 65, as amended by Republic Act No.
154, they having been appointed within the term provided for in said
Republic Acts. If the preference of a veteran is to be confined to
appointment and promotion only and does not include the right to
continue to hold the position to which he was appointed until an
eligible is certified by the Commissioner of Civil Service, then he
would be in no better situation than a non-eligible who is not a
veteran. The appointment of a veteran, however, is subject to
cancellation or his removal from office or employment must be made by
competent authority when the Commissioner of Civil Service certifies
that there is an eligible.</p>
<p> There is no averment in the petition that the positions held by
Manuel Kangleon and Alfredo Lucin were usurped or that they were
replaced by others in their positions as provincial guards. Hence the
petition in so far as it concerns them must be dismissed.</p>
<p> Republic Act No. 557 is also invoked by the appellants Bienvenido
Gonzales and Constancio Acasio. The act guarantees the tenure of office
of provincial guards and members of city and municipal police who are
eligibles. Non-eligibles like the two appellants do not come under the
protection of the act invoked by them.</p>
<p>    The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>
