				<H3>JOAQUIN GOZUN AND CARMEN VICENCIO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE AUDITOR GENERAL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> By way of petition for review, the petitioners appeal from a 
decision of the Auditor General denying their claim against the Government for 
the sum of P21,924, arising from the following facts:
<p align="justify">In December, 1940, negotiations were begun between the 
Government and the petitioners for the use and occupancy by the former of a 
strip of land belonging to the latter, containing an area of 60.90 hectares, 
which the Government needed to construct and maintain a public dyke from the 
Pampanga River, municipality of Arayat, to the Candaba Swamp, municipality of 
Candaba, province of Pampanga. For such use and occupancy of the land the 
Government offered to pay the petitioners the assessed value, or P500 per 
hectare, while the petitioners asked for P1,000 per hectare. The war 
subsequently broke out without the parties' having reached a final agreement. In 
the meantime the Government went ahead with its project and took possession of 
the land. After the liberation the negotiations to fix the price were resumed, 
and the parties finally reached an agreement which was embodied in a public 
document entitled "Channel and Dyke Right-of-Way Agreement," dated December 31, 
1946, whereby the Government paid to the petitioners, and the latter accepted, 
P60,900 "as damages for the use and occupancy" of the land hereinabove 
mentioned. In other words, the Government finally agreed to pay the price of 
P1,000 per hectare originally asked by the petitioners, and the latter accepted 
it although they had sought to raise the price to P1,500 per hectare on the 
ground that the land had increased in value since 1940.</p>
<p align="justify">After receiving payment of the said sum of P60,900 from the 
Government, the petitioners filed the present claim for P21,924 as interest on 
the said sum of P60,900 for six years at the legal rate of 6% per annum. The 
Auditor General denied said claim on two grounds: first, that the sum of P60,900 
was, according to the agreement above mentioned, in payment of the full 
compensation for the use and occupancy of the land, including whatever damages 
might have been sustained by the petitioners incident to such use and occupancy; 
and, second, that under the law the Government is not liable to pay interest 
unless it expressly engages to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners' appeal is grounded on the argument that to all 
intents and purposes the Government expropriated and took possession of the land 
in December, 1940, and that since it did not pay the price until January, 1947, 
it should pay interest on that price during the intervening period of six years. 
That, we think, is not a valid argument.</p>
<p align="justify">In the first place, the premise is wrong. There was no 
expropriation or condemnation proceeding. What there was, was a voluntary 
agreement between the parties whereby the claim of the petitioners for damages 
arising from the perpetual use and occupancy of their land by the Government was 
fully liquidated as of December 31, 1946, without any reservation as to interest 
or any other further claim by the petitioners against the Government.</p>
<p align="justify">In the second place, even if the premise were correct, the 
conclusion sought to be drawn would not necessarily be so. Even if we should by 
analogy consider the Government's taking possession of the land in 1940 as 
equivalent to taking possession of it through a condemnation proceeding, and the 
agreement between the parties for the payment of P60,900 as equivalent to a 
judgment in an expropriation proceeding, it would not follow that the Government 
is liable to pay interest on said sum. It would be liable to pay interest only 
if the judgment expressly so provided. No such provision was made in the 
agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">We hold that the petitioners are estopped from claiming 
interest by their unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the settlement of 
their claim as embodied in the Right-of-Way Agreement of December 31, 1946.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the Auditor General is affirmed, with 
costs.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason,
