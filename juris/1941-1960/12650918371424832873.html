				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from an&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bulacan&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First instance denying appellant's claim&nbsp; for additional&nbsp; professional fees.<br><blockquote>"The matter before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; said the judge,&nbsp;&nbsp; is the&nbsp; petition dated December 29,&nbsp; 19-54, filed&nbsp; by Atty.&nbsp; Teofilo&nbsp; Sison,&nbsp; asking for allowance&nbsp; and&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; his&nbsp; claim&nbsp; for&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees&nbsp; in the amount of P400,000.00 for services&nbsp; rendered as counsel&nbsp; for respondent-administrator,&nbsp; Federico C.&nbsp; Suntay.<br><br>For a&nbsp; proper understanding of&nbsp; the claimant's claim,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is pertinent to recite the background&nbsp; of this case and the circumstances under "which Mr.&nbsp; Sison came to&nbsp; be engaged as&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for the respondent-administrator.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1934,&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; B. Suntay,&nbsp; a Filipino citizen, died in Amoy,&nbsp; Fokien, China,&nbsp; leaving&nbsp; properties in the&nbsp; Philippines and&nbsp; in China and children in&nbsp; the first marriage had&nbsp; with&nbsp; the deceased Manuela T.&nbsp; Cruz;&nbsp; namely, Apolonio, Concepcion,&nbsp; Angel,&nbsp; Manuel,&nbsp; Federico,&nbsp; Ana,&nbsp;&nbsp; Aurora,&nbsp; Emiliano&nbsp; and Jose, Jr.,&nbsp; and a child named&nbsp; Silvano by the second marriage had with Maria&nbsp; Natividad Lim&nbsp; Billian, who&nbsp; survived the deceased Jose B. Suntay.<br><br>The present intestate estate&nbsp; proceeding was instituted and letters of administration&nbsp; issued to&nbsp; Apolonio Suntay&nbsp; and&nbsp; when&nbsp; the latter died, Federico C. Suntay was appointed administrator of&nbsp; the estate.<br><br>On October 15,&nbsp; 1934, the&nbsp; surviving widow&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in this&nbsp; Court a petition for&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; of a last will and&nbsp; testament claimed&nbsp; to have been executed and signed in&nbsp; the Philippines in&nbsp; November, 1929, by the&nbsp; late Jose R. Suntay.&nbsp; This&nbsp; petition wag denied&nbsp; because of the loss of the&nbsp; said will and insufficiency of evidence to establish its loss.&nbsp; Appeal was taken&nbsp; to the Supreme Court from&nbsp; this&nbsp; order and&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; Court&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; sufficient evidence&nbsp; to prove the loss of the will and&nbsp; the&nbsp; case was remanded, to&nbsp; this Court for further proceedings (63 Phil.&nbsp; 793).&nbsp; The&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; probate was&nbsp; subsequently dismissed by this Court&nbsp; because&nbsp; an&nbsp; attesting" witness who&nbsp; was in China could not come to the Philippines.&nbsp; The war&nbsp; broke out.<br><br>After liberation, Silvino&nbsp; Suntay fifed&nbsp; an&nbsp; alternative petition&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; on June 18, 1947 praying&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate of&nbsp; the will which was allegedly executed by Jose B. Suntay in the Philippines in November, 1929,&nbsp; or of the will allegedly&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; said&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; in Amoy, Fokien, China&nbsp; on January 4,&nbsp; 1931.&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; F, pp. 2-15)&nbsp; Administrator Federico C.&nbsp; Suntay filed a&nbsp; motion thru his lawyers,&nbsp; Attys.&nbsp; Roxas,&nbsp; Picazo and&nbsp; Mejia, asking&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; of this&nbsp; petition&nbsp; oi Silvino&nbsp; Suntay.&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; Federico C, Suntay likewise filed thru his lawyers, Attys.&nbsp; Roxas, Picazo and Mejia,&nbsp; his opposition&nbsp; to Silvino Suntay's&nbsp; alternative&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for probate (Exhibit F, pp. 56-61).<br><br>The&nbsp; alternative petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; probate filed by Silvino Suntay was heard before&nbsp; this Court, the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; commencing&nbsp; on October&nbsp; 13, 1947 and was terminated on March 9, 1948, or almost seven months from its&nbsp; commencement, and in&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearings, administrator Federico C. Suntay&nbsp; was represented by his lawyers, Attys.&nbsp; Roxas, Picazo&nbsp; and Mejia.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing was&nbsp; terminated, the&nbsp; parties filed&nbsp; their respective&nbsp;&nbsp; memorandum.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; memorandum&nbsp; for&nbsp; the respondent-administrator Federico C. Suntay (Exhibit 2)&nbsp; was filed by&nbsp; his&nbsp; lawyers, Attys.&nbsp; Roxas, Picazo&nbsp; and Mejia.<br><br>On April 19, 1948, Judge Peeson issued&nbsp; an order&nbsp; granting&nbsp; the petition of Silvino&nbsp; Suntay (Exhibit&nbsp; F,&nbsp; pp. 75-93).&nbsp; On&nbsp; May 20, 1948, respondent-administrator Federico&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Suntay filed&nbsp; thru&nbsp; his lawyers, Attys.&nbsp; Roxas, Picazo and&nbsp; Mejia, a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration and new trial&nbsp; asking:&nbsp; that the order of April 19, Z948,&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Pecson,&nbsp; be set&nbsp; aside and a new trial&nbsp; had&nbsp; (Exhibit F, pp.&nbsp; 148-222).&nbsp;&nbsp; Written&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; to this&nbsp; petition&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by Atty. Claro M. Recto for&nbsp; Silvino&nbsp; Suntay.<br><br>While the respondent-administrator's&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration and new trial&nbsp; was&nbsp; pending resolution, claimant&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Teofilo Sison was engaged as counsel by&nbsp; said respondent-administrator&nbsp; Federico C.&nbsp; Suntay in&nbsp; substitution&nbsp; of his&nbsp; former&nbsp; lawyers, Attys.&nbsp; Roxas, Picazo&nbsp; and Mejia without any contract&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; his services, the agreement&nbsp; being that claimant would be&nbsp; given&nbsp; a reasonable&nbsp; compensation.&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Sison filed&nbsp; a reply to the opposition of Atty. Recto&nbsp; and appeared and&nbsp; argued orally at&nbsp; the hearing of tho motion for&nbsp; reconsideration and new&nbsp; trial.<br><br>On September 29, 1948,&nbsp; Judge Pecson issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; granting the motion for reconsideration filed on&nbsp; behalf of the respondent- administrator,&nbsp; reconsidering&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; April&nbsp; 19, 1948&nbsp; and denying the alternative petition&nbsp; of&nbsp; Silvino&nbsp; Suntay&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; F, pp.&nbsp; 275-294).&nbsp;&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Recto,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for Silvino&nbsp;&nbsp; Suntay,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of the&nbsp; second&nbsp; order&nbsp; of Judge&nbsp; Pecson and&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Sison&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; simple&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of Mr.&nbsp; Recto was denied&nbsp; and&nbsp; appeal was taken to&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court from the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of Judge&nbsp; Pecson of&nbsp; September&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1948. The&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; brief was filed with the Supreme&nbsp; Court by&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Sison on behalf of the respondent- administrator&nbsp;&nbsp; Federico&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Suntay.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; finally rendered a decision dated&nbsp; July 31, 3954 affirming1 the validity of the order&nbsp; of September&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp; The motion for&nbsp; reconsideration of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp; having been denied, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; became final. Claimant Teofilo Sison had&nbsp; also acted as counsel for the respondent-administrator in the motion filed by Mr. Recto, on&nbsp; behalf of&nbsp; Silvino Suntay,&nbsp; asking for the removal&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent-admmistrator&nbsp; as administrator, and this&nbsp; motion was denied,<br><br>Mr.&nbsp; Sison had&nbsp; further&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; service&nbsp; as counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent-administrator&nbsp; in the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the latter's accounting, in the motion to fix the&nbsp; fees&nbsp; of the administrator and in the&nbsp; motion asking&nbsp; that tho&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; be authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; mortgage this estate&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sum of P150,000.00&nbsp; various times&nbsp; during the period that claimant was&nbsp; respondent-administrator's counsel, he secured from the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; sums amounting&nbsp; to P67,000.00 on account of his services.<br><br>After the termination of the case in the Supreme Court, claimant Mr.&nbsp; Sison&nbsp; made&nbsp; demands&nbsp; on respondent-administrator Federico C Suntay for the&nbsp; payment of his professional&nbsp; fees m the sum of P400,000.00, but&nbsp; the latter refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; this&nbsp; amount&nbsp; alleging that the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; P67,000.00&nbsp; which&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; Mr. Sison&nbsp; had already received from the respondent-administrator as fees is sufficient compensation&nbsp; for claimant's services.&nbsp; In view of the refusal of respond for claimant&nbsp; services.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the refusal of respondent-administrator&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the remaining claim&nbsp; of P333,000.00 as attorney's fees, Mr. Sison filed a petition in this&nbsp; case on December 29, 1954 asking&nbsp; for&nbsp; the annotation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; charging lien&nbsp; and for the allowance and payment of&nbsp; his attorney's fees of P400,000.00."</blockquote>On the basis of the&nbsp; foregoing facts, and. of others to be mentioned,&nbsp; His&nbsp; Honor reached&nbsp; the conclusion that the professional services&nbsp; rendered were not chargeable to the estate *&nbsp; * * and that even if chargeable,&nbsp; the amount of P67,000.00 already received by claimant constituted&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; compensation for&nbsp; his&nbsp; professional services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently he&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim, as&nbsp; already stated.<br><br>In coming to the first conclusion the judge noted&nbsp; that the&nbsp; claimant's&nbsp;&nbsp; work&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; with the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; will or&nbsp; wills&nbsp; did not&nbsp; redound to&nbsp; the&nbsp; protection or benefit of the&nbsp; estate of Suntay, because will or&nbsp; no will the estate continued to be the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; something, however, to&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; argument that the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; had previously agreed in the&nbsp; pretrial&nbsp; conference,<br><blockquote>"That claimant&nbsp; Atty. Teofilo&nbsp; Sison&nbsp; was engaged as counsel for respondent-administrator&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter's capacity&nbsp; as&nbsp; such&nbsp; judicial administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; this intestate estate&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; matters set&nbsp; forth in the motion of said&nbsp; claimant,&nbsp; under the circumstances alleged&nbsp; in said motion, * * *.</blockquote>Anyway,&nbsp; and this&nbsp; is&nbsp; conclusive,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; will had&nbsp; been probated&nbsp;&nbsp; this intestate&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; would&nbsp; have collapsed and&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of the first&nbsp; marriage, instead&nbsp; of sharing in the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; would only&nbsp; divide one&nbsp; third&nbsp; of&nbsp; it among themselves.&nbsp; And although it is true that&nbsp; the rejection of the will&nbsp; was prejudicial to&nbsp; the two heirs&nbsp; who claimed under it, still that is a matter to&nbsp; be considered in apportioning the amount of the professional fees among such heirs—not&nbsp; a&nbsp; reason&nbsp; to&nbsp; deny&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; for services beneficial to the other nine intestate heirs.<br><br>Wherefore on this&nbsp; aspect&nbsp; of&nbsp; the litigation&nbsp; our view&nbsp; is that Atty.&nbsp; Sison rendered legal services&nbsp; for the benefit of the&nbsp; intestate proceedings,&nbsp; and pursuant&nbsp; to his understanding with the administrator should be paid reasonable compensation.<br><br>Courts are agreed that the fixing of such compensation is a difficult and delicate task.<br><br>Section 22 of Rule&nbsp; 127 provides that "an&nbsp; attorney shall be&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to have and recover from&nbsp; his client no more than a reasonable compensation for&nbsp; his&nbsp; services, with a view to the&nbsp; importance of the subject&nbsp; matter of the&nbsp; controversy, the extent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered, and&nbsp; the professional&nbsp; standing" of the&nbsp; attorney."&nbsp; In&nbsp; amplification of such rule this Supreme Court "has held that the&nbsp; following&nbsp; are the circumstances to be&nbsp; considered in&nbsp; determining the compensation of an attorney: (a)&nbsp; the amount and character of the services&nbsp; rendered;&nbsp; (b) the&nbsp; labor, time, and trouble involved; (c) the nature and importance of the&nbsp; litigation or business&nbsp; in which the&nbsp; services were rendered; (d) the responsibility imposed; (e)&nbsp; the amount of money or the value of the&nbsp; property affected by&nbsp; the controversy,&nbsp; or involved in the employment;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) the skill and&nbsp; experience called&nbsp; for in the performance of the services; (g) the professional&nbsp; character&nbsp; and social standing of the attorney;&nbsp; (h) the results&nbsp; secured; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; and whether or not the fee is absolute or&nbsp; contingent, it being a recognized rule that an attorney may properly charge&nbsp; a&nbsp; much larger fee when it&nbsp; is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; contingent than&nbsp; when it is not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup><br><br>According to American Jurisprudence the determination of the attorney's reasonable compensation "depends largely upon the circumstances of&nbsp; the&nbsp; particular case," its importance and results,&nbsp; "the&nbsp; difficulties thereof, the degree of professional skill and ability required&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * the experience and professional standing of the attorney, * * * as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; or&nbsp; value involved&nbsp; or recovered." (5 American Jurisprudence 380)<br><br>We agree with the trial judge that "the&nbsp; claim of the claimant is&nbsp; principally based&nbsp; on his services in connection&nbsp; with the reconsideration and&nbsp; setting aside of the order of Judge Pecson dated April&nbsp; 19, 1948&nbsp; admitting&nbsp; to probate&nbsp; the&nbsp; last&nbsp; will&nbsp; and the recording&nbsp; of the Chinese will&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased Jose B.&nbsp; Suntay and for his services in connection with the&nbsp; appeal taken from the order&nbsp; of Judge Pecson&nbsp; dated&nbsp;&nbsp; September 29,&nbsp; 1948, reconsidering his Honor's&nbsp;&nbsp; order of April 19, 1948 and&nbsp; denying the alternative petition of&nbsp; Silvino&nbsp; Suntay."<br><br>We also&nbsp; agree that claimant&nbsp; "lays&nbsp; stress&nbsp; in having secured&nbsp; the&nbsp; reversal of the order of Judge Pecson dated April 19, 1948, because he alleges that if this order were not reversed, 2/8 of the estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased Jose B. Suntay&nbsp; would have gone&nbsp; to Silvino Suntay and the letter's mother,&nbsp; whereas,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; being declared as having&nbsp; died intestate, the&nbsp; heirs participated equally in the distribution of this estate&nbsp; which would be 1/10 share for each one of the ten children."<br><br>But we cannot agree&nbsp; that&nbsp; the credit for such reversal should go to the&nbsp; former counsel of the administrator in as much&nbsp; as&nbsp; the resolution of Judge&nbsp; Pecson setting&nbsp; aside his previous resolution&nbsp; "is in the&nbsp; main&nbsp; and principally based on the arguments embodied in the motion for reconsideration submitted by&nbsp; said former counsel."&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; denies this; and his assertion is not entirely without foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway it&nbsp; must be admitted that in order properly to&nbsp; improve, develop&nbsp; and sustain such arguments herein petitioner&nbsp; had&nbsp; to undertake&nbsp; the onerous work of wading through the voluminous record of the expediente. And speaking&nbsp; of the&nbsp; arguments, we note that there was oral debate of&nbsp; the motion to reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp; No record exists of&nbsp; what&nbsp; transpired&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet&nbsp; supposing&nbsp; the same points were touched, we must bear in mind&nbsp; that identical arguments acquire different meaning&nbsp; and impact&nbsp; according to the persuasive&nbsp; ability and personal prestige&nbsp; of the lawyer expounding them;&nbsp; and in this connection it&nbsp; should be noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; Teofilo&nbsp; Sison had been a successful&nbsp; practitioner before he became a Governor, a Senator, Secretary of the Interior and Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, not to mention other high positions he now&nbsp; held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup><br><br>We have no&nbsp; doubt that precisely&nbsp; because of those qualifications,&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator sought his&nbsp; services to convince&nbsp; Judge Pecson&nbsp; "to&nbsp; reverse&nbsp; himself"—a&nbsp; task very difficult indeed, partly because judges render&nbsp; their verdicts only after&nbsp; mature&nbsp; deliberation,&nbsp; and partly because of the natural human&nbsp; reluctance to admit one's error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>It may be added that such a&nbsp; task appeared to be doubly difficult by the opposition of the winning&nbsp; side,&nbsp; represented by&nbsp; the brilliant and&nbsp;&nbsp; successful&nbsp; lawyer&nbsp; Claro M.&nbsp; Recto, among whose&nbsp; many qualifications&nbsp; may be mentioned his having worthily&nbsp; occupied a seat in this&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court.<br><br>The legal controversy and appellant's services continued on&nbsp; appeal, arguments were&nbsp; amplified and&nbsp; elaborated in the&nbsp; appellant's brief&nbsp; of&nbsp; 104 pages,&nbsp; and&nbsp; appellee's brief of 237 pages&nbsp; both&nbsp; referring to&nbsp; a Record on&nbsp; Appeal of 384&nbsp; pages. Printed memoranda were&nbsp; later submitted.<br><br>The complexity and number of&nbsp; the issues is attested by the fact that we had to meet in not less than four sessions&nbsp; to&nbsp; arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; a&nbsp; solution; with&nbsp; dissenting opinions at that.<br><br>Having had before&nbsp; us the expediente,&nbsp; we can say that the&nbsp; case for the administrator in opposition to the will had been&nbsp; competently handled by herein claimant.&nbsp; That he has been helped by&nbsp; an assistant in his office,&nbsp; cannot in any way reduce the compensation he&nbsp; is entitled to receive&nbsp; from&nbsp; his&nbsp; client;&nbsp; he has&nbsp; paid such&nbsp; assistant.&nbsp; He was not expected to&nbsp; do everything&nbsp; personally;&nbsp; he could employ his&nbsp; assistants&nbsp; to do research for him, under his supervision&nbsp; and responsibility.&nbsp; The general does&nbsp; not&nbsp; do the fighting: he directs and supervises.&nbsp; Yet nobody denies him credit for the victory won in battle.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; generally&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; in determining: what would be reasonable compensation for the&nbsp; attorney for&nbsp; an&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; or executor, the size&nbsp; and&nbsp; value&nbsp; of the decedent's estate&nbsp; should&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">4</sup>&nbsp; But the&nbsp; services performed&nbsp; should be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5</sup><br><br>The value of the properties involved in the estate, says appellant, is four million pesos&nbsp; (P4,000,000.00).&nbsp; Therefore, he&nbsp; concludes&nbsp; "at 10%&nbsp; my attorney's fee should&nbsp; be P400.000.00&nbsp; from which P67,000.00 may be deducted; and that entitles me to demand, as I demand P833,000.00&nbsp; additional&nbsp; fees."&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; introduced the testimony of Marcelo Balatbat, a real&nbsp; estate expert native of Hagonoy, Bulacan, whose itemized statement&nbsp; of his appraisal of the intestate assets reads as follows:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="84%">28 hectares of riceland in Hagonoy, Bulacan, at Hagonoy, Bulacan a hectare (t.s.n. pp. 37-64, April 16, 1955)</td><td valign="bottom" width="16%"><div align="right">P84,000.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>11 hectares of Canaveral land in Hagonoy, Bulacan, at 2,000.00.00 per hectare (t.s.n. p. 56 April 16, 1965)</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">22,000.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>666 hectares of fishpond in Hagonoy, Bulacan, at P5,000.00 a hectare (t.s.n. pp. 34, 37, 41, 45, 54, April 16, 1955)</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">3,830,000.09</div></td></tr><tr><td>652.7 square meters of valuable commercial lands at Sto.

These were not mentioned in the appealed decision.&nbsp; Balatbat appraised the lot in Sto.

Suntay should be assessed roughly at P3,695,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; immaterial that this claimant had stated in various pleadings that this estate was worth one million.&nbsp; He explained, quite plausibly, that he simply repeated information received from the administrator and/or statements made in the case before his connection&nbsp; therewith.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; the price at which some heirs disposed of&nbsp; their shares&nbsp; may not&nbsp; be taken as the basis of computation, because the sales had taken place during the war emergency in 1942 or were affected by the uncertainties resulting from the pending contest of the wills.<br><br>Hence, for the purpose of computing the claimant's compensation, we could say that the litigation or the intestate involved over three million and a half&nbsp; pesos, or that his services&nbsp; to the intestate prevented the&nbsp; loss to it of two-thirds of such amount&nbsp; (P2,462,000.00).<br><br>The appellant insists&nbsp; on 10% of the value of the estate, relying principally on Quintillan vs. Degala, 50 O. G. 5305 wherein&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court approved payment&nbsp; of P50,000.00&nbsp; for professional services in opposing&nbsp; two wills concerning an estate of half&nbsp; a million pesos.&nbsp; But&nbsp; there was a contract for contingent fees: 30 % if successful, none if unsuccessful.
