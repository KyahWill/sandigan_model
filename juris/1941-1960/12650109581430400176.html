				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the general elections held on November 13, 1951, Luis C. Orbiso and 
Paulino Tumakay were registered candidates for the office of vice mayor of the 
municipality of Medellin, province of Cebu. The board of municipal canvassers 
declared Orbiso elected with 875 votes as against his opponent Tumakay with 769 
votes. In due time, Tumakay filed an election protest against Orbiso before the 
Court of First Instance of Cebu. This time the court found Tumakay as the one 
duly elected with 751 votes over Orbiso who obtained 694 votes. The protestee 
has now taken this appeal on the plea that the only questions he will raise are 
purely of law.
<p>While this case was pending appeal in this Court, appellee filed a motion to 
dismiss on the main ground that under the provisions of section 178 of Republic 
Act No. 180, known as Revised Election Code, no appeal can be taken from a 
decision of the lower court in protests involving the position of vice mayor 
and, hence,—he contends—this Court cannot now entertain the present appeal. 
Action on this motion was however deferred until after the briefs had been filed 
in order that it may be taken up in the decision on the merits. We now declare 
that said motion has no merit under the doctrine laid down in Marquez 
<em>vs</em>. Prodigalidad, G.R. No. L-2098 and Calano <em>vs</em>. Cruz, G.R. 
No. L-6404, it appearing that the questions to be determined are purely of 
law.</p>
<p>On the side of the political faction of appellant Orbiso in the general 
elections held on November 13, 1951 there was a candidate for councilor by tha 
name of Patricio Tumayao. The lower court found that in the five precincts of 
the municipality where he was a candidate, Tumayao was voted by many with his 
surname accompanied by different Christian names, nicknames and other 
appellations which, in the opinion of the court, clearly indicate an intention 
on the part of the voters to identify their ballots. And so the court found them 
to be marked and declared them invalid. These ballots number around 186.</p>
<p>Appellant now poses this question: "In those cases where Tumayao, who was a 
candidate, is voted, accompanied by names other than his, is the whole ballot or 
only the votes in his favor nullified?" It is appellant's theory that only the 
vote in favor of said candidate should be nullified considering the provisions 
of paragraph 9 of section 149 of the Revised Election Code. But the lower court 
found otherwise and this is now assigned as error.</p>
<p>The law invoked by appellant provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"9. The use of nicknames and appellations of affection and friend-ship, if 
accompanied by the name or surname of the candidate, does not annul such vote, 
except when they were used as a means to identify their respective 
voters."</p></blockquote>
<p>A perusal of the above provisions would at first glance indicate that the use 
of a nickname or appellation in the name or surname of a candidate when made as 
a means to identify the voter has the effect of annulling only the vote cast for 
said candidate and not the whole ballot because of the phrase "does not annul 
such vote" employed therein, and that this inference seems to be bolstered up by 
the other paragraphs of the same article which expressly refer to the ballot 
when speaking of the nullifying effect of the irregularity committed by the 
voter. But a more careful scrutiny of the provisions of paragraph 9 as compared 
with the rest gives us the reason why in said paragraph the word "vote" is used 
instead of "ballot", to wit, that in said paragraph the identifying mark is 
written on the very name of the candidate whereas in the other cases the mark or 
irregularity is committed on the ballot itself. Moreover, the provisions of 
section 149, which contain merely the general rules for the appreciation of the 
ballots for the guidance of the inspectors, must yield to the specific 
provisions of the law relative to the effect of a mark placed by the voter on 
the ballot. We refer to section 146 of the same Code which provides that the 
board of inspectors shall "determine whether there are any marked ballots, and, 
if any be found, they shall be placed in a package labelled 'Marked Ballots for 
National Offices' or 'Marked Ballots for Local Offices' as the case may be, * * 
* and <em>shall not be counted</em>" These provisions contain a mandate to the 
inspectors that marked ballots must be placed in a sealed envelope and should 
not foe counted. The logical inference is that the mark has the effect of 
nullifying the whole ballot.</p>
<p>The philosophy underlying this provision is undoubtedly to protect and 
maintain the secrecy of the ballot whicfy is the cardinal feature of our 
election law, and in order that this fundamental purpose may be fully achieved 
Congress took special care in providing that any person who "puts (on the 
ballot) any distinctive mark" or who "makes use of any other means to identify 
the vote of the voter" may be amenable to crinimal prosecution (section 135, in 
connection with section 183, Revised Election Code).</p>
<p>Indeed, "the statute making invalid any ballot containing any mark or device 
enabling it to be identified, is designed to prevent a voter from giving 
information to some interested person as to the way in which he voted" 
(Mansfield <em>vs</em>. Scully, 29 A. 2d 444, 129 Conn. 494). The interpretation 
which appellant wants lis to adopt in considering these ballots would defeat 
this fundamental purpose. We find no valid reason for such interpretation 
because a voter who marks his ballot forfeits his right to vote. His vote 
becomes null not only for one but for all the candidates.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from being in accordance with law, is hereby affirmed, 
with costs against appellants</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
