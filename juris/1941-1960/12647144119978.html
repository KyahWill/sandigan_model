				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  May 17,  1945, Vito Borromeo executed  a testament naming therein Jose H. Junquera as executor.   On March 13,  1952, Vito Borromeo  died  in Paranaque,  Rizal,  and on April 21, 1952,  Junquera filed in the Court of First Instance  of  Cebu  a petition for the probate of said  will praying that, during  the  pendency of its probate,  he be appointed a special administrator of the estate upon his filing of a bond in the amount to be fixed by the court. On June 14, 1952, the court appointed Junquera as special administrator upon his filing a bond of P2,000 and ordered that letters of administration be issued to him.</p>
<p>Crispin Borromeo and Teofilo Borromeo filed separately an opposition to  the petition for the probate of the will. On January 2, 1953, said oppositors filed a motion for the removal of Junquera as special administrator on the ground that he  failed  to submit an  inventory of the estate as required by law as well as to deposit either  in the bank or with  the  clerk of court all  the income of the estate and  by his conduct he may be considered as  having neglected his duties as such administrator.  On February 20, 1953, Junquera filed his opposition to the motion explaining that the reason why  he failed  to file the inventory  and report as required by law is that all the papers or  documents  relative to  the estate are in the possession of one Tomas  L.  Borromeo, who  was residing in Manila,  and who owns one-half of  the conjugal  properties of  the deceased by virtue of a deed of donation executed by the latter ia his favor and who, together  with the other  heirs, claim possession  of the other half of said properties by virtue of an agreement entered into with the deceased. And if he was not able to submit a report of the income of the estate, it was because he failed to collect its rentala due  to the opposition of Tomas L.  Borromeo, Fortunato borromeo  and Amelia  Borromeo who are  all heirs instituted  in the will subject of probate.  But on the same date, February 20, 1953,  Junquera  finally submitted  an inventory  of the  estate and  a report of the income as required by law.</p>
<p>After due hearing, the court granted the motion removing Junquera as special administrator and ordering the parties to submit a list of persons from whom the court may select for  appointment   as the  new  special administrator.  On appeal taken by Junquera, the Court of Appeals  certified the appeal to this Court on the ground that it comes within its jurisdiction  under  section  17  (5) of Republic  Act No. 296.                                </p>
<p>Section 4, Rule 82, of the Rules of Court provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Sec. 4. <em>Bond  of special administrator.</em>â€”A special administrator before entering upon the duties of his trust shall give a bond, in such sum as the court directs, conditioned that  he will make and return a true inventory of the goods, chattels, rights,  credits, and estate of the deceased which come to his possession  or knowledge, and that he will truly account for such as are received by him when required by the court, and  will deliver the same  to the person appointed executor or administrator; or to such other person as  may  be authorized  to receive them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears from the above  that a  special administrator before entering upon his duties shall  give a bond conditioned "that he will make and return  a true inventory  of the  goods, chattels,  rights,  credits,  and  estate  of  the deceased which come to his possession or knowledge,  and that he will truly account for such as are received by him when, required by  the court."  Has  Junquera  complied with this  duty?</p>
<p>It appears that he was appointed as special administrator on June 14, 1952  after filing a bond in the amount of P2,000.   He assumed office since then and yet until the motion for his removal which was filed  on January 2, 1953, or a period of approximately seven months, he appears not to have  taken any step to determine the  property,  real or personal, belonging to the estate and much less has filed an inventory thereof with the  court as required  by law. While the  above-quoted rule (section 4, Rule 82) does not fix any period within  which he is required to submit an inventory of the estate, it cannot be denied that such duty has  to be performed within  a reasonable  period, if not as soon  as practicable, in  order  to preserve the estate and  protect the  heirs  of the  deceased.  Such is inferred from section 2 of Rule 81 wherein  it is  provided that a special  administrator  "shall  collect  and  take charge  of the  goods,  chattels,  rights,  credits,  and  estate  of  the deceased and  preserve  the  same for the executor or  administrator afterwards  (to be) appointed" for only in that manner can we satisfy the real purpose for which the office of a special administrator is  provided for.  If such were not the case we would be  opening the  door to the commission of irregularities or  other  mischiefs  which may redound to the  detriment of  the  estate and  of the  heirs entitled to its distribution.  It is for this reason that  the law provides for his  removal in case  he fails to perform "a duty expressly provided by these  rules"  or "becomes insane,  or <em>otherwise  incapable or unsuitable  to discharge the trust</em> (section 2, Rule 83).   (Italics supplied.)  And if, as found  by  the  trial judge, Junquera "have not even attempted, much less done any substantial  performance of any  of  (his) commitments", it is evident that he  has proved  to be  unworthy of  his trust.</p>
<p>His claim that he  has not  been able  to submit earlier an inventory  of the  estate  because the  papers and  documents  relative thereto  were  in the possession of one of the heirs who was in Manila  and claims to be the owner of  one-half of the conjugal  properties,  is too flimsy to justify  the long delay he has incurred in the  submission of the  requisite inventory.  Neither  can  the  opposition to his  taking possession of the properties coming  from some of the heirs  of  the deceased justify his inaction  for in such a  predicament his duty  is to  inform  the  court of such opposition in  order  that the latter may  give whatever advice may be necessary to preserve  the  estate and protect  the interest of the heirs.  But no such  action was taken,  and what is more, there is  an intimation that  the special administrator  has never been allowed by the legatees of the will, who apparently  are in actual possession of  the estate,  to take possession thereof, nor to  collect  its rentals, for which reason the  account  submitted by him at the last hour appears to be unsatisfactory.  Even the  inventory he submitted  suffers from  a  substantial  deficieny for,  as pointed out by the oppositors, many properties belonging to the deceased have not been included therein.</p>
<p>It is true that Junquera is the one named by the testator as the executor of his will  but such designation cannot give him any preference or advantage until  after the will is admitted to  probate.  This claim can only be  asserted after the will has been admitted to probate for such is "a precious prerogative of a testator,  a necessary concomitant of his  right to dispose  of his property  in the manner he wishes" (Ozaeta vs. Pecson,  49 Off. Gaz., No. 7, 2805).</p>
<p>The  rule  is that "The appointment  and  removal of a special administrator lies entirely in the sound discretion of the court, *  *  *.  The sufficiency of any ground for removal should  thus  be determined by the court,  whose sensibilities are, in the first  place, affected by any  act or omission on the part of  the administrator  not conformable to or in disregard of the rules or  the  orders  of the court" (Moran,  Comments on the  Rules of Court, Vol. II, 1925 ed,,  pp. 405-406,  and  cases  cited therein).   Considering the circumstances of this case, we find no plausible reason to interfere with the action taken by the trial court in removing appellant as special administrator.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the  order appealed  from  is affirmed,  without costs.</p>
