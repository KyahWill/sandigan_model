				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals, affirming that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Davao dismissing&nbsp; her complaint&nbsp; for recovery of land, Conchita&nbsp; Liguez has resorted&nbsp; to this Court,&nbsp; praying that the&nbsp; aforesaid decision be reversed on points of law.&nbsp; We granted certiorari on October 9,&nbsp; 1956.<br><br>The&nbsp; case began upon complaint filed by petitioner-appellant against the widow and heirs of the late Salvador P.&nbsp; Lopez to recover&nbsp; a parcel of 51.84 hectares&nbsp; of land, situated in&nbsp; Barrio Bogac-Linot, of the municipality of Mati, Province of Davao.&nbsp; Plaintiff averred to be its legal owner, pursuant to a deed of donation of said land, executed in her favor by the late owner, Salvador P. Lopez,&nbsp; on 18 May 1943.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defense interposed was that the donation was null and void for having an illicit <span style="font-style: italic;">causa</span> or consideration, which was&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; entering into marital relations with Salvador P. Lopez, a married&nbsp; man; and that the property had been adjudicated to the&nbsp; appellees as&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Lopez by the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; since&nbsp; 1949.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the deed of donation was prepared by the Justice of the Peace of Mati,&nbsp; Davao, before whom it was signed and ratified on the date&nbsp; aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time, appellant Liguez&nbsp; was&nbsp; a minor, only 16&nbsp; years' of age.&nbsp; While the&nbsp; deed recites—<br><br>"That the&nbsp; DONOR, Salvador P. Lopez, for and in consideration of his Jove&nbsp; and&nbsp; affection&nbsp; for the&nbsp; said DONEE,&nbsp; Conchita Liguez, and also for the good and valuable&nbsp; services rendered to&nbsp; the DONOR by the DONEE, docs by these presents, voluntarily give, grant and donate to the said donee, etc."&nbsp; (Paragraph 2, Exhibit "A") the Court of Appeals found that when the donation was made, Lopez had been living with the parents of appellant for barely a month; that the&nbsp; donation&nbsp; was made in view of the desire of Salvador P. Lopez, a man of mature years, to have sexual relations with appellant Conchita Liguez; that Lopez&nbsp; had confessed to his love for appellant to the instrumental witnesses, with the&nbsp; remark that her parents would&nbsp; not&nbsp; allow Lopez to live&nbsp; with her&nbsp; unless he first donated the land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question;&nbsp; that&nbsp; after the donation, Conchita Liguez and Salvador P. Lopez lived together in the house&nbsp; that was built upon the latter's orders,&nbsp; until Lopez&nbsp; was&nbsp; killed on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1st, 1943,&nbsp; by some&nbsp; guerrillas who believed him to be pro-Japanese.<br><br>It was also ascertained by the Court of Appeals that the donated land originally belonged to the conjugal&nbsp; partnership of Salvador P. Lopez and his wife, Maria Ngo;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; had&nbsp; met&nbsp; and&nbsp; berated Conchita for&nbsp; living maritally&nbsp; with&nbsp; her husband,&nbsp; sometime&nbsp; during&nbsp; June of 1943; that the widow&nbsp; and children of Lopez&nbsp; were in&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of the land and made improvements thereon;&nbsp; that the land was&nbsp; assessed in the tax rolls first&nbsp; in the name of Lopez&nbsp; and&nbsp; later in that of&nbsp; his widow;&nbsp; and that the deed of donation was&nbsp; never recorded.<br><br>Upon these facts, the Court of Appeals held that the deed of donation was&nbsp; inoperative,&nbsp; and null&nbsp; and void&nbsp; (1) because the husband,&nbsp; Lopez, had no right to donate&nbsp; conjugal property to the&nbsp; plaintiff appellant;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2) because the donation was tainted with illegal&nbsp; <i>causa</i> or consideration, of which donor and donee were participants.<br><br>Appellant vigorously contends that the Court&nbsp; of First Instance as well&nbsp; as the Court of Appeals erred in holding the donation void for&nbsp; having an illicit <i>causa </i>or consideration.&nbsp; It is argued that under Article 1274 of the Civil Code of 1889&nbsp; (which was the governing law in 1943, when the donation was executed),&nbsp; "in contracts of pure beneficence&nbsp; the&nbsp; consideration is the&nbsp; liberality of&nbsp; the donor", and that liberality <i>per se</i> can never be illegal, since&nbsp; it is neither against law or morals&nbsp; or public policy.<br><br>The flaw in this argument lies in ignoring that under Article&nbsp; 1274, liberality of the donor is deemed <span style="font-style: italic;">causa</span>&nbsp; only in&nbsp; those&nbsp; contracts that are of&nbsp; "<i>pure</i>"&nbsp; beneficence;&nbsp; that is to say, contracts&nbsp; designed&nbsp; solely&nbsp; and&nbsp; exclusively to procure the welfare of the beneficiary, without any intent of&nbsp; producing&nbsp; any&nbsp; satisfaction for the donor; contracts, in other words, in which the idea of self-interest is totally absent on the part of the transferor. For this very reason, the same Article 1274 provides that in <i>remuneratory</i>&nbsp; con- tracts, the consideration is the <i>service</i>&nbsp; or <i>benefit</i> for which the&nbsp; remuneration&nbsp; is&nbsp; given;&nbsp; causa is&nbsp; not&nbsp; liberality in these cases because&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; or&nbsp; conveyance is&nbsp; not made out of pure&nbsp; beneficence, but "<i>solvendi animo</i>."&nbsp; In consonance with this view, this Supreme Court in Philippine Long Distance&nbsp; Co. vs. Jeturian<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> G. B. L-7756,&nbsp; July 30,&nbsp; 1955, like the&nbsp; Supreme Court of Spain in its decision of&nbsp; 16 Feb. 1899, has ruled that bonuses granted to employees to excite their zeal and efficiency, with consequent 'benefit for the employer, do not constitute donation having liberality for a consideration.<br><br>Here the facts as&nbsp; found by the Court of Appeals (and which we can not vary) demonstrate that in&nbsp; making the donation&nbsp; in question, the late&nbsp; Salvador&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Lopez was not moved exclusively by the&nbsp; desire to benefit&nbsp; appellant Conchita Liguez, but also to secure her&nbsp; cohabiting, with him, so&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; could&nbsp; gratify&nbsp; his sexual impulses.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is clear from the&nbsp; confession&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lopez to the witnesses Rodriguez and Ragay,&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was in love with appellant, but her parents would&nbsp; not agree&nbsp; unless he&nbsp; donated the land in question to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, therefore, the donation was but one part of&nbsp; an onerous transaction (at least with appellant's parents)&nbsp; that&nbsp; must be&nbsp; viewed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its totality. Thus considered, the conveyance was clearly predicated upon an illicit <i>causa</i>.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; seeks to differentiate between&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged liberality&nbsp; of Lopez, as <i>causa</i> for the donation in her&nbsp; favor, and his&nbsp; desire&nbsp; for cohabiting&nbsp; with appellant, as <i>motives</i> that impelled him to make the donation, and&nbsp; quotes from Manresa&nbsp; and the&nbsp; jurisprudence of this&nbsp; Court on&nbsp; the distinction that must be&nbsp; maintained between <i>causa</i> and motives (De Jesus vs. Urrutia and&nbsp; Co., 33 Phil. 171).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well to note, however,&nbsp; that Manresa himself&nbsp; (Vol.&nbsp; 8, pp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 641-642), while&nbsp; maintaining the&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; and upholding the imperativeness of&nbsp; the motives&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties to determine the validity of the contract, expressly excepts from the rule those&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; that&nbsp; are&nbsp; conditioned&nbsp; upon the attainment of the motives of either party. <br><blockquote>"* * * distincion&nbsp; importantisimii,&nbsp;&nbsp; que impide&nbsp; amilar el contrato por&nbsp; la sola iniluencia de los motivos <i>a no ser que se hubiera subordlnado al cumplimiento de estos como condiciones</i> la eficaeia de aquel."</blockquote>The same view is held by the Supreme Court of Spain, in its decisions of February&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1941,&nbsp; and&nbsp; December 4, 1946, holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; motive may be regarded&nbsp; as <i>causa </i>when it predetermines the purpose of the contract.<br><br>In the present case, it is scarsely disputable that Lopez would not&nbsp; have conveyed&nbsp; the&nbsp; property in&nbsp; question&nbsp; had he known that appellant would refuse to cohabit with him; so that the cohabitation was an implied condition to the donation, and&nbsp; being&nbsp; unlawful,&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; tainted&nbsp; the donation itself.<br><br>The Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; rejected&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; claim on the basis of the well-known rule "in pari delicto&nbsp; non oritur actio" as embodied&nbsp; in Article 1306 of the&nbsp; Code of 1889&nbsp; (reproduced in Article 1412 of the new Civil Code)&nbsp; :<br><blockquote>"ART. 1412. If the act in which the unlawful or forbidden cause consists does&nbsp; riot constitute a&nbsp; criminal offense, the&nbsp; following rules shall be observed: <br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; When the fault is on the part&nbsp; of both contracting parties, neither may recover what ho has given by virtue of the contract, or demand the performance of&nbsp; the other's undertaking; <br>(2)&nbsp; When&nbsp; only one of the contracting parties is at&nbsp; fault, he cannot recover what&nbsp; he has&nbsp; given by reason&nbsp; of the contract, or ask for&nbsp; fulfillment of what&nbsp; has been promised&nbsp; him.&nbsp; The other, who is not at fault, may demand the return of what he has given without any obligation to comply with&nbsp; his promise."</blockquote></blockquote>In our opinion, the Court of Appeals&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; applying to the present case the <i>pari delicto</i>&nbsp; rule.&nbsp; First,&nbsp; because it can not be said&nbsp; that both parties here had equal guilt when we consider that as against the deceased Salvador P, Lopez, who&nbsp; was a man&nbsp; advanced in years and mature experience, the appellant was a mere minor, 16&nbsp; years of age, when the donation was made; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no finding made by the Court of Appeals&nbsp; that&nbsp; she was&nbsp; fully aware of the terms of the bargain entered&nbsp; into by&nbsp; and between Lopez and her parents; that her acceptance&nbsp; in the deed of donation&nbsp; (which was authorized by Article 626 of the old Civil&nbsp; Code)&nbsp; did not necessarily imply knowledge of conditions and terms&nbsp; not set forth therein;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the substance&nbsp; of the testimony&nbsp; of the instrumental&nbsp; witnesses is that it was the appellant's&nbsp; parents who insisted on the donation&nbsp; before allowing her to&nbsp; live with&nbsp; Lopez.&nbsp; These facts&nbsp; are&nbsp; more suggestive&nbsp; of&nbsp; seduction than of immoral bargaining&nbsp; on the part of appellant.&nbsp; It must&nbsp; not&nbsp; be forgotten that illegality is not presumed, but must be duly and adequately proved.<br><br>In the&nbsp; second place, the&nbsp; rule that parties to&nbsp; an illegal contract,&nbsp; if equally guilty,&nbsp; will not be&nbsp; aided by the law but will both be left where&nbsp; it&nbsp; finds them, has been interpreted by&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; as barring the party&nbsp; from pleading the illegality of the bargain&nbsp; either as a&nbsp; cause,&nbsp; of action or&nbsp; as&nbsp; a defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Memo auditor proprian&nbsp; turpitudinem allegans</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said this Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; Perez vs. Herranz,&nbsp; 7&nbsp; Phil. 695-696:<br><blockquote>"It is unnecessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine whether a vessel&nbsp; fox&nbsp; which a certificate and license have&nbsp; been fraudulently&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; incurs forfeiture under these or&nbsp; any other provisions of this act.&nbsp; It is enough for this case that the statute&nbsp; prohibits such an arrangement&nbsp; as that between&nbsp; the plaintiff and&nbsp; defendant so as to&nbsp; render illegal both the arrangement itself and all contracts between&nbsp; the parties growing out of it.<br><br>It does not, however,&nbsp; follow&nbsp; that the plaintiff can&nbsp; succeed&nbsp; in this action.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two answers to his claim&nbsp; as urged in&nbsp; his brief.&nbsp; It is a familiar principle&nbsp; that the courts&nbsp; will not aid either party to enforce&nbsp; an&nbsp; illegal contract, but&nbsp; will&nbsp; leave&nbsp; them&nbsp; both where it finds them; but where&nbsp; the plaintiff can establish a&nbsp; cause of action without exposing&nbsp; its&nbsp; illegality,&nbsp; the vice does not&nbsp; affect his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; recover.&nbsp; The American authorities cited by the plaintiff;. fully&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; this doctrine.&nbsp; The&nbsp; principle applies&nbsp; equally&nbsp; to a defense.&nbsp; The law in&nbsp; those Islands&nbsp; applicable to the case&nbsp; is&nbsp; found in article&nbsp; 1305 of the Civil Code,&nbsp; shutting out&nbsp; from relief either of the&nbsp; two&nbsp; guilty parties to an&nbsp; illegal or vicious contract.<br><br>In the case at bar the plaintiff&nbsp; could establish <i>prima facie</i>&nbsp; his sole&nbsp; ownership by the bill of sale&nbsp; from Smith, Bell &amp; Co. and&nbsp; the official&nbsp; registration. The defendant, on his part, might overthrow this title by proof through a certain subsequent&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; between him and the plaintiff, dated March 16, 1902, that they had become owners&nbsp; in common of the vessel, the agreement&nbsp; not disclosing&nbsp; the illegal&nbsp; motive for placing the formal&nbsp; title in the plaintiff.&nbsp; Such an&nbsp; ownership is&nbsp; not&nbsp; in itself&nbsp; prohibited, for&nbsp; the United States courts recognize the equitable&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; a vessel as against the holder&nbsp; of a&nbsp; legal&nbsp; title,&nbsp; where the&nbsp; arrangement&nbsp; is not one in fraud&nbsp; of the law.&nbsp; (Weston vs.&nbsp; Penniman,&nbsp; Federal Case 17455; Scudder us. Calais Steamboat Company, Federal&nbsp; Case 12566.)<br><br>On this proof, the defendant being a part&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of the vessel, would have defeated the action for its&nbsp; exclusive possession by the plaintiff.&nbsp; The burden would then be east upon the plaintiff to show the illegality of&nbsp; the arrangement,&nbsp; which under the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; cited ho would not be allowed to&nbsp; do."</blockquote>The rule&nbsp; was reaffirmed&nbsp; in&nbsp; Lima vs.&nbsp; Lim Chu&nbsp; Kao, 51 Phil. 477.<br><br>The situation confronting us is&nbsp; exactly analogous.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant&nbsp; seeks recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; land&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; the strength of a donation regular on&nbsp; its face.&nbsp; To defeat its effect, the&nbsp; appellees must plead and&nbsp; prove that the same is illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp; But such plea on the part of the&nbsp; Lopez heirs is not receivable,&nbsp; since Lopez&nbsp; himself, if living, would be barred from setting up&nbsp; that&nbsp; plea; and his heirs, as&nbsp; his privies and&nbsp; successors&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; can have&nbsp; no better rights than Lopez himself.<br><br>Appellees, as successors&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; late&nbsp; donor",&nbsp; being thus precluded&nbsp; from pleading&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; immorality or illegal <span style="font-style: italic;">causa</span> of the donation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; total&nbsp; or partial ineffectiveness of&nbsp; the same must be decided by&nbsp; different legal principles.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; regard,&nbsp; the Court of Appeals correctly held that Lopez could not donate the&nbsp; entirety&nbsp; of the property in litigation,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; prejudice&nbsp; of&nbsp; his wife&nbsp; Maria Ngo, because&nbsp; said&nbsp; property&nbsp; was conjugal in&nbsp; character,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; right&nbsp; of the husband&nbsp; to&nbsp; donate&nbsp; community property is strictly limited&nbsp; by law (Civil&nbsp; Code of 1889, Arts. 1409, 1415, 1413;&nbsp; Baello vs. Villanueva, 54 Phil. 213).<br><blockquote>"ART. 1409. The conjugal partnership shall also be chargeable with anything&nbsp; which&nbsp; may have been&nbsp; given or promised&nbsp; by the husband alone to the children born of the marriage in order&nbsp; to obtain employment&nbsp; for&nbsp; them or&nbsp; give&nbsp; them a profession or by both spouses by common&nbsp; consent,&nbsp; should&nbsp; they not have 'Stipulated&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; expenditures should be borne&nbsp; in&nbsp; whole or in part by&nbsp; the separate property of one&nbsp; of them."<br><br>"ART. 1415. The husband&nbsp; may&nbsp; dispose of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property of&nbsp; the conjugal partnership&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purposes mentioned in Article 1409."<br><br>"ART. 1413. In addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; powers as&nbsp; manager&nbsp; the husband may for a valuable consideration alienate and&nbsp; encumber the property of the&nbsp; conjugal partnership without the consent of the wife."</blockquote>The text&nbsp; of the&nbsp; articles&nbsp; makes it plain that the donation made&nbsp; by the husband in contravention of law&nbsp; is not void in its entirety,&nbsp; but&nbsp; only&nbsp; in&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as it prejudices the interest of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; this regard,&nbsp; as&nbsp; Manresa&nbsp; points out&nbsp; (Commentaries,&nbsp; 5th&nbsp; Ed.,&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 650-651,&nbsp; 652-653), the law&nbsp; makes&nbsp;&nbsp; no&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; between&nbsp; gratuitous transfers and&nbsp; conveyances for a consideration.<br><br>"Puede la&nbsp; mujer como&nbsp; proprietaria hacer&nbsp; aimlar las donaciones aun durante el matrimonio?&nbsp; Esta es, en suma, la cuestion, reducida a dctcrminar&nbsp; si la&nbsp; distinta naturaleza entre los actos a titulo&nbsp; oneroso y los actos a&nbsp; tftulo lucrative, y sus espcciales&nbsp; y diversas eireunstan- cias,&nbsp; pueden&nbsp; motivar&nbsp; una solucion" diferente&nbsp; en&nbsp; cuanto a la epoca en que la muj er he&nbsp; de&nbsp; reelamar&nbsp; y obtener la&nbsp; nulidad del&nbsp; acto; cuestian quc&nbsp; no deja de&nbsp; ser&nbsp; interesantisima.<br><blockquote>El&nbsp; Codigo,&nbsp; a pesar&nbsp; de&nbsp; la variacion que ha&nbsp; introducido en&nbsp; el prooycoto do&nbsp; 1851, poniendo&nbsp; corooosegundo parrafo&nbsp; del&nbsp; articulo 1.413, como&nbsp; limitation de las enajenaciones u obligaciones a tftulo oneroso, lo que&nbsp; era&nbsp; una&nbsp; Iimitaci6n general de todos&nbsp; los actos del marido, muestra,&nbsp; sin&nbsp; embargo, que no ha variado&nbsp; de criterio, y que&nbsp; para el las&nbsp; donaciones&nbsp; deben&nbsp; en todo equipararse&nbsp; a cualquier otro acto ilegal o fraudulento de caructer oneroso,&nbsp; al decir en el art. 1.419: 'Tambicn&nbsp; se&nbsp; traera a colacion' en&nbsp; el inventario&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; sociedad—el importe de&nbsp; las dotiacio7ies y enajenaciones&nbsp; que&nbsp; deban&nbsp; considerarse ilcgales o fraudulentas, con sujecion al art.&nbsp; 1.413.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Debio tambien citarse&nbsp; cl artieulo&nbsp; 1.415, que es el&nbsp; que habla&nbsp; de donaeiones.)"<br><br>"En rcsumen:&nbsp; el marido solo puede donar los&nbsp; bienes gananciales dentro de los&nbsp; limites&nbsp; marcados en&nbsp; el art.&nbsp; 1.415.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin embargo, solo la mujer&nbsp; o&nbsp; sus hercderos pueden&nbsp; reelamar&nbsp; contra la&nbsp; valides de la donacion,&nbsp; pues solo en su interes&nbsp; se establece&nbsp; la&nbsp; prohibicion.&nbsp; La mujer o sus herederos, para poder dejar sin efecto&nbsp; el acto,&nbsp; han&nbsp; de sufrir verdadero perjuicio, entendiendose que no&nbsp; le hay hasta,&nbsp; tanto que, terminada por cualquier&nbsp; causa la&nbsp; sociedad&nbsp; de gananciales, y hecha&nbsp; su liquidacion,&nbsp; no&nbsp; pueda imputarse lo&nbsp; donado al habcr por cualquier concepto del marido,&nbsp; m obtener&nbsp; en su&nbsp; consccucncia&nbsp; ]a mujer&nbsp; la&nbsp; dibida&nbsp; indemniKacion.&nbsp;&nbsp; La&nbsp; donacion&nbsp;&nbsp; reviste por tanto legalmente, una eficaeia condicional, y en armonia con esto caracter, deben fijarse&nbsp; log efeetos&nbsp; de la&nbsp; misma con&nbsp; relacion a los adquirentes y&nbsp; a los terceros&nbsp; poseedores,&nbsp; leniendo,&nbsp; en.&nbsp; su caso, en&nbsp; cuenta&nbsp; lo dispueato en la Icy Hipotecaria.&nbsp; Para prevenir todo perjuicio, puede la mujer,&nbsp; durante&nbsp; el matrimonio inmediatamente al acto, haeer constar ante los&nbsp; Tribunales su existencia y soicitar meclidas&nbsp; de precaucion, como&nbsp; ya se ha dicho. Para&nbsp; evitarlo en lo&nbsp; sucesivo, y cuando las eircunstancias lo rcquieran, puede instar la declaration do prodigalidad."</blockquote>To determine the prejudice to the widow,&nbsp; it must&nbsp; be shown that the&nbsp; value of her share in&nbsp; the property donated can not be paid out of&nbsp; the husband's share of the community&nbsp; profits.&nbsp; The&nbsp; requisite&nbsp; data,&nbsp; however, are not available&nbsp; to us and necessitate a&nbsp; remand of the records&nbsp; to the&nbsp; court of origin that&nbsp; settled the&nbsp; estate of the late Salvador&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Lopez.<br><br>The situation of the children and forced heirs of Lopez approximates that&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; privies of their parent, they&nbsp; are&nbsp; barred from invoking&nbsp; the illegality&nbsp; of the&nbsp; donation.&nbsp; But&nbsp; their right&nbsp; to a&nbsp; legitime out&nbsp; of his estate is not thereby affected,&nbsp; since the legitime is granted them by the law itself, over and above the wishes&nbsp; of the deceased.&nbsp; Hence, the forced heirs are entitled to have the donation&nbsp; set aside in so far as <i>inofficious:&nbsp; i.e</i>., in excess&nbsp; of the&nbsp; portion of free&nbsp; disposal (Civil Code of 1889, Articles 636, 654), computed as provided in Articles 818 and 819, and&nbsp; bearing in&nbsp; mind that&nbsp; "collationable&nbsp; gifts"&nbsp; under Article 818 should include gifts made not only in favor&nbsp; of the forced heirs, but even those made&nbsp; in favor of strangers, as decided by the Supreme Court of Spain in its decisions of 4 May 1899&nbsp; and&nbsp; 16 June 1902.&nbsp; So that in computing the&nbsp; legitimes, the <i>value</i> of the property donated to herein appellant, Conchita&nbsp; Liguez,&nbsp; should be&nbsp; considered part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; donor's estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again,&nbsp; only the&nbsp; court&nbsp; of&nbsp; origin has&nbsp; the requisite&nbsp; date&nbsp; to determine whether the donation is&nbsp; inofficious or&nbsp; not.<br><br>With regard to the improvements in the land in question, the same&nbsp; should be governed by the rules of accession and possession in good faith, it being undisputed that the&nbsp; widow and&nbsp; heirs of Lopez were unaware of the donation in favor of the appellant when the improvements were made.<br><br>The appellees, relying on Galion vs. Garayes, 53 Phil. 43, contend that by her failure to appear at the liquidation proceedings of the estate of Salvador P.&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp; in July 1943, the appellant has forfeited her&nbsp; right to&nbsp; uphold the donation if the prejudice to the widow Maria Ngo resulting from the donation could be made good out of the husband's share in the conjugal&nbsp; profits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is also argued that appellant was guilty of laches in failing to enforce her rights as. donee until 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; This line&nbsp; of argument overlooks the capital fact that in 1943, appellant was still a minor of sixteen; and she did not reach the age of majority until 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, her&nbsp; action&nbsp; in 1951&nbsp; was only delayed three years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor could&nbsp; she be properly expected to intervene in the settlement of the estate&nbsp; of Lopez: first, because she was a&nbsp; minor&nbsp; during the&nbsp; great&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; proceedings; second, because she was not given notice thereof; and third, because the donation did&nbsp; not make her&nbsp; a creditor of the estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; we&nbsp; have ruled in&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Olbes, 15&nbsp; Phil. 547-548:<br><blockquote>"The <i>prima facie</i> donation&nbsp; <i>inter vivos</i> and its&nbsp; acceptance by the donees having been proved by means of a public instrument, and the&nbsp; donor having been duly notified&nbsp; of said acceptance,&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract is perfect and obligatory&nbsp; and it is perfectly in.&nbsp; order to demand its fulfillment, unless an exception is proved whicn is based&nbsp; on some legal reason opportunely alleged by the&nbsp; donor or her heirg.<br><br>So long&nbsp; as the&nbsp; donation&nbsp; in question&nbsp; has&nbsp; not been judicially proved&nbsp; and&nbsp; declared&nbsp; to be&nbsp; null,&nbsp; inefficacious,&nbsp; or&nbsp; irregular, the land donated is of the absolute ownership of the&nbsp; donees and consequently,&nbsp; does not form a part of thre property of&nbsp; the estate of the deceased&nbsp; Martina, Lopez; wherefore the action&nbsp; instituted demanding'&nbsp; compliance with&nbsp; the contract,&nbsp; the&nbsp; delivery by&nbsp; the deforciant of the land donated,&nbsp; or that&nbsp; it be prohibited to&nbsp; disturb the right of the donees, should&nbsp; not be considered as incidental to the probate proceedings aforementioned."</blockquote>The ease&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gallon vs.&nbsp; Gayares,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>, is not in point. First, because that case involved a <i>simulated</i> transfer that can have no effect,&nbsp; while a donation with illegal <i>causa</i> may produce&nbsp; effects&nbsp; under&nbsp; certain&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; where the parties&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; of equal guilt; and&nbsp; again, because the transferee&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Gallon&nbsp;&nbsp; case&nbsp; took the property&nbsp; subject to <i>lis pendens</i>&nbsp; notice,&nbsp; that in&nbsp; this case does not exist.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the&nbsp; decisions appealed from are reversed and&nbsp; set aside,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the appellant Conchita Liguez declared&nbsp; entitled to so&nbsp; much of the donated property&nbsp; as&nbsp; may be found, upon&nbsp; proper liquidation,&nbsp; not&nbsp; to prejudice the share&nbsp; of&nbsp; the widow Maria Ngo in the conjugal&nbsp; partnership with Salvador P. Lopez or the Iegitimes of the forced heirs of the latter.&nbsp; The records are ordered remanded&nbsp; to the court of origin for further&nbsp; proceedings in accordance with this opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against appellees.
