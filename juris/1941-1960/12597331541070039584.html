				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal&nbsp; by certiorari&nbsp; against a decision of the Court of Industrial Relations ordering the&nbsp; petitioner to reinstate&nbsp; Luis Mabagos to his former&nbsp; position as&nbsp; warehouseman or any equipment&nbsp; position,&nbsp; with&nbsp; back wages from January&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; until reinstatement,&nbsp; at P3.000 per annum.<br><br>Luis&nbsp; Mabagos&nbsp;&nbsp; started&nbsp; working in the service&nbsp; of the Government&nbsp; in 1918.&nbsp; He had three&nbsp; civil&nbsp; service eligibilities, third grade, second grade&nbsp; and typist.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1937 he transferred&nbsp; to the Naric.&nbsp; He served in said&nbsp; Government corporation&nbsp; in various capacities,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; as&nbsp; provincial inspector, district inspector,&nbsp; branch&nbsp; manager,&nbsp; provincial buyer and cashier,&nbsp; warehouseman, and&nbsp; lastly supervisor of all Narie&nbsp; warehouses in Manila. According&nbsp; to the records he was an&nbsp; efficient employee.&nbsp; In July, 1948, he was suspended because he was&nbsp; implicated in&nbsp; a case of&nbsp; theft in a warehouse under his supervision.&nbsp; The case was not finished until 1950,&nbsp; when he was acquitted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; his acquittal,&nbsp; he&nbsp; demanded his&nbsp; reinstatement and&nbsp; the payment of his back wages.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was paid back wages&nbsp; until&nbsp; December 31,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; but the&nbsp; reinstatement was denied on&nbsp; the ground that his position had been abolished.&nbsp; He&nbsp; sought the&nbsp; payment of his gratuity under the Osmena&nbsp; Retirement Act, but this was also denied. So his union&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; these proceedings for his reinstatement and for the payment of his back salary from January 1, 1950&nbsp; until, he&nbsp; is&nbsp; actually&nbsp; reinstated.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations found that his separation was without just cause and granted the&nbsp; petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nark appealed from this&nbsp; decision.<br><br>It is claimed that the decision directly contravenes Executive Order No.&nbsp; 350, Series of 1950, which provides in part:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * *; <i>Provided, further,</i> That the personnel of said corporations hereby transferred&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; reappointed in the PRISCO and<i> those not reappointed within sixty (60) days from, the&nbsp; effective date of this Order shall be&nbsp; considered separated&nbsp; from the service"'</i>&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>It is argued that as Mabagos was&nbsp; not&nbsp; reappointed within 60 days&nbsp; from&nbsp; October 3,&nbsp; 1950 he should&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered separated from the service&nbsp; in accordance with the abovequoted provision.<br><br>In order to decide&nbsp; the issue presented,&nbsp; it seems pertinent and relevant to determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; status of Mabagos as an employee&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of his suspension.&nbsp; The suspension must have been ordered by the head of the Naric by virtue&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 694 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code, which provides:<br><blockquote>"* * *. With the approval of&nbsp; the proper head of&nbsp; department, the chief of a bureau or office may likewise suspend any subordinate or employee in his bureau or under his authority pending an investigation, if the charge against such subordinate or employee involves dishonesty, oppression, or grave misconduct&nbsp; or neglect&nbsp; in&nbsp; the performance&nbsp; of duty."<br></blockquote>He&nbsp; was&nbsp; implicated in the charge of theft,&nbsp; which&nbsp; implies dishonesty. As he was merely suspended from office pending&nbsp; determination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal charge, there&nbsp; was&nbsp; a temporary cessation of his duties, not a removal, dismissal or permanent separation from service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspension means temporary withdrawal or separation, as distinguished from removal&nbsp; or dismissal,&nbsp; which&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; to permanent separation.<br><blockquote>"Word 'suspend' is defined&nbsp; as to cause&nbsp; to&nbsp; cease&nbsp; for a&nbsp; time. Derrick <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> City of Vallejo, 40 P. 2d H&amp;,-951, 4 Cal. App. 2d. 25".

Gaz.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6, pp.&nbsp; 2290, 3399.<br><blockquote>"Having proven&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; (the&nbsp; plaintiff had been&nbsp; suspended and dismissed&nbsp; without'&nbsp; cause, contrary to the express provision of&nbsp; the Constitution, his reinstatement becomes a plain&nbsp; ministerial duty of the Auditor General, a duty whose&nbsp; performance may be&nbsp; controlled and enjoined by mandamus.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no room for discretion.&nbsp; The Auditor General is not being&nbsp; directed&nbsp; to perform an act which he may or may not execute according&nbsp; to his discretion.&nbsp; He is being asked and enjoined to redress a grievance, to right a wrong.&nbsp; And the payment of the back salary is merely incidental to and follows reinstatement,&nbsp; this, aside from the parallel and&nbsp; analogy which may be found in section 200, paragraph&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code which&nbsp; provides&nbsp; for.the payment&nbsp; of back&nbsp; salary upon reinstatement<br></blockquote>The import of section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code and of the ruling&nbsp; herein above-quoted, which direct the payment&nbsp; of back salaries of a suspended employee, is that&nbsp; the position is not vacated by the incumbent or suppressed&nbsp; by reason of the&nbsp; suspension.&nbsp; The legal provision requiring payment of salaries during the suspension implies the continuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; position&nbsp; during the said suspension;&nbsp; the salaries&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; position during the time of suspension can&nbsp; not be ordered paid if the position is&nbsp; suppressed or eliminated.&nbsp; The argument of the petitioner that Mabagos was no longer in the employ of the Naric upon the approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; Executive Order No. 350, s.&nbsp; 1950, by reason of the suspension, is therefore incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The position was still&nbsp; in&nbsp; existence, with&nbsp; the salary corresponding thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspension merely&nbsp; operated to prevent Mabagos from exercising the duties and prerogatives pertaining to his office,&nbsp; not his&nbsp; removal&nbsp; or dismissal therefrom.&nbsp; The petitioner should have retained the position of Mabagos during&nbsp; the suspension, to await the result of the charges brought against him.&nbsp; The petitioner had&nbsp; no right to abolish the suspended employee's position, or to give it permanently to another during&nbsp; the pendency of the case against the&nbsp; employee.<br><br>It is to be noted that the principle we have explained above, to the effect that Mabagos should be&nbsp; returned to his position upon his exoneration, is applicable to officials and employees belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Service.&nbsp; But&nbsp; these rights and privileges have also been extended to employees in Government-owned&nbsp; or controlled corporations, such as the&nbsp; Naric, by virtue of Executive Order&nbsp; No. 399, s.&nbsp; 1951, section 14, which provides:<br><blockquote>"All officers and employees of the corporation shall be subject to the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations,&nbsp; except those&nbsp; whose positions may, upon recommendation of the&nbsp; Board of Directors and the&nbsp; Administrator of&nbsp; Economic&nbsp; Coordination,&nbsp; be&nbsp; declared by&nbsp; the President of the Philippines as policy-determining, primarily confidential or technical in nature."<br></blockquote>Section 6 of Executive&nbsp; Order No. 319,&nbsp; s. 1950, is also to the same effect.<br><br>"The officers and employees&nbsp; of the department of&nbsp; Economic Coordination and of the different corporations and agencies,&nbsp; under it may hereafter&nbsp; be employed shall&nbsp; be subject,&nbsp; in&nbsp; all respects to the application&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil Service rules and&nbsp; regulations, as in the case of the other officers and&nbsp; employees&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Government."&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1 of the above Order (Executive Order&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 319) includes the Narie among&nbsp; the government corporations&nbsp; under the supervision&nbsp; of the Department of Economic Coordination.<br><br>The petitioner also contends that&nbsp; as Mabagos was under suspension at the time&nbsp; of the merger&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Naric into the Prisco,&nbsp; and as he&nbsp; was not reappointed within sixty days&nbsp; from the said merger, he should be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as permanently separated from the service&nbsp; (section 12, Executive Order&nbsp; No. 350, s.&nbsp; 1950).&nbsp; The&nbsp; argument fails&nbsp; to consider the directive contained in the Executive Order which in effect is&nbsp; as follows: "<i>Provided, further,</i> that the personnel of said corporations hereby transferred <i>shall be reappointed in the PRISCO."</i>&nbsp; Mabagos was a personnel of the Naric at the time of the promulgation of said Order. In&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the directive&nbsp; Mabagos should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; reappointed.&nbsp; The failure of petitioner&nbsp; to comply with the order&nbsp; is without justifiable reason because it was found out that the suspension was&nbsp; illegal and unjust.<br><br>Another defense submitted by the petitioner is the supposed fact that the position of Mabagos&nbsp; had been abolished or given to&nbsp; some&nbsp; other&nbsp; employee of the Naric.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to conceive that the position of Mabagos held&nbsp; by him at the time of the merger could have been suppressed. The maintenance of warehouses is&nbsp; an inherent&nbsp; and indispensable activity of the Naric.&nbsp; The Naric would&nbsp; find it impossible to comply with its' duties and functions without warehouses.&nbsp; If Mabagos could not be appointed&nbsp; to the position of supervisor because this&nbsp; position was abolished, he could hold that of actual warehouseman wherever&nbsp; such warehouse of the Naric may be situated.&nbsp; In any ease, as pointed out above, the Naric should have kept the position open&nbsp; for&nbsp; Mabagos&nbsp; when the&nbsp; latter's case was&nbsp; terminated by the dismissal of the charges against him.<br><br>For the foregoing&nbsp; considerations,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of the Court of Industrial Relations appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.
