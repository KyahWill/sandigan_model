				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; from an order of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Ilocos Sur, dismissing the information for homicide filed against the accused Alfredo Araquel&nbsp; on the ground of double jeopardy.<br><br>The record shows that on January 30, 1955, the acting chief&nbsp; of police of Narvacan,&nbsp; Ilocos Sur, filed&nbsp; with the justice of the peace court of that municipality a complaint for&nbsp; homicide against Alfredo Araquel&nbsp; accusing him of having hacked and killed Alberto Pagadian with&nbsp; a bolo. More than a year and a&nbsp; half later, or on July 3, 1956, while said complaint,&nbsp; for reasons not&nbsp; stated, was still pending in the justice of the peace court, the&nbsp; chief of police of Narvacan moved for the amendment thereof, alleging that upon reinvestigation of the facts he found that the crime committed by the accused was not homicide as charged in the original complaint but that of homicide under exceptional circumstances&nbsp; as provided for in article 247 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding the motion to be well taken, the justice of the peace court, on July 16,&nbsp; allowed the filing of the amended complaint which charged the accused with."the crime of HOMICIDE UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES defined and punished under Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code."&nbsp; That same day, the accused was&nbsp; arraigned under the amended complaint.&nbsp; And as he entered a plea of "guilty", the justice of the peace court, also&nbsp; on that same day, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>for a period of one year to any place not within the radius of at least 25 kilometers&nbsp; from the municipal building of Narvacan,&nbsp; Ilocos Sur.<br><br>During the service of the&nbsp; sentence by the accused, the acting Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos Sur was&nbsp; informed of the case through the Department of Justice to which the private&nbsp; prosecutor had lodged a&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; And after conducting an investigation, the said acting provincial fiscal, on February 16, 1957, filed with the Court of First Instance of the province an information against the accused Alfredo Araquel&nbsp; charging him with homicide as defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code for the killing of Alberto Pagadian.<br><br>On July 9,1957, the accused moved to quash the information&nbsp; on the ground of double jeopardy, invoking the previous charge&nbsp; against him for homicide under exceptional circumstances and the subsequent&nbsp; sentence passed upon him by the justice of the Peace Court of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur.&nbsp; The fiscal opposed the motion, but the trial court, in its order of July 18, 1957, sustained the plea of double jeopardy&nbsp; and&nbsp; dismissed the information.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; this appeal.<br><br>The plea of jeopardy made by the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; was, to our minds, erroneously sustained by the&nbsp; lower court.<br><br>&nbsp;In order that&nbsp; a defendant may legally be placed in jeopardy, one of the necessary and indispensable conditions is that he should have been tried before a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 9, Rule 113, Rules of&nbsp; Court.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The court below,&nbsp; in&nbsp; upholding&nbsp; the plea&nbsp; of double&nbsp; jeopardy, held that the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, had jurisdiction&nbsp; to take cognizance of the complaint for "homicide&nbsp; under exceptional circumstances&nbsp; defined and punished under Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code," on the theory that "the act defined" in that article "is&nbsp; a felony" which is penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro&nbsp; </span>and,&nbsp; consequently, falls under the jurisdiction of the inferior court, following the ruling laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; in the case of Uy&nbsp; Chin Hua <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Dinglasan, et al.,&nbsp; (86 Phil., 617; 47 Off. Gaz. No.&nbsp; 12, Supp., p. 233).<br><br>There can of course be no question that, under the rule enunciated in the case of Uy Chin Hua <i>vs.</i> Dinglasan et al., supra, offenses&nbsp; penalized&nbsp; with&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro&nbsp; </span>fall&nbsp; under&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the justice of the peace and&nbsp;&nbsp; municipal courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">See </span>also De los&nbsp; Angeles&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; People,&nbsp; 103Phil., 295.)&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; rule, however, cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; made to apply&nbsp; to the&nbsp; present case, for it&nbsp; is&nbsp; apparent&nbsp; that Article 247&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code does&nbsp; not&nbsp; define a crime distinct and separate from homicide, parricide, or murder, as the case may be, depending, in so far as those crimes are concerned,&nbsp; upon the relationship of the victim to the killer and the manner by which the killing&nbsp; is committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The article in question&nbsp; reads: <br><blockquote>"Art. 247. <span style="font-style: italic;">Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances.</span>-Any legally&nbsp; married person&nbsp; who, having surprised his spouse in the act of&nbsp; committing sexual&nbsp; intercouse with another person, shall kill any of them or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter,&nbsp; or shall inflict upon them any&nbsp; serious physical injuries,&nbsp; shall suffer the penalty&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>. <br><br>"If he shall&nbsp; inflict upon them physical injuries of any other kind, he shall be exempt from punishment. <br><br>"These rules shall be&nbsp; applicable, under the same circumstances, to parents with respect to their daughters under eighteen years of age, and their seducers,&nbsp; while the&nbsp; daughters are living with&nbsp; their parents.<br><br>"Any person who shall promote&nbsp; or facilitate the prostitution of his&nbsp; wife or daughter, or shall otherwise&nbsp; have consented&nbsp; to&nbsp; the infidelity of the other spouse, shall&nbsp; not be entitled to the benefits of this article."<br></blockquote>This article is found under&nbsp; Section One of Chapter&nbsp; One, Title Eight of Book Two of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Title Eight&nbsp; refers to Crimes against Persons, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chapter One</span> is entitled Destruction to Life and Section One thereof treats of the crimes of parricide, murder and homicide.<br><br>As&nbsp; may readily be seen from its provisions and its place in the Code,the above-quoted article, far from defining a felony, merely provides or grants a privilege or benefit— amounting practically to an exemption from an adequate punishment—to a legally&nbsp; married person&nbsp; or parent who shall surprise his spouse or daughter in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another, and shall kill any or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter, or shall inflict upon them any serious&nbsp; physical injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in case of death or serious physical injuries,&nbsp; considering the enormous&nbsp; provocation&nbsp; and his&nbsp; righteous&nbsp; indignation, the accused—who would otherwise be criminally liable for the crime of&nbsp; homicide, parricide, murder, or serious physical injury, as the case may&nbsp; be—is&nbsp; punished only&nbsp; with <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>.&nbsp; This&nbsp; penalty is mere banishment&nbsp; and, as held in a case, is intended more for the protection of the accused than&nbsp; a punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People .<i>vs.</i> Coricor, 79 Phil., 672.) And&nbsp; where physical injuries&nbsp; other than&nbsp; serious are&nbsp; inflicted, the offender&nbsp; is exempted&nbsp; from&nbsp; punishment.&nbsp; In effect, therefore, Article&nbsp; 247, or the&nbsp; exceptional circumstances mentioned therein, amount to an exempting circumstance, for even where death or serious physical injuries is inflicted, the penalty is so greatly lowered as to result to no punishment&nbsp; at all. A&nbsp; different&nbsp; interpretation,&nbsp; i. e., that&nbsp; it defines and penalizes a&nbsp; distinct crime, would&nbsp; make the exceptional circumstances which practically exempt the accused from criminal liability&nbsp; integral elements of&nbsp; the offense, and thereby compel&nbsp; the prosecuting officer to plead, and,&nbsp; incidentally, admit them, in the information.&nbsp; Such an interpretation would be&nbsp; illogical if not absurd, since a mitigating and much less an exempting circumstance cannot be&nbsp; an integral element of the crime charged.&nbsp; Only "acts or omissions ... constituting the offense"' should be pleaded in a complaint or information, and a circumstance which mitigates criminal liability or exempts the&nbsp; accused therefrom, not being&nbsp; an essential element of the offense charged—but&nbsp; a matter of defense that must be&nbsp; proved to the satisfaction of the court—need not be pleaded.&nbsp; (Sec. 5, Rule 106, Rules of Court; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Campo, 23 Phil., 368.)<br><br>That the article in question defines no crime is made more manifest when we consider that its counterpart in the old Penal Code (Article 423) was found under the General Provisions&nbsp; (Chapter VIII) of Title VIII covering crimes against persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; There can, we think, hardly be any dispute&nbsp; that as part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the general provisions, it&nbsp; could not have&nbsp; possibly provided for a&nbsp; distinct and separate crime.<br><br>We also&nbsp; note&nbsp; that under&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 296, the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and&nbsp; municipal courts,&nbsp; as enlarged, extends only to "assaults&nbsp; where the intent to kill is not charged or evident at the trial."&nbsp; (Section 87[c]).&nbsp; A.<span style="font-style: italic;">fortiori</span>, where the intent to kill&nbsp; is evident—as in&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; under the exceptional circumstances provided in&nbsp; Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code—the case must necessarily fall beyond the jurisdiction of the inferior courts.&nbsp; An&nbsp; absurd situation would, indeed,&nbsp; be created&nbsp; if the justice of the peace courts could exercise jurisdiction over a case involving an actual killing, when they lack jurisdiction to try even a case of slight physical injury where the intent to kill was evident.&nbsp; Such could not have been the intendment of the law.<br><br>It may&nbsp; not be amiss to state here that&nbsp; the killing under exceptional circumstances&nbsp; under both the old (Art. 423) and Revised Penal Code (Art. 247) had invariably been tried before the Courts of First Instance under an information charging&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; with either homicide,&nbsp; parricide, or murder.&nbsp; (See U. S. <i>vs.</i> Vargas, et al., 2 Phil,, 194; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Melchor,&nbsp; 2 Phil., 588; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Posoc, et al., 10&nbsp; Phil., 711; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Alano, 32 Phil., 381;&nbsp; U./S. <i>vs.</i> Verzola, 33 Phil., 285; People <i>vs.</i> Loata, 46 Phil., 392; People <i>vs.</i> Bituanan, 56 Phil., 23;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Zamora de Cortez, 59&nbsp; Phil., 568; People <i>vs.</i> Gonzales, 69 Phil., 66; People <i>vs.</i> Dumon, 72 Phil., 41;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Coricor, 79 Phil., 672; People <i>vs.</i> Sabilul, 89 Phil.,&nbsp; 283; 49&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 2743.)&nbsp; In&nbsp; all the above-cited cases, the accused merely invoked the privilege or benefit granted&nbsp; in Article 247 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code or Article 423 of the old Penal Code.<br><br>We, therefore, conclude that Article 247&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code does not define and provide for a specific crime, but grants a privilege or benefit to the accused for the killing of another&nbsp; or&nbsp; the infliction of serious physical injuries Hinder the circumstances therein mentioned.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; a complaint&nbsp; or&nbsp; information charging homicide under&nbsp; the exceptional circumstances&nbsp; provided&nbsp; in&nbsp; Article 247 must fall&nbsp; under the jurisdiction of the Courts of&nbsp; First Instance, the offense charged being actually that of homicide.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; exceptional circumstances are also pleaded—as was&nbsp; done in the amended&nbsp; complaint filed with the Justice of the Peace Court of&nbsp; Narvacan—would not affect the nature of the crime charged.&nbsp; For they are not integral elements of the crime charged but are matters which&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; has to prove in order to warrant the application of the&nbsp; benefit granted&nbsp; by the law.&nbsp; As unnecessary and immaterial averments to the crime charged, they may be&nbsp; stricken&nbsp; out as surplusage and still leave the offense fully&nbsp; described.<br><br>Conformably to the above findings, we hold that defend ant was not tried by a court of competent jurisdiction when he was arraigned&nbsp; before the Justice of the Peace Court of Narvacan upon&nbsp; the amended&nbsp; complaint for "homicide under exceptional circumstances" filed against him by the chief of police of the municipality, and consequently, has not legally been placed in jeopardy in&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside and the case remanded to the court&nbsp; a quo for further proceedings. No special pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Labrador,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Bautista Angelo </i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCURRING</span><br></div><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PARAS, C. J.,</span><br><br>I concur in the result for the same reasons set&nbsp; forth in my concurring opinion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Uy&nbsp; Chin Hua,&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Hon. Judge&nbsp; Rafael Dinglasan,&nbsp; supra, promulgated&nbsp; June 30, 1950, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; the scale of penalties provided in&nbsp; article 71&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, as&nbsp; amended by Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 217, the&nbsp; two penalties&nbsp; successively lower than <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro&nbsp; </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>.&nbsp; Under article 25, <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>is classified as a correctional&nbsp; penalty and, under article 27, its duration is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the duration, of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, classified also as a correccional penalty&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 25), is from 1 month&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1 day&nbsp; to 6 months (Article 27).&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no question that, pursuant to the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296), the consummated&nbsp; offense of corruption&nbsp; of public officials, penalized with&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its medium and maximum periods, or from 2 months and 1 day to 6 months, comes within the original jurisdiction of the justice of the peace or municipal court.&nbsp; Under article 51,&nbsp; the penalty for an&nbsp; attempt to commit the&nbsp; offense of corruption of public officials is two degrees lower than <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in&nbsp; its&nbsp; medium and maximum periods. Said penalty—if the scale in article 71 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, as amended&nbsp; by Commonwealth Act No. 217, is to be followed to the&nbsp; letter—is <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>in its minimum and medium periods, or from&nbsp; 6 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months, with the&nbsp; result that an attempt would fall, pursuant also to the Judiciary Act of 1948, under&nbsp; the original jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; This is the theory of counsel for respondent Judge.<br><br>"According to&nbsp; this&nbsp; theory, an attempted offense is penalized&nbsp; with a&nbsp; greater penalty than the&nbsp; consummated offense and is to be&nbsp; tried by a&nbsp; higher court&nbsp; than&nbsp; that which will&nbsp; try&nbsp; the&nbsp; consummated offense. This&nbsp; absurd result&nbsp; would not&nbsp; have been&nbsp; contemplated by the&nbsp; lawmakers in&nbsp; amending article 71 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code&nbsp; and&nbsp; should accordingly&nbsp; be&nbsp; avoided.<br><br>"An attempt&nbsp; to commit a felony is certainly lower&nbsp; than&nbsp; the consummated felony, and this is the reason why article 51 of the Revised Penal Code specially provides that a penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by&nbsp; law for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the principals in an attempt to commit said felony.&nbsp; If this fundamental provision is, as it should be, given effect, the penalty for the attempted offense of corruption of public officials, which is a penalty lower by two&nbsp; degrees than <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor </span>in its medium and maximum periods (from 2&nbsp; months and&nbsp; 1 day to 6 months), is a<span style="font-style: italic;">rresto menor</span> in it minimum and medium periods&nbsp; (from 1 day to&nbsp; 30 days).&nbsp; The penalty for said&nbsp; attempted offense should not be taken from&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>, because the duration of this penalty is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years, and is therefore equal to and&nbsp; co-extensive in&nbsp; duration with <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional,</span>&nbsp; a penalty higher than <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in the scale&nbsp; provided by&nbsp; article 71 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 217.&nbsp; Although <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro&nbsp; </span>may not be an "Imprisonment", it is nonetheless a "deprivation of liberty"&nbsp; (People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Abilong, 82&nbsp; Phil., 172; 46 Off. Gaz., 1012).<br><br>"It is noteworthy&nbsp; that before&nbsp; article 71 was amended by Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 217, the scale of penalties from&nbsp; which a lower or higher penalty was taken, was that provided by article 70,&nbsp; under which the penalty lower than <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> was <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor. Destierro&nbsp; </span>was&nbsp; not included.&nbsp; The obvious&nbsp; reason is&nbsp; that <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>is an exceptional&nbsp; penalty, prescribed as a principal penalty only in two&nbsp; cases&nbsp; (articles 247&nbsp; and 334)&nbsp; and as an additional penalty only in one case (article 284).&nbsp; The&nbsp; exceptional character of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>is recognized in the&nbsp; fact that although it&nbsp; is classified as a correctional penalty having a duration&nbsp; of from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years, in&nbsp; parity with <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional,</span>&nbsp; it is placed in the scale fixed in article&nbsp; 70 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 217, below <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>, as regard&nbsp; severity and for purposes of successive service of sentence; and in the scale provided&nbsp; in article 71, as amended by Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 217, it is&nbsp; placed below <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>.&nbsp; But, as heretofore stated,&nbsp; if the scale in article&nbsp; 71 is followed literally, we shall have the unthinkable and absurd situation that the consummated offense of corruption&nbsp; of public officials&nbsp; is penalized with&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its&nbsp; medium and maximum periods (from 2 months and 1 day to&nbsp; 6 months) originally triable in the&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace or municipal court, whereas the lower offense of attempted corruption&nbsp; of public officials is penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>in its minimum and medium periods&nbsp; (from 6 months and 1&nbsp; day to 4 years and 2&nbsp; months) and originally triable&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; To avoid this absurdity, I&nbsp; am constrained to hold that the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>is to be considered only when it is&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; imposed and is to be disregarded in&nbsp; the&nbsp; scale provided&nbsp; in article&nbsp; 71.<br><br>"It&nbsp; is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that in the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Ng&nbsp; Pek, 81 Phil., 562; 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 360, decided&nbsp; on October 2,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; we&nbsp; held that the penalty lower&nbsp; by&nbsp; two degrees&nbsp; than&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; mayor</span> in&nbsp; its medium and maximum&nbsp; periods&nbsp; is <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro&nbsp; </span>in its&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; and medium periods;&nbsp; but in said case the point decided in the&nbsp; case at bar was not actually raised&nbsp; and passed upon.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of Rivera <i>vs.</i> Geronimo, 43 Off. Gaz., 841, decided on July 22, 1946t we&nbsp; ruled that tine penalty lower by two degrees than <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span> in its&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; and medium&nbsp; periods is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor&nbsp;</span> in&nbsp; its&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; period,&nbsp; the&nbsp; penalty of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>having been disregarded."<br></blockquote><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">DISSENTING</span><br></center><br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MONTEMAYOR,&nbsp; J.,</span><br></div><br>The facts,in this case are correctly stated in the majority opinion, the&nbsp; pertinent portion of&nbsp; which&nbsp; I am reproducing below for purposes of ready reference:<br><blockquote>"This is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal by the Government from an&nbsp; order of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Ilocos Sur, dismissing the information for homicide&nbsp; filed against the&nbsp; accused Alfredo&nbsp; Araquel on&nbsp; the ground of double jeopardy.<br><br>"The record shows that&nbsp; on January 30,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; acting chief of police of Narvacan,&nbsp; Ilocos Sur,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the peace&nbsp; court of that municipality a&nbsp; complaint for homicide against Alfredo Araquel accusing him of having hacked and killed Alberto Pagadian with a bolo.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than&nbsp; a year and a&nbsp; half&nbsp; later, or on July 3,&nbsp; 1956, while said complaint, for&nbsp; reasons not stated, was still pending in the justice of&nbsp; the peace court, the. chief of police of Narvacan moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; the amendment&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; alleging that upon reinvestigation of the facts he found that the crime committed by the&nbsp; accused was not&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; as charged in the original complaint but that of homicide&nbsp; under exceptional circumstances&nbsp; as provided for&nbsp; in article&nbsp; 247 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding the motion to be well taken, the&nbsp; justice of the peace court,&nbsp; on&nbsp; July 16, allowed the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; the amended&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; which&nbsp; charged&nbsp; the accused with "the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of HOMICIDE UNDER&nbsp; EXCEPTIONAL&nbsp; CIRCUMSTANCES defined and&nbsp; punished under&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 24? of&nbsp; the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code."&nbsp; That same day, the accused was&nbsp; arraigned under&nbsp; the amended complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as he entered a plea of 'guilty', the justice of the peace court, also on that same day,&nbsp; sentenced him to suffer&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>for a period of one year to any place not within the&nbsp; radius&nbsp; of at least 25 kilometers from the municipal building of&nbsp; Narvacan, Ilocos Sur.<br><br>"During the&nbsp; service of the sentence by the accused, the acting Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos&nbsp; Sur was informed of the case through the Department of Justice&nbsp; to&nbsp; which the private&nbsp; prosecutor had lodged a complaint. And after conducting an&nbsp; investigation, the said acting provincial fiscal,&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 16,&nbsp; 1957, filed with the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the province an information against the accused Alfredo Araquel charging him with homicide as&nbsp; defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code for the killing of Alberto&nbsp; Pagadian.<br><br>"On July&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1957, the&nbsp; accused moved to quash the information on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of double&nbsp; jeopardy, invoking the previous&nbsp; charge against him for homicide under&nbsp; exceptional circumstances and the subsequent&nbsp; sentence passed upon him by the Justice of&nbsp; the Peace Court of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; fiscal opposed&nbsp; the motion, but the trial court,&nbsp; in its order of July 18, 1957, sustained the plea of double jeopardy and dismissed the information.&nbsp; Hence, this appeal."<br></blockquote>I just want to add that the reasons&nbsp; given by the Chief of&nbsp; Police&nbsp; in&nbsp; moving for the amendment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; original complaint for homicide were:<br><blockquote>"1. That upon a careful reinvestigation of the facts and evidence in the above-entitled case, the undersigned found from all&nbsp; the declarations on&nbsp; record as well as the&nbsp; declarations of Pvodolfo Cachola (Annex&nbsp; A); Emilia Kabanal&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; B)&nbsp; and Laureana Torqueza (Annex C) that the crime committed by the accused is not Homicide as charged in the original complaint but that of&nbsp; Homicide under exceptional&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; defined and punished under Art. 247 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal Code;<br><br>"2. That in the face of the testimony of the witnesses available, the undersigned believes that since he cannot possibly have evidence to sustain&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution of the accused under the original complaint, the interest of justice require&nbsp; that the complaint be amended to conform with the known facts and&nbsp; evidence available." (Annex "B")</blockquote>It may be&nbsp; of interest to know that the original complaint for homicide was filed only&nbsp; by the Acting Chief&nbsp; of Police, whereas the&nbsp; amended complaint was filed by the regular incumbent Chief of Police.<br><br>The majority&nbsp; opinion readily admits that offenses penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>fall under the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace and Municipal&nbsp; Courts, under the doctrine laid down in the case of Uy Chin Hua <i>vs.</i> Dinglasan&nbsp; (47 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; No. 12, Supp. December 1951; p. 233), and more recently, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; De&nbsp; los&nbsp; Angeles&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; People&nbsp; 103 Phil.,&nbsp; 295 thereby&nbsp; making it unnecessary in this dissent to&nbsp; prove and establish&nbsp; that rule.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; in&nbsp; spite of said admission that&nbsp; the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; has jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; over&nbsp;&nbsp; offenses&nbsp;&nbsp; penalized&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp; destierro, in the present case, it holds that the Justice of the Peace Court of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, had no jurisdiction over the case, although according to the facts, the killing should be penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>.&nbsp; The reason given is that "Article 247 does not define a crime distinct and separate from homicide, parricide or murder ***"and that "far from defining a felony, merely provides or grants a privilege or benefit— amounting practically to an exemption from an adequate punishment ***. The majority contends that the case should have been tried in the Court of First Instance as a case of ordinary homicide, and that if the defendant proved the special circumstances defined in Article 247, the said court could and should impose the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>.&nbsp; I regret to disagree.<rro, present ="" case, ="" it  ="" holds ="" justice ="" peace="" narvacan,="" ilocos="" sur,="" had ="" no="" jurisdiction="" over="" case,="" although="" according ="" facts,="" th0="" killing ="" be ="" penalized ="" with="" destierro.  ="" the ="" reason="" given="" is="" 247="" does ="" not="" define="" crime="" distinct="" separate="" parricide="" murder ="" far="" from="" defining="" a ="" felony,="" merely="" provides="" grants="" privilege="" or="" benefit—amounting="" practically="" an="" exemption ="" from ="" an ="" adequate ="" punishment="" *="" * ="" .  ="" majority ="" contends="" that ="" case ="" should="" have="" been ="" tried="" in ="" first="" instance="" as="" a="" case="" ordinary="" homicide,="" that="" if="" defendant="" proved="" special="" circuit="" stances="" defined="" in="" article="" 247, ="" said="" court="" could="" and="" should ="" impose="" the="" penalty ="" of="" destierro. ="" i ="" regret ="" to="" disagree.=""><br><br>Article 247 reads thus:<br><blockquote>"Art. 247. <span style="font-style: italic;">Death&nbsp; or&nbsp; physical injuries inflicted under&nbsp; exceptional circumstances.</span>—Any leg-ally married person who, having surprised his spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person, shall kill any of them or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter,&nbsp; or&nbsp; shall inflict upon them any serious physical injury shall suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>. <br><br>"If&nbsp; he shall inflict upon them physical injuries&nbsp; of any&nbsp; other kind,&nbsp; he shall be exempt&nbsp; from punishment. <br><br>"These rules shall be applicable, under the&nbsp; same&nbsp; circumstances, to parents with respect to their daughters, under eighteen years of age and their seducers, while the daughters are living with their parents. <br><br>"Any person who shall&nbsp; promote or facilitate the&nbsp; prostitution of his wife or daughter, or&nbsp; shall&nbsp; otherwise have consented to the infidelity of&nbsp; the other&nbsp; spouse shall not be entitled&nbsp; to the benefits of the&nbsp; article."</blockquote>To me, the killing under Article 247 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code is&nbsp; a special crime, namely, that of a person who kills under certain, circumstances.&nbsp; It has some similarity to the killing on the occasion of a robbery or in a tumultuous affray, in which case, the prosecuting attorney should state clearly&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; and&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; under which a man&nbsp; is killed.&nbsp; So is the crime&nbsp; of rape when committed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion of&nbsp; a robbery.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; should&nbsp; be described&nbsp; by&nbsp; the prosecution&nbsp; not as&nbsp; an&nbsp; isolated&nbsp; crime against chastity, but as a crime committed on the occasion of robbery, thereby making it a special offense.<br><br>&nbsp;I cannot&nbsp; agree that Article 247 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code, according to the majority opinion, "merely provides or&nbsp; grants&nbsp; a privilege or benefit—amounting&nbsp; practically to an exemption from an adequate punishment".&nbsp; If that were so, then its provisions have no right or business to be under Title VIII (Crimes Against Persons), and Chapter 1 thereof (Destruction of Life), found almost&nbsp; at the end of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, but should have been placed under Chapter 2 of Title&nbsp; I, entitled, "Justifying Circumstances and Circumstances which Exempt&nbsp; from Criminal Liability," found at the beginning of the same Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Article&nbsp; 11 of said Chapter 2, Title I, we&nbsp; find that the following persons&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; incur any&nbsp; criminal liability: anyone who acts in defense of his person or&nbsp; rights under certain circumstances,&nbsp; or&nbsp; anyone who&nbsp; acts in&nbsp; defense of the person or rights of his spouse, ascendants&nbsp; or decendants, etc.,&nbsp; and&nbsp; even of strangers, under&nbsp; certain circumstances.&nbsp; Following the theory&nbsp; of the&nbsp; majority opinion, the provisions of Article 247&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code should have been placed under or added to said cases, in the following manner:&nbsp; Any&nbsp; legally married person who in defense of his honor and the sanctity of his home or family should kill his spouse or the person caught by him in sexual intercourse with said&nbsp; spouse, or both of them.<br>However, that has not been done, and as&nbsp; already stated, Article 247 is placed under&nbsp; Title VIII, entitled, "Crimes Against Persons,"&nbsp; and found between&nbsp; Articles 246&nbsp; (parricide)&nbsp; and 248 (murder),&nbsp; and Article 249&nbsp; (homicide).<br><br>Again, the&nbsp; majority says&nbsp; that Article 247 does&nbsp; not define a felony.&nbsp; Does it not?&nbsp; I&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that it does.&nbsp; It is a separate article of the Penal Code, different and distinct from, say, Article 246 (parricide)&nbsp; or Article 248 (murder) or Article 249 (homicide), although they are&nbsp; all under the same Title&nbsp; VIII, Chapter&nbsp; 1 and&nbsp; Section 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Code. What&nbsp; better proof that it defines a&nbsp; felony is there than that Article 247 has&nbsp; its&nbsp; own title—"Death&nbsp; or Physical Injuries&nbsp; Inflicted&nbsp; under Exceptional&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumstances"; it indicates and mentions the person included&nbsp; in and&nbsp; liable under its provisions; it specifies the circumstances&nbsp; under which the death is&nbsp; caused by him,&nbsp; and declares the penalty imposable on&nbsp; him?&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the definition of the crime is complete and&nbsp; unmistakable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; no less defines a&nbsp; crime than&nbsp; does Article 248&nbsp; (murder) which punishes a person who kills another&nbsp; who is&nbsp; not his father, mother,&nbsp; child, spouse, etc., under any of the following&nbsp; circumstances, such as, treachery, promise of reward, evident premeditation, etc.<br><br>In&nbsp; my opinion, Article&nbsp; 247 is considered and classified as a&nbsp; special crime, and what is more, the corresponding penalty&nbsp; is attached to it.&nbsp; Consequently, persons may be charged with&nbsp; its violation.<br><br>Article 247&nbsp; is quite similar&nbsp; to Article&nbsp; 251 entitled, "Death Caused in&nbsp; a Tumultuous Affray," which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"ART. 251. <span style="font-style: italic;">Death caused in a tumultuous affray.</span>—When, while several persons, not&nbsp; composing groups organized for the common purpose of assaulting and attacking each other reciprocally,&nbsp; quarrel and assault each other&nbsp; in a confused and&nbsp; tumultuous manner, and in the course of the&nbsp; affray&nbsp; someone&nbsp; is killed, and it cannot be ascertained who&nbsp; actually killed&nbsp; the deceased, but&nbsp; the person or persons who inflicted serious&nbsp; physical injuries can be identified, such person&nbsp; or persons shall be punished&nbsp; by <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>."<br><br>"If it&nbsp; cannot be determined who inflicted the serious physical injuries on the deceased,&nbsp; the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span> in its medium and maximum periods shall be imposed upon all&nbsp; those who shall have used violence&nbsp; upon the person&nbsp; of the victim."</blockquote>This article, like Article 247, also falls&nbsp; under Title VIII (Crimes Against Persons), Chapter 1 (Destruction of Life), and the same Section 1.&nbsp; Will&nbsp; the majority contend and claim, as it does as regards Article 247, that Article 251 does not define&nbsp; a felony but merely extends&nbsp; a mitigating circumstance and imposes a lesser penalty, and that consequently,&nbsp; one involved&nbsp; in or falling&nbsp; under its provisions (Death Caused in a Tumultuous Affray) should be charged with homicide under Article 249, and&nbsp; that it is up to him to invoke and prove the circumstances mentioned in Article 251, even when the prosecution&nbsp; already knows&nbsp; those circumstances to have attended or&nbsp; surrounded the&nbsp; death of the deceased? If the prosecution from its investigation is convinced that the&nbsp; accused comes under the provisions of&nbsp; said Article 251, in that he inflicted serious physical injuries on the person&nbsp; killed,&nbsp; it should charge him with causing "death in&nbsp; a&nbsp; tumultuous affray". It&nbsp; should&nbsp; not charge&nbsp; him with, say, homicide and let or rather compel him to&nbsp; prove the facts already known to the prosecution, namely that he&nbsp; was among several persons, not composing groups&nbsp; organized for the common purpose of assaulting or attacking each other, but that he was&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; a quarrel in&nbsp; a confused and tumultuous manner, and that all he did was to inflict serious physical&nbsp; injuries on the&nbsp; deceased. For the prosecution to suppress facts known to&nbsp; it,&nbsp; which facts are favorable to&nbsp; the accused, and file a charge of, say, homicide,&nbsp; and compel the defendant&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove those facts would not be playing fair and square.&nbsp; That would involve mental dishonesty.&nbsp; The duty of the Government is&nbsp; not to prosecute&nbsp; and&nbsp; convict one of&nbsp; a crime&nbsp; higher&nbsp; and more serious than that actually committed,&nbsp; but rather&nbsp; to charge the accused with what he had actually committed and the circumstances surrounding said commission, this, to serve the interest of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the Government would be undertaking and promoting persecution instead of prosecution.<br><br>If in a case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal,&nbsp; after his investigation, is convinced that the accused abducted a woman with her consent, he should file a charge for abduction with consent,, under Article 343 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code&nbsp; (Abduction&nbsp; with Consent),&nbsp; penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correcional&nbsp;</span> in its&nbsp; minimum and medium period and not with forcible abduction, punished with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, and leave it to the defendant to prove consent of the girl.&nbsp; Again, if an accused is found to have had sexual intercourse with a girl and the Fiscal from his investigation knows that the girl consented to&nbsp; said&nbsp; intercourse&nbsp; because of deceit, promise&nbsp; of marriage,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; then he should charge said accused with simple seduction under Article 338, penalized only&nbsp; with <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor </span>and not with rape under Article 335, Revised Penal Code, punished with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion&nbsp; temporal, </span>and leave&nbsp; it to said accused to&nbsp; prove what the Fiscal already knew—that sexual&nbsp; intercourse was not committed with force or intimidation, but rather with the consent of the girl.&nbsp; There should be sincerity and candor in the actuations of a prosecuting&nbsp; attorney.&nbsp; In the present case, the Chief of Police of&nbsp; Narvacan where&nbsp; the crime was&nbsp; committed, who being a resident of the place, was in a better position to know the real&nbsp; facts of the case, after his investigation, found as a matter of fact&nbsp; that the accused killed the deceased when&nbsp; he found&nbsp; him in actual sexual intercourse with his (defendant's) wife.&nbsp; This must have been known to&nbsp; the Fiscal who also must have known that the defendant had already been&nbsp; charged with&nbsp; causing death under exceptional circumstances under Article 247 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; found guilty under said article, and had served sentence; and yet, the prosecution in this case filed a charge of homicide, omitting&nbsp; or suppressing the facts&nbsp; and circumstances&nbsp; surrounding the killing.&nbsp; To me, that was&nbsp; wrong, unjust, and unfair.<br><br>I hold that Article 247 clearly&nbsp; defines a crime and&nbsp; attaches to it the&nbsp; corresponding penalty.&nbsp; It is complete in definition and in the fixing of punishment, like parricide, murder and homicide, which&nbsp; like them, is included in the same Title VIII, Chapter&nbsp; 1, and&nbsp; Section 1 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; It is not a mere exemption or mitigating circumstance which are included in a distinct and separate portion of the Revised Penal Code, namely, Title I, Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.<br><br>Continuing with its theory that the&nbsp; provisions of Article&nbsp; 247 only mention an exempting circumstance, the majority opinion says that it is a matter of defense on&nbsp; the part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accused which he has to&nbsp; prove, and&nbsp; that to consider said article as defining and penalizing&nbsp; a&nbsp; distinct crime, then the&nbsp; prosecuting officer would be&nbsp; obliged to plead and admit the said circumstance&nbsp; in his information, which would be illogical if not absurd, since a mitigating or exempting circumstance cannot be an integral&nbsp; element to the&nbsp; crime charged.&nbsp; In my opinion, therein lies&nbsp; the flaw&nbsp; in the&nbsp; majority's theory, all because its premise is incorrect.&nbsp; The reason why justifying circumstances&nbsp; are a matter of defense is because they involve several elements which need&nbsp; proof.&nbsp; For&nbsp; instance, in the matter&nbsp; of self-defense, the accused&nbsp; must prove that there was unlawful aggression, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; means&nbsp; employed&nbsp; by him to&nbsp; prevent or repel it were&nbsp; reasonable and necessary, and that there was lack of sufficient provocation on his part.&nbsp; All these are matters&nbsp; only known, to the accused himself and which he must establish to the satisfaction of the court in order to be exempted from criminal liability.&nbsp; However, where the accused is a married man and he&nbsp; surprises his wife and the deceased in the&nbsp; act of sexual&nbsp; intercourse and he kills&nbsp; anyone of them or both of them, there&nbsp; is&nbsp; nothing complicated&nbsp; or difficult of&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of these&nbsp; circumstances and when the prosecuting official knows it,&nbsp; as he did in this case, there&nbsp; is nothing illogical, much&nbsp; less absurd, in his sincerely, ingenuously and candidly including them in his complaint, so as to fall under the provisions of Article 247, all in the interest of justice.&nbsp; And knowing that the penalty attached to it is&nbsp; only <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>, he should file it in the Justice of the Peace Court or Municipal Court, as did the Chief of Police in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Why should a person accused of killing under Article 247 be compelled to submit to a mere preliminary investigation by the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court and&nbsp; later be sent up to the Court of First Instance, with all the attendant expense and trouble and worry, when after all, he could easily prove the circumstances under which he killed&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased, because the very Chief of Police and the Fiscal and the witnesses for the prosecution&nbsp; admit and know it?&nbsp; We should&nbsp; make the administration of justice as simple, speedy and inexpensive as&nbsp; possible, and fair to the accused.<br><br>Here, the Chief of Police who presumably acted in all sincerity and according to his conscience, filed an amended complaint according to the facts found by him.&nbsp; The Justice of the Peace knowing that the penalty attached to the criminal act committed under said circumstances&nbsp; was penalized&nbsp; with&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro</span>,&nbsp; which according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority opinion itself fell under&nbsp; his jurisdiction,&nbsp; took cognizance thereof and&nbsp; after court proceedings, rendered judgment.<br>The accused&nbsp; served the sentence&nbsp; for&nbsp; according to the appealed&nbsp; order of the trial court in this case, at the time said decision was rendered, defendant's service of sentence had been&nbsp; completed.&nbsp; But the tragedy and the misfortune that visited the&nbsp; unfortunate&nbsp; accused evidently had not ended, because now here comes the Government itself, who invoking&nbsp; a supposed technicality .as to&nbsp; jurisdiction, seeks to&nbsp; disregard and sweep away all&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; proceedings so far held, and again indicts and, in my opinion, harasses the said unfortunate defendant with&nbsp; another prosecution, and all for what?&nbsp; To try him for the same offense, this time in the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; and if found guilty, which of&nbsp; course, the defendant himself admits&nbsp; that he committed&nbsp; the act, to&nbsp; impose&nbsp; the same&nbsp; penalty of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">destierro </span>and for the accused to serve it all over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe that is justice.<br><br>But one&nbsp; might claim&nbsp; that there could have been fraud, collusion&nbsp; or connivance&nbsp; in the filing of the amended complaint in the Justice of the Peace Court, the arraignment of the accused on said amended complaint? and his sentence thereon.&nbsp; However, the record of the&nbsp; case fails to&nbsp; show any such fraud,&nbsp; connivance or&nbsp; collusion.&nbsp; On this&nbsp; point, the trial court in its order of dismissal, has this&nbsp; to say:<br><blockquote>"There being no showing&nbsp; that the first conviction in the Justice of the Peace Court was&nbsp; procured, through fraud, connivance&nbsp; or collusion of the accused, it would not seem pertinent, to&nbsp; discuss the contention of the Fiscal that the rule of double jeopardy could not apply if the&nbsp; first conviction was secured under those circumstances."</blockquote>Furthermore,&nbsp; the judgment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace Court in the&nbsp; original&nbsp; case,&nbsp; reproduced&nbsp; in the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of dismissal of the&nbsp; trial court, in&nbsp; part reads thus:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; amend the&nbsp; complaint was&nbsp; filed by the Chief of Police of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, attaching&nbsp; thereto annexes "A", "B" and "C", together with the Amended&nbsp; Complaint.<br><br>"The motion was set for hearing on July 9, 1956 on&nbsp; which date <span style="font-style: italic;">Atty. Constante R. Ayson&nbsp; appeared as private prosecutor</span> in&nbsp; collaboration with the Chief of Police. Atty. Francisco D. Villanueva appeared as&nbsp; a&nbsp; defense counsel.<br><br>"The counsels agreed to&nbsp; postpone the consideration of the motion filed by the&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; of&nbsp; Police&nbsp; for July 16, 1956 at&nbsp; which time the private prosecutor manifested to the Court that he will file his objections to the motion to amend the complaint filed by the&nbsp; Chief of&nbsp; Police.<br><br>"On July 16, 1956 when the case was heard the <span style="font-style: italic;">private prosecutor</span> did <span style="font-style: italic;">not appear</span>&nbsp; and the Chief of&nbsp; Police filed a motion&nbsp; to correct a clerical error committed in&nbsp; the complaint."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied)</blockquote>It&nbsp; is, therefore, clear that considering that there was a private prosecutor representing the offended party in the first&nbsp; case;&nbsp; that although said private&nbsp; prosecutor at first manifested his intention to file an objection to the motion to amend&nbsp; the complaint, nevertheless, when hearing&nbsp; on said amendment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint was held, said private prosecutor&nbsp; did not&nbsp; appear, showing that he no longer objected to the amendment, or that&nbsp; he acquiesced in said amendment, it is safe to say that there has been no collusion,&nbsp; connivance or fraud in the&nbsp; case.<br><br>The unfortunate defendant here has more than sufficiently suffered, what with the proven infidelity of his wife, the attack upon his honor, the&nbsp; wrecking of his home, his subjection to a criminal prosecution and the service of the penalty&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; upon him.&nbsp; In my opinion, the ends of justice have been more than served.&nbsp; I agree with the trial court in&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; second complaint filed&nbsp; by the Chief of Police on the ground of double jeopardy.<br><br>For the&nbsp; foregoing reasons, I&nbsp; dissent.<br></rro,></div>
