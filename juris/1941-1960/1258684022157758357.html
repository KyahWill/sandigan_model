				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal  by certiorari from  a decision of the  Court of Appeals reversing the judgment  of  the Court  of First Instance of  Nueva  Ecija in  Civil Case  No.  631, entitled Alfonso Angeles,  et  al., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gregorio  Santa Ines, et al., and dismissing the complaint  and counterclaim,  without pronouncement as to costs.            <br><br>On  March 12, 1935,  homestead  patent No. 31613 was issued for a parcel  of land in the municipality of Santo Domingo,  Nueva  Ecija, containing  an  area of  13.6696 hectares more  or  less.  Pursuant  to the issuance of this homestead patent,  original  certificate  of title No. 4906 was issued to  the  patentee Juan  Angeles on March  28, 1935.  On May 28,  1937,  Juan Angeles sold the above land to  defendants  Gregorio  Santa  Ines and Anastacia Divino,  who thereupon took  possession thereof.  Juan Angeles  died in the year 1938, and thereafter his heirs, the petitioners  herein, sought to recover the land from the defendants on the ground that the sale was null and void (Sec.  116, Act No.  2874).  The  defendants  refused to return the land, so said heirs, petitioners herein, brought this action in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. <br><br>In the amended complaint  filed by the plaintiffs the allegation is  made that defendants' possession of the land was by  virtue of a  sale which is against  the  law  and therefore did not convey title to them.   It is also alleged that the homestead  produces an  average of 200 cavans per year as  share for the  owner.  Prayer is made that the defendants  be  ordered to  vacate  the land   and the possession thereof returned to the  plaintiffs, and that the defendants be condemned to pay damages at the rate of 200 cavans of  palay  per year from 1938, valued at  P12 per cavan,  until the return of the  land.   Defendants answered the amended complaint alleging that  the  purchase was for  a valuable consideration,  in utmost good faith, and that the  defendants took possession of the land with  the  knowledge, consent  and  acquiescence  of  plaintiffs. They denied that  the harvest of the land is  200 cavans per year for the owner and that the alleged price is P12 per  cavan.   As special  defenses,  they alleged that the plaintiffs are guilty of laches for having allowed 12 years to pass, after  the death  of the  original  homesteader, before they  brought  the  action; that the  plaintiff's  right of action had prescribed; that more  than five years had elapsed from the date of the final approval  of the  homestead,  when  the sale  was made on May 28,  1937; etc.   It is, therefore, prayed  that the complaint be dismissed that the  sale be  declared valid  and defendant's be declared owners of  the  property;  and that the certificate of title be cancelled and one issued in the name of the defendants. As an alternative remedy, it was  prayed that should the court declare the  sale null and void the  defendants be reimbursed  in the  amount of P6,000 which  they incurred in cleaning the land,  etc. <br><br>That trial court found  that when the sale  was made by the  deceased Angeles,  five  years  had  not  passed  from the issuance of the certificate of title to  the  homestead; that both vendor and vendee knew that the  sale was void because the  five-year period  prescribed by  law had not yet elapsed; as a consequence of this bad  faith of both parties, they should be considered as having  acted in good faith (Art. 364, Civil Code of Spain), and  that  defendants are entitled to  the fruits of the land.  The  court further held that the  right  of  action  of plaintiffs had already prescribed before the  complaint was filed on June 12, 1950, in accordance with Section 40 of Act No.  190.   The trial court also  found that the  land  was  levelled and a dike was  built thereon at a cost of P3.000.00 to  prevent it from being flooded every year; that  defendants paid P2,500.00 for the homestead.  Wherefore, the  court  declared that the sale of the homestead  is  null and  void and ordered plaintiffs to  return the price of the land  of P2,500.00 to the defendants  and to reimburse the latter in the amount of P3,000, for expenses incurred in  levelling the land and  the construction of the dike thereon.  The  court  ordered the defendants to return the homestead to the plaintiffs upon the payment to the defendants of P2,500.00 and that the P3,000.00, value of the improvements, should constitute a lien on the land. <br><br>The case having been appealed to the Court of Appeals, the  latter  held  that Article 1306,  paragraph  1   of  the Spanish Civil Code, which provides: <br><blockquote>"* * * When both parties are guilty, neither of them can recover what he may have given by virtue of the  contract, or enforce the performance  of the undertaking of the other party;"</blockquote> which legal provision  is  founded on the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">in pari delicto</span>, is applicable.   In  accordance with said principle, it. held that none of the parties should be given  any remedy  due to the fact that they  did not only violate the prohibition contained in the Public Land Law but  because they knowingly tried to cheat the prohibition (by  the insertion of a provision for the execution of another  deed of sale after five years).  The  decision of the lower court was,  therefore, reversed and the  action  dismissed. <br><br>In  this  Court it  is claimed by the petitioners that the application of  Article  1306,  par. 1,  of the  Spanish Civil Code is null and void; and that the heirs of the homesteader should be  declared entitled to the  possession of the homestead and the fruits of the same. <br><br>The most important issue raised in the appeal is whether the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">in  pari  delicto</span> is  applicable  to sales  of homesteads. This question was squarely decided  in  the case of Catalina de los Santos <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Roman Catholic  Church of Midsayap, et al., 94 Phil. 405; 50 Off.  Gaz. 1588, in the negative.  In that case we held that the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">in pari delicto</span> is not applicable to a homestead which has been illegally sold, in violation of the homestead law.   Reason for the  rule is  that the  policy of  the  law is to  give land to  a  family for home  and cultivation and the law allows the homesteader to reacquire the land even if it has been  sold;  hence  the  right may not be  waived.  This principle  was  again confirmed in  the  case of Acierto,  et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De  los Santos, et al., (95 Phil. 887) in which, through Mr.  Justice  Alex.   Reyes, we  said:<br><blockquote>"Appellants, however, contend that the voiding provision of the Act may not be  invoked in  favor of plaintiffs as their  predecessor in  interest  was <span style="font-style: italic;">in pari delicto</span>, and  that, since the same provision says  the illegal  sale  shall have the effect of annulling the  grant and cause  the reversion of  the property and its  improvements  to the  State,  plaintiffs may  no longer  claim the homestead.  Similar contentions were made in the  case of Catalina de los  Santos, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Roman  Catholic  Church  of Midsayap  et  al., 94 Phil.,  405,  50 Off,  Gaz.  1588,  but  they were   there overruled,  this  Court holding that the  <span style="font-style: italic;">pari delicto</span> doctrine may not be invoked in a case of this kind since it would turn counter to an avowed fundamental policy of the State that the  forfeiture of the  homestead is a matter between the State and the grantee of his heirs, and that until the State has taken  steps to  annul the  grant and asserts title to the homestead the  purchaser is,  as  against the vendor or  his heirs, 'no more entitled to  keep the  land  than  any intruder."</blockquote>Consistent with the above decisions,  we must hold  that in  the  case at bar the sale of the homestead by the deceased  homesteader was  null and void  and his heirs  have the  right  to  recover the homestead illegally  disposed of. <br><br>It  now  becomes  necessary to determine if the  defense of prescription raised in the answer to the  amended  complaint can be sustained,  it appearing that when the action was brought  in the year 1950, about 13 years had elapsed since the date  of the sale.  The precise question was also passed upon by Us  adversely to  the defendants-respondents in the case of Eugenio, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Perdido, et al., 97 Phil., 41.   In  that case  we  held,  thru  Mr.  Justice Bengzon:<br><blockquote>"There is no question that the sale in March 1932 having been made within five years from  'the date of the issuance of the patent' was  'unlawful  and null and void from  its execution', by  express provision of sections  116 and 122 of Act No. 2874 (Now Com. Act No. 141).<br>  <br>"Under the existing classification, such contract would be 'inexistent' and 'the action  or defense for declaration' of such  inexistence 'does not prescribe'.   (Art. 1410 New  Civil Code).  While it is true that this is a new provision of the New Civil  Code, it is nevertheless a principle recognized since Tipton v. Velasco, 6 Phil. 67 that 'mere lapse  of time cannot  give efficacy  to contracts that are null and void'." </blockquote> Having found that the sale of the homestead is null and void, and  that the action  to  recover the  same  does  not prescribe, we now come to the  effects of these rulings  on the price paid for the sale and the value of the  improvements made on the homestead and of the  products realized from the homestead by the buyer.   The stipulation of the parties  (pp. 39-40,  R.O.A.) shows that  the deed of sale was to be renewed  after the expiration of  five years, and that this fact was explained by the notary to  the parties. The notary must have informed  the  latter that renewal of the deed was necessary to avoid the prohibition against the sale of the  homestead  within five years after the  issuance of the title.  This circumstance shows  that  the parties  to the sale  were aware of the  existence of  the prohibition and that they entered  into the contract of sale notwithstanding  such  knowledge.  As a matter  of fact, the Court of Appeals predicated its decision on the finding that the parties to the sale were both guilty of bad  faith. <br><br>The question  that now poses is whether the  return of the value of the products gathered from the  land by the defendants and the expenses incurred in the construction of  the  dike—all  useful  and  necessary  expenses—should be ordered to be returned by  the  defendants to the plaintiffs. While  we believe that the rule of  <span style="font-style: italic;">in  pari delicto</span> should not apply to the sale of the homestead, because such sale is contrary to the public policy enunciated in the homestead law, the loss of the products realized by the defendants and the value of the necessary improvements made by them on  the land  should  not be excepted from the  application  of the said rule because no cause or reason  can be  cited to justify an exception.   It  has  been  held that the rule of in pari delicto is inapplicable only where the same violates a  well-established public policy. <br><blockquote>"* * *  But we doubt if these principles can now be  involved considering the philosophy and the policy behind the approval of the Public Land  Act.  The principle underlying  <span style="font-style: italic;">pari delicto</span> as known here and  in the United States is not absolute in its application.  It recognizes certain  exceptions one of them being when its enforcement  or application runs counter to an avowed fundamental policy or to public  interest.  As stated by us in  the Rellosa case, 'This doctrine is subject to  one important limitation, namely,  "whenever public policy is considered  advanced by  allowing either party  to sue for relief  against the  transaction."   (Rellosa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gaw Chee Hun,  93  Phil. 827;  49  Off.  Gaz. 4345.)"  (De los Santos  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Roman Catholic  Church of  Midsayap,  94  Phil. 405;  50 Off. Gaz. 1588).</blockquote> We are constrained to hold that the heirs of the homesteader should be declared to have  lost and forfeited the value of the products gathered from the land, and so should the defendants lose the value of  the necessary  improvements that  they have made thereon. <br><br>With respect to the price that  the defendants  had paid for the land P2,500, in view of the rule that no one should enrich himself  at the expense  of another,  the return of the said amount by the  plaintiffs should be decreed, before  the plaintiffs  may be  allowed  to recover back the possession of the homestead, subject to the action. <br><br>The decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and judgment is hereby entered declaring the  sale of the homestead null and  void, ordering the defendants to return the same to the plaintiffs upon payment by the  latter to them of the  sum of  P2,500.  The claim of plaintiffs for the value of the products of the land and that of defendants for the expenses in the  construction of the dike  are both dismissed.  Without costs in this  appeal. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Reyes,  A., Bautista Angelo,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
