				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva 
Ecija convicting the herein appellants of the crime of forcible abduction in 
accordance with article 342 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing them, to an 
indeterminate penalty ranging from 8 years and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em> 
as minimum, to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of<em> reclusion temporal</em> as 
maximum, and costs.
<p>Serafin Castillo was a persistent and ardent suitor of Carolina Isidro, both 
residents of the barrio of San Juan, Aliaga, Nueva Ecija. In the afternoon of 
March 27, 1945, Castillo and Marcelo Lugod, his co-appellant, forcibly dragged 
and carried Carolina Isidre from the store she was tending and took her to a 
waiting <em>carretela</em> while she resisted and cried for help. Appellants 
then ordered the rig driver to speed away in the direction of the town of Aliaga 
until they reached a point much farther than the municipal building where they 
stopped upon being warned by some <em>guerrilleras</em> that it was dangerous to 
proceed further. Whereupon, the party half-turned and proceeded instead to the 
municipal building. Upon the arrival of the mayor and the chief of police at the 
building, the sworn statements of the girl and of Castillo were taken down. 
Subsequently, Carolina's mother, Juliana Santiago, with a sister of Carolina, 
both of whom arrived about two hours after Carolina, asked her whether she 
accepted Castillo. The girl vehemently answered in the negative, whereupon her 
mother took her home.</p>
<p>There is no controversy as to the fact that Carolina Isidro was taken away by 
Serafin Castillo and Marcelo lugod against her will. Counsel for appellants 
admits this and it is well supported by the evidence. Now, the question would 
be: were lewd designs sufficiently proven to constitute the case one of forcible 
abduction? The trial court's finding is fully supported ~by evidence. It is 
admitted that Serafin Castillo was a rejected suitor of Carolina Isidro with no 
hope of having her in marriage. His persistent offers of love and marriage had 
been decidedly spurned. It was in the evening of March 27 when he took the girl 
by force, and at that time the office of the justice of the peace is usually 
closed and no marriages are therein solemnized much less at a moment's notice 
without previously fulfilling the requlsites provided by law. Castillo took the 
girl in a <em>carretela</em> to a distance much farther than the municipal 
building of Aliaga, and he proceeded with her to that building only by the 
warning of a grave danger ahead. In the <em>carretela</em> he forcibly embraced 
her, kissed her, and handled her against her will. No protestation of noble 
intentions can obviate the conclusion that all these acts proved lewd designs. 
Would a man intent on marriage so act? Appellant Castillo claims these acts were 
intended simply to add to the persuasive force of his matrimonial offer. This 
merits no consideration at all. It is a defense that can be put", up even by one 
who commits rape, that the girl will eventually yield to marriage.</p>
<p>With regard to the other appellant. Marcelo Lugod, it was he who forcibly 
dragged the girl from the store she was tending to the <em>carretela</em> where 
Castillo was waiting to receive her. And throughout the ride, while Castillo 
handled the girl, lugod was seated to one side of her. He took, therefore, 
direct participation in the execution of the crime.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is affimed in all 
respects, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Feria, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
