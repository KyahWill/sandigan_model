				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A parcel of&nbsp; land containing an area of 2,784&nbsp; square meters&nbsp; as&nbsp; described in&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of title No. 36234&nbsp; issued on 6&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1930 by&nbsp; the office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Register of Deeds in and for the City of Manila was registered&nbsp; in the name of Andres Luna de Pardo de&nbsp; Tavera, single; Carlos Pardo de Tavera, married to&nbsp; Belen Ramirez; Gonzales; Maria Audotte&nbsp; Pardo&nbsp; de&nbsp; Tavera&nbsp; y Ramirez, 3 years of age, single; Roberto Pardo de Tavera y Ramirez, 9 years of age, single; and&nbsp; Carmen Pardo de Tavera y Lopez&nbsp; Manzano,&nbsp; 11 years of age,&nbsp; single&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B). On 6 August 1930&nbsp; the&nbsp; co-owners agreed to organize a corporation under the name of&nbsp; Tavera-Luna, Inc.&nbsp; for the purpose of building a modern structure on the parcel of land' and to&nbsp; that&nbsp; end they also agreed to accept shares of stock of the corporation to be organized in exchange for their respective shares&nbsp; in&nbsp; the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; and building erected thereon to be transferred to tfi^f. corporation&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; D-2).&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 12&nbsp; August&nbsp; 1930&nbsp; the&nbsp; duly appointed guardian&nbsp; of the minor Carmen Pardo&nbsp; de&nbsp; Tavera y Lopez&nbsp; Manzano,&nbsp; mother&nbsp; of the minor,&nbsp; filed a petition in the probate court&nbsp; (Special&nbsp; Proceeding&nbsp; No. 34154)&nbsp; praying for the approval of&nbsp; the agreement&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; (Exhibit D-2) and&nbsp; seeking authority to accept shares&nbsp; of stock of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; in&nbsp; exchange for the share of the&nbsp; minor&nbsp; in the property (Exhibit D-l).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 28 August 1930&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; approved&nbsp; the agreement in so far as the minor Carmen Pardo de Tavera y Lopez Manzano was concerned and authorized the guardian to&nbsp; accept the shares&nbsp; of&nbsp; stock of the&nbsp; corporation in exchange for the share of the&nbsp; minor in, the property (Exhibit E-l).&nbsp; The Tavera-Luna, Inc., was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; incorporated on 14 December 1930 and the guardian of the minor Carmen&nbsp; Pardo de Tavera y Lopez Manzano transferred&nbsp; her share.in the&nbsp; property on&nbsp; 16&nbsp; January 1931. After the transfer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the shares of&nbsp; the&nbsp; co-owners in the property, transfer certificate of title No. 36234&nbsp; (Exhibit B) was cancelled and in lieu thereof transfer certif- icate of titlel No. 37347 ill the name of Tavera-Luna,&nbsp; Inc. was issued on 23 January&nbsp; 1931&nbsp; (Exhibit H).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 17 January 1931&nbsp; upon application&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; El Hogar&nbsp; Filipino,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; a&nbsp; loan&nbsp; and&nbsp; building&nbsp; association, granted it a loan of P1,000,000 for the purpose of erecting a concrete building in lieu of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wooden building standing thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; loan was secured by a&nbsp; first mortgage registered on the certificate. On&nbsp; 11 February 1932&nbsp; an additional loan of P300.000 was obtained by the corporation from El Hogar Filipino, Inc. secured by a mortgage on the same&nbsp; property.&nbsp; The period&nbsp; of the&nbsp; first mortgage of P1,000,000 was extended.&nbsp; Transfer certificate of title No. 37347 in the name of&nbsp; Tavera-Luna,&nbsp; Inc. (Exhibit H) was cancelled and&nbsp; in lieu&nbsp; thereof transfer certificate of title No. 40177 was issued&nbsp; on 28 April 1932 in the name of Tavera-Luna, Inc., but the parcel of land was subdivided into several&nbsp; lots with their respective&nbsp; description&nbsp; (Exhibit K).&nbsp; Again, transfer certificate of title No.&nbsp; 40177 (Exhibit&nbsp; K)&nbsp; was&nbsp; partially cancelled as to one&nbsp; of the several lots&nbsp; and transfer&nbsp; certificate of title No.&nbsp; 41127 was issued in the name of&nbsp; Tavera-Luna, Inc. on 25 August 1932&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; K-l).&nbsp; Thereafter,&nbsp; partial cancellations were made of transfer certificate' of title No. 40177 Exhibit K)&nbsp; as&nbsp; to some of the small lots&nbsp; and transfer certificates&nbsp; of title Nos. 41128, 43104,&nbsp; 43105, 43107, 43108, 43109 and 7276 were issued in the name of Tavera-Luna, Inc.&nbsp; The&nbsp; last certificates&nbsp; of title&nbsp; cover small parts of the original parcel&nbsp; of land.&nbsp; The larger part of the parcel of&nbsp; land is described in transfer certificates of title Nos. 40177 (Exhibit K)&nbsp; and 41127 (Exhibit&nbsp; K-l).&nbsp; Not long after the construction of the building known&nbsp; as "Crystal Arcade" was finished, El&nbsp; Hogar Filipino, Inc., the mortgagee, took&nbsp; over the possession&nbsp; and management of the property to&nbsp; apply the rents, after deducting management expenses, to&nbsp; the payment of the mortgagee&nbsp; debt and on 28 September 1933&nbsp; the mortgagee&nbsp; foreclosed the mortgage .extrajudicially and purchased the whole&nbsp; property at public auction sale&nbsp; for P1,363,555.37 (Exhibits L and L-l).&nbsp; The mortgagor having&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to redeem&nbsp; the property,&nbsp; the mortgagee consolidated its title and&nbsp; the certificate of title Nos. 40177&nbsp; (Exhibit K) and 41127&nbsp; (Exhibit K-l)&nbsp; in the name of Tavera-Luna,&nbsp; Inc. were&nbsp; cancelled and&nbsp; in lieu thereof transfer certificates of&nbsp; title Nos. 59596&nbsp; (Exhibit M),&nbsp; and 59570&nbsp; (Exhibit M-l were&nbsp; issued in the&nbsp; name of the mortgagee, El Hogar Filipino, Inc. on&nbsp; 12 August 1940.&nbsp; On 26&nbsp; August 1943, nearly nine&nbsp; months after the filing of the&nbsp; original&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case, El&nbsp; Hogar Filipino, Inc. .sold the whole property to Magdalena Estate, Inc.&nbsp; for P1,400,000 in Japanese&nbsp; war&nbsp; notes (Exhibit&nbsp; P). The&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name of&nbsp; El Hogar Filipino, Inc. Nos. 59569&nbsp; and&nbsp; 59570 (Exhibits M&nbsp; and M-l) were cancelled and. lieu thereof transfer&nbsp; certificates of title&nbsp; Nos. 67102 and&nbsp; 67103 were issued in&nbsp; the name of&nbsp; Magdalena Estate,&nbsp; Inc. on&nbsp; 26 August 1943&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibits Qiand Q-l). On 22 September 1943 Magdalena Estate, Inc. "sold one third undivided share in the property to Ernest Berg for P466,S66.66&nbsp; in in Japanese war notes&nbsp; (Exhibit R).<br><br>On 17 November 1942, Carmen&nbsp; Pardo de Tavera y Lopez Manzano brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to annul the transfer&nbsp; of her&nbsp; right,&nbsp; share and interest in the property made by&nbsp; her&nbsp; guardian&nbsp; to Tavera- Luna, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before judgment could be rendered by the&nbsp; Court, the battle for liberation of Manila&nbsp; supervened: and&nbsp; the record&nbsp; of the case was destroyed.&nbsp; After reconstitution&nbsp; of the record of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; amendment to the pleadings&nbsp; to&nbsp; include the Magdalena Estate,&nbsp; Inc. and Ernest Berg to party-defendants&nbsp; and trial on the merits, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment annulling the&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; probate court that had granted authority to the guardian of the&nbsp; plaintiff to transfer her ward's right, share interest in the parcel of land to Tavera- Luna,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; the transfer&nbsp; thereof pursuant&nbsp; thereto; the transfers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the ward's share in the&nbsp; property&nbsp; to El Hogar Filipino,&nbsp; Inc., Magdalena&nbsp; Estate, Inc.&nbsp; and Ernest Berg; the certificates of title issued to the transferees in so far as the ward's share in the&nbsp; property is&nbsp; concerned; and ordering cancellation of transfer&nbsp; certificates issued to the transferees&nbsp; and&nbsp; issuance of new&nbsp; ones in the name of the transferees&nbsp; and&nbsp; the plaintiff with the&nbsp; statement&nbsp; in&nbsp; the certificates to be&nbsp; issued that plaintiff's share in the property is two-ninths,&nbsp; free from&nbsp; any lien or&nbsp; encumbrance,&nbsp; and accounting of the income collected by the transferees during the periods of their respective possession of the property and payment or&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; to&nbsp; the, plaintiff in&nbsp; so far as her share in the property is&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendants have appealed.<br><br>The point that&nbsp; the plaintiff's&nbsp; action&nbsp; is barred by&nbsp; the statute of limitations is no longer urged,&nbsp; because the plaintiff became&nbsp; of age and released from guardianship&nbsp; on 19 November 1940 (Exhibit N-l and 0-1) and the action was brought on 17 November 1942, or&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; period provided for in section 579, Act No. 190, which says:<br><blockquote>No action for the recovery of any estate sold by a guardian&nbsp; can be maintained by the "ward, or by any person claiming under him, unless it is commenced within three years next&nbsp; after the termination of the guardianship,&nbsp; or, when a legal disability to sue&nbsp; exists by reason of minority or otherwise, at&nbsp; the time when&nbsp; the cause of action accrues, within three years next after&nbsp; the removal of such disability.<br></blockquote>The plaintiff&nbsp; contends and the trial court&nbsp; sustained&nbsp; her claim that the&nbsp; order of the probate court of&nbsp; 28&nbsp; August 1930&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; E-l) is a&nbsp; nullity because the provisions of section 569,&nbsp; Act No. 190, the law then in&nbsp; force, were not complied with and for that reason&nbsp; the probate court was without jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; order the transfer of&nbsp; her share in the property to the corporation to be organized and' formed.&nbsp; She&nbsp; alleges&nbsp; and argues that as the petition which brought about the entry of the order of the probate court of 28&nbsp; August 930 was not verified; it did&nbsp; not&nbsp; set forth the&nbsp; condition of&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; of the ward&nbsp; and&nbsp; the facts and circumstances&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; was founded&nbsp; tending to show&nbsp; the necessity&nbsp; or expediency of the sale&nbsp; (transfer) ; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; did not direct "the next of&nbsp; kin&nbsp; to the&nbsp; ward,&nbsp; and all&nbsp; persons&nbsp; interested in&nbsp; the estate, to appear before the judge or court, at the time and place therein&nbsp; specified, not less&nbsp; than four nor more than eight weeks from the time of making such order, to show cause why an order&nbsp; should not be granted&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sale or&nbsp; such estate,"&nbsp; the&nbsp; order is a&nbsp; nullity for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction&nbsp; of the court issuing it.<br><br>That&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; in guardianship&nbsp; proceedings No. 34154 entitled "Tutela de la menor&nbsp; Carmen Pardo de Tavera y Lopez&nbsp; Manzano," had&nbsp; jurisdiction over the petition&nbsp; filed by the guardian admits&nbsp; of no boubt.&nbsp; Only upon the ground&nbsp; of lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; may&nbsp; an order entered&nbsp; by&nbsp; a court be&nbsp; assailed collaterally.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the court had jurisdiction, -irregularities in the proceedings which would or could invalidate the court's order may be&nbsp; assailed directly&nbsp; by means of an appeal but not collaterally,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>&nbsp; Lack of verification of. a&nbsp; petition filed&nbsp; in a probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; for the sale of&nbsp; real property&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to the&nbsp; estate of a minor is not a jurisdictional defect.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>&nbsp; It should have been attacked directly and&nbsp; not&nbsp; collaterally.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In her petition the guardian alleged that the transfer of her ward's share in&nbsp; the property&nbsp; to the corporation then to be organized would be to&nbsp; or for her benefit and she expected that the construction&nbsp; of a new&nbsp; building would enhance the value of&nbsp; her ward's share in the&nbsp; property and increase&nbsp; her income (Exhibits D-l and D-2).&nbsp; No other consideration or motive could have prompted the guardian, mother of the minor, to file the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not necessary for a grant of authority&nbsp; to the guardian to sell the estate of the ward to&nbsp; state&nbsp; that the income "is insufficient to maintain the ward and his family or to&nbsp; maintain or educate the ward when a&nbsp; minor."&nbsp; It is enough,&nbsp; as the other&nbsp; alternative of the law provides, that "it appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; the satisfaction of the court that it&nbsp; is for the benefit of the ward that his real&nbsp; estate or some part thereof should be sold, and the proceeds thereof put&nbsp; out at&nbsp; interest, or invested&nbsp; in some productive security."<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</span></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition of the guardian falls&nbsp; under the last quoted part&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 569, Act No. 190.&nbsp; That part of the section, requiring the probate court to enter an order directing the next of kin to the ward and all persons interested in the estate to appear before the court at a time and place therein specified, was substantially&nbsp; complied with, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; next kin&nbsp; to&nbsp; the ward was her own guardian and mother and&nbsp; all persons interested in the estate of the ward were her uncles and aunt&nbsp; who&nbsp; agreed to make the transfer of their respective shares in&nbsp; the&nbsp; property to the corporation,&nbsp; Tavera-Luna, Inc.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; "next&nbsp; of kin" are those whose relationship is such that they are&nbsp; entitled to share in the estate as distributees.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</span></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no creditors to the ward's&nbsp; estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice to "the next&nbsp; of&nbsp; kin to&nbsp; the ward, and&nbsp; all persons&nbsp; interested in&nbsp; the estate,&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; before&nbsp; the judge or court, at the time&nbsp; and place therein specified," was not necessary, because the next&nbsp; of&nbsp; kin to the ward and all persons&nbsp; interested in the estate were&nbsp; her mother and guardian, uncles and aunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these&nbsp; circumstances we&nbsp; are of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that that&nbsp; part of the provision of section 569, Act No. 190, has been complied with. Hearing on the&nbsp; petition, as required in said section does not necessarily mean that witnesses testify&nbsp; or documents be produced or&nbsp; exhibited.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; court be satisfied that the allegations of the petition are true and the interested persons tor&nbsp; close&nbsp; relatives&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ward did not&nbsp; object because they&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; were interested in&nbsp; the&nbsp; scheme to organize a corporation to&nbsp; which&nbsp; all their shares&nbsp; in the property&nbsp; were to be&nbsp; transferred,&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the law on&nbsp; hearing were also complied with.&nbsp; The conclusion arrived at renders it unnecessary for us to pass upon the question whether El&nbsp; Hogar&nbsp; Filipino,&nbsp; Inc. was a purchaser for value and in good faith.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that even if the loan was granted&nbsp; when the certificate of title was still&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of&nbsp; the plaintiff and her co-owners,&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan was&nbsp; applied&nbsp; for by. an entity that was in the process of organization&nbsp; and by the same persons&nbsp; who&nbsp; were the&nbsp; registered owners&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property, the mortgagee was&nbsp; entitled to rely upon&nbsp; the order of the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; granting authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; the guardian to make the transfer of the share of her ward in the property and was not bound to&nbsp; inquire further to find out&nbsp; whether there were irregularities&nbsp; committed&nbsp; or defects&nbsp; or vices that would render&nbsp; the order&nbsp; null and void.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> So&nbsp; also the question whether&nbsp; the action&nbsp; brought by Carlos Pardo de Tavera y Cembrano in his&nbsp; own behalf and in behalf of the minor, the herein plaintiff-appellee, is res judiecda need not be passed upon.&nbsp; Certainly, it would be awkward&nbsp; for this Court to&nbsp; review a final decree&nbsp; or judgment which upheld the validity&nbsp; of the mortgage&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; appellant, El Hogar Filipino, Inc.,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; Carlos Pardo de Tavera&nbsp; and&nbsp; Carmen Pardo de Tavera&nbsp; Manzano<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs. </span>El Hogar&nbsp; Filipino,&nbsp; Inc., 68&nbsp; Phil., 712, and to declare null and void the order of the probate court as&nbsp; far as the share in the property of the minor is concerned,&nbsp; a declaration which&nbsp; would&nbsp; partly&nbsp; reopen, review, reverse&nbsp; or set&nbsp; aside that final decree or judgment rendered by this Court.<br><br>This action would not have been brought if&nbsp; the scheme and plan of the organizers or incorporators of the Tavera-Luna, Inc.&nbsp; should have met with success.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is reversed, the complaint dismissed,&nbsp; with costs against the appellee.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angela, Labrador, Concepcion </i>and <i>Reyes, J.
