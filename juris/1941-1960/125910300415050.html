				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In Civil  Case No.  3186 of the  Court of First  Instance of Negros Occidental, Fidela Morin Vda. de MarbeUa versus Victorino Kilayko, et al., judgment was rendered finding plaintiff  to be  rightful  heir  to  the  properties left by the  deceased Matias Morin,  and  ordering defendants  to reconvey and deliver to her all  properties  belonging to the estate that they  might have received,  with  their fruits, and in case of defendants' failure to comply, to pay plaintiff their value at the  time they were  disposed of.  The estate of  the  deceased  was, likewise,  ordered  placed  under receivership.</p>
<p>From the above decision,  defendants Kilaykos, et al., appealed to this Court (G.  R. No. L-11141).  During the pendency  of the  appeal, and  upon petition  of  plaintiff Morin Vda. de MarbeUa, Leopoldo Anoche was,  on June 6, 1956, appointed by ttye trial court receiver of the properties under litigation.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1956, receiver Anoche filed a P5,000 bond subscribed by himself as  principal and the Luzon  Surety Co.  as  surety.  Whereupon, Anoche took his oath  and entered into his duties as receiver.</p>
<p>On June 27, 1958, this Court rendered judgment in G. R. L-11141 Vda. de Marbella  <em>vs</em>. Kilayko,  et al, (104 Phil.. 41; 56 Off. Gaz., 1672) affirming with some modifications the  decision  appealed from.  This decision  became final and executory on August 6,1958, and the case was remanded to the jcourt a quo for execution.</p>
<p>On March  16, 1959, receiver Anoche filed with the court below his final statement of accounts.  On April 21, 1959, plaintiff Morin  Vda.  de  Marbella filed'a motion praying among other things, for  the confiscation of  the bond of the receiver, because the latter  had admitted that part of the money and  some  titles turned over to him were missing or unaccounted for.   On April 28,  1959, the lower court ordered the receiver  to answer plaintiff's charges, and  to deposit with the clerk of court all  the cash in his possession.  Complying with this order,  the receiver filed his  answer, stating among  other things  that  he  could no longer return any  cash to  the court because he had  no more money  in  his possession.  Whereupon,  on  May  20, 1959, the  court issued an  order  endorsing  the case to the  provincial fiscal for investigation, with a view to  the filing of a criminal complaint  against  the  receiver  for misappropriation; and on August 22, 1959, the court issued another order, stating that  "the defendants are not responsible for  the restitution o,f the amount"  delivered to the receiver, "it  appearing that the receiver was appointed at the instance of the plaintiff," and ordering that  a writ of execution  be issued "for the  amount  posted  by  the receiver".  Pursuant to this order, the provincial  sheriff served on  September 28, 1959, upon the Luzon  Surety Company, Inc., the corresponding writ of execution against the  receiver's bond, and to  enforce said writ, garnished the  account of  the surety  company with  the Philippine Trust Co.</p>
<p>Claming that the proceedings  taken  against its bond, having been made without prior notice to it and in violation of the procedure outlined  in  section 20, Rule  59, in conjunction with section 9, Rule 61, of the Rules of Court, are null and void, the Luzon Surety Co., Inc., filed on October 16, 1959 the present petition for  certiorari with this Court.  Upon petitioner's motion  and the filing of a bond in the amount of Pl,000, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction  to enjoin the execution proceedings  against it in the court below.</p>
<p>We  find no merit  in the surety's contention that the proceedings leading to the issuance of the writ of execution against the receiver's bond  are null and void  in so far as the same is sought  to be enforced against  it,  because of non-compliance with the procedure laid down in section 20, Rule  59, in conjunction with section 9, Rule 61,  of the Rules of Court.  As correctly pointed out by respendont, this procedure  is to be followed only in the execration of a  bond filed by <em>either  party</em> in the case where the receiver is appointed,  but  not in the  execution  of  the receiver's bond, which is filed by the receiver himself'and his surety.   This is clear from the provisions of section 9, Rule 61, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  9. <em>Judgment  to include recovery against sureties.</em>â€”The amount, if any, to be awarded to either party <em>upon any bond filed by the other</em> in accordance  with the provisions of this rule, shall be claimed,  ascertained, and  granted  under  the same procedure  ag prescribed  in section 20 of Rule 59."  (Italics, supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the procedure  outlined in Rule 59, section 20, is required to be followed only in proceedings against the bond filed  by the  applicant  for receivership, which answers for the damages that the adverse party may sustain by reason of the appointment of a  receiver in case the applicant shall  have  procured  the  appointment  without sufficient cause  (sec. 3, Rule 61), or against the counter-bond  posted by the party  opposing the appointment  of the receiver, conditioned to pay all  the damages the applicant  may  suffer by reason of the  acts, omissions,  or other matters in the application for receivership  (sec. 4, <em>supra</em>).  Bonds filed  by the parties to cases are different and  should be distinguished  from the  bond filed by the receiver under section 5 of  Rule 61, "executed to  such person and in such sum as  the court or judge may direct, to the effect that he will faithfully discharge the duties of receiver in the action and  obey the  orders of the court therein."   Damages for improperly procuring a receivership, or on a counterbond,  cannot be recovered  upon any bond filed by either party unless they are claimed and ascertained in the same action, with due notice to the surety, pursuant to section 20, Rule 59 (Sec.  9, RUle 61;  Yap Unki <em>vs</em>. Chua Jamco, 14 Phil., 602; Monteverde <em>vs</em>. Nakata,  30 Phil., 608; Nava <em>vs</em>. Hofilena, 53 Phil., 738; Visayan Surety &amp; Ins. Cor. <em>vs</em>. Pascual, 85 Phil., 779; 47 Off. Gaz., 5075; Liberty Construction Supply Co. <em>vs</em>.  Pecson, 89 Phil., 50). Where, however, the  damages sought to be recovered arose from the misconduct or negligence  of the receiver  himself  in relation  to the discharge of his  official  duties, no one  is responsible therefor but  the  receiver  and his sureties  (De la Riva <em>vs</em>. Molina, 32 Phil.,  277,  281-282), and for these damages, the  bond given by them is valid  and enforceable (De la Rosa <em>vs</em>.  De  Borja,  53 Phil., 990).  The court below having found in this  case that the  receiver had failed to  return to the court  or account for certain properties and cash in  his official custody, the petitioner,  as surety on the receiver's bond, is of course liable on said bond.</p>
<p>That petitioner is  liable on its bond does not, however, mean that execution may issue  against it  without prior notice of the action or proceeding to hold  it liable on its bond, and without giving it its day in court.  The solidary nature of its liability as surety on the receiver's  bond does not imply that it can  be condemned to pay without a hearing.   Solidarity simply dispenses with the necessity  of levying first upon the property of the principal (beneficio de  excusion).   As  held  by  this  Court in  the  case of Agusan <em>vs</em>. Velasquez, 88 Phil., 357:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"* * * It  seems elementary that before being condemned to pay, it was the elementary right of the surety to be heard and to  be informed that  the party seeking indemnity would hold it Uable and was going to prove the grounds and extent of its liability.</em> This case is different from those in which the surety, by law and/or by the terms of his Contract, has  promised to abide by the judgment against the principal and renounced  the right to be sued or cited.</p>
  <p><em>That the liability  of the surety and the principal fonder  the term of the bond is joint and seii&amp;ral has nothing to do with the case.</em> The objection is  purely procedural.  <em>The materiality of the question of joint and several obligation does not come into play until both principal and surety have legally been adjudged liable by a lawful judgment entered after due hearing."</em>   (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides,  a solidary debtor may avail himself of all defenses which are derived from the nature of the obligation and of those which are personal to him, or pertain to his own share; and even of  those personal to the other co-debtors, as regards their shares  in the debt (Art.  1222, Civil Code).  If a solidary debtor, such as petitioner herein under  its  surety  bond,  is  considered  concluded  by the judgment against  its  co-debtor, without even notifying it of the  action  or proceeding against the latter, he would be deprived of the  right and  opportunity to set  up any defenses which it may have  against  liability on  their solidary undertaking.</p>
<p>Respondents  argue, however, that  certiorari does not lie where the petitioner did not apply  for the  relief sought in the court of origin to give it an opportunity to correct its  supposed error,  and  as petitioner  did  not file any motion for  reconsideration of the order of execution against its bond in the  court below, but immediately applied for certiorari with this court, the writ should  be denied.  It is true  that  a  motion  for reconsideration  in  the  court below  has  often  been considered  a  condition  precedent for the granting of  the writ of certiorari.   This rule is not without exception, however.   Thus, it has been  held that the rule does not apply where the order or judgment subject of review is a patent nullity (Director of Lands <em>vs</em>. Santamaria, 44  Phil., 594).   We think the deprivation of petitioner's fundamental right to due process, which taints the proceedings against it in  the court below  not  only with irregularity but with nullity, and  the fact that execution had already been issued against it and its account with the Philippine Trust Co. already garnished, so  that it was a matter of extreme urgency to petitioner that relief against the execution order  be immediately  obtained, are sufficient reasons to bring this case outside  the  purview of the  above-mentioned rule.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the order of execution against petitioner is hereby set aside for being null and void, and the records are remanded  to the  court of origin for a hearing on the question of petitioner's liability under the receiver's bond. Costs against  respondent Fidela Morin de Marbella.</p>
