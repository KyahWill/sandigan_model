				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the government from&nbsp; a decision of the Court of First Instance of Antique, granting two separate petitions for naturalization of the brothers, Raymundo Pe and Fortunato Pe.<p>Raymundo Pe and Fortunato Pe filed separate petitions for naturalization in the Antique court.&nbsp; Attached to each petition were&nbsp; the affidavits&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same two&nbsp; character witnesses, Panfilo Chua and Gerardo Agravante.&nbsp; The opposition filed by the provincial fiscal&nbsp; was based on the ground that the applicants did not have the qualifications required by law.&nbsp; After due publication&nbsp; of the petitions, and after&nbsp; a joint hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial rendered&nbsp; separate decisions granting the two&nbsp; petitions&nbsp; for naturalization. As already stated,&nbsp; the provincial fiscal&nbsp; appealed from said decisions.</p><p>The trial court found that both brothers&nbsp; possessed all the qualifications and&nbsp; none of&nbsp; the disqualifications&nbsp; for naturalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the court's findings are the following:&nbsp; Both Raymundo and Fortunato, 26 years old and 25 years old&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; were born in&nbsp; Guisijan,&nbsp; Laua-an, Antique, and were baptized&nbsp; at the Aglipayan Church of that barrio.&nbsp; They finished their&nbsp; elementary course at the Laua-an Elementary School,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the secondary course, at the Central Philippine College, recognized by the government.&nbsp; They both studied at&nbsp; the Mapua Institute of Technology from where&nbsp; Raymundo obtained&nbsp; an Engineering degree. Fortunato, at the time of the hearing, was a 3rd year mechanical&nbsp; engineering student.&nbsp; Raymundo is&nbsp; now employed as manager of the Davao branch of the National Merchandizing&nbsp; Corporation at a&nbsp; salary of P300 a month. He has P5,500&nbsp; in the bank.&nbsp; Fortunato is employed&nbsp; as a salesman of the Vimes Trading Corporation&nbsp; in Manila, with a salary of P150 a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has P4,000 deposited in the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two brothers had always resided in Laua-an, Antique, except when they studied in Manila, although in&nbsp; 1936 they went to visit their grandmother in China and&nbsp; returned to Antique in 1938.&nbsp;&nbsp; They both speak and write English and Visayan and a little Tagalog.&nbsp; They have&nbsp; mingled&nbsp; socially&nbsp; with&nbsp; Filipinos&nbsp; and have adopted Filipino ways and customs.</p><p>The only ground of the appeal of the government is that at the hearing,&nbsp; only one of the character witnesses named Gerardo Agravante, testified&nbsp; for the applicants.&nbsp; In place of Panfilo Chua, the other character witness whose affidavit was attached to the two&nbsp; petitions, Provincial Governor Calixto O. Zaldivar of Antique, testified for the applicants. He said that he had known the two brothers since 1934 specially since he was a&nbsp; member of the faculty of the Central Philippine College, when they were students there and he vouched&nbsp; for their good character.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the theory of&nbsp; the&nbsp; government&nbsp; that the affidavits of&nbsp; character&nbsp; witnesses attached&nbsp; to a petition of&nbsp; naturalization form part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; application&nbsp; and&nbsp; that to&nbsp; substitute witnesses for any or both&nbsp; of said character witnesses to testify at the hearing, would be amending the application;&nbsp; and that, furthermore, to&nbsp; do that, would be to deprive the government of the opportunity to check up on the new witnesses, find out their background and&nbsp; determine whether they really were in a position to know the applicants so as to be&nbsp; able to vouch&nbsp; for their good character.</p><p>We realize&nbsp; that&nbsp; in previous naturalization cases,&nbsp; this court has held that the two character&nbsp; witnesses required by&nbsp; law, whose affidavits should be attached to the application for naturalization,&nbsp; must be presented to&nbsp; testify at the trial, unless there is some valid reason why they or anyone of them&nbsp; could not testify, and in case of a justified change&nbsp; or substitution, the new witness or witnesses must be competent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, the reason why character witness&nbsp; as Panfilo Chua could&nbsp; not&nbsp; testify at the hearing was because he died shortly before said hearing. That&nbsp; certainly was a valid excuse.&nbsp; The government could not well allege that it had no time to check up on the new or&nbsp; substitute witness so as&nbsp; to determine his background and his opportunity to know the applicants and his competency as&nbsp; a witness&nbsp; because as already&nbsp; stated, he&nbsp; was the Provincial Governor of the province,&nbsp; well known, and whose competency and&nbsp; background could not be doubted. Moreover,&nbsp; at the hearing, the provincial fiscal,&nbsp; in representation of the government, did not raise any&nbsp; objection to the substitution of witnesses and to Governor Zaldivar taking&nbsp; the witness&nbsp; stand.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; contrary,&nbsp; he cross examined the witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; From all this,&nbsp; we are&nbsp; satisfied that&nbsp; there has&nbsp; been&nbsp; a&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; compliance with the requirements of&nbsp; the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p><p>In view of the foregoing, the appealed decisions granting the&nbsp; petitions for naturalization of Raymundo Pe and Fortunato Pe, are hereby&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; No costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
