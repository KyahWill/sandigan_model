D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Auditor General rendered 
on March 21, 1952, denying the claim of petitioners for the refund of the 
royalty fees paid by them to the Sugar Quota Office in the amount of P4,950, 
P205,675.55, and P38,009.30, respectively.
<p>On July 2, 1946, Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 278 making it unlawful 
for any person, association or corporation to export to any destination 
agricultural or industrial products, merchandise, articles, materials and 
supplies without a permit from the President of the Philippines. Section 2 of 
this Act confers upon the President authority to "regulate, curtail, control, 
and prohibit the exportation of materials abroad and to issue such rules and 
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, through 
such department or office as he may designate."</p>
<p>On July 10, 1946, the President, acting upon the authority vested in him by 
Commonwealth Act No. 728, promulgated Executive Order No. 3, prohibiting the 
exportation of certain materials enumerated in section 1 thereof, but allowing 
the exportation of other merchandise, like scrap metals, provided an export 
license is first obtained from the Philippine Sugar Administration. And on 
November 1, 1946, section 2 of Executive Order No 3 was amended by Executive 
Order No. 23 fixing the export license fee to be charged for the exportation of 
merchandise, including scrap metals, allowed in said Executive Order No. 3.</p>
<p>On April 24, 1947, the Chief of the Executive Office, by authority of the 
President, sent a communication to the Philippine Sugar Administration 
authorizing the exportation of scrap metals upon payment by the applicant of a 
fee of P10 per ton of the metals to be exported. Subsequently, the Cabinet, upon 
recommendation of the National Development Company, approved a resolution fixing 
the schedule of royalty rates to be charged on metal exports.</p>
<p>Petitioners herein, on several occasions, exported large amounts of scrap 
metals for which they paid by way of license fees and royalties the sum of 
P248,634.85. This amount was collected by the Sugar Quota Office under the 
authority granted to it by the Chief of the Executive Office and the resolution 
of the Cabinet above mentioned.</p>
<p>On November 17, 1949 and September 26, 1950, respectively, petitioners filed 
formal claims with the Auditor General for the refund of said license fees and 
royalties on the ground (a,) that Commonwealth Act No. 728 does not authorize 
their collection; (6) that he Cabinet has no authority to provide for such 
collection and therefore its resolution of October 24, 1947 is null and void; 
and (c) that Commonwealth Act No. 728 is inoperative being an export law not 
approved by the President of the United States pursuant to the provision of the 
Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Philippines.</p>
<p>On May 21, 1952, the Auditor General denied the claims for refund and from 
this decision petitioners interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>It should be stated that the present case is similar to the one recently 
decided by this Court,—Marc Donnelly &amp; Associates, Inc. <em>vs</em>. Manuel 
Agregado, et al., (92 Phil., 152)—wherein the issues raised are practically the 
same as those involved herein and wherein this Court held that the collection by 
the Government of the license and royalty fees in question was valid and legal. 
For the purposes of this decision, it would suffice for us to incorporate herein 
by reference what we said in the decision rendered in the above mentioned 
case.</p>
<p>There is, however, one question raised herein which was not raised in the 
previous case which has reference to the alleged invalidity of Commonwealth Act 
No. 728 on the ground that it being an export law the same was not approved by 
the President of the United States pursuant to the provision of the Ordinance 
appended to our Constitution.</p>
<p>The record, it is true, shows that petitioners in their claim for refund 
filed with the Auditor General maintained that said Act was inoperative because 
it has never been submitted to the President of the United States for approval, 
but there is no showing by competent evidence that such is the fact in order 
that such claim may merit consideration. On the other hand, it appears that 
Commonwealth Act No. 728 was approved on July 2, 1946 and the Executive Orders 
of the President of the Philippines implementing said Act were issued much after 
the proclamation of the Philippine Republic, and it is to be presumed that the 
President has acted on the matter knowing that the law has been complied with. 
At any rate, even granting <em>arguendo</em> that the claim is correct, We are 
of the opinion that petitioners are now estopped or prevented from setting up 
the invalidity or urrconstitutionality of Commonwealth Act No. 728 it appearing 
that they had acted thereon, or invoked the benefits deriving therefrom, when 
they applied for the exportation of scrap metals as provided for in said Act. It 
has been held that "a person who obtains a license under a law, and seeks for a 
time to enjoy the benefits thereof, cannot afterwards, and when the license is 
sought to be revoked, question the constitutionality of the act." (Cooley's 
Constitutional Limitations, Vol. I, pp. 369-370.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Generally, one who, tinder the requirements of a statute or ordinance, 
applies for and accepts, together with its attendant benefits, a license or 
permit, of a franchise, or a certificate of public convenience and necessity, if 
the application and acceptance are voluntarily made, cannot thereafter attack 
the statute or ordinance containing the requirement as unconstitutional, * * *." 
(16 C.J.S., pp. 192-193.)</p>
<p>"While one will not be estopped to deny the validity of a taxing statute 
which has already been declared unconstitutional at the instance of other 
parties, one may, by his acts or omissions, waive the protection against 
unlawful taxation afforded by a constitutional provision, or may be estopped to 
raise constitutional objections to the validity of a taxing statute, or a. 
statute imposing a lien for failure to pay assessments. Thus, one who has 
availed himself of the benefits of a tax bill or who has invoked a provision 
thereof, is precluded from attacking its constitutionality." (16, C.J.S., pp. 
193-194.)</p>
<p>"There are cases where a law in its application to a particular case must be 
sustained, because the party who makes objection has, by prior action, precluded 
himself from being heard against it. Where a constitutional provision is 
designed for the protection solely of the property rights of the citizen, it is 
competent for him to waive the protection and to consent to such action as would 
be invalid if taken against his will. On this ground it has been held that an 
act appropriating the private property of one person for the private purposes of 
another, on compensation made was valid if he whose property was taken assented 
thereto; and that he did assent and waive the constitutional privilege, if he 
received the compensation awarded, or brought an action to recover it. So if an 
act providing for the appropriation of property for a public use shall authorize 
more to be taken than the use requires, although such act would be void, without 
the owner's assent, yet with it all objection on the ground of 
unconstitutionality is removed. (So a person who obtains a license under a law, 
and seeks for a time to enjoy the benefits thereof, cannot afterwards, and when 
the license is sought to be revoked, question the constitutionality of the act." 
(Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol. I, pp. 868-370.)</p></blockquote>
