				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Arsenio Napagao was charged with homicide in a complaint filed with the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Oton, Iloilo. As the accused waived his right to 
preliminary investigation, the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance 
of Iloilo. Thereupon the provincial fiscal conducted a preliminary 
investigation, with the result that an information was filed not only against 
Arsenio Napagao but also against Benjamin Napagao and Bernan Napagao. The latter 
two filed a motion to quash, alleging that the preliminary investigation 
conducted by the provincial fiscal was irregular and violative of Republic Act 
No. 732, in that they were not present at said investigation. Over the 
opposition filed by the fiscal, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed 
the information as against Benjamin and Bernan Napagao who were ordered 
released. The prosecution has appealed.</p>
<p>In case of Lozada <em>vs</em>. Hernandez, et al., (92 Phil., 1051), decided 
on April 29, 1953, we already hinted that the provincial fiscal is not required 
to give notice of the preliminary investigation so that the accused may be 
present thereat, unless the accused has made the proper request. In the portion 
pertinent to the issue herein involved, Republic Act No. 732 provides as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A provincial fiscal shall have authority to conduct investigation into the 
matter of any crime or misdemeanor and have the necessary information or 
complaint prepared or made against persons charged with the commission of the 
same. If the offense charged falls within the original jurisdiction of the Court 
of First Instance, the defendant shall not be entitled as a matter of right to 
preliminary investigation in any case where the provincial fiscal himself, after 
due investigation of the facts <em>made in the presence of the accused if the 
latter so requested</em>, shall have presented an information against him in 
proper form and certified under oath by the said provincial fiscal that he 
conducted a proper preliminary investigation. To this end, he may, with due 
notice to the accused, summon reputed witnesses and require them to appear 
before him and testify and be cross-examined under oath by the accused upon the 
latter's request. The attendance or evidence of absent or recalcitrant witnesses 
who may be summoned or whose testimony may be required by the provincial fiscal 
under the authority herein conferred shall be enforced by proper process upon 
application to be made by the provincial fiscal to any Judge of First Instance 
of the Judicial District. But no witness summoned to testify under this section 
shall be compelled to give testimony to incriminate himself."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is quite obvious from the foregoing provision that the legal duty of the 
provincial fiscal to notify the accused of the preliminary investigation, arises 
only after the latter expressly requests that said investigation be made in his 
presence. Counsel for defendants-appellees, in contending otherwise, stresses 
the fact that the above quoted provision recites that "to this end, he may, with 
due notice to the accused, summon reputed witnesses and require them to appear 
before him and testify and be cross-examined under oath by the accused upon the 
latter's request," and "that the attendance or evidence of absence or 
recalcitrant witnesses who may be summoned or whose testimony may be required by 
the provincial fiscal * * * shall be enforced by the proper process upon 
application to be made by the provincial fiscal to any Judge of the First 
Instance of the Judicial District." Insamuch, however, as the sentences referred 
to by counsel for defendants-appellees, are introduced by the phrase "to this 
end", they are to be construed in relation to the preceding provision, namely, 
that the accused should make the corresponding request if he desires to be 
present at the investigation. The clause "if the latter so requested," appearing 
in the second sentence of the above quoted provision of Republic Act No. 732 
would be meaningless, if in all cases the fiscal is bound4 to notify and require 
the presence of the accused.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order is reversed and the case remanded to the Court 
of First Instance of Iloilo for further proceedings. So ordered, without 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
