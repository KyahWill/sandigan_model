				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals'&nbsp; decision requiring Domingo R. Acasio to vacate certain premises belonging to the Corporacion de los PP. Dominicos de Filipinas.<br><br>The facts found by said&nbsp; Court, are the&nbsp; following:<br><br>"The plaintiff corporation is the owner&nbsp; of a house situated at No. 651-A Invernes, Sta. Ana, Manila, which was leased to a certain Esteban Garcia&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; monthly rent of P75.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two&nbsp; of the rooms in&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; house&nbsp; were in turn sub-leased by the lessee to&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses Domingo' R. Acasio and Vicenta Tengco Acasio, who were paying there- for&nbsp; a monthly&nbsp; rent&nbsp; of&nbsp; P25.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; Esteban Garcia gave notice to the sublessees to&nbsp; vacate the premises and upon their refusal to do so tiled an action for&nbsp; illegal detainer&nbsp; against them (Civil Case No. 11813, Court of First Instance of Manila).&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp; reason of certain equitable facts and circumstances which&nbsp; the court found to have been established in that case, it dismissed the complaint for illegal detainer in&nbsp; its decision dated&nbsp; January 9, 1952&nbsp; (Exhibit 6).&nbsp; Esteban&nbsp; Garcia left the premises at the end of that month and on the following February 5 Mrs. Acasio&nbsp; went to the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Jose A.&nbsp; Francisco, Trust Officer of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, which was&nbsp; administering the properties of the plaintiff corporation, and asked that&nbsp; the house in question be leased&nbsp; to her.&nbsp; Informed that the rent would be increased to P100, she&nbsp; asked that she be&nbsp; given a few&nbsp; days within which to consult with her husband; but when Francisco said that unless&nbsp; the terms were immediately accepted&nbsp; the&nbsp; house might be given to somebody else, she paid the increased rent for February, although with a certain degree of reluctance (Exhibit C).<br><br>"Evidently the husband was not satisfied with the arrangement,&nbsp; for on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; day, February 5, 1952,&nbsp; he wrote a letter&nbsp; to the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of the Bank of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; as administrator&nbsp; of the plaintiff's&nbsp; properties, protesting against the&nbsp; increase&nbsp; from P75 to P100 (Exhibit 3).&nbsp; The letter was received on February 11 and on February 19 a reply was sent to Mrs. Acasio, stating that the rent could not be reduced in view of the increase in the assessed value of the property and of the improvements&nbsp; which&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; made thereon.&nbsp; Because of the subsequent refusal of the lessees to pay P100&nbsp; and their insistence on&nbsp; paying&nbsp; only&nbsp; P75, the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action for ejectment was filed against Domingo&nbsp; R.&nbsp; Acasio in the Municipal Court of Manila on&nbsp; September 18,&nbsp; 1952 and later on appealed to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance, which rendered&nbsp; judgment on&nbsp; March 21,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; dispositive portion&nbsp; of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>'In view whereof, the Court renders&nbsp; judgment declaring that defendant shall have&nbsp; the right to continue the&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of th6 premises&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; July&nbsp; 31, 1953, paying the&nbsp; rental&nbsp; of P75 each month; ordering&nbsp; the defendant to pay that amount of P75 each month to plaintiff; and authorizing plaintiff to collect the deposits made by defendant of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respective&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; previously due; condemning defendant&nbsp; further to&nbsp; pay P100 a month from July 31, 1953, and should defendant fail to do so, ordering him to leave the premises. The counterclaim is dismissed. There&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; no pronouncement as to costs.'"</blockquote>On appeal to it, the Court of Appeals&nbsp; held that Acasio's refusal to pay the&nbsp; rent&nbsp; of P100 violated the terms of the lease,&nbsp; and gave&nbsp; the corporation the right to eject. Wherefore it ordered him to vacate the premises and pay P100 monthly from March 1,&nbsp; 1952.<br><br>The court of first instance, it appears, found defendant and his wife&nbsp; to be "the occupants ever since the Japanese times of the&nbsp; property, and continued to be so up to 1952, and remained as such&nbsp; up to&nbsp; the present".&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; on that ground it allowed them to continue leasing the premises for more time, at&nbsp; a monthly rent of P75&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with Article&nbsp; 1687 of the New Civil Code which provides.<br><blockquote>"If the period of the lease has not been fixed,&nbsp; it is understood to be from year to&nbsp; year, if the rent agreed upon&nbsp; is annual; from month to month, if&nbsp; it is monthly; from week to week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid daily. However, even&nbsp; though&nbsp; a monthly rent is paid,&nbsp; and no period for the lease has been set, the courts may fixed a longer&nbsp; term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for over&nbsp; one year. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)</blockquote>However the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; declared that&nbsp; even&nbsp; If the spouses&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; the lessees&nbsp; before April 4, 1945, they ceased to be so on that date, when&nbsp; they&nbsp; were taken for detention by the Counter Intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; Corps of the United States Army.&nbsp; "Since then, said&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; ''it was Esteban Garcia who became the lessee and who paid the monthly&nbsp; rents until the&nbsp; end of January,&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; (Exhibit E); and after the herein&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; and his wife were released from detention in&nbsp; October&nbsp; 1945 they&nbsp; became mere sub-lessees&nbsp; of two rooms in the house, paying a rental to the sub-lessor of F25 a month,"<br><br>This request&nbsp; for&nbsp; revision&nbsp; was entertained partly&nbsp; because&nbsp; Acasio insisted he was the lessee despite his&nbsp; detention in 1945, and partly because the controversy&nbsp; involved the innovation introduced by the New Civil Code in its article 1687&nbsp; herein before quoted.<br><br>However,&nbsp; after full consideration&nbsp; of the matter upon the record and the&nbsp; briefs, we found no way to uphold petitioner's&nbsp; insistence&nbsp; on being the&nbsp; lessee, not only&nbsp; because&nbsp; the appellate court specifically declared&nbsp; that beginning April 1945 the lessee was Esteban Garcia, and that Acasio became the sub-lessee who subsequently paid rents as such&nbsp; to said Garcia1, but also because if Acasio&nbsp; had been really the lessee,&nbsp; his wife would not have repaired to the office of the corporation, on&nbsp; February 5, 1952, to ask "that the house in question be leased to her".<br><br>We notice in this regard that Acasio does not question his wife's authority to&nbsp; bind him by&nbsp; he» acts.&nbsp; He only argues that her payment of P100 as found by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals did not constitute an&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; (of lease) "for it&nbsp; was made under circumstances that certainly negated consent" referring, obviously, to her paying&nbsp; "with a certain degree of .reluctance".&nbsp; Nevertheless, as pointed out in appellee's&nbsp; brief, such reluctance did not have the legal effect of preventing the formation of a contract.<br><blockquote>"There&nbsp; must, then, be a distinction to&nbsp; be made between&nbsp; a&nbsp; case where a&nbsp; person gives his&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> consent reluctantly</span> and&nbsp; even against his good&nbsp; sense&nbsp; and judgment, and&nbsp; where he, in&nbsp; reality,&nbsp; gives no consent at all, as where he executes a contract or performs&nbsp; an act against his&nbsp; will under a pressure&nbsp; which' he cannot resist.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; clear that one acts as voluntarily and independently in the&nbsp; eye of the law when he acts <span style="font-style: italic;">reluctantly</span> and with&nbsp; hesitation as&nbsp; when he acts&nbsp; spontaneously&nbsp; and joyously.&nbsp; Legally&nbsp; speaking&nbsp; he&nbsp; acts as voluntarily and freely when he acts wholly against his better sense and judgment as when he acts in conformity with them.&nbsp; Between the two acts there is&nbsp; no difference in law."&nbsp; (Vales vs.&nbsp; Villa, 35 Phil. 789.)</blockquote>Her conformity gave rise to a now contract of lease between the corporation and the Acasios—not a&nbsp; renewal oi a previous lease.&nbsp; The latter, therefore, could not, after&nbsp; one month as lessees ask for a "longer term".<br><br>Appellant, enlarged on the proposition that his capacity as "occupant" since 1945—if&nbsp; not as lessee—entitled him to the benefits&nbsp; of article 1687, inasmuch as the&nbsp; purpose of said&nbsp; article is to&nbsp; protect&nbsp; the&nbsp; occupants&nbsp; "from&nbsp; loss of shelter" by&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner's&nbsp; arbitrary&nbsp; action.&nbsp; As we see it, the article refers to "lessee", i. e., one&nbsp; who has a contract of lease with the owner;&nbsp; it&nbsp; does not contemplate sub-lessees&nbsp; having&nbsp; no contractual&nbsp; relations&nbsp; with&nbsp; such owner,&nbsp; much&nbsp; less&nbsp; a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; occupant. Otherwise&nbsp; even "squatters"&nbsp; or&nbsp; deforciants may&nbsp; stand on&nbsp; the&nbsp; privilege of "extension",&nbsp; which obviously may not&nbsp; be granted, because there&nbsp; was never a term to be&nbsp; extended, and because the law should&nbsp; not be,presumed&nbsp; to encourage bad faith.<br><br>In&nbsp; this connection, it should&nbsp; be&nbsp; observed, that&nbsp; under section 1687 the power of the courts to "fix a longer term for the lease" is protestative or&nbsp; discretionary,—"may" is the word—to&nbsp; be exercised or not in accordance with the particular circumstances of the&nbsp; case;&nbsp; a&nbsp; longer term to be granted&nbsp; where equities come into play demanding extension, to&nbsp; be&nbsp; denied&nbsp; where none&nbsp; appear, always&nbsp; with due&nbsp; deference to the parties" freedom&nbsp; to&nbsp; contract.&nbsp; Now then, supposing, for the sake of argument, the petitioner to be a "lessee" from 1945 to 1952,&nbsp; the Court of Appeals' decision amounted to a denial of extension.&nbsp; Was there abuse of discretion?&nbsp; No particulars are shown requiring or justifying extension, except the&nbsp; alleged unreasonableness of the increased rental charges, from P75&nbsp; to P100.&nbsp; However, it appearing that the monthly rent of P75 had been paid&nbsp; since&nbsp; 1948 we do not think&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; could&nbsp; be criticized for&nbsp; demanding a higher compensation, bearing in mind the downward trend of the&nbsp; value of the local currency with consequent rising&nbsp; prices and the' "increase in the assessed value of the property and&nbsp; of the improvements which had been made thereon"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>One final,&nbsp; and&nbsp; conclusive&nbsp; viewpoint&nbsp; If petitioner's theory be followed&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; the lessee all&nbsp; the time from 1945&nbsp; to 1952,&nbsp; his lease would then be a contract entered into before the passage of the New Civil Code, when the right to extension of the lease did&nbsp; not exist. Hence petitioner may not plead&nbsp; it&nbsp; at&nbsp; this time so as to affect obligations previously contracted.&nbsp; Articles 2252 and 2255 of the same New Civil Code clearly so provide.<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 2252,—Changes made and new&nbsp; provisions and rules laid down by this Code which may&nbsp; prejudice or impair vested&nbsp; or acquired rights in&nbsp; accordance with the old legislation&nbsp; shall have no retroactive effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br><br>Art. 2255.—The former laws&nbsp; shall&nbsp; regulate acts&nbsp; and contracts with a condition or period,&nbsp; which were executed or entered into before the effectivity of&nbsp; this Code, even though the condition or period may still be pending at the time&nbsp; this body of laws&nbsp; goes into effect."</blockquote>Wherefore, the decision under review is affirmed with costs against petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
