				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 9, 1954, upon charges filed by herein respondent Eulogio P. 
Flores, and after preliminary investigation, a complaint for unfair labor 
practice was filed m the Court of Industrial Relations by an acting prosecutor 
of that court against Erlanger and Galinger, Inc., a corporation organized under 
Philippine laws and its general manager, L. B. Nestle. The complaint alleged 
that the corporation and general manager, thru their officers, supervisors and 
agents, initiated and assisted in the formation of a labor organization composed 
of their employees and supervisors known as the Kontiki Employees Association 
and continuously thereafter interfered with its administration, supported, 
controlled and dominated it, thereby violating the employees' right to 
self-organization as provided for in section 3 of Republic Act 875; that on or 
about July 10, 1954, by reason of the union activities of complainant Eulogio P. 
Fiores after he was employed by respondents as credit investigator-collector, 
particularly his efforts as legal adviser of the Association, ,fhe latter 
summarily and discriminatorily discharged him and appointed to his posi-ti|n two 
persons receiving higher salaries; and that after sara discharge, respondents 
also threatened to dismiss Gerardo Cruz and Victor Torio, president and 
vice-president of the Association.
<p>Answering the complaint, the herein petitioners, thru counsel, denied the 
charge of unfair labor practice and as special defenses alleged that the 
separation of Eulogio P. Fiores was justified, and that the filing of the 
complaint by an acting prosecutor of the Industrial Court was vio-lative of the 
law on due process. The issues having thus been joined, the case was.assigned 
for hearing. Thereafter, Atty. Pedro Perez, one of the examiners, submitted his 
report. After examining the record, Associate Judge Emilio C. Tabigne of the 
Industrial Court, found the findings,of fact and conclusions arrived at by Mr. 
Perez in his report to be fully supported by the evidence, and adopting the 
same, rendered decision finding the company and its manager guilty of unfair 
labor practice as charged and ordering them" to cease and desist therefrom and 
to reinstate immediately Eulogio P. Flores to his former position, with back 
salaries from the date he was discharged until he is fully reinstated, less 
whatever earnings he might have received elsewhere during his discriminatory 
lay-off.</p>
<p>Not satisfied, the respondents filed a motion for reconsideration and new 
trial, alleging that the decision is contrary to law and the evidence adduced at 
the trial. They also alleged that after the case had been submitted for 
decision, the company was constrained to disband its personnel in its radio and 
refrigerator departments as the Central Bank banned the importation of radios 
and did not grant to it dollar allocations for the importations of refrigerators 
(both of which items constituted the great bulk of the company's business during 
the employment of Flores), so that to recreate the former position of Flores as 
credit investigator-collector pursuant to the decision to reinstate him would 
not only be unjustifiable but entirely unjust. Finding the motion meritorious, 
the court en bane, under date pn May 10, 1957, resolved to remand the record of 
the case to the trial court for the reception of additional evidence.</p>
<p>A hearing was accordingly conducted, this time through Hearing Examiner 
Mariano Tuason. After the parties had submitted memorandum and reply memorandum 
in support of their respective positions, the Industrial Court in an order dated 
November 14, 1958 affirmed its finding that the respondents were' guilty of the 
unfair labor practice acts complained of and that the motivating factor that led 
to the dismissal of Eulogio Flores was his union activities. Observing, however, 
that the business of the company had suffered a recession and that its 
collectible accounts had suffered a sharp and continuous decline in view of the 
banning of the importation of finished radio and refrigerator, the court 
modified its previous decision by eliminating therefrom its order to reinstate 
Flores and merely requiring the company to pay him back wages from July 10, 1954 
to June 30, 1957, inclusive, less whatever he may have earned within said 
period. After the lower court <em>en banc</em> denied their final motion for 
reconsideration, the company and its manager brought the case to this Court for 
review.</p>
<p>Petitioners in the first place question the manner in which the prosecution 
of the case had been conducted, alleging that with the filing of the complaint 
by the very same acting prosecutor of the Industrial Court who conducted the 
preliminary investigation, the reception of evidence by hearing examiners of the 
same court, and the adoption by Judge Tabigne of the report of Hearing-Examiner 
Pedro Perez, the said Industrial Court assumed the role of accuser, prosecutor 
and judge at the same time. We find the objection to be without legal basis. The 
procedure followed by the Industrial Court was in accordance with section 5(b) 
of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), which reads In part as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Whenever it is charged by an offended party or his representative that 
any person engaged or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the Court 
or any agency or agent designated by tiie Court must investigate such charge and 
shall have the power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a 
complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice of hearing 
before the Court or a member thereof, or before a designated Hearing Examiner at 
the time and place fixed therein not less than five nor more than ten days after 
serving the said complaint. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the above legal provision, it is apparent that the Court of Industrial 
Relations, in the exercise of its investigatory powers, in unfair labor practice 
cases, may designate its acting prosecutor to conduct an investigation of the 
charges filed by the aggrieved party, and later have the complaint filed on the 
basis of the result of said investigation, requiring the respondent to file his 
answer and then hear both parties thru designated hearing examiners. Such 
procedure has been sanctioned by this Court in the case of Natioinal Printing 
Workers <em>vs</em>. Asia Printing, et al. (99 Phil., 589; 52 Off. Gaz., [12] 
5858). It is true that the prosecutors and hearing examiners are officers of the 
court. Their functions and duties as such are, however, well defined in the law 
and their findings are not conclusive upon the Industrial Court, which has the 
discretion to accept or reject them. There is, therefore, no reason to fear that 
the parties who undergo trial under the procedure as above stated are denied the 
constitutional guarantee of due process.</p>
<p>The fact that the decision rendered by the court was based upon the report of 
Hearing Examiner Perez who heard the evidence only in part is of no moment, for 
the court below studied and examined not only the evidence received by said 
hearing examiner but also that presented before the others and found that the 
findings and conclusions contained in the report conform to its own. This court 
has already ruled in the case of Indias <em>vs</em>. Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. 
(101 Phil., 297; 54 Qff. Gaz., [6] .1817), that "where the Court of Industrial 
Relations approved the report of the hearing examiner after a perusal of the 
record of the case, this pre-supposes that it had examined the evidence and 
found no justification in modifying his findings and conclusions. It is not 
necessary for the court to make fn the order its own discussion of the evidence 
or its own findings of fact."</p>
<p>Petitioners also contend that the Industrial Court erred in awarding back 
wages to respondent Eulogio P. Flores because during his employment he used 
company time for his private interest. To support this contention, petitioners 
cite the testimony given by said respondent's wife in Civil Case No. 24387 of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila that during the period from August, 1953 
to July, 1954, her husband helped her at their store in Divisoria. Said 
testimony, however, was not admitted as evidence by the lower court, and we 
think correctly, for the witness was not presented in court and there is no 
showing that she is deceased, or out of the Philippines, or unable to testify 
(Sec. 37, Rule 123, Rules of Court.). At any rate, assuming that respondent 
Eulogio P. Flores, during his employment with the company, actually helped his 
wife in the latter's business, it has not been shown that this had in any way 
adversely affected the work of said respondent as credit investigator-collector. 
As a matter of fact, the said respondent was once given by the company a reward 
fojritns good work and efficiency.</p>
<p>Neither may it validly be argued that the recession in the business of the 
company should defeat respondent Eulogio P. Flores' right to back wages. The 
unfavorable conditions in the company's business and the consequent reduction of 
its collectible accounts, as held by the lower court, may not justify 
reinstatement, but they certainly are not sufficient grounds to deny back wages 
to respondent Stores who was illegally dismissed on account of union 
activities.. To hold otherwise would render the provisions of the Industrial 
Peace Act on unfair labor practice nugatory.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision and order of the Court of Industrial Relations are 
affirmed, with- costs against the petitioners.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon,,JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision and order affirmed.</em></p></div>
