				<H3>RAMON  J.  GUICO, PETITIONER, VS. ESTATE  OF FLORENCIO P. BUAN, OPPOSITOR AND RESPONDENT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 6, 1954, Ramon J. Guico&nbsp; applied for a certificate&nbsp; of public&nbsp; convenience for the operation&nbsp; of a bus&nbsp; service&nbsp; on the following lines:<br><blockquote>Bangued&nbsp; (Abra)-Manila&nbsp; and vice versa;<br>Laoag (Ilocos&nbsp; Norte)-Manila and&nbsp; vice versa;<br>Vigan (Ilocos&nbsp; Sur)-Manila and&nbsp; vice&nbsp; versa;<br>Aparri&nbsp; (Cagayan)-Manila via&nbsp; Claveria&nbsp; and vice versa.<br></blockquote>At the&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; the last, <i>i.e.</i>, the Aparri-Manila line&nbsp; was dropped from the application.<br><br>On the 17 of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; month, the Estate&nbsp; of Florencio P. Buan, which was&nbsp; already operating on the lines&nbsp; applied for,&nbsp; on&nbsp; its part&nbsp; asked for authority&nbsp; to run&nbsp; additional trips&nbsp; on those lines and later&nbsp; filed, its opposition to Guico's application.<br><br>Equally&nbsp; opposed by the other transportation companies affected—among them the Manila Railroad Company and the Pangasinan Transportation Company—the two&nbsp; applications were, by agreement of the parties, heard in joint trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Commission having&nbsp; found after hearing that there really was need for&nbsp; more trips&nbsp; on&nbsp; the lines covered by the applications, albeit the need was not such as to warrant&nbsp; the operation of all the trips proposed by the two applicants, it authorized an additional&nbsp; 11&nbsp; round trips&nbsp; a day, being of the opinion after going&nbsp; over&nbsp; the evidence and&nbsp; its own records&nbsp; that&nbsp; those&nbsp; 11 trips,&nbsp; distributed&nbsp; as follows:&nbsp; 4 on the line&nbsp; Laoag-Manila, 5 on the line Vigan-Manila and 2 on the line Bangued-Manila, would provide the additional service needed by the public.<br><br>In choosing,&nbsp; however, the operator that was to run the additional trips, the Commission expressed preference for the Estate of Buan as the one with the means and the requisite capacity and experience to maintain the&nbsp; same and also because, as the&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; operator on&nbsp; the lines, it should under the doctrine of protection, be given&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; provide&nbsp; the additional service that&nbsp; had been found to be needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the additional trips authorized were therefore, adjudged to the&nbsp; said Estate.<br><br>Not satisfied with the decision,&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; Guico brought the case here for review.<br><br>As stated, the Commission recognizes&nbsp; the need for more service on the lines in question but&nbsp; after&nbsp; going&nbsp; over the evidence and its&nbsp; own records concludes that 11 round trips a day should suffice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner disputes&nbsp; this&nbsp; conclusion and claims that,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the basis of&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence presented, more trips should&nbsp; have been authorized.&nbsp; We consider&nbsp; the&nbsp; question&nbsp; thus&nbsp; raised&nbsp; factual&nbsp; and find no justification for revising the&nbsp; Commission's&nbsp; estimate, the same not being without&nbsp; support in&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this connection we have&nbsp; to give recognition to the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; number of- trips that&nbsp; would be required&nbsp; to&nbsp; endow a bus line&nbsp; with adequate service is something&nbsp; that&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be determined or&nbsp; estimated with&nbsp; precision.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is Subject to&nbsp; many&nbsp; variables and,&nbsp; too often, parties&nbsp; base their estimates on the observation and testimony of more or less&nbsp; interested&nbsp; witnesses.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; the Commission, which exercises supervision over these public utilities&nbsp; and&nbsp; has,&nbsp; besides,&nbsp; ready&nbsp; access&nbsp; to&nbsp; information contained in its own records, of which it may take judicial notice, is peculiarly in a position&nbsp; to&nbsp; appraise the needs of&nbsp; any given&nbsp; line&nbsp; and form a fair estimate as to&nbsp; the number&nbsp; of&nbsp; trips necessary&nbsp; to meet those needs.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the circumstances, we should do well&nbsp; to&nbsp; defer to the judgment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; in&nbsp; that regard&nbsp; and refrain from interfering with the exercise of its discretion except where it clearly&nbsp; appears that such discretion&nbsp; has been gravely abused.&nbsp; After going over&nbsp; the record we do&nbsp; not feel that the present case calls for such&nbsp; interference.<br><br>It is&nbsp; contended,&nbsp; however, that it was not right&nbsp; for the&nbsp; Commission to adjudge all of&nbsp; the authorized additional&nbsp; trips to respondent,&nbsp; it&nbsp; being&nbsp; claimed&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; has&nbsp; no&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of' public&nbsp; convenience&nbsp; for&nbsp; the line Vigan-Manila; that petitioner should have been given the&nbsp; preference&nbsp; because his&nbsp; application was&nbsp; filed ahead of that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; petitioner's evidence rather than&nbsp; respondent's&nbsp; that proved&nbsp; the need for&nbsp; additional&nbsp; service.<br><br>It may be true,&nbsp; as claimed,&nbsp; that respondent has&nbsp; no certificate&nbsp; of public convenience exclusively for the&nbsp; line Vigan-Manila alone.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no' disputing the fact that respondent has a certificate for the&nbsp; line Aparri- Manila via Claveria&nbsp; and Vigan, and&nbsp; protection of&nbsp; this line should extend&nbsp; to all&nbsp; of its&nbsp; parts,&nbsp; including the portion Vigan-Manila on which,&nbsp; according to the Commission, respondent&nbsp; is&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; (presumably under the same certificate)&nbsp; to&nbsp; run&nbsp; three&nbsp; round trips&nbsp; daily,&nbsp; an&nbsp; arrangement which virtually makes Vigan an intermediate&nbsp; station or&nbsp; terminal&nbsp; for&nbsp; the authorized line&nbsp; Aparri-Manila.<br><br>Respondent's right&nbsp; to protection&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; established operator on the lines&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; defeated by mere priority in the filing of the&nbsp; application of&nbsp; the newcomer.&nbsp; Note must especially&nbsp; be taken of&nbsp; the fact that the lines—Laoag-Manila, Vigan-Manila and Bangued- Manila are hundreds of kilometers&nbsp; long and,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; the Commission,&nbsp; require new&nbsp; and well-built&nbsp; trucks and an operator with ample means,&nbsp; such as the respondent, if a regular and continuous&nbsp; service&nbsp; is to be maintained.<br><br>The Commission has also observed that the small operators on these&nbsp; lines have not been operating regularly so that their services have been unreliable.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Commission has&nbsp; found that the&nbsp; respondent has been operating since 1952&nbsp; and has maintained service regularly and in accordance with the terms of its&nbsp; certificate.&nbsp; It says:<br><blockquote>"* * *&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears that applicant Estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Buan&nbsp; has been operating on these lines since 1952 and&nbsp; that it has maintained its service regularly and in accordance -with the terms of its certificate, and such being the case&nbsp; it should&nbsp; be&nbsp; given&nbsp; the opportunity to provide the necessary additional&nbsp; service in preference&nbsp; to&nbsp; another who has no authority or certificate to operate on the lines involved. Furthermore,&nbsp; applicant Estate of Buan,&nbsp; according to the evidence, has the experience,&nbsp; trained personnel&nbsp; and&nbsp; capital&nbsp; necessary to undertake a bus service&nbsp; of this nature which will require not only a big investment to start the&nbsp; service but the financial capacity to maintain the service regularly, to replace worn-out equipment and to answer&nbsp; for&nbsp; obligations to the&nbsp; public."<br></blockquote>The charge that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; has&nbsp; abandoned&nbsp; its trips on&nbsp; parts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the line Vigan-Aparri&nbsp; does not necessarily speak&nbsp; ill&nbsp; of respondent's service considering the explanation given that the&nbsp; abandonment was&nbsp; due to the bad condition,of the&nbsp; road to Aparri, and, moreover, the alleged abandonment is on&nbsp; the line&nbsp; excluded by applicant from his application.<br><br>Petitioner is not necessarily entitled to preference just because, as&nbsp; he alleges, it was&nbsp; his&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; rather than respondent's, that established the fact that there was still need for&nbsp; additional service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose evidence it&nbsp; was that proved such&nbsp; need is&nbsp; not important.&nbsp; What is important is whose operation&nbsp; would best subserve the public&nbsp; interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that score&nbsp; we find no&nbsp; sufficient justification for&nbsp; not&nbsp; respecting the&nbsp; opinion of&nbsp; the Commission&nbsp; that the&nbsp; additional service in this case could best be operated by the respondent.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing, the decision&nbsp; under&nbsp; review is affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C, J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.. Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
