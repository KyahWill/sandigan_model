				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff Mathew S.&nbsp; Tee seeks to recover, from defendants Tacloban Electric&nbsp; and Ice Plant Co.,&nbsp; Inc., Victoriano Chan and&nbsp; Chan Bun Chit, the amount&nbsp; of P48,700&nbsp; representing ten&nbsp; (10%)&nbsp; per cent of a $243,500 allocation allegedly&nbsp; secured by said plaintiff from the Central Bank of the Philippines— in addition to the sum of P10,000, by way of expenses of litigation and attorney's fees,&nbsp; with costs against said defendants.&nbsp; In&nbsp; paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and&nbsp; 5 of his complaint plaintiff alleges that:<br><blockquote>"2. On or about August, 1955,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Tacloban&nbsp; Electric and Ice Plant Co., Inc.,&nbsp; acting through defendants Chan Bun Chit and Victoriano Chan,&nbsp; approached&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and, informing him that they&nbsp; needed foreign exchange allocation&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; of machineries and&nbsp; other supplies for the&nbsp; expansion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tacloban Electric and Ice Plant&nbsp; Co., Inc., they requested&nbsp; plaintiff to prepare, file and work&nbsp; for the approval of the application for the said foreign exchange, knowing plaintiff had much experience therein, and promising to pay plaintiff the usual fee&nbsp; for his work, to which plaintiff agreed.<br>"3. In compliance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; said agreement,&nbsp; plaintiff worked for a period&nbsp; of&nbsp; six&nbsp; (6) months, more&nbsp; or less,&nbsp; accomplishing&nbsp; papers, filing them and following up the papers in the different government offices to which they were referred in order to obtain the necessary foreign exchange allocation, as a result of which the Central&nbsp; Bank granted&nbsp; an&nbsp; allocation of ($243,500.00)&nbsp; two&nbsp; hundred forty-three THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED&nbsp; DOLLARS;<br>"4. The usual, standard fee for the services performed by plaintiff&nbsp; is&nbsp; ten&nbsp; per centum&nbsp; (10%)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allocation obtained, which in this case amounts to (P48,700.00)&nbsp; FORTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PESOS;<br>"5.&nbsp; Plaintiff has&nbsp; demanded payment from defendants, but the latter have&nbsp; failed&nbsp; and refused,&nbsp; without justifiable&nbsp; cause, to comply with plaintiff's demands."<br></blockquote>Defendants filed separate&nbsp; motions&nbsp; to dismiss,&nbsp;&nbsp; predicated upon&nbsp; the ground, among others, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract referred to&nbsp; in the complaint is null and&nbsp; void <i>ab&nbsp; initio.</i> After&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; proceedings,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp;&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila granted&nbsp; these&nbsp; motions&nbsp; and dismissed the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, this&nbsp; appeal by&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; who maintains that:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiff's complaint, without&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; to&nbsp; answer&nbsp; or hearing&nbsp; plaintiff's evidence, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that plaintiff's demand for&nbsp; compensation for the services he&nbsp; had&nbsp; rendered in preparing and working for the approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants'&nbsp; application&nbsp; for foreign exchange is 'unenforceable under the statute of frauds' because 'of the denials of defendants to recognize that said services&nbsp; have been rendered in their favor and benefit'.&nbsp; (Resolution, Record on Appeal, p. 120.)<br>"2. The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; further&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; ruling, without&nbsp; giving plaintiff an&nbsp; opportunity to present his&nbsp; evidence, and despite&nbsp; the allegations of plaintiff's complaint to the contrary, that 'it was&nbsp; not he (plaintiff) who had obtained the dollar allocation&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants' (Record on&nbsp; Appeal, pp.&nbsp; 121-122),&nbsp; and for that reason, dismissing his complaint. <br>"3. The trial court&nbsp; likewise erred in dismissing plaintiff's complaint on the ground that the aforesaid contract 'is invalid and void' because it is 'contrary&nbsp; to law and public morals' (Record on Appeal, p. 121).<br>"4. The trial court&nbsp; finally erred&nbsp; in dismissing the complaint as to defendants Victoriano Chan and&nbsp; Chan Bun Chit, on the ground that&nbsp; they acted merely 'as intermediaries&nbsp; or attorney in&nbsp; fact of the&nbsp; defendant Tacloban Electric and Ice Plant,&nbsp; Inc., and, at&nbsp; the same time,&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the complaint as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Tacloban Electric &amp; Ice Plant,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; because it could not be held liable&nbsp; for the&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of an&nbsp; agent or&nbsp; intermediary (Record on Appeal,&nbsp; pp. 122-123)."<br></blockquote>The main issue in this case is&nbsp; the validity of the contract&nbsp; relied upon&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court pronounced it void&nbsp; in&nbsp; the following language:<br><blockquote>"It is gleaned from&nbsp; the above cited paragraphs of the complaint that a contract of agency existed between plaintiff and defendants. Such contract being contrary to law and public morals&nbsp; same is invalid and void&nbsp; and&nbsp; could not therefore be enforced against&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; Article 1409 of&nbsp; the Civil Code&nbsp; prohibits&nbsp; such&nbsp; contract and Section&nbsp; 14 of the Central Bank Charter and Act 265 of&nbsp; the Republic prohibit&nbsp; and&nbsp; punish any person&nbsp; except the interested party&nbsp; to work for and in behalf of the&nbsp; party interested to obtain dollar allocation's approval.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff being&nbsp; not only prohibited by&nbsp; law&nbsp; for&nbsp; being&nbsp; against&nbsp; public policy and morals but likewise punishable by&nbsp; the same legal&nbsp; provisions, said claim is void and unenforceable."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record&nbsp; on&nbsp; Appeal,&nbsp; 121.)<br></blockquote>We are fully in agreement&nbsp; with this view.&nbsp; According to&nbsp; plaintiff's complaint, he agreed "to prepare, file and work for,&nbsp; the approval&nbsp; of the application"&nbsp; for foreign exchange of the Tacloban Electric &amp;&nbsp; Ice Plant Co., Inc., and "in compliance" with said agreement, he "worked for", and secured the corresponding allocation,&nbsp; "accomplishing the papers, filing them, and <i>following up&nbsp; the papers in&nbsp; the different government offices&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; they were referred."</i><br><br>Section 3 of Article IV of Central Bank Circular No. 44, provides:<br><blockquote>"Authorized Agent Banks&nbsp; are hereby instructed to&nbsp; inform their clients that <i>under no circumstances should any applicant, his agent or other representatives, follow up an application with the Central Bank&nbsp; or the Bankers Committee</i>.&nbsp; All information concerning applications, including actions taken thereon by the Monetary Board or the Bankers' Committee, shall be&nbsp; communicated to the applicants <i>by their respective Authorized Agent Banks.</i>"&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; circular, all applications for foreign exchange shall&nbsp; be made through&nbsp; authorized agent banks, which are&nbsp; the&nbsp; only parties&nbsp; authorized to&nbsp; deal with the Central Bank&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bankers&nbsp; Committee&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection therewith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistently with&nbsp; this&nbsp; scheme, plan&nbsp; or pattern,&nbsp; the circular declares that, "under no&nbsp; circumstances should any applicant, his agent, and <i>representatives</i> follow up&nbsp; an&nbsp; application with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank."&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff's alleged contract to work for the&nbsp; approval of the foreign exchange application in question and the services he claims to have performed in pursuance of&nbsp; this contract, "following up the papers in&nbsp; the different government offices to which they were referred"— one&nbsp; of which is the Central Bank— are&nbsp; inconsistent with the&nbsp; law&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 265,&nbsp; as amended) creating the Central&nbsp; Bank" upon the authority of which the&nbsp; circular&nbsp; above&nbsp; mentioned was issued— and, hence,&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; policy&nbsp; thus adopted.&nbsp; In short, said contract&nbsp; is "in-existent and void from the beginning."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Article 1409&nbsp; (1),&nbsp; Civil Code of the Philippines).<br><br>Besides, the agreement under consideration is contrary to good customs and public order, for public interest demands that&nbsp; applications for foreign exchange be considered,&nbsp; acted upon and disposed of strictly on the basis of the merits&nbsp; and&nbsp; demerits of each case.&nbsp; In other words, the exigencies&nbsp; of public welfare require&nbsp; that the proceedings for the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of said&nbsp; applications&nbsp; be conducted in the most&nbsp; impersonal&nbsp; and impartial manner to forestall&nbsp; favoritism or the commission&nbsp; of other irregularities in relation thereto,&nbsp; or, at least, to minimize&nbsp; the opportunities&nbsp; therefor or the&nbsp; possibility thereof—which is, evidently, the purpose of the aforementioned circular, requiring&nbsp; that&nbsp; all&nbsp; applications for&nbsp; foreign exchange be filed with agent banks and that all representations relative thereto&nbsp; be&nbsp; made, not by the "applicant, his agent or other representative",&nbsp; but through&nbsp; said agent banks.<br><blockquote>"El orden publico, que no signified aqui el&nbsp; material&nbsp; mantenimiento de la paz publica,&nbsp; represents, el&nbsp; interes publico, social y de ley en&nbsp; el derecho privado, lo&nbsp; permanente y essencial de&nbsp; las instituckmes, lo que, aun favoreciendo&nbsp; a&nbsp; algun&nbsp; individuo&nbsp; en quien se concreta al derecho,&nbsp; no puede quedar&nbsp; a&nbsp; su arbitrio."&nbsp; (Manresa, 5.a ed,&nbsp; Tomo VIII, Volumen II, p. 289.)<br><br>"Sec. 167. <i>Generally</i>.— *&nbsp; * * It is a general rule that agreements against public policy ,are illegal and void.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the principles relating to the doctrine of public policy, as applied&nbsp; to the law of contracts, courts of justice will not recognize or uphold any transaction which,&nbsp; in its object, operation, or tendency, is calculated to be prejudicial to the public welfare, to&nbsp; sound morality, or to civic honesty. The&nbsp; test&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether the parties have stipulated&nbsp; for something inhibited by the law or inimical to, or inconsistent with, the&nbsp; public welfare.&nbsp; An&nbsp; agreement is&nbsp; against public&nbsp; policy&nbsp; if&nbsp; it is injurious to the interests of the&nbsp; public, contravenes some established interest of&nbsp; society,&nbsp; violates&nbsp; some public statute, is&nbsp; against good&nbsp; morals, tends to interfere with the public&nbsp; welfare&nbsp; or safety, or as it is sometimes put, if it is at war with the interests of society and is in conflict with&nbsp; the&nbsp; morals of the time.&nbsp; An&nbsp; agreement either to&nbsp; do anything which,&nbsp; or not to do&nbsp; anything the omission of&nbsp; which, is&nbsp; in any degree,&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly injurious to the&nbsp; public&nbsp; and an agreement&nbsp; of such a nature that it&nbsp; cannot be carried&nbsp; into execution without reaching&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; exercising an injurious influence&nbsp; over the community&nbsp; at large are&nbsp; against public policy.&nbsp; There&nbsp; are&nbsp; many things which&nbsp; the law&nbsp; does not prohibit, in the sense of attaching&nbsp; penalties, but which are so mischievous in their nature and tendency&nbsp; that on grounds of public policy they cannot be admitted as the&nbsp; subject of a valid contract.&nbsp; The question whether a contract is against public policy depends upon its purpose and tendency, and not upon&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; no harm results from it.&nbsp; In&nbsp; other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; all&nbsp; agreements the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; which is to create a situation which&nbsp; tends to operate to the detriment of the public interest are against public policy and void, whether in the&nbsp;&nbsp; particular case the purpose of the agreement is or is not effectuated. For&nbsp; a particular undertaking&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; against public&nbsp; policy actual injury need not be shown; it is enough if the potentialities for harm are present.&nbsp; * * *" (12 Am. Jr., pp. 663-664.)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; renders a determination&nbsp; of the other issues raised in the&nbsp; appeal unnecessary.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant.&nbsp; Let the Solicitor General&nbsp; be&nbsp; furnished&nbsp; a certified&nbsp; copy of this decision&nbsp; for such&nbsp; action, if&nbsp; any, as may be&nbsp; appropriate under pertinent laws.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.&nbsp; </div>
