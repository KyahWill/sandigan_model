				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for mandamus filed by Carlos Ledesrna et al., petitioners, to compel  the Court of Tax Appeals to proceed with the determination of the petition for review (Court of Tax  Appeals  Case No.  226)  filed  with  it by the same  petitioners herein  and to  annul  the resolution of  said   Tax  Court  of July 31,  1956,  dismissing  said petition for review. <br><br>Petitioners are owners of  Hacienda Fortuna,  composed of  36 parcels  of land,  situated in  San Carlos,  Negros Occidental, originally belonging  to the spouses  Julio  Ledesma and  Florentina  Ledesma,  which they  purchased on  July  9, 1948.  On March 22, 1950,  the  Collector of Internal  Revenue, later  on referred  to as the  Collector, assessed on  Hacienda Fortuna an income tax  alleged to be due for the year 1949, in the amount  of  P23,704.22, including surcharges and penalties,  claiming the  Hacienda to be an  unregistered  general  copartnership,  with  the petitioner  as  the  unregistered  copartners.  Petitioners equally  claim  that  they  were  mere  co-owners   <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span>  of  the property,  and  so  were  not liable  for the amount included in the assessment.  By a ruling dated March 12, 1955, the Collector overruled petitioner's contention,  as well as a subsequent motion for reconsideration,  in  a letter dated  December 20, 1955.  On January 3, 1956, petitioners filed the petition aforementioned in the Court of Tax  Appeals, docketed as Case No. 226. <br><br>However,  on March 22, 1955, before the filing of the petition  for review of  this ruling  with the  Tax Court, the collector filed a civil action against  the  petitioners in the Court of First Instance  of Negros  Occidental, for the collection of the same assessment for  the year 1949, which action was docketed as Civil Case  No. 3373.  On January 14, 1956, the  Collector filed a  motion  with the Tax  Court to  dismiss  the petition  for review,  alleging the pendency of  Civil Case No. 3373 before the Negros Occidental court, and claiming the same to constitute a bar to the petition for  review on  the  ground that the  two actions involved the same parties, the same subject matter, and the same cause of  action. <br><br>On July 31,  1956, the  Tax Court issued the  resolution dismissing the petition for review.   We quote a certain portion of the resolution: <br><blockquote>"The said Court of First  Instance having acquired jurisdiction over the assessment in controversy prior to the institution of this case,  we  therefore believe  that such fact has deprived  this  Court of the right to entertain the present petition for review covering the same cause of action,  for a judgment in Civil Case No. 3373 would constitute  res  adjudicata between  parties."  (Annex  "E").</blockquote> Later, the Tax Court denied a motion for reconsideration of  its resolution.  Petitioners  also  filed a  motion in the Negros  Occidental court to remand Civil  Case  No. 3373 to the Tax Court, pursuant to Section 22 of Republic Act No. 1125, which reads  as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 22. <span style="font-style: italic;">Pending cases to  be remanded to  court.</span>—All cases involving disputed assessment of  Internal Revenue  taxes or customs duties pending determination before  the  Court of  First  Instance shall be remanded by the respective clerk  of court to Court of Tax Appeals for disposition thereof",</blockquote>which motion is still pending action  in said Negros Occidental court. For purposes of reference, we are reproducing Sections 7  and 11 of Republic Act  No.  1125,  creating  the Court of Tax Appeals:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jurisdiction</span>.—The Court of Tax  Appeals shall exercise exclusive  appellate jurisdiction  to review  by appeal,  as herein provided— <br><br>(1) Decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal  revenue  taxes, fees  or other  charges,  penalties imposed in  relation thereto,  or other  matters  arising under  the National Internal Revenue  Code or other law or part of law administered by  the Bureau of Internal Revenue;       <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*   *   *   *   *   * <br></div><br>"Sec. 11. <span style="font-style: italic;">Who may  appeal;  effect of  appeal</span>.—Any person, association  or corporation adversely affected by  a decision or ruling of the Collector of Internal Revenue, the Collector  of Customs  or any provincial  or  city Board of Assessment Appeals may file an appeal in the Court of  Tax  Appeals within thirty  days after the receipt of such decision or ruling."</blockquote>From the  above legal  provisions, there is no  question that  petitioners had the right to appeal from the  ruling or  decision   of  the  Collector assessing the  income tax against  them, to the  Court  of Tax  Appeals  and  that the latter had exclusive appellate jurisdiction over said appeal. If the petitioner were  not  allowed to  appeal from  said ruling, the latter would become final.   It  was, therefore, to their  interest to keep alive said appeal and if  possible, to have  the  appealed ruling or  decision of  the Collector reviewed.  It is true that  an action  involving the  same parties,  the same subject matter and the  same cause of action is  pending in  the  Negros  Occidental  court; but we understand  that  the  main purpose  of the  enactment of Republic  Act No.  1125,  creating  the  Court of  Tax Appeals, was not only give said court exclusive appellate jurisdiction over disputed  tax  assessments, but  also  to transfer to its  jurisdiction all cases involving said assessments previously cognizable by  Courts  of First  Instance and even those already pending  in said  courts, as may  be seen from  the  provisions of Republic Act 1125 which we have  already reproduced. <br><br>From what we recall of the  explanatory note  as well as the  legislative discussion  of  the  bill which  resulted in Republic Act  No. 1125,  one of the reasons for transferring jurisdiction  over disputed  tax  assessment  cases from  the Courts of First Instance to the  Court of Tax Appeals was that, considering the many cases on  different subject matter which the Courts of First Instance had  to hear  and determine, oftentimes  disputed tax assessment cases  took  a long time, even  years, to decide, and so for purposes of expediency and the prompt collection  of taxes, the Tax Court was created, and  was given a limited time within  which  to  determine said  cases before  it (30  days after  their submission for decision). <br><br>After the creation  of  the  Court of  Tax Appeals, we see no reason or occasion for the Collector  to enforce his assessments by means of civil  action before the Courts of First Instance.   In the first  place  as  already stated said actions take a relatively  long time  to determine.   In the second place, there is no need for  enforcing his tax assessment in that manner because his  ruling or decision is enforceable  against  the  taxpayer,  unless  the  latter appeals therefrom, and even  when appealed,  there  is  an assurance that the Tax Court without loss of time, would decide the  appeal.  Besides, the  Government and the Collector will  suffer no loss or  prejudice by the appeal, for the reason  that said  appeal  will not "suspend the payment, levy,  distraint, and/or sale of any property  of  the taxpayer for the satisfaction of  his tax liability as  provided by existing law".  (Par. 2, Sec. 11, Republic Act 1125). Moreover,  we must  bear in  mind that  the taxpayer and businessman is as much interested as the Collector in the early and  final determination of his tax assessment, so that he would  know as soon  as possible how  much  he is liable to pay as taxes, which  information is  necessary  for the proper operation of his business.  To allow the  filing of ordinary civil cases in the ordinary  courts to  enforce rulings of the Collector on assessments, would rob Republic Act No. 1125,  creating the Court of  Tax Appeals, of its principal objectives, namely, of the expeditious determination of disputed tax  assessments, and also  deprive  the taxpayer of  the remedy  of  appeal  from the Collector's rulings and  decisions to the Tax Court which is  in a position to determine and finally decide said  tax assessments in the shortest time possible. <br><br>As to question  of  procedure,  petitioners should  have appealed to  us  the  resolution of dismissal of the  Tax Court.  That was  a plain,  speedy and  adequate remedy; although petitioners  may have been impressed and  obsessed by the  consideration that the Tax Court through error, neglected and even refused the performance of an act specifically enjoined as duty  as  such  appellate court, and excluded petitioners  from the use  of their right of appeal.  However,  because of the  great importance of this case, calling as it does for interpretation for the first time of the law on  court jurisdiction over disputed tax assessments,  we  are  willing to consider as we  do consider  the present petition  as one for review. <br><br>In  view  of the foregoing, we believe  and  hold that  the Court of Tax  Appeals was  in duty bound to give  due course  to  the  appeal or  petition for  review filed  with it by the  petitioners. Setting aside its resolution dismissing the appeal, the Tax  Court is hereby directed to proceed with the determination of said petition for review No costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
