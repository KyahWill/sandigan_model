				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal by the petitioners&nbsp; from the&nbsp; decision of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; holding that the&nbsp; deed of sale between respondent Irenea Inacala and one Arcadio Mendoza should be&nbsp; given&nbsp; the effect of a mere <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> sale and that, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 1606 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, said respondent should be permitted to exercise the right of repurchase.&nbsp; <br><br>Respondent Inacala was the registered owner of a parcel of land located in barrio&nbsp; Valdefuente,&nbsp; Cabanatuan, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 1, 1941,&nbsp; through the intervention of Claro Pacis, she&nbsp; executed a&nbsp; deed of sale&nbsp; (Exhibit B) covering a&nbsp; 15-hectare lot in favor of Arcadio Mendoza for&nbsp; P420.00.&nbsp; The latter thereupon executed a private instrument (Exhibit C)&nbsp; granting said respondent&nbsp; the option to repurchase the lot for the&nbsp; same consideration within&nbsp; the period of one year from the date of the sale.&nbsp; Mendoza afterwards sold the&nbsp; property to the spouses Eugenio and Margarita Ramos to whom a transfer certificate of&nbsp; title was issued. The petitioners herein, all surnamed Adorable, in turn bought the land from the Ramos spouses, and&nbsp; the corresponding transfer certificate of title&nbsp; No. 19736&nbsp; was issued. <br><br>Since&nbsp; the first sale in 1941, Inacala, who had&nbsp; not redeemed&nbsp; the&nbsp; land from Mendoza,&nbsp; never relinquished the possession thereof.&nbsp; It was only in 1951, during the opening of the Pampanga River Irrigation Project, when the petitioners attempted to take physical possession&nbsp; through one Geronimo Fajardo, who leased it from them,&nbsp; that said petitioners were apprised for the first time&nbsp; of Inacala's claim over the lot.<br><br>There can be no question about the correctness of the conclusion of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals that the transaction at bar is a <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> sale. Exhibit&nbsp; "C" is conclusive on the point. But, as&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by the petitioners, the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals erred in applying the third paragraph of Article 1606 of the&nbsp; new Civil&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our&nbsp; opinion, this provision refers to cases involving a transaction where one of the parties contests or denies that the true agreement is one&nbsp; of sale with&nbsp; right of repurchase. In the case now before&nbsp; us, the sale (Exhibit B) is&nbsp; expressly with right to repurchase in virtue of Exhibit "C" granting respondent Inacala the right to redeem&nbsp; within&nbsp; one year. As this stipulated period has expired without said respondent having&nbsp; redeemed the land in question, the&nbsp; original purchaser, Arcadio&nbsp; Mendoza,&nbsp; had irrevocably&nbsp; acquired ownership over the property in accordance with Article 1509 of the old&nbsp; Civil Code which was in&nbsp; force at the time of the transaction in dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Angao&nbsp; vs. Clavano, 17 Phil., 152; Rafols&nbsp; vs. Rafols, 22&nbsp; Phil., 236; Gonzales vs. Javellana, 49 Phil., 1; Racca us. Viloria,&nbsp; 26 Phil., 120.)<br><br>It therefore becomes unnecessary to discuss petitioners' other contention that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the petitioners were not purchasers&nbsp; in good faith.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby reversed, and the petitioners declared owners of the land in controversy.&nbsp; So ordered without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,&nbsp; JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br></div>
