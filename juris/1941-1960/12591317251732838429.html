				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September&nbsp; 23, 1953, at the corner of Atlanta and 13th streets, Port Area, Manila, a jeepney and an autobus, collided so violently that a passenger of the jeepney died on account of the injuries he received.<br><br>In&nbsp; due course, the "two drivers&nbsp; were&nbsp; prosecuted&nbsp; for homicide with damages to property through reckless imprudence.&nbsp; After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; the driver of the bus, Enrique&nbsp; Servo&nbsp; y&nbsp; de la Cruz, but acquitted the other driver.<br><br>The Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; affirmed the judgment of conviction&nbsp; awarding, at the same&nbsp; time,&nbsp; a bigger indemnity to the heirs of the deceased.<br><br>On petition&nbsp; for certiorari by way of appeal Servo moved for&nbsp; review (G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-12728)&nbsp; contending that the appellate court had failed to make a finding as to whether the bus had hit the jeepney or vice-versa,&nbsp; and to specify the act constituting his negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; merit, we dismissed&nbsp; such petition on September 3, 1957. Denial of a motion to reconsider followed on October 1, 1957.<br><br>Thereafter, on October 12, 1957, he started this <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span>&nbsp; proceeding in the&nbsp; Manila court of first&nbsp; instance, asserting that the judgment of conviction was&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void&nbsp; on its face because it&nbsp; contained no specification of the&nbsp; particular act,&nbsp; punished by&nbsp; law, committed by the accused.&nbsp; His position rested on the&nbsp; proposition that the Court of Appeals'&nbsp; decision limited&nbsp; its&nbsp; findings of fact to the statement that "the two vehicles collided and one was&nbsp; at fault" without&nbsp; declaring who between the&nbsp; two drivers, had caused the smashup through&nbsp; his&nbsp; negligence.<br><br>After hearing&nbsp; the parties, the Honorable Juan P. Enriquez, Judge, refused to issue the writ, for three reasons: (1)&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; was&nbsp; at&nbsp; liberty under bail; (2) the judgment of conviction could not be&nbsp; collaterally attacked nor reviewed on habeas corpus, and&nbsp; (3) the decision set forth enough&nbsp; findings of fact to sustain Servo's&nbsp; conviction.<br><br>Servo appealed.<br><br>This is a mere dilatory move.&nbsp; Appellant seeks another review of the judgment of conviction, on the very grounds explained&nbsp; in his petition for certiorari&nbsp; in&nbsp; G. R. No. L12728, which petition we declined to entertain, <span style="font-style: italic;">for lack of merit,&nbsp;</span> in September 1957.<br><br>It may&nbsp; be stated in this&nbsp; connection that&nbsp; in&nbsp; a detailed and long opinion the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; after&nbsp; describing the particular of the mishap,&nbsp; the testimony of the witnesses, the condition of the streets, and the speed of the vehicles,&nbsp; reached the final&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; that this&nbsp; driver was&nbsp; guilty of reckless negligence.&nbsp; Just before the&nbsp; impact, it found, the bus was&nbsp; speeding&nbsp; (35 miles an hour) upon entering&nbsp; a busy thoroughfare, whereas the jeepney moved&nbsp; slowly<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, even as&nbsp; it had the right of way.<br><br>The opinion&nbsp; may not have explicitly declared&nbsp; that "this driver acted recklessly for driving so&nbsp; fast at a city intersection,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereby&nbsp; causing&nbsp; the collision";&nbsp; but such inference is easily implied from the facts related therein. In logic,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; mode&nbsp; of reasoning called "enthymeme", in which one of the premises is understood but not stated.<br><br>We must decline to go further; otherwise,&nbsp; Servo would obtain the review which had precisely been denied&nbsp; him way&nbsp; back&nbsp; in&nbsp; September 1957.<br><br>Judgment affirmed with double costs against&nbsp; appellant. <br><br><i>Paras, C. J. Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion Reyes J. B.&nbsp; L.,</i> and <i>Endencia JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It had just shifted from first to second gear.<br></div>
