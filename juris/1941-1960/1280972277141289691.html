				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At about 8:30 o'clock in the evening of October 20, 1950, the now 
deceased Primitivo Adel was attacked by five men with knives, a bolo and
 a piece of Wood near his house in barrio Nato, municipality of Taft 
Samar, sustaining serious wounds in the back and in the abdomen and 
other wounds and bruises in other parts of the body from which he died a
 few hours thereafter.
  <p>    Identified as the assailants, Sergio Valdez, his son Ambrosio 
Valdez, and the brothers Zosimo Balibat, Ambrosio Balibat and Ogun 
Balibat were prosecuted for murder in the Court of First Instance of 
Samar, and having been found guilty as charged, they were all sentenced 
to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> with the accessory penalties prescribed by
 law, and to pay an indemnity of P5,000.00 and the costs.  From this 
sentence only Sergio Valdez has appealed.</p>
  <p>    There is no disputing the fact that the deceased was attached 
and killed by several men.  Motive for the attack was some property 
dispute between the deceased and the Balibats and resentment of the 
Valdezes towards the deceased growing out of a case of carabao stealing.
  The only thing to be determined is whether the appellant participated 
in the attack.</p>
  <p>    Denying participation in the crime, the appellant testified 
that at the time of its perpetration, that is, on the night of October 
20, 1950, he was in the distant barrio of Hilabaan, having passed the 
night there in the house of his overseer, Vicente Tejero.  But, although
 appellant's testimony on this point was corroborated by Tejero, the 
alibi was weakened by the latter's admission that he knew the date to be
 October 20 because he was "taught" by his wife before going to court.  
Moreover, Nicolas Lopinia, the ferryman at the Canavid river, testified 
that at about 11 o'clock on the night of the murder he ferried the 
appellant across the river on his way to his plantation in Hilabaan.</p>
  <p>    On the other hand, appellant was named by the deceased as one 
of his assailants and positively identified by the deceased's wife, 
Valeriana Ademos, who, coming to the scene of the crime in answer to her
 husband's call for help, at a distance of less than two meters saw 
appellant and his companions attacking the deceased with bolo and knives
 but running away upon her arrival.  Appellant was also identified by 
Estanisla Ademos, who being at the time in the house of the deceased and
 looking out of the window when he called for help, saw him surrounded 
by appellant and his co-accused.  Between them and this witness the 
distance was only seven meters.  Furthermore, Canesia Chicano, who lived
 in another house, also saw appellant that same night as he and his son 
Ambrosio Valdez passed by about 3-Â½ meters from her, running towards 
their house some 50 meters away after leaving the scene of the crime.</p>
  <p>    Though the defense questions the testimony of the three women 
above named, especially that of Estanisla Ademos, who could not read 
without glasses, we find no sufficient reason for doubting their 
veracity.  Recognition of the appellant by them was not improbable, 
considering that there was a bright moon that night and they knew 
appellant well and saw him at close range.  Their testimony not being 
incredible, is not to be denied credence just because they were in one 
way or another related to the deceased.</p>
  <p>    Appellant complains that the trial court took into account an 
alleged statement made by Ambrosio Balibat on the witness stand to the 
effect that Ambrosio Valdez has told him that he and Sergio Valdez had 
killed the deceased when it does not appear that Ambrosio Balibat has 
testified as a witness.  Although the transcript of stenographic notes 
forwarded to this Court does not include the testimony of this witness, 
the minutes of the session held on January 23, 1951, do show that he had
 in fact testified in the case.  In any event, even without the 
statement attributed to him by the trial court, there is sufficient 
evidence in the record to sustain the conviction below.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
