				<H3>SIMPLICIO DURNA ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF THE FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, RIZAL CITY BRANCH, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 26, 1948, an information for qualified theft was filed in the Court 
of First Instance of Rizal City charging the herein petitioners with having 
stolen an automobile belonging to Ned C. Cook which was parked in Port Area, 
City of Manila, on August 25, 1948, and which was later found in San Juan 
street, Rizal City. During the trial, after the prosecution had presented its 
evidence, the defense moved for the dismissal of the information on the ground 
that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try the case. This motion and a 
subsequent motion for reconsideration were denied, and the defense was ordered 
to present its case. After presenting its evidence, the defense again moved for 
dismissal on the same ground and the lower court again denied the motion. Hence, 
this petition on the ground that the offense charged having been allegedly 
committed in Manila, the court of Rizal City has no jurisdiction to try the 
case.<br><p>Rule 106 of the Rules of Court provides in its Sections 5, 9 and 14 
(<em>a</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 5. <em>Sufficiency of complaint or information</em>.—A complaint or 
information is sufficient if it states the name of the defendant; the 
designation of the offense by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of 
as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate 
time of the commission of the offense, and the place wherein the offense was 
committed.<br><br>"When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of 
them shall be included in the complaint or information."<br><br>"Sec. 9. 
<em>Place of the commission of the offense</em>.—The complaint or information is 
sufficient if it can be understood therefrom that the offense, was committed or 
some of the essential ingredients thereof occurred at some place within the 
jurisdiction of the court, unless the particular place wherein It was committed 
constitutes an essential element of the offense or is necessary for identifying 
the offense charged."<br><br>Sec. 14. <em>Place where action is to be 
Instituted</em>.—(<em>a</em>) In all criminal prosecutions the action shall be 
instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or province wherein the 
offense was committed or any one of the essential ingredients thereof took 
place."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing provisions and in accordance with settled jurisprudence, 
the commission of an offense is triable only in the courts of the place where 
the offense was allegedly committed.<br><br>In the instant case, the offense 
charged was fully committed in the City of Manila where the automobile was 
allegedly stolen from its parking place in Port Area. The fact that said 
automobile was later found in Rizal City is not an essential ingredient of the 
crime but a mere circumstance which could add nothing to the nature of the 
offense or to its consummation. Hence, this circumstance cannot be made 
determinative of the jurisdiction of the trial court over the criminal action. 
In the case of People <em>vs</em>. Mercado (65 Phil., 665, 666) the defendant 
had stolen an animal in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, and had later taken it to Candaba, 
Pampanga, where it was found, and this Court held that the fact that the animal 
was taken to Pampanga did not give the court of that province concurrent 
jurisdiction to try the case because the consummation of the theft was completed 
when the animal was taken from the owner in Nueva Ecija, and its taking to 
Pampanga added nothing to the nature or consummation of the offense.<br><br>The 
American rule that larceny is a continuing offense does not apply to theft 
because "carrying away" which is one of the characteristics of larceny is not an 
essential ingredient of theft, as stated by this Court in the Mercado case. If, 
as maintained by some members of the court, every moment's continuance of the 
thief's possession is a new taking and asportation, then criminal action would 
never prescribe against a thief in possession of the stolen thing.<br><br>For 
all the foregoing, the Petition is hereby granted and respondent Judge is hereby 
ordered to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. No costs.</p>
<p>Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, and Torres, JJ., concur.</p><p>Bengzon, J., see dissenting opinion. <br></p><p>Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, and Reyes, JJ., 
joins Justice Bengzon dissent. <br></p>

<p align="center"><b>CONCURRING SEPARATE OPINION</b><br></p><p>FERIA, J.:<br><br>I concur in the decision of the 
majority.<br><br>It is a well settled principle of Criminal Jurisprudence that 
every offender against the law must be prosecuted for his crime in the 
jurisdiction wherein it was committed and section 14, Rule 106, of the Rules of 
Court, is declaratory of that principle. It prescribes that "all criminal 
prosecution shall be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or 
province where the offense was committed or any one of the essential ingredients 
thereof took place."<br><br><em>The common law and statutory provision in most 
States</em> which provides, according to 22 C. J. S. pp. 291, 292, and 32 Am. 
Jur. Larceny, Sec. 97, that "one who steals property in one county and brings it 
into another may be indicted and tried for simple larceny either in the county 
where the theft was committed or in any county into or through which the stolen 
property was brought" can not be applied in this Jurisdiction, because said 
common law and statutory provision are not in force here in the Philippines. 
Just because the interests of justice may be best served by applying said common 
law and statutory provision would not justify its application as part of our law 
to the present case. If it is better than the provision of said Sec. 14 of Rule 
106 we should recommend its formal adoption by the proper authorities; but until 
that is done we can not apply it as part of our law to the present case, 
specially in view of our ruling in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Mercado, (65 
Phil., 665, 666) cited in the decision of the majority, which conforms to the 
statutory provision of Sec. 14, Rule 106, of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The 
principle upon which the common law of England applied in the United States and 
the statutory provision in most of the States declaratory thereof is predicated 
is that in larceny because the "legal possession still remaining in the true 
owner, every moment's continuance of the trespass and felony and every 
subsequent act of removal or asportation amount, in legal consideration, to a 
new caption and asportation." This principle can not be invoked in this 
jurisdiction, for theft as defined in our Revised Penal Code can not be 
considered as a continuing and transitory offense, inasmuch as asportation or 
carrying away of the stolen goods is not an essential element thereof. In Texas, 
however, though asportation is not also an essential ingredient of larceny and, 
therefore, this offense is not a continuing or transitory one, the thief may be 
prosecuted "either in the county where he took the property or in any other 
county through or into which he may have carried the same" (Sec. 235, Texas Code 
of Criminal Procedure), because there is there an express statutory provision to 
that effect.<br><br>"To constitute larceny the first essential is that the thing 
which is the subject of the crime should be taken from the possession of the 
owner into the possession of the thief, and be carried away by Mm, for until 
this is done there is no larceny, however definite may be the intent of the 
prospective thief to commit the theft, and however elaborate his preparations 
for doing so. This was the rule at collision law and seems to be the rule under 
all the statutes except in Texas inhere the statute omits the words 'carrying 
away;' for which reason asportation is held not to be an element of larceny in 
that state, even in the case of larceny from the person." (36 Corpus Juris, pp. 
747, 748.)<br><br>"In the case of Hartman <em>vs</em>. State, (8 Tex. Cr. 582,; 
213 S. W. 936), it was held that "Under the statute any taking of property 
without the owners consent and with the present intent to deprive the owner of 
its value and to appropriate the same by the taker is theft, and asportation is 
not necessary to make out the offense."<br><br>Besides, it is not true that the 
interests of justice would be served by following and applying the above quoted 
common law and statutory provision in most of the States. The reason given by 
the dissenters to the effect that "if a car stolen in Manila and driven by the 
thief to Appari, Cagayan, it would be very inconvenient to bring here the 
witness in Appari who actually saw the accused in possession of the automobile, 
(possession is partial proof that accused stole it)" is predicated upon the 
erroneous assumption that ordinarily it is necessary to prove the possession of 
the thing, stolen by the accused after the offense was consummated in order to 
obtain the latter's conviction. Generally the offense of theft is committed by 
taking, without violence or intimidation against persons or force upon things, a 
personal property belonging to another without the latter's consent and with 
intent of gain. It is immaterial that the thief should, after committing the 
offense, keep the property in his possession, consumes it if it is perishable or 
give it to another person, and therefore the witness or witnesses who may 
testify to the stealing by the accused must necessarily be those who reside or 
were found at the place from where the property was taken.<br><br>The only cases 
in which it is necessary to prove the actual possession of a stolen good by the 
accused after the theft was consummated or completed is, when a personal 
property was stolen or disappeared from the possession of the owner, no person 
saw the act of stealing it, and the property lost or stolen is found a short 
time afterwards in the possession of a person who can not satisfactorily explain 
how he came into the possession thereof, because in such case it maybe presumed 
that the person having in his possession a property recently stolen is the one 
who has committed the theft; but it is also necessary to prove, besides the 
possession, that the property belongs to another and was stolen or has recently 
disappeared from the latter's possession by the testimony of the owner. But"even 
in such exceptional cases it would be more convenient to prosecute the offense 
in the municipality or province where the property was taken or stolen than in 
the jurisdiction into which the property was taken and compel the owner to go 
to the place into which the stolen property was brought and testify as the 
principal witness, because the fact that it was found in possession of the 
defendant after the commission of the offense may be established by the 
testimony of any person who might have seen the accused in possession thereof at 
any place, or by the agents of authority arresting the defendant with the stolen 
property in his possession.</p><p><br></p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><p><b><br></b></p><p align="center"><b>DISSENTING OPINION</b><br></p><p>BENGZON, J.:<br></p><p>The court of first instance of Rizal had jurisdiction to try 
the case. The information alleged, that the accused had stolen the car from the 
Manila Port Area and had trot it to Rizal City, Rizal province.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with the general rule that an offense is triable in the 
courts of the place where it was committed. But I submit that this particular 
theft was also deemed to have been committed in Rizal City, to which the stolen 
car was taken by the accused. Our crime of theft is of the same nature as 
larceny in the United States, where it is held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Both at common law and under statutory provisions in most states one who 
steals property in one county and brings it into another may be indicted and 
tried for simple larceny either in the county where the theft was committed, or 
in any county into or through which the stolen property was brought; the theory 
being that the possession of the stolen goods by the thief is a larceny in every 
county through or into which he carries them, because, as the legal possession 
still remains in the owner, every moment's continuance of the trespass and 
felony amounts to a new taking and asportation." (22 C. J. S., Criminal Law, pp. 
291, 292).<br><br>"Notwithstanding the general rule that crimes are to be 
prosecuted in the county in which committed, in the law of larceny it is settled 
that a person committing a simple larceny may be prosecuted not only in the 
county in which he originally steals the property, but in any county into which 
he subsequently carries it with, a continuing felonious intent to make it the 
subject of larceny. A similar rule has been applied in the Federal courts, in 
cases where property stolen in one Federal district is brought into another by 
the offender and the question has arisen as to which district is proper for 
institution of prosecution under a Federal statute. In such, cases a larceny is, 
in contemplation of law, committed in the county or district into which the 
property is brought, on the principle that since legal possession of the 
property remains in the true owner, the law will regard each moment's 
continuance of the trespass and felony, and every subsequent act of removal by 
the thief as a new caption and asportation." (32 Am. Jur., Larceny, sec. 
97).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the interests of justice the above rule—on the so-called continuing or 
transitory offenses—should be followed in this country, because if a car is 
stolen in Manila and driven by the thief to Aparri, Cagayan, it would be very 
inconvenient to bring here the witnesses in Aparri, who actually saw the accused 
in possession of the automobile (possession is partial proof that accused stole 
it). Such rule is not unknown, in our jurisprudence. It was explained 
(apparently with approval) in U. S. <em>vs</em>. Cunanan, 26 Phil., 376; and U.S. <em>vs</em>. Bernabe, 23 Phil., 154 is obviously—although not expressly—an 
application thereof.<br><br>I know that in People <em>vs</em>. Mercado, (65 
Phil., 665, 666) the above theory of American jurisprudence was examined and 
expressly rejected. But it seems clear that the rejection was based on two 
propositions, which upon careful examination do not sustain such 
rejection.<br><br>The first proposition is: There is a difference between the 
crime of larceny in the United States and the crime of theft in the Philippines, 
because whereas larceny requires not only the "taking" of property but also the 
"carrying away", it is enough in the Philippines that the property be "taken" 
for the consummation of theft. On this proposition, I would say that the 
difference, even if admitted, has no substantial effect upon the adjective 
principle that where the theft is consummated in one province it may be 
prosecuted in any other province into which the thief should subsequently bring 
the stolen merchandise, because in the eyes of the law every moment's 
continuance of the dispossession of the owner amounts to a new taking and 
asportation. (<em>See</em> C. J. S. and Am. Jur., <em>supra.</em>). In the 
Mercado case, <em>supra</em>, there was no doubt that theft of cattle was 
consummated in Nueva Ecija. The prosecution there contended—and I think 
rightly—that even if consummated in Nueva Ecija the offenders could be 
prosecuted in Pampanga where the rustled animals were subsequently conveyed. In 
the precedents cited by the prosecution (in the Mercado case) the larceny was 
consummated also in one county, but the thieves were allowed to be prosecuted in 
another county to which they had removed the stolen things. Therefore, the 
difference between the essential elements of the crime did not justify a 
different procedural doctrine.<br><br>The second proposition which induced the 
court to reject the transitory-offense theory is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Practical reasons and considerations, however, require that no pass be 
opened to the thief through which he may easily frustrate the right of the owner 
of a stolen thing to recover it from him or to go after it, or which may make it 
difficult, if not impossible, for him to secure the punishment of the offender. 
By allowing the owner of the stolen thing to follow the thief no matter how far 
from the scene of the crime the latter may have brought it, in order to have him 
prosecuted which, surely, will be the effect of sustaining a contrary opinion, 
is to put obstacles in his way precisely because this will result in expenses 
and delay. If this were done, the thief would contrive in all cases to carry as 
far as possible what he may have stolen so that lie would have greater chances 
of getting unpunished." {65 Phil., 674}</p></blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to perceive how the theory we advocate could favor the 
culprit and frustrate prosecution. On the contrary, if the thief may be booked 
in any place to which he carries his plunder, his main accomplice - flight - 
becomes valueless. It may even become an additional hazard, if and when the 
forces of law and order are given the privilege to prosecute him in any of the 
provinces through which he has travelled with his booty - wherever the 
prosecution may have found convenient evidence against him.<br><br>Moreover, the 
above paragraph of the Mercado decision is premised on the assumption that the 
transitory-offense idea <em>requires</em> the owner <em>to follow</em> the thief 
and prosecute him in the province where such thief may have chosen to carry the 
loot. That assumption is a fundamental mistake. The theory <em>permits</em> 
(does not require) the owner to prosecute in any province to which the culprit 
may have brought the stolen articles. The owner may choose to prosecute him in 
the province where the goods had originally been feloniously seized.<br><br>An 
example: A car is stolen in Manila and later carried by the thief into Davao. No 
witness in Manila saw him in the act of grabbing or driving the vehicle. But in 
Davao there are persons who saw him in possession. Under the transitory-offense 
theory, the owner may either prosecute him in Manila and spend for 
transportation of the Davao witnesses to Manila, or else prosecute him in Davao, 
and pay for his own transportation from Manila to Davao. Such owner may choose 
according to his convenience; of course, with advice of the prosecuting officers 
under whose direction the case for the People is always handled.<br><br>It being 
clear, in my opinion, that the rejection of the transitory-offense theory, is 
unfair to the victim and is contrary to the intention of the justices who 
concurred in the Mercado ruling, I have no hesitation to vote for departure from 
it.</p></div>
