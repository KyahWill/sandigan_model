				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July&nbsp; 6, 1954, twenty employees of the Philippine Normal College, who were working as cooks, waiters, dishwasher, and in various other&nbsp; capacities in its dormitory known as Normal Hall, filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the said Philippine Normal College and/or Philippine Normal School for the recovery of salary differentials and overtime pay.&nbsp; The Solicitor General filed an answer on behalf of the defendants denying the latter" s liability.&nbsp; But before the case was tried on the merits, the court ordered it dismissed on the ground that neither one of the defendants was a corporation or a juridical entity with capacity to be sued. Reconsideration of this order having been denied, plaintiffs took this appeal to this Court, alleging that It was error to dismiss their case on the ground mentioned.<br><br>The appeal is, in cur opinion, meritorious.<br><br>Republic Act No. 416, which took effect In July., 1949, converted the old Philippine Normal School into the present Philippine Normal College and endowed it with the "general powers set out In section thirteen of Act Numbered Fourteen hundred and fifty-nine, as amended" (Corporation Law)., entrusting Its government and the administration of its affairs to a board of trustees therein created, which was to exercise for It "all the powers of a corporation as provided in (said) section,” and in particular, “to administer and appropriate the funds of Normal Hill and to supervise&nbsp; and&nbsp; control&nbsp; its&nbsp; income&nbsp; and expenses,&nbsp;&nbsp; all provisions&nbsp; of law to the&nbsp; contrary notwithstanding."<br><br>One&nbsp; of the&nbsp; powers&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; enumerated&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; said section. 13 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Corporation Law is&nbsp; the power "to&nbsp; sue&nbsp; and be&nbsp;&nbsp; sued&nbsp; in any.court."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this&nbsp; express grant&nbsp; of power, we&nbsp;&nbsp; don't&nbsp; see how it&nbsp; could be&nbsp; doubted that&nbsp; the Philippine Normal College&nbsp; could be made&nbsp; a&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; suit&nbsp; in court.<br><br>The Solicitor General admits that the Philippine Normal College has&nbsp; a&nbsp; juridical personality&nbsp; of its&nbsp; own, but&nbsp;&nbsp; contends that,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; an Instrumentality&nbsp; of government&nbsp; for the&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; of&nbsp; state&nbsp; functions,&nbsp;&nbsp; it may not&nbsp; be sued without&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of the&nbsp; state. The&nbsp; answer to that contention&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; state&nbsp; has&nbsp; already&nbsp; given that&nbsp;&nbsp; consent&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; investing the&nbsp; College with the&nbsp; express power to be&nbsp; sued in&nbsp; courts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; the Act Authorizes&nbsp; the&nbsp; College to be&nbsp; sued is&nbsp; also made&nbsp;&nbsp; clear in section&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; where&nbsp; it&nbsp; is provided that&nbsp; "all process against&nbsp; the Board&nbsp; of Trustees shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; served on the President&nbsp;&nbsp; or secretary thereof,"<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; order appealed from is&nbsp; revoked and the&nbsp; case&nbsp; remanded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the court&nbsp; of origin&nbsp; for further proceedings. No&nbsp; costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
