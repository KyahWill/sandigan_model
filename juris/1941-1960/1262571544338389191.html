				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Mariano Delimios alias Bigote, Eugenia&nbsp; Delimios&nbsp; and Bernardo Tariman alias Benny&nbsp; were charged&nbsp; with the crime of robbery&nbsp; in band with homicide in an amended information filed in the Court of First Instance of Camarines&nbsp; Sur.&nbsp; Upon arraignment&nbsp; the three&nbsp; defendants entered a plea of not guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Florentino Dacuba, Armando Cadag,&nbsp; Jesus Bordejos alias&nbsp; Jesse, Federico Babasa alias Decoy and Salvador Sulit, Jr., the co-defendants charged with the&nbsp; crime in the amended information, were&nbsp; still at large at the time of the filing thereof.&nbsp; On 25 March 1953, upon motion of the Provincial Fiscal the amended information was dismissed&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; Florentino&nbsp; Dacuba, Armando&nbsp; Cadag&nbsp; and Salvador Sulit,&nbsp; Jr.&nbsp; After&nbsp; trial, on 27&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1953 the Court rendered judgment finding the&nbsp; defendants guilty of the&nbsp; crime charged&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentencing each of them to&nbsp; suffer&nbsp; the&nbsp; penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,&nbsp; to indemnify jointly&nbsp; and severally&nbsp; the heirs of the deceased&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola in the sum of P6,000,&nbsp; to indemnify Lee Yat in the sum of P164, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. The defendants appealed to this&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; On 10 November 1955&nbsp; this Court dismissed the&nbsp; appeal interposed&nbsp; by Bernardo&nbsp; Tariman.<br><br>The&nbsp; evidence for the prosecution&nbsp; shows that at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of 27 September 1950&nbsp; Eugenia Delimios, Mariano Delimios and Bernardo Tariman, the first armed&nbsp; with a knife and&nbsp; the&nbsp; last two with bolos, entered the store of Lee Yat at barrio Hanauan, municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ocampo, Camarines Sur and said: "Do not make noise, we&nbsp; are going to get what we want." Upon seeing Gaspar Peralta inside the store, Mariano pulled his right shoulder, hit him on the head with a "baji" (palma brava) held&nbsp; by his right hand and&nbsp; with the&nbsp; bolo in his left hand aimed to&nbsp; strike him, and asked him what he was doing there.&nbsp; Gaspar answered that he was buying something. Bernardo asked&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; if&nbsp; Gaspar&nbsp; was&nbsp; their enemy.&nbsp; Gaspar answered he was&nbsp; not.&nbsp; Felix Brazal, who came to the place with Eugenia, Mariano and Bernardo, at&nbsp; a&nbsp; distance of about&nbsp; ten meters from the&nbsp; store, saw Bernardo&nbsp; about to&nbsp; strike Gaspar with his bolo and "palma brava" while Mariano was touching Gaspar's right shoulder with his bolo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Felix asked the two why they were doing that to Gaspar and told them not to&nbsp; do&nbsp; harm to him because he was a good man.&nbsp; He took aside Gaspar to the road and advised him&nbsp; to leave the place&nbsp; to&nbsp; avoid trouble and embarrassment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaspar went&nbsp; home.&nbsp; Bernardo struck&nbsp; with his bolo the&nbsp; box containing rice&nbsp; in the store.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the three took from&nbsp; the&nbsp; stand ten packages of different brands valued at P40,&nbsp; two boxes of canned&nbsp; salmon and sardines valued at P38, two&nbsp; sacks of rice valued at P86 and Lee Yat's wrist watch valued at P40.&nbsp; Tito Crucillo who&nbsp; was&nbsp; at his store about 45 meters from that of Lee Yat heard the noise&nbsp; coming from Lee Yat's store,&nbsp; so he came out of his store and from a distance of. about five meters from Lee&nbsp; Yat's saw&nbsp; what Eugenia, Mariano and Bernardo&nbsp; were doing inside Lee Yat's store.&nbsp; He immediately went to report the incident to Cecilio Iriola, the barrio lieutenant.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; hearing the report&nbsp; of Tito,&nbsp; Cecilio took his gun and put on his badge and&nbsp; together with Tito&nbsp; went to the place. Meanwhile at Lee&nbsp; Yat's&nbsp; store, Eugenia called for the truck parked a few&nbsp; meters away and with the aid of&nbsp; Mariano and Bernardo&nbsp; started loading the goods they took.&nbsp; Upon reaching the store of Juan Salve&nbsp; about&nbsp; 150&nbsp; meters from Lee Yat's,&nbsp; Cecilio fired&nbsp; his gun and upon reaching Lee Yat's store he fired&nbsp; again and shouted, "I am the barrio lieutenant." Mariano&nbsp; and&nbsp; Bernardo&nbsp; laid&nbsp; flat&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground face downward.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cecilio reached the spot where the two laid, they rose and struck&nbsp; him with their bolos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Mariano ordered&nbsp; his&nbsp; companions&nbsp; to get on&nbsp; the truck and speed away. Cecilio called for&nbsp; help saying that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was struck&nbsp; by Mariano Delimios and Bernardo&nbsp; Tariman&nbsp; with their bolos.&nbsp; When Tito came to his aid&nbsp; he found&nbsp; him sitting in&nbsp; a reclining position supported by his two arms on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground and his feet stretched forward.&nbsp; Asked&nbsp; who&nbsp; his&nbsp; assailants were he answered that they were Mariano Delimios and Bernardo Tariman.&nbsp; He brought Cecilio to the house of Mrs. Pelagia Bacay Moll,&nbsp; a nurse, where he expired.&nbsp; The next day, 28&nbsp; September 1950,&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Servillano Olano,&nbsp; president of the&nbsp; 4th and&nbsp; 6th Sanitary Divisions,&nbsp; made an autopsy on the cadaver and reported on the external&nbsp; and internal examinations&nbsp; he&nbsp; made, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 1</span>— Left ear divided horizontally, a 5 cm. portion was left hanging, the inferior portion still attached to the main body of the&nbsp; ear.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 2</span>—A&nbsp; clean cut wound on the&nbsp; posterior side of left shoulder of about 6 by 4 cm. and one cm.&nbsp; deep.&nbsp; The head of&nbsp; the humerus was&nbsp; scrapped.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No.&nbsp; 3</span>—A clean&nbsp; cut&nbsp; wound on&nbsp; the center of the left deltoid&nbsp; muscle&nbsp; of about&nbsp; 3 by 1&nbsp; cm. and one&nbsp; cm. deep.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 4</span>—A ;clean cut semi-circular extensive wound at the center&nbsp; of the&nbsp; left&nbsp; forearm&nbsp; of about 11&nbsp; by&nbsp; 7 cm. in dimensions, reaching and scraping a portion of the ulnar bone. The soft tissues form a semi-circular flap which fall when one moves the arm.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 5</span>—A clean cut wound 10 by&nbsp; 5 cm. and one cm. deep at the&nbsp; left side of the body on the level&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 8th rib, exposing portions of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ribs.&nbsp; This wound was found later to be non-perforating.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 6</span>—A similar wound&nbsp; as No.&nbsp; 5 but on the right side and fracturing the 8th&nbsp; rib about&nbsp; 2 cm.&nbsp; from its attachment in the spinal column.&nbsp; This wound was ground also to be nonperforating.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No.&nbsp; 7</span>—A clean cut wound 8 by 4 cm. and 2 cm. deep on the right hip region.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;Wound No.&nbsp; 8</span>—A clean cut circular wound of about 4 cm. in diameter and almost reaching the tibia, located about 8 cm. below the&nbsp; right&nbsp; knee.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound No. 9</span>—A clean&nbsp; cut linear wound running medially downwards&nbsp; about&nbsp; 6 by 2&nbsp; cm. about 12 cm. below&nbsp; right knee&nbsp; joint. The tibia&nbsp; was almost cut.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound&nbsp; No. 10</span>—A&nbsp; clean&nbsp; cut linear&nbsp; wound&nbsp; running&nbsp; medially downwards about 7 by&nbsp; 3 cm.&nbsp; almost cutting&nbsp; the&nbsp; tibia, situated about&nbsp; 5 cm.&nbsp; below left knee.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wound&nbsp; No. 11</span>— A&nbsp; clean&nbsp; cut linear&nbsp; wound&nbsp; running&nbsp; medially downwards about 14 by 7 cm., cutting the tibia and fibulae and the anterior tibial artery,&nbsp; situated&nbsp; 2 cm.&nbsp; below wound No. 11. On&nbsp; section, the body was&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be Very&nbsp; pale&nbsp; and contains little&nbsp; adipose tissue.&nbsp; Lungs&nbsp; and heart&nbsp; normal. Stomach empty.<br><br>&nbsp;Wounds Nos. 5 and 6 were found to be non-perforating.&nbsp;&nbsp; No other peculiarities&nbsp; in the rest&nbsp; of&nbsp; the body having any direct relation with the occurrence of death were&nbsp; observed.<br></blockquote><center>CONCLUSIONS<br></center><br>From the foregoing&nbsp; necropsy findings, it may be reasonably inferred:<br><blockquote>1. That, in&nbsp; view of the blood lost&nbsp; as&nbsp; indicated,&nbsp; due to the numerous wounds and&nbsp; cutting of the anterior tibial&nbsp; artery, Cecilio Iriola&nbsp; died from&nbsp; syncope&nbsp; secondary to profuse bleeding from said artery and numerous&nbsp; wounds&nbsp; found.<br><br>2. That, judging from the&nbsp; nature of the cadaveric changes, the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; time that had&nbsp; elapsed from the moment of death until the&nbsp; time of&nbsp; autopsy must be about 18 hours.<br><br>3. That&nbsp; Wound No. 11,&nbsp; because of its extent and depth, (cutting the&nbsp; anterior&nbsp; tibial&nbsp; artery) and&nbsp; location may&nbsp; be classified as very severe&nbsp; wound but not&nbsp; necessarily mortal.<br><br>4. That&nbsp; prompt&nbsp; medical attention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased may have prolonged or even saved his life. (Exhibit A.)<br></blockquote>The evidence for&nbsp; the defense&nbsp; shows that at about&nbsp; 3:30 o'clock in the&nbsp; afternoon&nbsp; of 27&nbsp; September 1950 Eugenia Delimios, accompanied by her&nbsp; four year old child,&nbsp; went to barrio Hanauan,&nbsp; municipality of Ocampo,&nbsp; Camarines Sur,&nbsp; to&nbsp; make some purcnases.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the&nbsp; store of&nbsp; Chua Luy,&nbsp; she bought on credit the following: 10&nbsp; gantas of rice,&nbsp; 6 cans&nbsp; of salmon, 6 cans of sardines, 1&nbsp; package of cigarettes&nbsp; (matamis),&nbsp; 5&nbsp; Kilos of sugar and 1/4&nbsp; kilo of garlic,&nbsp; which were&nbsp; packed&nbsp; in three bundles and brought by&nbsp; Chua Luy's&nbsp; helper outside the store beside the&nbsp; road. From there&nbsp; she went to a store run by a Filipino opposite Lee Yat's where while talking with the storekeeper, Cecilio Iriola appeared brandishing and swinging his bolo a little less than a&nbsp; yard long.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she&nbsp; was told that their stock of rice was&nbsp; for retail of a few gantas only, she left and proceeded to Lee Yat's&nbsp; store.&nbsp; She bought&nbsp; fish worth P1&nbsp; from&nbsp; Valeriano&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; and after receiving the fish and&nbsp; the&nbsp; change&nbsp; from the vendor, she went back to the Lee Yat's store.&nbsp; Cecilio&nbsp; Iriola, Gaspar&nbsp; Peralta and Tito Crucillo followed&nbsp; her.&nbsp; Eugenia talked with Lee Yat who quoted a sack of rice at P23 which quotation he&nbsp; later on&nbsp; reduced to P22.50 when she&nbsp; huggled with him.&nbsp; She bought 2&nbsp; sacks of rice,&nbsp; 6 packages of cigarettes, 2 dozen cans of sardines, 2 dozen cans of salmon, for which she was charged P95.20.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee Yat&nbsp; packed&nbsp; the goods&nbsp; she bought&nbsp; and&nbsp; brought&nbsp; out the&nbsp; two sacks&nbsp; of rice. At this&nbsp; juncture&nbsp; Cesar&nbsp; Era&nbsp; came&nbsp; in&nbsp; and asked her&nbsp; whether she already had&nbsp; received the&nbsp; compressor to which&nbsp; question she answered&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; affirmative. Eugenia took out&nbsp; from&nbsp; her vanity case&nbsp; 4 P20&nbsp; bills, 2 P5&nbsp; bills&nbsp; and 1&nbsp; P10&nbsp; bill&nbsp; which she&nbsp; placed on the table to pay for the goods bought.&nbsp; As Lee Yat was handing to&nbsp; her the change of P4.80, Cecilio addressed Eugenia in Bicol, "Mrs. give&nbsp; the change to&nbsp; us."&nbsp; When she paid no&nbsp; attention to&nbsp; him, Cecilio asked&nbsp; her, "Where is&nbsp; the change I was asking from you?"&nbsp; In answer, she rebuked him for begging despite his strong physique, which remark angered&nbsp; Cecilio. Eugenia&nbsp;&nbsp; stopped&nbsp; an ALATCO bus passing by and&nbsp; the&nbsp; conductor named&nbsp; Anayan&nbsp; and&nbsp; the driver&nbsp; named&nbsp;&nbsp; Exequiel&nbsp; Patriarca alighted&nbsp; to load Eugenia's packages.&nbsp; As the two, with&nbsp; the aid of Cesar Era, started to load them, Cecilio&nbsp; stopped them, threatening to do harm to them if they&nbsp; should disobey him. The three desisted.&nbsp; When Eugenia picked&nbsp; up&nbsp; the bundle of canned goods,&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola snatched it away from her. Eugenia dropped the bundle scattering the canned goods on the ground Cecilio took the fish wrapped in a piece of paper which Eugenia bought,&nbsp; while&nbsp; Tito and Gaspar picked up&nbsp; the&nbsp; bundles containing the rest of the goods she&nbsp; purchased&nbsp; and&nbsp; deposited them inside the store of Lee Yat, with&nbsp; instruction not to give them to anybody. The bus driver&nbsp; drove&nbsp; on&nbsp; leaving Eugenia behind. . At about&nbsp; 5:30 o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon,&nbsp; a&nbsp; bus of the BITRANCO&nbsp; passed by and&nbsp; Eugenia boarded it to&nbsp; go home to Higfiaroy.&nbsp; On her way she met&nbsp; a truck on which her&nbsp; husband was riding.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had left Higfiaroy to go to Hanauan to meet her upon receipt of the information about&nbsp; the&nbsp; incident&nbsp; from Exequiel Patriarca.&nbsp; She signalled&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck to stop, transferred to it to join her husband, and returned&nbsp; to Hanauan. On their way, they stopped at&nbsp; the&nbsp; store of Dominador Nunez at barrio Osini at the instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Felix Brazal who&nbsp; made&nbsp; some purchases there. Resuming, they reached Hanauan at about 6:30 o'clock in the evening where Eugenia and her husband Mariano alighted in front of Lee&nbsp; Yat's&nbsp; store,&nbsp; There she&nbsp; pointed to him the bundles belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; her which she&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to bring home. She told Lee&nbsp; Yat that she would&nbsp; get&nbsp; them already.&nbsp; Lee Yat&nbsp; at&nbsp; first refused to allow her&nbsp; to get them, saying that they were deposited in&nbsp; his&nbsp; store&nbsp; by Cecilio&nbsp; Iriola.&nbsp; Mariano protested to Lee&nbsp; Yat and asked&nbsp; him why he would&nbsp; not allow his wife who purchased them from him to&nbsp; get what she owned.&nbsp; Lee Yat finally yielded.&nbsp; Mariano carried the sacks of rice and&nbsp; the bundles of goods bought by his wife to the truck while his laborers Felix Brazal, Federico Babasa, Jesus&nbsp; Bordejos and Armando&nbsp; Cadag stayed on top&nbsp; of the truck and&nbsp; helped him get the&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of rice and bundles of&nbsp; goods as he raised&nbsp; them up. When Mariano was raising&nbsp; up the&nbsp; first sack of rice, a shot was fired,&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by another, coming from the direction of&nbsp; Naga City.&nbsp; Eugenia saw Cecilio&nbsp; approaching the truck armed with a gun&nbsp; and&nbsp; a bolo.&nbsp; When&nbsp; Mariano was loading the last sack of rice Cecilio shouted&nbsp; at him, "Why&nbsp; did&nbsp; you get that?" and struck her&nbsp; husband with a bolo on&nbsp; the&nbsp; right leg. Mariano turned around to the right and&nbsp; fell.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; he was about to fall Cecilio&nbsp; dealt him another&nbsp; blow.&nbsp; Upon seeing that Mariano was being attacked, his men aboard the truck jumped to the ground. Cecilio&nbsp; chased&nbsp; Felix Brazal.&nbsp; At that&nbsp; moment Bernardo intercepted Cecilio and grappled with him.&nbsp; Cecilio tried to strike Bernardo but the latter was able to pary his blow and wrest his bolo&nbsp; from him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilio ran away and Bernardo picked up Mariano&nbsp; whom he&nbsp; carried&nbsp; to the&nbsp; truck. They brought&nbsp; him to&nbsp; Tigaon and&nbsp; later&nbsp; to Goa&nbsp; where he was treated by&nbsp; a physician.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was subsequently&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; to the provincial&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital&nbsp; at Naga City&nbsp; where he was medically examined.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Diosdado P.&nbsp; Lahum,&nbsp; senior&nbsp; resident physician,&nbsp; issued the following certificate:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">April 16, 1951</span><br></div><br>TO&nbsp; WHOM IT MAY&nbsp; CONCERN:<br><br>This is to certify that Mariano de Limios, 40 years old, male, married, and a resident of Tinambac, Camarines Sur, was physically examined in this hospital on Sept. 28, 1950,at 11:30 A.M.<br><br>1. Wound,&nbsp; incised,&nbsp; 3&nbsp; inches&nbsp; long, sutured, scalp,&nbsp;&nbsp; left temporal region.<br><br>2.&nbsp; Wound,&nbsp; incised,&nbsp; 3 inches&nbsp; long,&nbsp; sutured, hand,&nbsp; right, dorsal aspect.<br><br>3. Wound,&nbsp; incised, 4 inches long, sutured,&nbsp; directed transversely,. right&nbsp; leg, lower&nbsp; 3rd.<br><br>The right leg was fluoroscoped&nbsp; on August 29, 1950.&nbsp; The following finding was&nbsp; noted:<br><br>1. Complete oblique fracture of lower 3rd&nbsp; fibula,&nbsp;&nbsp; right.<br><br>The patient was confined&nbsp; in this hospital from September 28, 1950, and was&nbsp; discharged from&nbsp; the hospital with&nbsp; slight dermal wound. Plaster cast&nbsp; was applied over the right leg&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 29, 1950, and was removed on January 3, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient was then able to walk&nbsp; over the removal&nbsp; although with slight difficulty. (Exhibit 4-Delimios.)<br></blockquote>A careful review of&nbsp; the evidence leads&nbsp; us to give more credence&nbsp; to the evidence for the defense.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is hard&nbsp; to believe&nbsp; that the&nbsp; three&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; would&nbsp; commit robbery in the&nbsp;&nbsp; center&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; barrio. where&nbsp;&nbsp; there are&nbsp; several stores.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; prosecution attempted to show that at 7:00 o'clock in the evening of&nbsp; 27 September&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the three defendants, together with Jesus Bordejos alias&nbsp; Jesse and Federico Babasa alias Decoy, who are still at large, went to the barrio&nbsp; of Hanauan to&nbsp; commit the robbery charged in&nbsp; the amended information.&nbsp; On the other&nbsp; hand, the evidence&nbsp; for&nbsp; the defense shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; at&nbsp; 3:30 o'clock&nbsp; in the afternoon of that day, the appellant Eugenia Delimios, accompanied&nbsp; by her&nbsp; four year&nbsp; old&nbsp; child, went to the barrio to make&nbsp; some&nbsp; purchases, but&nbsp; was&nbsp; prevented by Cecilio Iriola&nbsp; from taking home what she had purchased, because&nbsp; he was angered by&nbsp; the&nbsp; refusal of Engenia Delimios to&nbsp; give&nbsp; him&nbsp; the&nbsp; change&nbsp; of F4.80 that Lee Yat handed to&nbsp; her after paying for her&nbsp; purchases in his store. According to Felix Brazal, upon whom the trial court placed much reliance, at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of&nbsp; that&nbsp; day, after his work in Hignaroy was over,, he&nbsp; asked Mariano Delimios for&nbsp; rice but the latter told him to go&nbsp; to Hanauan where&nbsp; his wife was.&nbsp; This part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Felix Brazal corroborates&nbsp; the evidence for the defense that before the incident&nbsp; which resulted&nbsp; in the death&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola, Eugenia Delimios went to&nbsp; barrio Hanauan&nbsp; to make&nbsp; some purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Felix Brazal&nbsp; further testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; he asked for rice&nbsp; from Mariano&nbsp; Delimios&nbsp; because&nbsp; he was not&nbsp; given his pay for&nbsp; the&nbsp; work&nbsp; he had done&nbsp; in the construction&nbsp; of the bridge in Hignaroy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; at 6:00&nbsp; o'clock in the evening, he boarded the truck used by Mariano Delimios and&nbsp; went with him to Hanauan.&nbsp; This testimony again tallies with the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; for the&nbsp; defense that after learning&nbsp; from Exequiel Patriarca the incident that took place between his&nbsp; wife&nbsp; and Cecilio Iriola, Mariano went to Hanauan in his&nbsp; truck and on the way&nbsp; he met his wife who transferred to his truck and returned&nbsp; to Hanauan.&nbsp; The trial court gave credence to the&nbsp; testimony of Felix&nbsp; Brazal because he was a&nbsp; laborer of Mariano Delimios in the construction of the bridge&nbsp; in Higñaroy&nbsp; and that notwithstanding the fact that&nbsp; he was under his employ, he testified against Mariano Delimios and his wife.&nbsp; However, the fact that he had a grudge&nbsp; against the Delimioses because according to&nbsp; him he&nbsp; was not paid his wages as laborer and failed to get the&nbsp; rice which he needed&nbsp; for him and his family was overlooked&nbsp; by the trial&nbsp; court.<br><br>Another witness whose testimony was relied&nbsp; upon by the trial court&nbsp; is Lee&nbsp; Yat.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; withheld from the Court&nbsp; certain&nbsp; facts such as the incident that took place between Gaspar Peralta and the two male defendants inside&nbsp; his store before the alleged robbery was committed,&nbsp; he having testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; Gaspar&nbsp; was inside the store when the&nbsp; alleged robbers&nbsp; arrived.&nbsp; On&nbsp; cross-examination, he testified that he did not hear any noise outside his&nbsp; store&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged robbers had&nbsp; left and after closing his store.&nbsp; It is hard to believe&nbsp; that he did not hear the shooting&nbsp; and the&nbsp; shouts&nbsp; of Cecilio&nbsp; Iriola for help when he was wounded.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also hard to believe that his wife who was&nbsp; in his store when the robbers arrived was able to leave the store to&nbsp; go to a nearby restaurant and come back later after the store was closed, because the alleged robbers&nbsp; who&nbsp; were armed, according to&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; for the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have allowed her to leave the store to enable her&nbsp; to call the police&nbsp; for help.<br><br>The&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tito Crucillo loses its reliability in view of the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was with Cecilio Iriola in the store of Lee Yat extorting&nbsp; money&nbsp; from&nbsp; the appellant Eugenia&nbsp; Delimios.<br><br>If the&nbsp; evidence for the prosecution is to&nbsp; be believed in its entirety, the wounds inflicted upon Mariano Delimios would&nbsp; have no&nbsp; explanation because, according&nbsp; to that evidence,&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola&nbsp; did not&nbsp; strike&nbsp; or&nbsp; hit&nbsp; Mariano Delimios with his bolo.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, the evidence for the defense shows that when the last sack of rice was being raised by&nbsp; Mariano Delimios to be placed on board the truck, Cecilio&nbsp; Iriola attacked Mariano Delimios with&nbsp; his&nbsp; bolo&nbsp; and hit&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter on the lower&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; right&nbsp; leg&nbsp; above&nbsp; the&nbsp; heel. Commenting&nbsp; on&nbsp; this testimony of&nbsp; Mariano Delimios, the trial court stated that if it&nbsp; is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola&nbsp; struck with&nbsp; his &amp; bolo Mariano&nbsp; Delimios,&nbsp; both&nbsp; standing,&nbsp; he&nbsp; would not have hit him on the right leg,&nbsp; lower 3rd, and&nbsp; for&nbsp; that reason his&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; was not&nbsp; given credence.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the trial court overlooked the fact that the day following the incident Mariano Delimios was examined by Dr. Diosdado P. Lahum&nbsp; and&nbsp; in addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the wound on the right leg,&nbsp; 3rd, he was wounded on the scalp,&nbsp; left temporal region, and&nbsp; hand, right" dorsal aspect.<br><br>The defendant spouses were engaged in the construction work with a fair income.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact, taken together with the other circumstances of the case, engenders and creates a serious&nbsp; and reasonable&nbsp; doubt that they would go&nbsp; to the extent of robbing a Chinese vendor of two&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of. rice, ten packages&nbsp; of cigarettes,&nbsp; two&nbsp; boxes&nbsp; of canned salmon and sardines and&nbsp; a watch, all&nbsp; valued at P154. What really happened,&nbsp; as&nbsp; may be gleaned from the evidence&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by the prosecution&nbsp; and the&nbsp; defense, was&nbsp; that when&nbsp; Eugenia was prevented&nbsp; by the deceased and&nbsp; his companions from bringing with&nbsp; her the goods she had&nbsp; purchased, which were deposited&nbsp; by&nbsp; them&nbsp; in the store of Lee Yat, she&nbsp; returned to Hignaroy.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way she&nbsp; met her husband who was on his&nbsp; way&nbsp; to&nbsp; aid her after Exequiel Patriarca had informed him&nbsp; of what happened to&nbsp; her and&nbsp; upon reaching Lee&nbsp; Yat's&nbsp; store&nbsp; at Hanauan got what rightfully belonged to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon beings informed that&nbsp; she&nbsp; was back with her&nbsp; husband&nbsp; to get them, Cecilio Iriola hurried to the store and as he approached the place&nbsp; fired his gun twice, perhaps to scare them away and to&nbsp; prevent them from getting the goods which he had left and deposited in the&nbsp; store of Lee Yat The prosecution&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; that&nbsp; Mariano Delimios and&nbsp; Bernardo&nbsp; Tariman&nbsp; struck Cecilio Iriola with their&nbsp; bolos. On&nbsp; the other hand, the evidence for the defense shows that Mariano Delimios&nbsp; did not strike Cecilio&nbsp; Iriola, because&nbsp; after the latter struck Mariano Delimios&nbsp; on the right&nbsp; leg, the latter turned&nbsp; around to the&nbsp; right&nbsp; and&nbsp; fell. The&nbsp; wounds inflicted&nbsp; upon&nbsp; Cecilio Iriola were caused not&nbsp; by Mariano Delimios&nbsp; but by his companions who jumped from the truck probably&nbsp; to stop the fight, most likely by Bernardo Tariman who grappled with the deceased Cecilio Iriola.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; the whole evidence we cannot conclude and&nbsp; find the appellants&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime charged in the amended information, and for that reason we reverse the judgment appealed from and acquit the&nbsp; appellants Mariano Delimios and Eugenia Delimios, with the proportionate costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span><br><br><i>Paras C.
