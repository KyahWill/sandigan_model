				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By an instrument dated June 29, 1944, Vicenta Matias Vda. de Cornejo, and her 
son, Amado Cornejo, Jr., mortgaged to the spouses Dominador Nicolas and Olimpia 
Matias, four (4) parcels of land, situated in San Roque, municipality of Gapan, 
Province of Nueva Ecija, to guarantee the payment of the sum of P30,000—then 
lent by the mortgagees to the mortgagors and received by the latter, in Japanese 
military notes—one (1) year after the expiration of five (5) years from said 
date ("pagbabayaran isang [1] taon pagkatapos ng limang [5] taong Simula sa 
fecha ng kasulatang ito") with interest thereon, at the rate of six per cent 
(6%) per annum. On July 15, 1944, said mortgagors offered to pay the debt, with 
interest for five (5) years, but the mortgagees rejected the offer. Whereupon, 
in August, 1944, the mortgagors deposited judicially the sum of 
P39,000—representing the principal (P30,000), plus interest for five (5) years, 
at the stipulated rate—and instituted Civil Case No. 156 of the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija, entitled "Vicenta Matias, et al. vs. Dominador Nicolas, 
et al.," for the purpose of compelling the mortgagees to accept said amount and 
to discharge the mortgage. Although holding that the mortgagees were not 
justified in rejecting the tender of payment made by the mortgagors, said court 
rendered judgment, on August 12, 1946, declaring the consignation invalid for 
failure of the mortgagors to give previous notice thereof, and sentencing the 
mortgagors to pay the mortgagees the sum of P2,000—as the equivalent in 
Philippine currency, pursuant to the Ballantyne schedule, of P30,000 in Japanese 
military notes—with interest, at the legal rate, from June 29, 1944. On appeal 
from this judgment, the Court of Appeals, CA—G. R. No. 554-R (L-1195), in a 
decision promulgated on September 16, 1947, held the consignation valid and the 
obligation guaranteed by the mortgage fully discharged. The mortgagees, however, 
brought the case, for review by writ of certiorari, to this Court, which, in a 
decision promulgated on May 29, 1951<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> 
(G. R. No. L-1743), held that the mortgagors could not, without the mortgagees' 
consent, accelerate the date of maturity of the obligation in question, which is 
payable after the fifth year from June 29, 1944; that the mortgagees cannot be 
compelled to accept payment prior to the expiration of said fifth year; and that 
the judicial consignation made by the mortgagors is, consequently, invalid, 
except as regards the amount corresponding to the interest for one (1) year from 
June 29, 1944. The dispositive part of our aforementioned decision reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"Hence we must of necessity declare, that the offer and consignation were not 
valid, except for the satisfaction of the interest for the year 1944 which was 
then due. The appealed decision will thus be modified. Although the defendants 
have asked for judgment against the plaintiffs 'in the sixth year from 1944' for 
the amount of the note plus interest, we must decline to render such judgment 
now, firstly because at the time the case was instituted the mortgage was not 
yet payable, and secondly because there is the moratorium law. Anyway they will 
be at liberty to collect that mortgage plus interest when the moratorium is 
lifted, and in that foreclosure proceedings the amount of recovery shall be 
determined. Let judgment be entered accordingly."</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon thereafter, or on August 22, 1951, the mortgagees instituted the present 
action for foreclosure of said mortgage. The only issue raised in the lower 
court was whether the sum of P30,000, lent by the mortgagees in Japanese war 
notes, should be paid by the mortgagors in Philippine currency, peso for peso, 
or in accordance with the Ballantyne schedule. The lower court chose the latter 
alternative and, accordingly, rendered judgment "ordering defendants to pay 
plaintiffs the amount of P2,000, Philippine currency, with interest at six per 
cent (6%) a year, from June 29, 1945, up to the date when it is actually paid." 
The case is now before us on appeal taken by the mortgagees.</p>
<p>In Cruz <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario (G. R. No. L-4859) decided on July 24, 1951, 
it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In passing upon the petitioner's first assignment of error, which was the 
only one that deserved consideration, and dismissing the petition for 
certiorari, we have cited in our minute resolution the cases already decided by 
this Court as applicable to the present, not because they are similar in fact 
and law to this case as the attorneys for the petitioner erroneously believe, 
but because the doctrine laid down in those cases is squarely applicable to the 
present. That is, <em>if according to the stipulation of the parties, the money 
to be paid by the debtor to the creditor, or by the vendor with pacto </em>to 
the creditor to redeem the property mortgaged, or sold<em>, shall be due and 
payable after liberation as agreed upon by the parties in the present case, it 
shall be paid in legal tender or Philippine currency at par value or at the rate 
of one Philippine peso for each peso in Japanese military notes</em>; but if it 
shall be due and payable before liberation it shall be paid after the liberation 
in Philippine currency in accordance with the Ballentyne schedule. Besides, 
according to the facts found by the Court of Appeals which we cannot disturb in 
the present case, in fixing the amount of P5,000 to be paid by a vendor with 
<em>pacto de retro</em> to the vendee or by the debtor to his creditor after 
liberation, the parties had stipulated that the debtor or vendor, who had 
received P70,000 in Japanese military notes, shall pay the said sum of P5,000 
Philippine currency within a certain period after liberation." (Underscoring 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This ruling was reiterated in Arevalo <em>vs</em>. Barreto (89 Phil., 633) 
decided on July 31, 1951, in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a consideration of the question raised in the second assignment of 
error of the appellant, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court 
erred in evaluating the repurchase price of the property sold and the value of 
the promissory note, at P516.70 Philippine currency. The parties have stipulated 
or agreed that the right to repurchase the property for P12,000 Philippine 
currency 'shall only commence from January 1, 1947, and shall end on January 10, 
1948,' and the promissory note for P4,000 Philippine currency 'shall be paid on 
or after October 31, 1946.' <em>As the said amounts were to become due after 
liberation, they shall be paid in Philippine currency</em> according to a long 
line of decisions rendered by this Court. Besides, in the present case, the 
agreement of the parties was, not only that said amounts be paid after 
liberation, but they had stipulated that of the 60,000 pesos in Japanese 
military notes, the vendee shall pay P12,000 in Philippine currency for the 
repurchase of the property, and of the 20,000 in Japanese military notes 
received by the plaintiff from the defendant as a loan, the former shall pay the 
latter P4,000 in Philippine currency, after liberation." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>To the same effect was the conclusion reached in the case of Wilson 
<em>vs</em>. Berkenkotter (49 Off. Gaz., p. 1401), in which we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In several cases involving the application of the Ballantyne schedule, this 
Court has held that said schedule is applicable to obligations contracted during 
the Japanese occupation <em>where said obligations are made payable on demand or 
during said Japanese occupation</em>, but not after the war or at a specified 
date <em>or period which may indicate that the parties were speculating on the 
continuation or cessation of the war at time of payment</em>. If the obligation 
on the part of Wilson to pay Berkenkotter the amount paid by the latter to wipe 
out their debt to the Bank was created during the occupation, then the 
Ballantyne schedule is applicable; but if said obligation was created <em>before 
the war</em>, particularly on date when plaintiff and defendant signed the 
promissory note in favor of the Bank, then the Ballantyne schedule may not be 
applied." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing view has been consistently applied by this Court in a number of 
other cases, among which the following may be mentioned: Ilusorio <em>vs</em>. 
Busuego, 84 Phil., 630; Roño <em>vs</em>. Gomez, 46 Off. Gaz., Supp. No. 11, 
339; Gomez <em>vs</em>. Tabia, 47 Off. Gaz., 641, Ponce de Leon <em>vs</em>. 
Syjuco, 90 Phil., 311; Garcia <em>vs</em>. De los Santos, 49 Off. Gaz., 4830. 
What is more, the strong dissents written in some of the cases cited indicated 
that adherence to said view was effected upon thorough consideration of the 
different aspects thereof, that said doctrine is now in the nature of <em>stare 
decisis</em> and that the issue is now close as regards this Court.</p>
<p>It is thus settled that the contracting parties are free to stipulate on the 
currency in which their respective obligations shall be settled, and that 
whenever, pursuant to the terms of an agreement, an obligation assumed during 
the Japanese occupation is not payable until after liberation of the 
Philippines, the parties to the agreement are deemed to have intended that the 
amount stated in the contract be paid in such currency as may be legal tender at 
the time when the obligation becomes due. This is, precisely, the situation 
obtaining in the case at bar. The deed of mortgage in question provides that the 
obligation of the mortgagees shall be paid one year <em>after</em> the 
expiration of five (5) years from June 29, 1944, which is the date of said 
instrument. In other words, the obligation is not payable until June 29, 1949. 
Indeed, in the decision of this Court in case G. R. No. L-1743, we 
<em>reversed</em> the decision of the Court of Appeals sustaining the theory of 
the mortgagors, upon the ground that the latter were not entitled to accelerate, 
without the consent of the mortgagees, the date of the maturity of the 
obligation; that the mortgagees could not be compelled, and were under no 
obligation, to accept the tender of payment made on July 15, 1944 (except as to 
the interest for one [1] year) despite the fact that said tender included the 
interest for five (5) years from June 29, 1944; and that, consequently, the 
consignation effected simultaneously with the institution of civil case No. 156 
of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija in August, 1944, was null and 
void, with the exception above mentioned.</p>
<p>In other words, said decision of this Court was implicitly held, and the 
doctrine laid down in the cases above referred to, leave us no choice but to 
declare, as we do, that the obligation involved in the present case must be 
satisfied, peso for peso, in Philippine currency.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the defendants-appellees are hereby sentenced to pay to the 
plaintiffs-appellants, either directly or through the Clerk of the lower court, 
within ninety (90) days from the date on which this decision shall become final, 
the sum of P30,000, in Philippine currency, with interest thereon at the rate of 
six per centum (6%) a year, from June 29, 1945. In default of such payment, let 
the mortgage in question be foreclosed in the manner provided by law and the 
rules of court.</p>
<p>With costs against the defendants-appellees. So ordered.</p>
