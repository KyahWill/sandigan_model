				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo 
dismissing the plaintiff's action upon motion of the defendant on the ground 
that it is barred by prior Judgment.</p>
<p>The pertinent facts alleged in the complaint to which a motion to dismiss on 
the ground that the cause of action is barred by a prior Judgment la filed are 
those relating to the cause of action and the parties, because if they are the 
same as the cause of action and the parties in the prior judgment, or though the 
parties are different they represent the same interest, and the court rendering 
the prior judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties, the 
subsequent action, is barred by the prior Judgment and should be dismissed.</p>
<p>In the present appeal, there is no question that the parties in the present 
and prior action are the same or represent the same interest, and that the cause 
of action in both are the same, that is, the performance or non performance of 
the terms and conditions of a contract of sale for the enforcement or 
resolution thereof. The only question to be determined is whether the Court 
which has rendered the former judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter 
and the parties.</p>
<p>The appellants contend that the lower court erred in upholding the validity 
of the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo during the Japanese 
occupation, because; (1) "The said court had no jurisdiction to try , Civil Case 
No. 21, much less to render the decision in question on October 2, 1944; and 
(2) That granting for the sake of argument that the Puppet Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo had jurisdiction, yet such decision was rendered after having 
deprived plaintiff of his day in court and is therefore in violation of the due 
process clause of the Constitution."</p>
<p>As to the first question, the appellants do not question the ruling of this 
Supreme Court on the validity of the judgments rendered by the courts 
established in these Islands during the Japanese occupation laid down in Co Kim 
Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>, Off. 
Gaz., 779; but they contend that, as the three parcels of land, involved or sold 
in the contract, of sale resolved by the prior judgment were located in the 
Municipality of Passi, Province of Iloilo, and "the puppet Republic of the 
Philippines since tho middle of the month of September, 1944, could no longer 
assort its authority over the major portion of the territory of Iloilo including 
the Municipality of Passi," then under the possession and control of the Panay 
guerrilla forces, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo which rendered the prior 
judgment had no jurisdiction over the <em>res</em> or the property because the 
action was <em>quasi In rem</em>, and therefore the said judgment is null and 
void.</p>
<p>This contention is premised on the wrong assumption that the action for the 
resolution of a contract of sale of a real property is an action <em>quasi in 
rem</em>. The action instituted by the appellees to resolve the contract of sale 
of said parcels of land, <em>is in personam </em>and not quasi in rem.</p>
<p>This Court quoted with approval in Grey Alba <em>vs.</em> De la Cruz, 17 
Phil. 61-62, the following definition of an action <em>in personam:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the technical object of the suit is establish a claim against some 
particular person, with a judgment which generally, in theory at least, binds 
his body, or to bar some individual claim or objection, so that only certain 
persons are entitled to be heard in defense, the action is in Personam, although 
it may concern the right to or possession of a tangible thin If, on the other 
hand, the object is to bar indifferently all who might be minded to make an 
objection of any sort against the right sought to be established, and if anyone 
in the world has a right to be heard on the strength of alleging facts which, if 
true, shew an inconsistent interest, the proceeding is <em>in rem." </em>(Tyler 
<em>vs.</em> Judges, <em>supra)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to American Jurisprudence, Vol. I, page 435, "An action <em>in 
personam</em> has for its object a judgment against the person, as distinguished 
from a judgment against property, to determine its status. Whether a proceeding 
is in <em>rem</em> or <em>in personam</em> is determined by its nature and 
purpose, and by these only. A proceeding <em>in personam</em> is a proceeding to 
enforce personal rights and obligations brought against the person and based on 
jurisdiction of the person, although it may involve his right to, or the 
exercise of ownership of, specific property, or seek to compel him to control or 
dispose of it in accordance with the mandate of the court."</p>
<p>In the case of Banco Espa√±ol-Filipino <em>vs.</em> Palanca, 37 Phil. 921, 
928, we held that "The action<em> quasi in rem</em> differs from the true action 
<em>rem</em> in the circumstance that in the former and individual is named as 
defendant, and the purpose of the proceeding is to subject his interest therein 
to the obligation or lien burdening the property. All proceedings having for 
their sole object the sale or other disposition of the property of the 
defendant, whether by attachment, foreclosure, or other form of remedy, are in a 
general way thus designated. The judgment entered in these proceedings is. 
conclusive only between the parties."</p>
<p>With respect to the second question. From the prior judgment marked as 
Exhibit A of the motion to dismiss, it appears that the appellants had submitted 
themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo by 
filing their answers to the complaint through their Attorney Benjamin H. Tirrol, 
the same attorney who represents them now; that they were notified ofthe date 
set for the hearing of the action, but when the case was called for trial on 
September 29, 1944, their attorney asked and obtained permission from the court 
to withdraw his appearance as attorney for the appellants stating as ground 
therefor that it was difficult to communicate with his clients, who went to 
Arevalo, a suburb of and distant of about six or seven kilometers from the 
Iloilo City, capital of the Province of Iloilo; that to give the appellants 
opportunity to be heard, the hearing was postponed and set on the afternoon of 
the same date; and that as they did not appear on the afternoon the oase was 
heard and judgment was rendered on October 2, 1944, declaring the resolution of 
the contract between the parties and ordering the appellees to return to the 
appellants the sum of P5,723.60, received by the former from the latter as 
payment on account of the sum of P55,000.00 agreed upon as purchase price.</p>
<p>And, according to the allegations in appellants' complaint, on October 25, 
1944, the appellants filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the 
court, and when they tried to appeal from the decision the court denied the 
appeal on November 23, 1944, and declared the judgment final and executory; and, 
on November 29, the appellant: filed a motion for reconsideration of the order 
denying the appeal, and up to the filing of the complaint in the present case no 
resolution of the motion has been received by the appellants.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing facts set forth in the decision Exhibit A and not 
contradicted or denied by the appellants, which show that the absence from the 
trial of the appellants was due to their own fault, appellants contention that 
they were deprived of their day in court is untenable.</p>
<p>The appeal is therefore dismissed. So ordered.</p><em>Paras, Actg. C.J.,

</style>PERFECTO, J.: 
<p>We dissent:<br>We are the opinion that the appealed decision should be 
reverse and the lower court ordered to proceed with the case and render 
decision on the merits.</p>This stand is based on the reasons stated in our 
opinion in Co Kim Chan vs. Valdez Tan Keh, <span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> (41 Off. Gaz., 779). <br><br><br>
