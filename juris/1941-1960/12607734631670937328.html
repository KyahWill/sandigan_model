				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is ah appeal by the prosecution from an order of dismissal. <br><br>It appears&nbsp; that on February&nbsp; 26, 1953,&nbsp; an information was filed in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Camarines Sur, charging&nbsp; four persons with theft of large cattle alleged to have been committed on or about June 18, 1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the defendants&nbsp; had pleaded not guilty and in the course of&nbsp; the trial, the caretaker of&nbsp; the&nbsp; stolen carabao, testifying as fourth witness for the prosecution, declared that the theft occured sometime in July, 1947,&nbsp; where upon the fiscal asked for permission to amend the&nbsp; information to make&nbsp; it conform to&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; as&nbsp; regards the date of the commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instant objection&nbsp; to the proposed&nbsp; amendment&nbsp; was raised on behalf of the defendants on the ground that it would&nbsp; violate their substantial rights&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been pending for a long time and the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; had progressed to .such an extent that&nbsp; their defense had already been revealed to the prosecution.&nbsp; Believing&nbsp; that&nbsp; the amendment would really&nbsp; prejudice the substantial rights of the accused&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court sustained the&nbsp; objection.&nbsp; And the defense having also asked&nbsp; that the information be quashed on the ground of variance between its allegations and the evidence, the court verbally ruled that it&nbsp; was dismissing the said&nbsp; information and implemented the ruling&nbsp; by declaring the case&nbsp; dismissed in the judgment rendered, at the conclusion of the trial.<br><br>Appealing .from the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; dismissal, the Solicitor General contends that instead of&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the case the lower court should have&nbsp; allowed the&nbsp; information&nbsp; to be amended. <br><br>Section 13 of Rule 106 provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 13. <i>Amendment.â€”</i>The information&nbsp; of complaint&nbsp; may be amended, in substance or form, without leave of&nbsp; court, at any time before the defendant pleads;&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereafter and during the trial as&nbsp; to all matters of form, by leave and at the discretion of the court, when&nbsp; the same can be dona without prejudice to the rights of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.<br><br>"If it appears at any time before judgment that a&nbsp; mistake has been&nbsp; made in charging the proper&nbsp; offense, the court may dismiss if the original&nbsp; complaint or information and&nbsp; order the filling of&nbsp; a new one charging the proper&nbsp; offense, provided the defendant would not be placed&nbsp; thereby in double jeopardy,&nbsp; and may&nbsp; also require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial."<br></blockquote>The amendment proposed in the present&nbsp; ease&nbsp; consists in&nbsp; changing the&nbsp; date of the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime charged from June 18, 1952 to&nbsp; July,&nbsp; 1947.&nbsp; In not permitting&nbsp; the amendment&nbsp; the&nbsp; learned&nbsp; trial&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"It is a cardinal rule in criminal&nbsp; procedure that the time at&nbsp; which an offense&nbsp; was committed&nbsp; need not be alleged in&nbsp; the complaint or information, but it&nbsp; is required that the a alleged to have been committed at any time as near to the actual date at which the offense was committed as the information or complaint would permit (Rule&nbsp; 106,&nbsp; section 10).&nbsp; The reason for this rule&nbsp; is obvious.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; to apprise the accused'&nbsp; of&nbsp; the approximate&nbsp; date when&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; charged was committed in order to enable&nbsp; him to&nbsp; prepare his defense and thus avoid a surprise.&nbsp; In t case at bar, the proof shows that the&nbsp; carabao was lost on&nbsp; July 25,&nbsp; 1947&nbsp; and not on June 18,&nbsp; 1952 as alleged' in the information. The period of&nbsp; almost five years between 1947 and&nbsp; 1952 covers&nbsp; such a&nbsp; long stretch of time that one cannot help but be led&nbsp; to&nbsp; believe that another theft different from&nbsp; that' committed&nbsp; by the defendants in 1952&nbsp; was also perpetrated by them in 1947.&nbsp; Under this impression the accused,&nbsp; who&nbsp; came to&nbsp; court prepared to&nbsp; face&nbsp; a charge of theft of&nbsp; large cattle allegedly committed by them in 1952, were certainly caught by sudden&nbsp; surprise upon being confronted by evidence tending to&nbsp; prove a&nbsp; similar&nbsp; offense&nbsp; committed in&nbsp; 1947.&nbsp; The variance&nbsp; is certainly unfair to&nbsp; them,&nbsp; for it violates their constitutional right to be informed before the trial of the&nbsp; specific charge against them and deprives them of the&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; defend themselves.&nbsp; Moreover, they can not be convicted of an&nbsp; offense&nbsp; with which they are not charged.<br><br>"It&nbsp; is also a cardinal rule&nbsp; in criminal procedure that after the defendant has&nbsp; entered his plea,&nbsp; tho information or complaint may be&nbsp; amended&nbsp; only&nbsp; as&nbsp; to all matters of form when the same&nbsp; can be done&nbsp; without prejudice to the rights of the defendant (Rule 196,&nbsp; section 13).&nbsp; An&nbsp; amendment that would change&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of the&nbsp; offense from 1947&nbsp; to 1952 is certain not a matter of form.&nbsp; The difference' in&nbsp; date&nbsp; could not be attributed&nbsp; to a clerical error, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; possibility of such&nbsp; an e ruled out by the fact that the difference is not only in the year, but also in the&nbsp; month and in the last&nbsp; two&nbsp; digits&nbsp; of the&nbsp; year.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is apparent that the proposed amendment concerns with material facts constituting&nbsp; the offense, and consequently it&nbsp; would be prejudicial to the substantial rights of the defendants."<br></blockquote>His&nbsp; Honor has&nbsp; we&nbsp; think&nbsp; adduced good reasons for considering the amendment&nbsp; as&nbsp; referring&nbsp; to substance&nbsp; and not.&nbsp; merely to form.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even&nbsp; supposing&nbsp; it to&nbsp; be the contrary, its allowance, after the defendants had pleaded, was discretionary&nbsp; with the&nbsp; court&nbsp; and would be&nbsp; proper only if it would not prejudice their rights. We are not prepare&nbsp; to say&nbsp; that the&nbsp; court did not&nbsp; makes good use of that discretion in disallowing the amendment; considering that the variance sought to be introduced thereby would appear to be&nbsp; really&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp; for as clearly explained by the court "it violates&nbsp; their constitutional&nbsp; right to be informed before the trial of&nbsp; the&nbsp; specific charge against&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp; and deprives them&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opportunity to defend themselves."<br><br>In any event, it appears from the judgment&nbsp; below that, with the proposed&nbsp; amendment disallowed and&nbsp; seeing&nbsp; that the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; could&nbsp; not contradict the testimony&nbsp; that created the necessity for&nbsp; the amendment, the trial court dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; case oh the ground of variance between allegation and proof, so that the dismissal really amounted to&nbsp; an acquittal.&nbsp; In line,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; with&nbsp; our ruling&nbsp; in Gandicela&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.
