				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The four defendants in cases G. R. Nos. L-3770-71, namely, <em>Datumanong 
Monadi, Mascara Monadi, Racid Lucman, and Palawan Lucman</em>, are appealing the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of Lanao finding them guilty of the 
crime of murder for the killing of <em>Pangandaman P. Aguam</em> (later to be 
referred to as <em>Pangandaman</em>), and sentencing Palawan Lucman as principal 
to the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the amount of P2,000; and sentencing the other three defendants 
Datumanong Monadi, Mascara Monadi and Racid Lucman as accomplices, each to an 
indeterminate penalty of from six (6) years, one (1) month and eleven (11) days 
of <em>prision mayor</em> to twelve (12) years, five (5) months and eleven days 
of <em>reclusion temporal</em> and to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs 
of the deceased in the sum of P2,000; and all four to pay proportionate 
costs.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that on November 14, 1947, at about 7:30 p.m. as 
Pangandaman was about to enter his house in Dansalan, Lanao, he was shot in the 
back with a revolver, causing a mortal wound which resulted in his death a few 
minutes later. The four appellants were charged separately in two informations. 
First, Datumanong and his brother Mascara both surnamed Monadi and Moro Mapupuno 
were charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 362 on March 27, 1948; later on 
July 8, 1948, first-cousins Racid Lucman and Palawan Lucman were charged with 
the same crime in Criminal Case No. 446. The two cases were tried jointly and 
after the prosecution had rested its case, at the request of the prosecution 
itself the case against Moro Mapupuno was dismissed for lack of evidence. 
Extensive evidence was presented by the Government and the defense, the former 
presenting 17 witnesses and later 3 rebuttal witnesses, and the defense 
presenting about 29 witnesses.</p>
<p>According to the evidence and as found by the trial court in an exhaustive 
and well-written decision penned by Judge Ramon 0. Nolasco, in the evening in 
question Makasindig Umpat, Manking Aguam and Abdul Aguam, sister-in-law and 
brothers, respectively, of the deceased were living in the latter's house in 
Dansalan, Lanao. At about 7:30 p.m. these three happened to be in the second 
story of the house. Makasindig heard a knock at the door of the ground floor. 
She hastened to answer it and opening the door she saw Pangandaman wiping his 
shoes at the foot of the stairs preparatory to entering the house. At the same 
time she saw the two brothers Datumanong and Mascara walk fast or run from under 
the avocado tree in the yard, a few meters away from the door, toward two 
gasoline drums standing near the stairs, and as they reached the same, she saw 
Palawan Lucman stand up from behind the said two drums and with a revolver fire 
the fatal shot hitting the deceased in the back. The Monadi brothers also aimed 
their revolver at the deceased but because Makasindig shouted and cried for 
help, they desisted and the three defendants fled. A few moments later, several 
shots were heard from behind the house. Answering the cry for help for 
Makasindig, Manking stood up from the table where he was at and because of the 
shot or shots that he heard, he looked out the window and he saw five persons 
running below, away from the house, all carrying revolvers. He recognized only 
Racid Lucman and Palawan Lucman. He ran below and saw his brother sprawled below 
the stairs. Makasindig informed him of the identity of the three men she had 
seen but Manking told her not to reveal what she had seen to any one, not even 
to the authorities because they (relatives of the deceased) would take care of 
seeking revenge on the assailants. Makasindig and Manking carried the body of 
the deceased inside the house. Abdul Aguam was in the toilet room upstairs when 
he heard the shot and the cry for help. He hurriedly buttoned his pants, entered 
the kitchen and looked out the window and he saw Racid Lucman followed by four 
others among them Palawan Lucman, all running. As he descended to the ground 
floor he saw Makasindig and Manking carrying the body of the deceased. It seems 
that he was also informed of the identity of the three defendants seen by 
Makasindig and he also enjoined her not to reveal their indentity because they 
would take care of avenging the outrage. Condar Mama, a neighbor of the 
deceased, also heard the shots. He went down his house and saw three persons in 
the yard of the deceased but recognized none of them. Maungko Diro, another 
witness for the Government stated that that evening he was walking along the 
main road not far from the house of the deceased Pangandaman; in fact he could 
see the house from where he was. As he reached a spot in front of the house of 
one Sampaco Gubat he heard a shot followed by two other shots from the direction 
of the house of Pangandaman. He stopped walking evidently to observe and later 
saw Racid and Palawan running along a path from the direction of the house of 
Pangandaman extending from the house of the deceased toward the main road; and 
as the two defendants reached the highway he addressed Racid as Governor, the 
latter being a Deputy Governor of the municipal district of Bayang, and asked 
him where they came from. Racid curtly answered him with "Don't ask us". Just 
then two other persons followed Racid and Palawan along the same path or trail. 
Then Racid told those two to proceed to the lake; and "We will proceed to the 
house of Damocao Alonto".</p>
<p>In their defense appellants Datumanong and Mascara Monadi tried to prove by 
their testimony and that of their witnesses that in the afternoon and the whole 
evening of November 14, 1947, they were in the municipal district of Bayang 
where they were then residing; that Bayang is on the farther side of the lake 
(Lanao); that the only transportation then available from Bayang to Dansalan was 
by boat and it would take several hours to travel the distance, and that 
consequently, they could not possibly have been at the scene of the killing. 
Racid and Palawan tried to prove that at the time that Pangandaman was killed, 
they were in the house of Iki Alonto and Alauya Alonto. respectively, and that 
upon being informed of the death of Pangandaman, they together with Atty. 
Damocao Alonto and others hurried to the house of the deceased where they view 
the body and later volunteered to join search parties that went around lake 
Lanao in an effort to apprehend the perpetrators of the killing; that after a 
fruitless search they returned to the house of the deceased around midnight and 
Racid was even requested by the father-in-law of the deceased to look for a 
truck to carry the dead body to the Municipal District of Ganasi where it was 
buried the following day, Racid and Palawan attending the burial.</p>
<p>In the course of the hearing the trial judge made an ocular inspection of the 
premises of the house of the deceased and he found that the two gasoline drums 
from behind which Palawan shot at the deceased was only about one and half 
meters from the door, easily visible from where Makasindig was standing at the 
time of the shooting. Also visible was the avocado tree from under which the 
Monadi brothers hurried to join Palawan behind the gasoline drums; that at the 
time of the shooting, there was an electric bulb burning about 15 yards away and 
another electric light inside the house near the door. The trial judge also 
found that the houses of Iki Alonto and Alauya Alonto where Racid and Palawan 
claimed to have been at the time that Pangandaman was killed were not so far 
away, that is, they were only a few minutes walk from the house of the deceased 
so that it was perfectly possible for these two defendants to have been near the 
house of Iki Alonto and Alauya Alonto.</p>
<p>On the defense of alibi of the Monadi brothers, the trial court said that the 
witnesses presented to prove alibi were closely related to them; besides, their 
memory as to dates could not be relied upon for while they remembered Friday, 
November 14, 1947, they could not however state with certainty other dates more 
important to them and which concerned them personally, like the dates of the 
births of their children or their marriages, and the court concluded: "In short, 
their testimonies do not clearly and positively prove that the accused 
Datumanong and Mascara Monadi were in the municipal district of Bayang on the 
night in question."</p>
<p>Pending appeal there was filed with us a motion for new trial on the ground 
of newly discovered evidence which would consist of the testimony of several 
witnesses who, if permitted to testify would say that two other persons not 
included in the present case were the real killers of Pangandaman; that said 
killers had confessed their crime to one of the proposed witnesses; that 
defendants herein Racid and Palawan were among the first who rendered succor to 
the victim (Pangandaman); and that all the prosecution witnesses were paid and 
their testimonies fabricated, etc. The motion for new trial is accompanied by 
affidavits of persons said to be willing to testify at said new trial. In the 
first place, as well observed by the Solicitor General in his brief, the alleged 
evidence is not really newly discovered evidence within the meaning of the law 
because it could have been presented at the trial of the case, and that the new 
trial sought would only serve to further delay the final disposition of this 
case, and that furthermore, this so-called newly discovered evidence if allowed 
to be presented would only affect the credibility of witnesses which has been 
fully discussed by the trial court in its decision. Moreover, this is not the 
first time that a motion for new trial of this nature has been presented to us. 
We have considered similar motions for new trial where the very persons said to 
be responsible for the commission of the crime, filed affidavits owning and 
claiming the criminal responsibility, and yet we have almost invariably refused 
to entertain and grant them, because of the inherent improbability of the 
alleged new version of the commission of the crime, as well as the easiness and 
facility with which such affidavits are obtained. For these reasons, we are 
constrained to deny as we hereby deny the present motion for new trial.</p>
<p>The motive for the commission of the crime was in our opinion, duly 
established by the prosecution. We quote with approval the findings of the trial 
court on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pangandaman P. Aguam and Rascid Lucman joined the guerrilla forces in Lanao 
as first lieutenants. Pangandaman was promoted to captain, while Rascid remained 
as First lieutenant. Pangandaman subsequently was made Assistant Chief of Staff 
G-2 of the 108th Division under Col. Hodges, but Rascid was made Battalion 
Commander only. When Rascid was proposed to be promoted to captain, Pangandaman 
did not give his favorable recommendation thereto and his promotion was 
disapproved. Immediately after the liberation and during the organization of the 
Military Police Command in the Province of Lanao, Pangandaman, in his capacity 
as Operations Officer, was directed to select ten (10) Moro Officers from the 
Replacement Battalion in Camp Overton for integration in the Military Police 
Command, Rascid Lucman was not selected by Pangandaman.</p>
<p>"At one time, Datu Umpat, father-in-law of Pangandaman, was shot and wounded 
in Bayang, Lanao, by Barodi Monadi, a brother of Datumanong and Mascara Monadi 
and a relative of Rascid and Palawan Lucman. Shortly thereafter, Barodi was shot 
to death and as a consequence thereof, Ayonan Aguam, a son of Pangandaman and 
three other relatives of said deceased, were accused in court in, connection 
with the death of Barodi Monadi. (Criminal Case No. 141 of this Court.) In this 
particular criminal case, the accused were acquitted execpt Rascal Dimalna, who 
entered the plea of guilty. While the case was pending decision, Rascid Lucman 
wrote a letter to the then presiding Judge of First Instance, of Lanao, Hon. 
Felicisimo Ocampo, dated March 16, 1947, which has been marked as Exhibit H, 
urging the conviction of the accused. A few months after, 'that is on November 
14, 1947, by way of revenge, the accused assaulted and fired at the deceased 
Pangandaman F. Aguam, thereby causing his almost instantaneous 
death."</p></blockquote>
<p>The determination of the guilt or innocence of appellants rests in large 
measure upon the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties. After 
the hearing, and after the trial judge had observed the behavior and reactions 
of said witnesses on the witness stand, he chose to accept the testimony of the 
witnesses f6r the Government, considering them as more credible. We find nothing 
in the record to warrant disturbing said finding and action of the lower court. 
It will be remembered that each of the principal witnesses for the prosecution 
does not pretend to have seen and recognized all the appellants; one witness saw 
three men and recognized them all (Palawan, Datumanong and Mascara), two of said 
witnesses claim to have seen five men running and recognized only two of them 
(Racid and Palawan); and one witness recognized only two (Racid and Palawan) out 
of the four men he saw hurrying from the direction of the house of the deceased. 
If these witnesses for the Government had chosen to make an air-tight case and 
clinch it for the prosecution, it would have been easy for them to have told the 
court that they all saw only four persons and that they readily recognized said 
four persons to be the appellants herein, this, without any fear of 
contradiction or impeachment by the defense, and yet as already stated, they 
actually testified as they did thereby rendering it more difficult for the 
prosecution to sort out and correlate their different versions. This may 
indicate that they were not rehearsed or taught to tell the same story.</p>
<p>After a careful appraisal of the evidence we agree with the trial court that 
the guilt of the four appellants has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. The 
lower court as already stated, found that only Palawan who actually fired the 
shot was responsible as a principal and that his co-accused should be considered 
as mere accomplices. The Solicitor General disagrees with this appraisal of 
criminal responsibility, he, believing that the four appellants should be held 
responsible as principals. We are inclined to agree with the Solicitor General. 
It is true that there was no direct evidence as to conspiracy among the four 
appellants, but conspiracy can be inferred and proven by the acts of the accused 
themselves when sai'd acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted 
action, and community of interests. Here, the four appellants were seen together 
at or near the scene of the crime, three of them at the scene itself, in fact 
only about two meters from the man who was shot and killed by one of them. The 
four of them, including Racid were seen running just behind the house of the 
deceased and later two of them, Racid and Palawan, accompanied by two others 
were seen and recognized running from the direction of the house of the deceased 
toward the main road, and all that time these four accused were armed with 
revolvers. As was said by this Court thru Mr. Justice Labrador in the case of 
People <em>vs</em>. Panglina Mahlon, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> G. R. No. L-5198, April 17, 1953, on the 
point of conspiracy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Actual cooperation with Sabtal and Mañon, the trigger men in the 
assassination, is the only plausible or reasonable conclusion that can be 
inferred from the fact that the three appellants were in company with Sabtal and 
Mañon as they proceeded to the place where Lumundut was, and were armed with 
blade instruments, as well as from the fact that they came back together from 
the plaCe of the commission of the crime. The same inevitable conclusion is 
obtained from the possession of the victim's rifle by Mahlon as they came back. 
If appellant merely approved of the assassination, it would not have been 
necessary for them to join Sabtal and Mañon, and neither would they have carried 
their weapons with them. * * All these acts of the appellants can point to no 
other conclusion —that appellants <em>conspired</em> to commit the crime, and 
are therefore all guilty as principals of the crime of murder were present at 
the time of its commission, giving encouragement thereto by their armed 
presence. It is unreasonable to presume that appellants were present only an 
curious onlookers; possession of their weapons and company with the trigger men 
just before and after the killing— all these are inconsistent with such an 
assumption. On the other hand, these circumstances are not consistent with 
innocence."</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, as to community of interests among the accused We start with the fact 
that they are all closely related to each other by blood. Racid and Palawan are 
first cousins, although many consider them as brothers. Datumanong and Mascara 
are brothers. And the Lucmans and Monadis are relatives. It is not difficult to 
see that the four of them had strong reasons to hate the family of the deceased 
and to adopt measures, even 'radical, to obtain revenge. The action of the 
deceased while a guerrilla officer in blocking the promotion of Racid Lucman and 
later failing to select him among the ten Moro officers for purposes of 
integration, must have caused resentment in Racid who by the way seems to be the 
most intelligent and active among the four accused and possibly the moving 
spirit among them. He seems to be the one giving the orders although in the 
actual killing, he was behind the scenes. Then, came the killing of Barodi 
Monadi, brother of Datumanong and Mascara, wherein relatives of Pangandaman were 
strongly suspected as the killers. In fact, Ayonan Aguam, the son of Pangandaman 
was included among the four defendants accused in the murder case. Pending the 
preparation and promulgation of the decision in that case Racid wrote Exhibit 
"H" to Judge Ocampo who tried the case and later decided it, telling the Judge 
that the four accused in that case were all guilty and urging their conviction. 
However, three of the defendants therein were acquitted including Ayonan Aguam, 
son of the deceased, and only Rascal Dimalna, a minor who pleaded guilty to the 
charge was found guilty and he was not punished either because being a minor it 
would appear that he was sent to the reformatory. All this, must have embittered 
Racid and his co-accused, including the two brothers Datumanong and Mascala 
Monadi who perhaps must have felt the death of their brother Barodi was not duly 
avenged. On this point of the custom among the Moros in Lanao of taking the law 
into their hands, preferring to adopt measures and avenge any outrage committed 
on them or their kins, the trial court found this to be prevalent} at least at 
the time, and this will explain why despite the investigation conducted by the 
authorities, including the police and the Constabulary, the two criminal cases 
in the lower, court accusing the four appellants herein were filed several 
months after the killing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find the four appellants guilty as principals of the crime 
of murder. With the modification that all four are to be sentenced to the 
penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to jointly and severally indemnify 
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000, the appealed decision is hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C. J., Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur. '</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed with modification.</em></p>
