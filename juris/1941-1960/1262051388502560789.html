				<H3>FERNANDO E. RICAFORT, PETITIONER,  VS.  HON. WENCESLAO L.  FERNAN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS  JUDGE OF  THE  COURT OF  FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, AND JUANITO ESPEEO, JR., RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Fernando E. Ricafort instituted&nbsp; these certiorari proceedings for the purpose of securing judgment from this Court annulling the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; of September&nbsp; 23, 1955, dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; information filed&nbsp; in Criminal&nbsp; Case No. 2980 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Davao charging respondent Juanito Espero with&nbsp; the crime of qualified theft allegedly committed in the City&nbsp; of Davao while in the employ of the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said information substantially&nbsp; avers&nbsp; that during the&nbsp; period&nbsp; comprised between October, 1952, and&nbsp; July 31,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant did wilfully, maliciously and criminally,&nbsp; with grave abuse of confidence&nbsp; and intent of&nbsp; gain and without the&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; and&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner thereof, take, steal&nbsp; and carry away medicines&nbsp; and money&nbsp; belonging to&nbsp; the petitioner, of the total&nbsp; value of P1,426.17, to the damage and prejudice of&nbsp; the latter.&nbsp; In his pleading, petitioner&nbsp; further&nbsp; prays&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge,&nbsp; Wenceslao&nbsp;&nbsp; L. Fernan, be ordered to reinstate said&nbsp; criminal case for its trial&nbsp; on&nbsp; the merits. <br><br>The facts of the&nbsp; case may be briefly stated as follows: upon the filing of said information by the Provincial Fiscal, counsel for the defendant moved for a bill of particulars on the ground that the information&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; allege the definite time in which the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of qualified theft&nbsp; was executed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion,&nbsp; however, was denied by the respondent&nbsp; court because a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of the balance&nbsp; sheets showing the different dates when the various amounts were allegedly <i>misappropriated</i> by the accused, was served upon the&nbsp; attorneys&nbsp; for&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp; Those&nbsp; balance sheets (Annexes A and A-1 attached to the motion to quash later submitted), showed that the defendant was a sales representative&nbsp; or agent receiving&nbsp; a commission&nbsp; of 5&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent of all sales made and that in the course of the performance of his duties&nbsp; as such he was found short in the sum of P1,013.09.<br>&nbsp;<br>Based on these balance sheets counsel for&nbsp; the defendant, now respondent Juanito Espero, filed a motion and a supplemental motion to quash on the following grounds:&nbsp; (1) that the information charged more&nbsp; than one offense;&nbsp; (2) that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; had&nbsp; no jurisdiction&nbsp; over some of&nbsp; the separate offenses;&nbsp; and (3) that the information&nbsp; charged the&nbsp; wrong&nbsp; offense.&nbsp; Defendant's counsel&nbsp; then asked&nbsp; the Court for&nbsp; permission&nbsp; to present&nbsp; evidence in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to support the allegations in the motions to quash, which the court granted.&nbsp; At the hearing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the motions&nbsp; to quash, defendant presented Exhibits&nbsp; 1, 1-A and 1-B.&nbsp; In Exhibit 1&nbsp; the offended party, petitioner Fernando E.&nbsp; Ricafort, recognized&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; as&nbsp; his sales&nbsp; representative,&nbsp; to which exhibit&nbsp; a certified&nbsp; statement of accountability&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accused was attached, wherein the sales, collections and&nbsp; commissions covering the period from October,&nbsp; 1952, to July, 1953,&nbsp; were stated.&nbsp; At said hearing&nbsp; it was&nbsp; also disclosed that the accused, as&nbsp; petitioner's sales representative, was&nbsp; authorized to sell different articles&nbsp; on commission basis, which articles the&nbsp; offended party Fernando&nbsp; E. Ricafort had turned over to&nbsp; his agent for sale.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the delivery of&nbsp; the drugs or&nbsp; merchandise to be sold on commission by petitioner to the defendant involved a transfer of the juridical possession thereof from the former to the latter, the lower Court believed that the&nbsp; crime resulting from the&nbsp; alleged <i>misappropriation</i> of the goods&nbsp; or of&nbsp; the proceeds thereof, would be, at most, <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; not theft, simple or qualified, so the Court acting on&nbsp; the motion to quash, dismissed the case with costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br>From this&nbsp; order,&nbsp; and&nbsp; without first&nbsp; praying the&nbsp; Court for its&nbsp; reconsideration, or causing the&nbsp; intervention of the Provincial Fiscal of Davao who filed the information, the purported victim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime—the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein—instituted the present case in this Court seeking&nbsp; to obtain the remedy&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; in&nbsp; his petition. In&nbsp; this&nbsp; instance&nbsp; respondents submit&nbsp; the&nbsp; following questions at issue, to&nbsp; wit: <br><blockquote><ol><li> Do&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; and Ms attorney have legal representation in this ease?; <br></li><li> Does certiorari lie in&nbsp; the present instance?;&nbsp; and <br></li><li> If certiorari&nbsp; is the proper legal remedy&nbsp; to contest the correctness of an order&nbsp; sustaining a motion to quash in a criminal case, did the respondent Judge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Davao act without or in&nbsp; excess of his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse&nbsp; of discretion, in issuing&nbsp; the order dated September 23, 1955, dismissing. the information in Criminal Case No. 2819 on the ground that the "facts do&nbsp; not constitute the crime&nbsp; of qualified theft"&nbsp; for which offense the accused is charged under the information? </li></ol></blockquote>I.&nbsp; As stated by&nbsp; counsel for the respondents, the petition herein&nbsp; is an offshoot,&nbsp; an incident of&nbsp; said&nbsp; criminal case for qualified&nbsp; theft.&nbsp; For all&nbsp; purposes, therefore, it is&nbsp; a continuation of that case and partakes of the nature of a criminal&nbsp; proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; This being so,&nbsp; the party&nbsp; defeated by the&nbsp; order of the respondent Judge dismissing the information in Criminal&nbsp; Case No. 2819 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Davao must&nbsp; be the People of the&nbsp; Philippines and&nbsp; not the petitioner,&nbsp; the complaining witness.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; proper party to&nbsp; bring this petition&nbsp; is the State and the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; legal representation&nbsp; should&nbsp; be the Solicitor General and not the attorney for the complaining witness&nbsp; who was&nbsp; the private prosecutor&nbsp; in said&nbsp; Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 2819.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true that under&nbsp; the" Rules&nbsp; of Court the offended&nbsp; party may&nbsp; take&nbsp; part in&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution of criminal cases and even appeal in certain instances from the order or judgment of the courts, but this "is only so in cases where the party injured has to protest his pecuniary interest in connection with the civil liability of the accused.<br><br>Petitioner did not institute the&nbsp; case at bar for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; protecting&nbsp; his pecuniary interest as&nbsp; supposed offended&nbsp; party of the crime&nbsp; charged in the information that&nbsp; was dismissed, but to&nbsp; cause the restoration of the case&nbsp; and to&nbsp; have it tried as if&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; had&nbsp; happened.&nbsp; This, certainly, falls within the province of the representative of the&nbsp; People who in this case has&nbsp; not appealed nor joined the private prosecutor in&nbsp; bringing this case before Us. <br><br>Besides,&nbsp; and as to&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; proceedings, Rule&nbsp; 67 of the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court prescribes: <br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 5. DEFENDANTS AND COST IN CERTAIN CASES.—When the petition&nbsp; filed&nbsp; relates to the acts or omissions&nbsp; of&nbsp; a court or of a judge, the petitioner shall join as parties defendant with such court or judge <i>the person or&nbsp; persons&nbsp; interested in sustaining</i> the proceedings of the court; and it&nbsp; shall he the duty of such person or persons&nbsp; to appear and defend, both in his or their own behalf and in behalf of&nbsp; the court or judge affected&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings, and costs awarded in such proceedings in favor of the petitioner shall be against the&nbsp; person or persons&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest only and&nbsp; not against the court or&nbsp; judge." </blockquote>It&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; in said Criminal Case No. 2819, the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; which appears in the caption of the information, was the People of the Philippines which yielded&nbsp; to the&nbsp; order of the Court&nbsp; objected to by the private prosecutor, and&nbsp; the People should have been made a party&nbsp; to these proceedings,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; same manner as&nbsp; the defendant Juanito&nbsp; Espero whom the petitioner had to include as respondent in his amended petition. <br><br>Moreover, in People to. Velez, 77 Phil.&nbsp; 1026, We have- already held&nbsp; that the&nbsp; offended party cannot appeal&nbsp; from the order of the Court dismissing&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case.&nbsp; In that case the attorney for the offended party&nbsp; appealed from the order of the Court of First Instance of Misamis&nbsp; Occidental that dismissed the information against&nbsp; the accused,&nbsp; upon motion of the latter's counsel, on the ground that&nbsp; the supposed libelous document was a privileged document.&nbsp; The Provincial Fiscal did not oppose the motion for dismissal filed by the defendant in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance because he was&nbsp; also of the opinion that the latter which was the subject matter of the case was a privileged communication, and when the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; offended party reached this Court&nbsp; the Solicitor General filed a motion to&nbsp; dismiss the appeal. <br><blockquote>"<i>Held:</i> it appearing from the record that there was a pending civil action arising out of the same alleged libelous document filed by the offended&nbsp; party against&nbsp; the same defendant, the offended party has no right&nbsp; to intervene in&nbsp; the prosecution of this ease, and consequently cannot appeal from the order of the court dismissing&nbsp; the information. The reason of the&nbsp; law in not permitting the&nbsp; offended party to intervene in the prosecution of a criminal&nbsp; case, if he has waived his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; institute&nbsp; a&nbsp; civil action arising&nbsp; from a&nbsp; criminal act or&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp; reserved or,&nbsp; a <i>fortiori</i>, already instituted&nbsp; the said civil action, is that he has no&nbsp; special interest in&nbsp; the prosecution of the criminal&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Besides,&nbsp; even if the offended&nbsp; party has not instituted a&nbsp; separate civil action nor reserved his right to do so,&nbsp; and has&nbsp; intervened&nbsp; in the&nbsp; prosecution of the criminal&nbsp; action, as his intervention is&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; direction&nbsp; and control&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fiscal, that is,&nbsp; the Provincial Fiscal or the Solicitor General,&nbsp; the latter in the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; control the prosecution&nbsp; has&nbsp; the right to&nbsp; move&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal of the appeal interposed&nbsp; by the offended&nbsp; 'party if such&nbsp; dismissal would not affect&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of the offended&nbsp; party&nbsp; to civil&nbsp; indemnity." Padilla's </i> Criminal Procedure, 1955 Ed., p. 697-698). </blockquote>In the&nbsp; present case&nbsp; the dismissal of&nbsp; the information or the&nbsp; criminal action does not affect the right of the offended party to institute or&nbsp; continue the civil action already instituted arising&nbsp; from the offense, because such&nbsp; dismissal or extinction of&nbsp; the penal action does not carry&nbsp; with&nbsp; it the extinction of&nbsp; the civil&nbsp; one&nbsp; under section 1-(<i>d</i>), Rule 107 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;II. Rule _ 67&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court&nbsp; provides: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. <i>Petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari</i>.—When any tribunal,&nbsp; hoard or officer exercising judicial functions, has acted without or in excess of its or&nbsp; his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion and <i>there is no appeal, not any&nbsp; plain,&nbsp; speedy and adequate remedy&nbsp; in&nbsp; the ordinary&nbsp; course&nbsp; of&nbsp; law</i>,&nbsp; a person&nbsp; aggrieved thereby may file a Verified petition in the proper court&nbsp; alleging the facts with certainty and&nbsp; praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board, or officer as the law requires, with costs."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></blockquote>So that where&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; is&nbsp; in itself&nbsp; a sufficient and adequate remedy&nbsp; that&nbsp; would promptly&nbsp; relieve&nbsp; the petitioner from the injurious effects of the order or&nbsp; judgment complained of, the existence of that appeal would bar&nbsp; the institution of the&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; of certiorari.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Arches vs. Beldia&nbsp; et al., G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-2414, promulgated on May 27, 1949,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court held "that neither&nbsp; certiorari nor&nbsp; prohibition lie against&nbsp; an order of the court granting or denying&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; quash&nbsp; an&nbsp; information.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; the courts&nbsp; have&nbsp; jurisdiction to take&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of the case and to decide the&nbsp; motion to quash, <i>appeal in due time is the</i>&nbsp; obvious and only <i>remedy</i> for the <i>public</i> prosecutor or the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; as the case may&nbsp; be." <br><br>In this connection it is&nbsp; to be&nbsp; stated&nbsp; at this&nbsp; juncture, that the petitioner did&nbsp; not&nbsp; pray the respondent Judge&nbsp; for a&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of his order of&nbsp; dismissal, nor file any motion to that effect,&nbsp; and&nbsp; having failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; avail himself of this obvious remedy he cannot&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; seek&nbsp; relief by&nbsp; by certiorari.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>Certiorari will not lie where&nbsp; the relief sought is obtainable by application in the court&nbsp; of the original proceeding and it has not there been applied for.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; connection, it has&nbsp; been held that before filing a petition for certiorari,&nbsp; the attention&nbsp; of&nbsp; lower court should first be called to its&nbsp; supposed error&nbsp; and its correction ask for,&nbsp; and that if this is&nbsp; not done, the right&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"<br><br>(II Moran, 1952 Ed., p. 169-170; Hen-era vs. Barreto, 25 Phil. 245; Uy Chu vs. Imperial, 44 Phil.&nbsp; 27; the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Post Publishing Co. vs. Sanchez, 81 Phil., 814, 46&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp; Sup.&nbsp; 1, 412;&nbsp; Alvarez vs. Ibanez, 83 Phil., 104, 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 42S8). </blockquote>III.&nbsp; Having&nbsp; come to&nbsp; the conclusion&nbsp; (1) that the petitioner has no personality to institute the&nbsp; present recourse in this Court&nbsp; and (2)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; remedy of certiorari is not&nbsp; available&nbsp; to annul the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of dismissal of the&nbsp; respondent judge in said Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2819 of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Davao, it&nbsp; would&nbsp; seem unnecessary for Us to pass upon the third question at issue. Yet,&nbsp; We prefer to&nbsp; make&nbsp; briefly a&nbsp; few remarks&nbsp; on this point. <br>&nbsp;<br>The information filed in said&nbsp; case No. 2819&nbsp; really and in effect charged the&nbsp; defendant Juanito Espero with&nbsp; the crime of&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp;&nbsp; drafted&nbsp; in&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and plain words&nbsp; and contained all&nbsp; the&nbsp; requisites&nbsp; prescribed in section 5,&nbsp; Rule 106 of&nbsp; the Rules of Court for a sufficient information.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trouble&nbsp; arose not&nbsp; because&nbsp; said information was&nbsp; defective, but" because the&nbsp; true facts of the case did&nbsp; not conform&nbsp; to the allegations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the indictment.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; when&nbsp; upon the filing of&nbsp; a motion for a&nbsp; bill of particulars counsel for&nbsp; the offended party furnished the defense&nbsp; with Exhibit 1, to which&nbsp; a certified statement&nbsp; of accountability of the&nbsp; accused was attached.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was then disclosed that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Juanito Espero did not <i>take</i>,&nbsp; steal and carry away&nbsp; medicines valued at P430.08 and&nbsp; money amounting to P1,013.09,&nbsp; but <i>received</i> medicines&nbsp; for sale on commission,&nbsp; the proceeds of which he&nbsp; allegedly <i>misappropriated</i> during&nbsp; the&nbsp; lapse of time comprised between October,&nbsp; 1952 and July&nbsp; 31, 19-53.&nbsp; Naturally, the&nbsp; averments&nbsp; of&nbsp; the information had to be considered&nbsp; modified and amplified in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; the very&nbsp; admissions&nbsp; of the offended party and&nbsp; the Provincial Fiscal made&nbsp; at the&nbsp; hearing of the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to quash.&nbsp; In the case of People vs. Navarro et al.,*&nbsp; 42 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 497-499,&nbsp; the&nbsp; question was raised as to whether&nbsp; or not the&nbsp; trial court could&nbsp; take&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; facts not appearing in the&nbsp; information&nbsp; but divulged at&nbsp; the pre-trial.&nbsp; In&nbsp; deciding&nbsp; in the&nbsp; affirmative, this Court&nbsp; held: <br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; must be noted that the&nbsp; section of the Rule&nbsp; (Sec. 2-A, Rule 113)&nbsp; permitting a motion to quash on the ground&nbsp; that 'the facts charged do not constitute&nbsp; an offense' omits&nbsp; reference to the facts detailed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the information.&nbsp; Other&nbsp; sections of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; same&nbsp; Rule would&nbsp; imply that the . issue is restricted&nbsp; to&nbsp; those&nbsp; alleged in&nbsp; the information (see sections&nbsp; 9 and 10, Rule 113).&nbsp; <i>Prima facie,&nbsp; the facts charged are those in the&nbsp; complaint, but they may&nbsp; be amplified or qualified by&nbsp; others&nbsp; appearing to&nbsp; be&nbsp; additional&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; upon admissions made by the People's representative,&nbsp; which admission could anyway be submitted by him as amendments to the same information.&nbsp; It would seem, to be pure- technicality&nbsp; to hold that in the&nbsp; consideration of the motion the 'parties and the Judge were&nbsp; precluded&nbsp; from considering fact which&nbsp; the Fiscal admitted to be true, simply because they were not described in the complaint.</i> Of course, it may be added that upon similar motions the court and the Fiscal are not required to go beyond&nbsp; the averments of the information, nor is the latter to be inveigled into a premature and risky revelation&nbsp; of his evidence, but we see no reason to prohibit the&nbsp; Fiscal from making", in all&nbsp; candor,&nbsp; admissions of&nbsp; undeniable facts, because the principle&nbsp; can never he sufficiently reiterated that such&nbsp; official's&nbsp; role is to sec that justice&nbsp; is&nbsp; done;&nbsp; not&nbsp; that&nbsp; all accused are convicted, but that the guilty&nbsp; are&nbsp; justly&nbsp; punished.&nbsp; Less&nbsp; reason&nbsp; can there be&nbsp; to prohibit the court from considering&nbsp; those admissions,&nbsp; and&nbsp; deciding accordingly, in the&nbsp; interest of a speedy administration of Justice."</blockquote>The balance sheets&nbsp; show cash shortages in the total sum of P803.91, but this amount was&nbsp; broken down into several other sums, the smallest of which are P30,&nbsp; P15.95,&nbsp; P22.61 and&nbsp; P1,&nbsp; and even assuming that the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; committed in said case was&nbsp; qualified theft, the resulting offense for the taking&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; small&nbsp; amounts would&nbsp; not come&nbsp; within the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance,&nbsp; for any of such&nbsp; offenses would fall within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Davao&nbsp; (section 87-b and c-3&nbsp; of Re- public Act No. 296, known as the Judiciary Act&nbsp; of 1948, and&nbsp; Article 309, No. 5, of the Revised Penal Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike in cases for <i>estafa</i> in which the misappropriations of various separate amounts that are to be&nbsp; accounted for in one single occasion may be considered and prosecuted&nbsp; as&nbsp; only one&nbsp; offense, in the&nbsp; crime of theft, simple or qualified,&nbsp; each <i>taking</i> of&nbsp; another's property, coupled with the other circumstances prescribed in" Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; a&nbsp; separate crime of&nbsp; theft. <br><br>On the other hand, the acts committed by&nbsp; the defendant in connection with the case at bar, if they&nbsp; constitute any crime at all, that crime would be <i>estafa</i>, because unlike in the&nbsp; case of People vs. Locson, 57 Phil.&nbsp; 325,&nbsp; cited by&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; in which the&nbsp; teller of a&nbsp; bank only obtained the <i>physical or material possession</i> of the money taken by him, the defendant Juanito Espero obtained from the&nbsp; offended party the juridical possession of the drags or medicines he received to sell on commission. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; People us. Isaac, the&nbsp; regular&nbsp; driver of a jeepney&nbsp; was&nbsp; on vacation&nbsp; and&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; of that vehicle hired Isaac on a temporary basis and entrusted the vehicle for a "pasada", that is to say, for transporting passengers for a compensation&nbsp; at the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; P10&nbsp; per day.&nbsp; Appellant never&nbsp; returned the vehicle&nbsp; and&nbsp; after a&nbsp; search&nbsp; the vehicle was found in Tarlac.&nbsp; Appealing from a judgment of&nbsp; conviction counsel <i>de&nbsp; oficio</i> contends that appellant may have committed estafa but not theft,&nbsp; on the theory, that the possession&nbsp; of the&nbsp; vehicle was obtained with consent of the owner, and therefore there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; illegal taking.&nbsp; Held: To this we cannot agree.&nbsp; In the case of U. S. vs. De Vera, 43&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 1000, this Court&nbsp; said that "when the&nbsp; delivery of&nbsp; a chattel has&nbsp; not the effect of transferring the&nbsp; juri- dical possession&nbsp; thereof or&nbsp; title&nbsp; thereto, it is presumed that the&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; and&nbsp; title to, the thing so delivered remains&nbsp; in&nbsp; the owner; and the act of disposing thereof with intent of&nbsp; gain&nbsp; and&nbsp; without the consent of the owner constitutes the crime of theft."&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 Padilla's Criminal&nbsp; Law, 1955 Ed.,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 531). <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;'ESTAFA' DISTINGUISHED FROM&nbsp; THEFT.&nbsp; In&nbsp; general,&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of <i>estafa</i> is&nbsp; distinguished&nbsp; from that of theft by the manner&nbsp; in&nbsp; which the&nbsp; offender&nbsp; in each case acquires possession&nbsp; of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>estafador</i> receives the&nbsp; possession of the property, while&nbsp; the thief takes, without the&nbsp; owner's consent,&nbsp; the possession of the latter's property. <br><br>There are,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; instances where&nbsp; even&nbsp; if&nbsp; the property mis- appropriated&nbsp; was received by the offender,&nbsp; the misappropriation will&nbsp; constitute theft, and not&nbsp; estafa.&nbsp; In such&nbsp; cases, distinction should be&nbsp; made whether the offender, on receiving the&nbsp; property, acquired:&nbsp; (1) the material possession alone or (2) the material&nbsp; and juridical possession,&nbsp; or&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; the material&nbsp; and juridical possession plus the ownership, of the property.&nbsp; Where&nbsp; only&nbsp; the' material possession is transferred, conversion of&nbsp; the property gives rise to&nbsp; the crime of theft; where&nbsp; both&nbsp; material and&nbsp; juridical possessions&nbsp; are transferred,&nbsp; misappropriation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; would constitute estafa; and where in addition to the material possession, the owner- ship of tho property is transferred, misappropriation would only give rise to a&nbsp; civil obligation (People&nbsp; vs. Aquino, 36 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 1886). For&nbsp; example, an agent&nbsp; of the public authorities who,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the performance&nbsp; of his duties, and because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lack of&nbsp; registration papers, takes possession of cattle&nbsp; in the presence of&nbsp; the cattleman charged with the care thereof, without any opposition or protest on the part of&nbsp; said cattleman&nbsp; or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of the possessor or owner of&nbsp; the cattle seised,&nbsp; does&nbsp; not commit the crime of theft, inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; said&nbsp; cattle were seized with&nbsp; the&nbsp; knowledge of the person presumed&nbsp; to be owner. But' the defendant's own act&nbsp; of selling the cattle seized&nbsp; and&nbsp; appropriating the value&nbsp; thereof to his own use,&nbsp; without reporting&nbsp; the case&nbsp; to his superior officers or to the competent authorities, constitute the crime of estafa (U. S. vs. Dacaimy,&nbsp; 8 Phil.&nbsp; 617.)" (Book&nbsp; Two,&nbsp; Part II, Francisco's Penal Code, p. 1098.) .<br><br>The&nbsp; case of People vs. de&nbsp; Leon, 49&nbsp; Phil. 437, cited by the&nbsp; petitioner has no bearing on the case at bar,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; "taking" in&nbsp; that case&nbsp; occurred on the same occasion, while the alleged "takings" .under consideration&nbsp; took place on different days. <br><br>In the light of the foregoing considerations, We can by no means declare that the order objected to&nbsp; by the petitioner&nbsp; is erroneous.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, it was&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with law.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; is dismissed, with costs against&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; So&nbsp; it is ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
