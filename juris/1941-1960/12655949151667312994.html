				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The respondents and appellees, Candida San Jose et al., filed in&nbsp; the municipal court&nbsp; of Manila against the petitioners-appellants separate complaints for unlawful detainer (Civil Cases Nos 27142, 27144, 27156, 27157, 27158, 27170, 27171 and 27172).&nbsp;&nbsp; After a joint trial the court rendered a&nbsp; decision on&nbsp; October 19, 1953,&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; appellants to vacate their respective lots and to&nbsp; pay to the appellees their respective unpaid back rentals, copy of which decision was received by attorney&nbsp; for appellants on&nbsp; October 22, 1953.&nbsp; Instead of appealing, the appellants filed on November 5, 1953, or one day before the expiration of the period for appeal, a petition&nbsp; for certiorari in the Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 21118), which was summarily dismissed on the same date&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that appellants'&nbsp; remedy was appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of the order&nbsp; of dismissal was received by attorney for appellants on November 7, 1953,&nbsp; when the&nbsp; period for appeal&nbsp; had&nbsp; already expired.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 3, 1953, the appellants filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for relief from the decision of the Municipal Court in the detainer cases (Civil Case No. 21332),&nbsp; alleging that&nbsp; said appellants were prevented&nbsp; from taking an appeal by&nbsp; accident, mistake&nbsp; or excusable negligence.&nbsp; On January 4, 1954, the&nbsp; court dismissed said petition for relief on the ground that appellants' failure to perfect an appeal on time was unexcusable negligence, pure and&nbsp; simple.&nbsp; The petitioners&nbsp; have appealed.<p>Counsel&nbsp; for appellants contends that he is a new practitioner and his mistake in instituting a petition for certiorari,&nbsp; instead of appealing&nbsp; from the decision&nbsp; of the municipal&nbsp; court in&nbsp; the detainer cases, may be considered excusable,&nbsp; considering that immediately upon knowing that certiorari was not the proper remedy&nbsp; he filed the petition for relief, and especially in view of the fact that this case involves a big social problemâ€”the ejectment&nbsp; of about 160 persons living in the houses respectively occupied by the appellants.</p><p>While we sympathize with appellants' situation, we cannot depart from the rule&nbsp; that "relief will in no case&nbsp; be granted to a party who seeks to be relieved from the effects of a judgment which he claims has been obtained against him through fraud,&nbsp; where the loss of the remedy at law was due to said party's own negligence or fault&nbsp; or that of his counsel"&nbsp; (Echarri <em>vs.</em> Belen&nbsp; Velasco, 55 Phil., 570, 573), and "the&nbsp; erroneous interpretation&nbsp; or application of a law is not an excusable error giving the right to remedy afforded by section&nbsp; 113 of the Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure" (Catala <em>vs.</em> Monteverde,&nbsp; 63 Phil., 503, 509).&nbsp; It is needless to state that&nbsp; we have to apply the law&nbsp; and the Rules of Court with uniformity, unaffected by the class of litigants.</p><p>It is to be noted that when the appellants, through their counsel, filed&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for certiorari on November 5, 1953, there was still one day within which to perfect an appeal from the decision of the municipal court in the detainer cases;&nbsp; and yet although counsel for&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; received notice of the dismissal of their petition for certiorari on November 7, 1953, no step was taken by&nbsp; said counsel until&nbsp; December 3, 1953, when he filed&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Manila the present petition for relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some earnestness would have urged counsel to perfect an appeal in the detainer cases on the&nbsp; same day when he received notice&nbsp; of the dismissal of his petition for certiorari, or even one day thereafter; and he could have&nbsp; reasonably contended that the period for&nbsp; appeal was&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; during the&nbsp; pendency of the petition for certiorari in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; advert to these facts merely in further support of the ruling&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; a quo&nbsp; that appellants' failure to appeal in&nbsp; the&nbsp; detainer cases was unexcusable.</p><p>Although already&nbsp; superfluous, it may be pointed out that the alleged ownership by the appellants of their respective lots finds&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; refutation&nbsp; in the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact of the Municipal Court that they were mere lessees under the&nbsp; evidence; and the contention that the Municipal Court had no jurisdiction over the&nbsp; detainer&nbsp; cases&nbsp; involving a period&nbsp; of more than one&nbsp; year,&nbsp; is likewise&nbsp; contrary to what was proved during the trial, namely,&nbsp; that the notices to vacate were received by the appellants only on May 31 and June 1, 1953, or much less than one year before the complaints for unlawful detainer were filed in the Municipal Court on July 27 and 28, 1953.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; it is alleged in the complaint&nbsp; that defendants failed to pay the rents since after August 26, 1923, does not make unlawful&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; withholding of&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the property. Mere failure to pay rents does not<em> ipso&nbsp; facto</em> make unlawful tenant's possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises.&nbsp; It is the owner's demand for&nbsp; tenant to vacate the premises, when the tenant has failed to pay the rents on&nbsp; time,&nbsp; and tenant's refusal&nbsp; or&nbsp; failure to vacate,, which make unlawful withholding of possession.&nbsp; There is no legal obstacle for the owner to allow a defaulting&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; to remain&nbsp; in the&nbsp; rented property one month, one year, several years, or even decadtes. That consent, no matter how long&nbsp; it may&nbsp; last, makes lawful tenant's possession.&nbsp; Only when that consent is withdrawn and&nbsp; the owner demands&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; to leave the&nbsp; property is&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner's&nbsp; right&nbsp; of possession&nbsp; asserted and the tenant's&nbsp; refusal or failure to move out makes his possession&nbsp; unlawful, because it&nbsp; is&nbsp; violative&nbsp; of the owner's preferential&nbsp; right&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession." (Canaynay,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. <em>vs.</em> Sarmiento, 45 Off. Gaz., No. 1, p. 252.)</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the appealed order is affirmed, with costs against the appellants,</p><p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
