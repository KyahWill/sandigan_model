				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Jose Lee Dy Piao, claiming to be the only child of the late Dy Lac, by the 
latter's first marriage, filed Civil Case No. 25736 in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila on March 19, 1955, to compel defendant Paz Ty Sin Tei to 
deliver or reconvey certain properties allegedly belonging to his late father Dy 
Lac, but unlawfully donated by the latter on 1938 to defendant Paz Ty while the 
latter maintained extra-marital relations with the deceased. Plaintiff further 
averred that the donations were based on illegal consideration and were, besides 
inofficious, being in excess of the free part of Dy Lac's estate; but that Paz 
Ty, who is the executrix named in Dy Lac will, refused to bring said properties 
into the estate. On April 11, 1955, defendant pleaded by way of answer that she 
had been married to Dy Lac in 1942, and denied any impairment of plaintiff's 
legitime as a result of the questioned donations ; and counterclaimed for 
damages.
<p>Up to the filing of the answer to defendant's .counterclaim, plaintiff had 
been represented by Attorney Ignacio Lugtu. However, on June 7, 1955, Attorneys 
Felipe S. Abeleda and Felipe T. Ang entered an appearance for plaintiff "in 
collaboration with Attorney Ignacio Lugtu".</p>
<p>On October 6, 1955, the court set the case for hearing on November 18, 1955, 
and the clerk of court served notice of said hearing on Attorneys Abeleda and 
Ang for plaintiff. When the date of the trial came, neither plaintiff nor any of 
his counsel appeared; and upon defendant's motion, the lower court dismissed the 
case "with prejudice."</p>
<p>On December 1, 1955, plaintiff, through Attorney Felipe S. Abeleda, filed a 
motion for reconsideration, claiming that Attorney Ignacio Lugtu was and had 
always been the principal counsel of record for plaintiff, the undersigned 
counsel having entered his appearance in the case only in collaboration with 
him; that Abeleda, a member of Congress, was in Occidental Mindoro from 
September 1 to November 23, 1955 in connection with the campaign for the 
elections of November 8, 1955, and came to know of the notice of the hearing of 
the case only on November 26, 1955, when he returned to Manila and was informed 
by his assistant that said notice was received; that while counsel for defendant 
had always served copies of previous pleadings on plaintiff's principal counsel 
Attorney Ignacio Lugtu, he did not serve copy of his motion to set the case for 
hearing on said counsel, and the clerk of court likewise failed to serve notice 
of the hearing on said lawyer; that plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing 
because of illness at the time, as shown by medical certificate attached to the 
records of another case pending in the same court; and that unless plaintiff is 
given ample opportunity to prove his allegations, his interests in Special 
Proceedings No. 5541 would be jeopardized. This motion for reconsideration was, 
on December 15, 1955, denied by the court, first, because it was not in due 
form, and second, because service of notice upon one of the attorneys of record 
in a case is sufficient and binding upon the party represented.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1955, Attorney Ignacio Lugtu, in behalf of plaintiff, asked 
for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, which was granted; and on 
January 7, 1955, said counsel filed a second motion for reconsideration, 
specifically charging defendant's counsel with having procured the hearing of 
November 18, 1955 by fraud, stealth or strategy calling attention to the fact 
that all notices prior to that of the hearing of November 18, 1955 had been 
served on the principal counsel of Ignacio Lugtu, and not on the collaborating 
attorneys. In spite of vigorous opposition on the part of defendant, the lower 
court, on January 19, 1956, amended its previous order of November 18, 1955 
making the dismissal of the case "without prejudice". Having failed to obtain 
reconsideration of this last order, defendant appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>Appellant contends that since both motions were substantially identical, and 
because the fraud averred in the second motion must have existed already when 
the first motion was filed, the second did not interrupt the period for 
appealing; and as said period had already elapsed when the court entered its 
order amending that of November 18, 1955 (dismissing the action with prejudice), 
said order had become final, and hence, that the amendatory order of January 19, 
1956, was void as issued without jurisdiction.</p>
<p>After mature consideration of the peculiar circumstances obtaining in the 
present case, we have reached the conclusion that the action of the court below 
should be sustained.</p>
<p>Defendant appellant's position that the two motions for reconsideration are 
identical is not warranted, for the first motion for reconsideration of December 
1, 1955, merely alleged excusable negligence, while that of December 23, 1955, 
relied upon fraud or malice on the part of appellant's counsel. This charge 
necessarily injected a new fact, not theretofore averred or presented in the 
first motion for the court's consideration, and one that caused a substantial 
difference between the two petitions, to wit: that the failure to notify the 
principal counsel of the motion to set the case for trial was intentional and 
calculated to take advantage of the absence of collaborating counsel upon whom 
the motion to set was served. Consequently, the second motion for 
reconsideration being on a materially different ground than the first, suspended 
the period for appeal and the court retained jurisdiction to consider and decide 
it.</p>
<p>It is a recognized rule that in matters of fraud, the cause of action arises 
not upon the commission of the deception, but upon its discovery by the injured 
party, and this principle applies under the peculiar circumstances of the case. 
While it may be true that whatever deceit existed must have been practiced upon 
appellee before the issuance of the order of November 18, 1955, there is nothing 
on. record to positively show that such fraud had been discovered on the day the 
first motion to reconsider was filed, either by appellee or attorney Abeleda who 
filed the same. Furthermore, a charge of fraud is one not to be lightly made; 
and we are not inclined to penalize appellee, by a final bar against his causes 
of action, simply because his counsel did not immediately and recklessly jump 
into conclusions and make a charge of fraud, but exercised proper restraint and 
refrained from doing so until he felt reasonably certain of its existence.</p>
<p>Considering that the merits of the case have not been in any way inquired 
into; and that a dismissal with prejudice would, under the facts of record in 
the present case operate to bar appellee's claim through mere technicality, we 
do not believe that the action of the court, in converting such dismissal into 
one without prejudice, exceeded the bounds of judicial discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in the interest of equity and justice, the order appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs against appellant. <br></p><p>So ordered.</p>
