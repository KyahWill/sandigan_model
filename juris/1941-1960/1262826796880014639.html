				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">.On October&nbsp; 27, 1952, herein respondent&nbsp; Octaviano Pabalan filed an application with the Public Service Commission to operate an&nbsp; auto-truck service with&nbsp; four jeepneys on the following lines: Calamba-College via Los&nbsp; Banos, Calamba-Tanauan&nbsp; (Batangas)&nbsp; and Calamba-Canlubaiig (Laguna).<br><br>The&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioners,&nbsp; Laguna Tayabas Bus Go.&nbsp; and Batangas Transportation Co, filed opposition to the application&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that they are now. operating more than enough buses on the lines applied for by the applicant; that the Honorable Commission has already&nbsp; granted various operators several certificates of public&nbsp; convenience on the routes sought which are sufficient to serve&nbsp; the people and&nbsp; that any grant in favor&nbsp; of the applicant of a&nbsp; new certificate of public convenience to operate an auto-truck service along the lines mentioned in the application would create ruinous competition to the oppositors and the other operators.<br><br>After hearing, the Public Service Commission rendered a decision, the&nbsp; dispositive part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; the opposition&nbsp; filed by the Laguna Tayabas Bus Company and Batangas Transportation Company is hereby overruled, and it appearing&nbsp; from the evidence that&nbsp; applicant is a Filipino citizen&nbsp; and is financially capable to operate&nbsp; and maintain&nbsp; the proposed service, and&nbsp; that the approval of this&nbsp; application will promote public convenience&nbsp; and interests in a proper and suitable&nbsp; manner, it is ordered that, under the provisions of Section 15 of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 146, as amended, the certificate of public convenience&nbsp; applied for be&nbsp; issued to the applicant * *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>Not&nbsp; satisfied&nbsp; with this&nbsp; decision, the petitioners&nbsp; have appealed to&nbsp; this Court contending that the Public Service Commission erred:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; in not holding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; granting of a new certificate on the&nbsp; lines applied for by applicant (respondent)&nbsp; would only&nbsp; create&nbsp; ruinous competition&nbsp; to the&nbsp; herein petitioners and other operators of said lines; (2)&nbsp; in holding that public convenience&nbsp; and necessity will be&nbsp; served&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of respondent's&nbsp;&nbsp; application because the evidence in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case does not warrant the finding that there was or there is any need for the service sought for in the application;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; in not&nbsp; giving the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; preference&nbsp; in the granting of&nbsp; new units on the lines in question; "and (4)&nbsp; in not denying the application of the respondent&nbsp; in so&nbsp; far as the&nbsp; lines&nbsp; covered by the application&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent are&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in not sustaining petitioner's opposition thereto.<br><br>Errors 1, 2&nbsp; and 3 essentially raise the issue that the evidence in the&nbsp; case does not&nbsp; warrant the&nbsp; finding&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was need for the service&nbsp; sought for in&nbsp; the application and that the&nbsp; grant&nbsp; of a new certificate&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; would create ruinous competition to the oppositors.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&nbsp; find that&nbsp; during the&nbsp; hearing of the case&nbsp; before the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission,&nbsp; the parties introduced&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective evidence and, after mature consideration thereof, the Public Service Commission rendered its decision containing the following findings of fact:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; "It appears&nbsp; from the evidence presented&nbsp; by the&nbsp; applicant that he proposes to operate one unit on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line Calamba-Collega via Los&nbsp; Banos,&nbsp; two units&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line&nbsp; Calamba-Tanauan, and&nbsp; one unit on the&nbsp; line Calamba-Canlubang;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; has already acquired the four units&nbsp; which he proposed to&nbsp; operate as shown by&nbsp; the certified&nbsp; copies&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; registration marked&nbsp; Exhibits "C", "C~l", "C-2" and "C-8"; that the trucks&nbsp; operating&nbsp; on these&nbsp; lines&nbsp; are usually filled to capacity and&nbsp; there are many passengers "who cannot be accommodated by the present transportation facilities; that there are also many passengers on the line Calamba-Canlubang&nbsp; because of the&nbsp; cadre of&nbsp; the Second Military Area and the families of the&nbsp; soldiers living in&nbsp; the&nbsp; camp often travel to and from this area; that on the Calamba-College line the Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Company operates&nbsp; only one truck;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the Batatas&nbsp; Transportation&nbsp; Company operates&nbsp; express&nbsp; trucks&nbsp; which do not pick up passengers in the barrios along the lines in question.<br><br>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; "Staff Sergeant&nbsp; Lorenzo&nbsp; Komabiles,&nbsp; traffic officer of&nbsp; the Philippine Constabulary&nbsp; of the province of Laguna, stationed at Los Banos, furthermore testified that according to his personal observation, there is&nbsp; a heavy volume&nbsp; of&nbsp; passengers riding in the buses and jeepneys operating&nbsp; on the lines&nbsp; Calamba-Canlubang; that&nbsp; he has apprehended many TPTJ&nbsp; jeepneys and buses as well as. auto-calesas for&nbsp; overloading, that&nbsp; there are plenty of passengers&nbsp; between Calamba and Canlubang because there is an army installation, Camp&nbsp; Vicente Lim, 'where&nbsp; there&nbsp; are about one&nbsp; thousand soldiers living with their families; and that there are&nbsp; more than two thousand persons employed in the Canlubang Estate who need additional transportation facilities&nbsp; on&nbsp; the lines herein applied for.&nbsp; .<br><br>(<i>c</i>) "On the other hand,&nbsp; the oppositora submitted evidence tending to show that their buses operating on the lines covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the present application&nbsp; can&nbsp; accommodate&nbsp; all the passerigers; that rthe average passenger load&nbsp; of&nbsp; their buses is less than the&nbsp; authorized maximum passenger capacity of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; buses&nbsp; as shown by the reports of its inspectors marked Exhibits&nbsp; "1", "2", and "3";&nbsp; that aside&nbsp; from the buses of the oppositors, there are also other TPU auto-trucks and auto-calesas operating along those lines as shown&nbsp; by the census&nbsp; taken by&nbsp; the inspectors of&nbsp; the Laguna Tayabas Bua Company and presented in evidence as Exhibits "4", "4-a" to "4~d", Exhibits "5", "5-a", to "6-e", Exhibits 6,&nbsp; 6-a to 6-d; and that the oppositors have suffered losses in the operation&nbsp; of their: San Pablo-Manila line, Tanauan-Calamba line and Calamba-Canlubang . line as shown, by their monthly operation reports for&nbsp; March&nbsp; and April, 1953, marked as Exhibits "7" and "7-a" respectively.<br><br>(<i>d</i>) "After a careful consideration of the evidence submitted by both parties and the records of this Commission on authorized auto-truck services on the lilies herein applied for, we are of the opinion that public convenience&nbsp; and necessity will&nbsp; be served by the approval of this application inasmuch as the&nbsp; service being rendered by the oppositors on the lines in&nbsp; question&nbsp; is inadequate to meet the needs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; inhabitants for a&nbsp; local service which applicant proposes to operate."<br></blockquote>As could be seen,&nbsp; the decision appealed from is predicated on&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence presented at the&nbsp; trial of the case, which the Public Service Commission found to be in&nbsp; favor of the respondent; consequently, the same should not be disturbed, for in several decisions&nbsp; we have already held that "this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; would&nbsp; not unduly&nbsp; interfere&nbsp; with the Commission "or&nbsp; attempt to substitute its&nbsp; judgment for the judgment of the Commission if there be evidence before it&nbsp; reasonably supporting its order.<br><br>Under the third assignment of error, petitioners strongly urge that the Public Service Commission should not have granted&nbsp; the&nbsp; application&nbsp; but&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp; required the oppositors to increase their service on&nbsp; the lines applied for by the new&nbsp; applicant, being old and established operators on the said&nbsp; lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention,&nbsp; however, was not pleaded by&nbsp; the petitioners in their&nbsp; opposition to the application; it was not raised during&nbsp; the hearing of the case,&nbsp; and it is&nbsp; only&nbsp; raised now in this&nbsp; appeal, hence&nbsp; it cannot be properly entertained by this Court.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding no&nbsp; errors&nbsp; in the decision appealed from, the same&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, wi|h&nbsp; costs against the oppositors, herein petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras, G. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ., </i>concur.</div>
