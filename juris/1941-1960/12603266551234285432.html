				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. NICANOR ACOSTA Y PALA ALIAS MATA, ET AL., DEFENDANTS, NICANOR  ACOSTA Y PALA ALIAS MATA,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case&nbsp; has been elevated&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court as prescribed by the Rules so that we may review the sentence of death passed upon the accused Nicanor Acosta y Pala&nbsp; by the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila.<br><br>It appears that the said accused was, together with four others,&nbsp; charged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below&nbsp; with the&nbsp; crime of robbery&nbsp; with&nbsp; homicide,&nbsp; committed, according to&nbsp; the information,&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the&nbsp; 21st day of, October, 1953, in the City&nbsp; of Manila, Philippines, the&nbsp; said accused, conspiring and&nbsp; confederating together and helping- one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with ah."use of superior strength,&nbsp; the use&nbsp; of' motor&nbsp; vehicle, and by means of violence against or intimidation&nbsp; of persons, to wit: by treacherously shooting one Olimpia Francisco&nbsp; de Guzman Santos six times with a firearm, take steal and carry&nbsp; away, with intent of gain and against the consent&nbsp; of the owner thereof, a handbag containing the sum of P10,000 in cash belonging to the said Olimpia Francisco&nbsp; de Guzman&nbsp; to. her damage and prejudice in the said sum of P10,000, Philippine currency and&nbsp; thereby inflicting upon her multiple (6)&nbsp; gunshot wounds lacerating the heart, inferior vena cava, lung and kidney, which injuries were the direct and natural cause of her&nbsp; death of a few moments thereafter;"<br></blockquote>the information further alleging—<br><blockquote>"That the accused Nicanor Acosta y Pala alias Mata is a habitual delinquent, having been previously convicted by final judgment of competent courts as follows-:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">B-58172&nbsp; Theft ................ 1 mo. &amp; 1 day&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-14-52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4-16-52<br>B-77275&nbsp; Estafa ............... 1 mo. &amp; 1 day&nbsp;&nbsp; 6-30-50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7-31-50<br></div></blockquote>Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not&nbsp; guilty.&nbsp; But when the case came up for trial about a month later,&nbsp; he withdrew his plea of not guilty and,&nbsp; upon the information being read to him, entered, that of guilty.&nbsp; After satisfying itself that&nbsp; the accused,&nbsp; who was.&nbsp; then represented&nbsp; by counsel,&nbsp; was&nbsp; aware of the consequences of his&nbsp; plea, the court pronounced its&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; declaring him guilty&nbsp; as charged&nbsp; and, in view of the aggravating&nbsp; circumstances alleged in the information with only the plea of guilty to mitigate the&nbsp; offense,&nbsp; sentencing him to death.<br><br>The attorney <i>de oficio</i> recommends that.the sentence be set aside and the case remanded to&nbsp; the court below for a new trial, contending that it "Was error to&nbsp; "mete out so grave a&nbsp; penalty, on a mere&nbsp; plea of guilty,&nbsp; without first fully explaining to&nbsp; the accused the&nbsp; consequences of such plea in view&nbsp; of the aggravating&nbsp; circumstances alleged in the&nbsp; information.<br><br>This Court has already declared that the essence of the plea of guilty in a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; trial is that the accused,&nbsp; on arraignment,&nbsp; admits his guilt freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of&nbsp; the consequences and meaning of his act, and with a clear&nbsp; understanding of the precise nature of the crime&nbsp; charged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information; that when formally entered, such&nbsp; a&nbsp; plea is&nbsp; sufficient to sustain a conviction of&nbsp; any offense charged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information, even a capital offense, without the introduction of further evidence, the defendant having himself supplied the necessary proof; and that while it may be prudent and advisable in&nbsp; some eases, especially where grave crimes are charged, to take additional evidence&nbsp; as to the guilt of the accused and the circumstances attendant upon tho commission of the crime nevertheless it lies,in the sound discretion&nbsp; of the court whether to take evidence or not in any case where it is satisfied that the plea of guilty has been&nbsp; entered by&nbsp; the accused with full knowledge&nbsp; of the meaning and&nbsp; consequences of his act.&nbsp; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jamad, 37 Phil., 305;&nbsp; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Burlado,&nbsp; 42 Phil., 72; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Sta. Rosa, 88&nbsp; Phil., 487; People <i>vs.</i> Sabilul, 89 Phil., 283.)<br><br>In the present case, the-decision below states:<br><blockquote>"Asked by the Court whether he is fully aware of the consequences of his voluntary plea of guilty in view of the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information namely, abuse of superior strength, us of motor vehicle,&nbsp; treachery, and&nbsp; habitual delinquency, the accused maintained his&nbsp; plea of guilty.<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; thus appears&nbsp; that, before&nbsp; passing&nbsp; sentence, the court fust satisfied itself&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused "was well aware&nbsp; of the consequences of his plea of guilty,&nbsp; the full import of which, in view of the aggravating&nbsp; circumstances alleged, must have been brought home to him by his&nbsp; lawyer,'who M.as&nbsp; then with,&nbsp; him and must be supposed to&nbsp; have duly performed&nbsp; his&nbsp; duty&nbsp; as such.&nbsp; Undoubtedly&nbsp; aware that there were no. mitigating circumstances—for&nbsp; he made no offer&nbsp; to prove any—counsel must have figured&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant's only&nbsp; chance to&nbsp; obtain leniency was for him to atenuate&nbsp; his liability with&nbsp; a frank admission&nbsp; of guilt and throw himself upon the mercy&nbsp; of the. court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circumstances, the&nbsp; trial court was not bound to take&nbsp; evidence since the plea&nbsp; of guilty, which was&nbsp; advisedly&nbsp; entered, already supplied the necessary proof.<br><br>In the case of People <i>vs.</i> Palupe, 69 Phil., 703, this Court, in&nbsp; affirming a conviction for&nbsp; murder&nbsp; on a plea of&nbsp; guilty, said<br><blockquote>"Cuando el Juzgado&nbsp; no requirio la presentacion de pruebas&nbsp; adicionales, fue indudablemente porque no hubo el menor&nbsp; asomo de duda de que el acusado, o sea el apelante,&nbsp; conocia&nbsp; los verdaderos hechos y la naturaleza de su delito, siendo por dicha raaon innecesario dieho tramite;&nbsp; y nadie mejor que le Juzgado podia determinar si habia tal necesidad o no porque tenia ante si al apelante que&nbsp; por cierto&nbsp; no estaba solo, sino&nbsp; acompanado y asistido dohidamente de su albogsido defensor a quien. fse supone naturahnente que le asesoro con abaoluta fidelidad y aprobo el paso que iba a day eonfesan dose culpably porque era&nbsp; lo megor que podia hacer para merecer la menor pena posible.&nbsp; Ademas, el apelante no pidio en ning momento antes de&nbsp; perfeccionailf si apslacion, que&nbsp; se permitiese presentar&nbsp; pruebas&nbsp; para&nbsp; estafolecer alguna defensa, no obstante haber&nbsp; hecho bu confesion Bin resetvas&nbsp; de ningun&nbsp; genero."<br></blockquote>The above pronouncement fits in to the case now before us. And it&nbsp; clearly appearing that the trial court accepted the plea of guilty only after satisfying itself that the accused was aware of its consequences in&nbsp; view of the aggravating circumstances alleged, we find no need for. ordering a new trial,&nbsp; especially because no&nbsp; offer has been&nbsp; made&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove any defense&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; circumstance that might mitigate criminal&nbsp; liability.<br><br>The sentence imposed below being&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with law, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., .Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.
