				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila, with  a violation  of Commonwealth  Act No. 303  in relation to Article 315  of  the Revised  Penal  Code. After due  proceedings  and  hearing, the Court found him guilty of the crime  charged and  sentenced him to suffer the indeterminate imprisonment term ranging from 1  year and  1 day, to  1 year and 8  months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional,</span> to indemnify the  complainants in the sum of P477.34, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,  and  to pay  the costs.  From  this sentence defendant Venancio Manangco  appealed to  the Court  of  Appeals which  by resolution  of  August 11, 1956, certified the case to this Court under the  provision of Section 17-(6) of the Judiciary Act of 1948. <br><br>The facts of the  case as correctly stated in the brief of the  Solicitor  General are  substantially as follows: <br><br>On February 8,  1952, and  in  San Nicolas, Muelle  de la Industria,  Manila,  appellant Venancio Manangco  contracted the services of several laborers to do the loading and  unloading of cement sacks that was to be undertaken in Mariveles,  Bataan.   The shipment  of the cement belonged to the National Steel and Shipyard Company and the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co. was the entity that had entered  into contract  with several  companies  or  persons  for such loading and unloading  (Exhibit 11).   The laborers that are  involved in  this  case  to  whom appellant bound  himself  to  pay their  respective  wages,  and  the respective  amounts that  are due and  unpaid  to  them for the services they have rendered in said  enterprise, are the following: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="6%"> <br></td><td width="15%">Mariano  Belen..........................................</td><td width="6%"><div align="right">P68.21 </div></td><td width="13%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Gaudencio  Durante...................................</td><td><div align="right">101.50 </div></td><td>  <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Diego  Callejon......................................... </td><td><div align="right">128.21 </div></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Pablo   Villanueva......................................</td><td><div align="right">51.98 </div></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Marcelo   Labar........................................</td><td><div align="right">42.41 </div></td><td>  <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Pacifico   Labar.........................................</td><td><div align="right">44.81 </div></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Felipe  Samaniego....................................</td><td><div align="right">40.21</div></td><td>  <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The  loading  and  unloading  in which these  laborers worked  was finished on February 26, 1952, and  notwithstanding their repeated demands on appellant to pay them their respective  wages due, he refused and  failed to pay the same up to  the  present.  The contract that appellant entered  into with the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co.  contains the following stipulations  and  conditions,  to wit: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="5%"><div align="center">(1)</div></td><td width="90%"> Venancio  Manangco will put  up all necessary laborers to undertake the job; </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(7)</div></td><td> It  is understood that the Pan-Philippine Shipping will not be  responsible  for  non-payment  to any  laborers  working  under this contract; </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(8)</div></td><td> That  the Pan-Philippine Shipping will  not  entertain  any protest from any  laborer  and that  it should  be  Mr: Manangeo who must have to attend to all the laborers </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(9) </div></td><td>The Pan-Philippine  Shipping will advance some  money to Venancio Manangco for buying of  rice and other food stuff necessary to maintain themselves while they are in  Mariveles  (Exhibit I). </td></tr></tbody></table><br>Pursuant to this  contract the  Pan-Philippine Shipping Co. paid P11,110, on account of the Nassco Cement which included the payment of the wages of laborers doing the loading  and unloading of said  cement,  and P11,530  on account of the  unloading of the Prisco Cement. On appeal counsel  for the  defense contends that the  lower Court erred: <br><ol><li>In  not  taking into consideration the  legal issue raised by the defendant and appellant to the effect that Commonwealth Act No. 602 has been repealed already in toto by  Republic Act No. 602, otherwise known as the Minimum Wage Law;<br><br> </li><li>In  not taking into  consideration  the  fact  that non-payment of wages to laborers  does not constitute  estafa as provided by Republic Act No. 602; and<br><br> </li><li>In not acquitting  defendant and appellant. </li></ol>Pursuing these defenses  counsel  for appellant  states: (1)  That appellant  is  an  independent  contractor  and having  signed a contract with  the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co. he  became  a sub-contractor and  the company the principal  (Exhibit 1); (2) That upon the signing of the abovementioned  contract appellant was ordered by his principal thru his General Manager Capt. Hilarion Benedicto to proceed to Mariveles immediately  to start the unloading of  cement,  as stipulated, hence, said defendant and appellant gathered all his men and  on February 8, 1952 went to Mariveles with all his laborers arriving there on the afternoon of the same day;  (3) That appellant could not start immediately  the unloading of cement because the ship supposed to have the  Cargo had  not yet  arrived, so they had to wait in  the meantime and without work until the arrival of the S.S. BANZAI <span style="font-style: italic;">Maru</span> on the 12th day of February, 1952; (4) That appellant has paid the laborers for the 5 days' period and  incurred in expenses for the daily subsistence of the laborers  and the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co. has refused to reimburse the defendant-appellant for his extra and unnecessary expenses; and  (5) That at the termination of the unloading of the cargo of cement, the defendant and appellant was not able  to pay in full  the wages of his  laborers, specially  the  herein seven complainants  and,  consequently, the  City  Fiscal's Office filed  the corresponding complaint  at  the instance of the Department of  Labor. <br><br>Appellant admits that he has not paid in full the wages of herein complainants but his  counsel contends  that he had  been erroneously prosecuted  because, instead of accusing him  of a  violation of Republic  Act No.  602,  he was prosecuted  erroneously for  a violation  of Commonwealth Act  No.  303.   It is,  therefore,  appellant's  contention and  his  principal issue in this appeal that  Commonwealth Act No. 303 was already repealed  by Republic Act No.  602,  which  is the epitome  of all labor  laws  in the Philippines. <br><br>The pertinent portions of the labor laws involved in this prosecution read as follows:                <br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote>"COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 303.— <br></blockquote></div><span style=""><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Section</span>  1.—Every  employer,  including the head  of every government office, whether national, provincial or municipal, shall pay the salaries  and wages  of  his employees  and laborers  at  least once every two weeks or one-half month unless it  be impossible to do so due  to force majeure or to  gome other  causes  beyond his  control, or  unless he has been previously exempted by  the Secretary  of  Labor  from  this requirement.

As  under the facts of the case at bar,  defendant cannot be prosecuted twice, i.e., one under Commonwealth  Act No. 303 and another under Republic Act No.  602. We  have  to  conclude the latter Act, at  least in so far as the issues herein involved are concerned, covers and repeals the  provisions  of the former Act  on the  point,  and  although appellant has been  prosecuted under Commonwealth Act  No.  303 in connection with  Article 315  of the Revised  Penal Code, as the elements  constituting  a violation of Section 15 of Republic Act No. 602 are fully averred in the information, We would find no obstacle in  declaring the defendant and appellant guilty  of a violation of this law if the  evidence appearing on record would show,  as it does, his guilt of a violation  thereof, although the penalty to be imposed upon said defendant and appellant would have to be imposed in accordance with the provisions  of the latter law (Rep. Act No.  602, Section 15). <br><br>Wherefore, and  on the strength  of the foregoing  considerations, the decision appealed from is hereby modified by finding the defendant and appellant guilty of a  violation of Section 10-(h)  in connection with Section 15 of Republic Act No. 602, and sentencing the defendant and appellant to pay a fine of P1,000, to further indemnify  the complainants in the total amount of  P477.33,  or  suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment  in case of insolvency or  inability to pay both indemnity and fine, and to pay the  costs in both instances.  It is so ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
