				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a  decision of  the  Court of First  Instance of Camarines Sur (Criminal  Case No. 3335)  certified to this Court by the Court of Appeals,  as the issue  involved is purely a question of law. <br><br>It appears that the appellant, Alicia Rapirap, was charged with, and after due trial was convicted by the Municipal Court of the  City of  Naga,  of the crime of less serious physical injuries  and  sentenced to pay a fine  of P25.00. Not satisfied with said decision, she appealed to the Court of First Instance  of Camarines Sur. When the case was called for trial,  the accused  appeared with her counsel and manifested to the court  that she was changing  her former plea of not guilty to that of guilty; and having been given the permission of the court to do so, she withdrew her plea of not guilty and upon arraignment anew, accused voluntarily pleaded  guilty to  the crime described in  the information  in the following manner: <br><blockquote>"That on or about January 16, 1954 in the City of Naga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the  said accused, without any justifiable motive or cause, did, then  and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,  assault and use personal violence  upon  the herein  complainant,  Remedios Braca, by hitting the latter with a piece of  wood, thereby inflicting upon her physical injuries  as per medical  certificate hereto attached, to wit; <br><br>Contusion, sacral region, direction of contusion transverse, 3 inches wide and 7 inches long. <br><br>Which injuries have required and may  require medical  attendance for a period of three (3) to seven  (7) days and have incapacitated  and may  incapacitate  said  Remedios  Braca from performing her  customary labor for the same period of  time,  and as a result thereof, Remedios Braca suffered damages in the amount of P200.00,  Philippine  currency, in  concept of  actual and  moral damages." </blockquote>Thereafter,  Atty. Catimbang (one of her counsel) asked the court to impose the penalty of P20.00  to  the  accused, in consideration  of her plea  of guilty,  but  the  petition was denied.   In  view of  this refusal of  the court,  the appellant then asked permission to withdraw her appeal, which was also denied.  Thereafter, she was  sentenced: (1)  to suffer the penalty of  eleven (11)  days  <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>; (2)  to pay the damages in  the amount of P200 to the offended  party,  or to suffer  subsidiary  imprisonment in case of insolvency at  the  rate  of  P2.50 per day which shall not be more than 1/3 of the principal penalty; and  (3) to pay the  costs  of the proceedings. <br><br>The only issue tendered in this appeal  is whether  or not the refusal of the lower court to permit the withdrawal of the appeal from said court was proper  under the circumstances.  Appellant invokes section  12,  Rule 118,  of the Rules of Court: <br><blockquote>"Notwithstanding the perfection of the appeal, the Court of First Instance may  allow the  appellant to withdraw his appeal before the record  has been forwarded by the  clerk of  the court to  the appellate court as provided in Section 8, in which case the judgment shall  become final. <br><br>The Court of  First Instance may also,  in its  discretion, allow the appellant from the judgment of  the justice of the  peace court or judge of a  municipal  court  to withdraw his appeal,  provided a motion to that effect is filed before the trial of the  case on  appeal, in which case the judgment of the justice of the peace or municipal court shall  become  final,  the provisions  of  Section 8, Rule  119, to the contrary notwithstanding, and the case shall be remanded to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo </span>for execution of the judgment. </blockquote>In the first place, it is clear from this provision of the Rules that the withdrawal of the appeal should be allowed upon motion, <span style="font-style: italic;">only before the trial of the case on appeal</span>, and not during or after it.  In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ilagan (58 Phil. 851), this Court implied that an accused is deemed to have been  brought to  trial  after  issues  are properly joined  with a plea of not  guilty.   A plea  of guilty does not merely join the issues of the complaint or information, but amounts to an admission of guilt  and of the material facts alleged  in the complaint or information (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Buco,  G. R.  No. L-2633, February 28, 1950;  People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sabilul,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 49 Off. Gaz., 27434; Rules of Court Annotated,  by Moran, Vol. II, p. 806), and in  this sense takes the place of the  trial itself.   Such plea removes the  necessity  of presenting further  evidence and for all intents and purposes the case is deemed tried on its merits and submitted for decision.   It leaves the court with no alternative but to impose the penalty prescribed by law (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ng Pek, 46 Off. Gaz.,  Supp. [1]  360; 81 Phil., 562). <br><br>Secondly, it should be noted that the withdrawal of an appeal under this section rests within the sound discretion of the court.   In imposing a higher penalty and not allowing the withdrawal of the appeal by the accused appellant, the court did not  abuse its discretion; on the  contrary it was soundly exercised.   The move to withdraw the appeal was made only at a time when the court appeared disposed to impose a higher penalty, when it denied the recommendation of  one of her attorneys to impose a P20.00 fine.  No one should be allowed to trifle with the solemn judicial procedure  (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Pangilinan, 74 Phil. 451) as by permitting parties to a case to take  appeals and withdraw them at  pleasure, after  they become certain that the forthcoming judgment would work adversely  to them.  Parties and attorneys should realize that the ethics of the market place are not those of courts of justice. <br><br>As the plea of guilty was only taken when the  case was on appeal with the Court of First Instance, it was rightfully  not considered a mitigating circumstance (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Herminio, 64 Phil. 403). <br><br>Finding none of the errors alleged to have been  substantiated, we affirm  the judgment appealed from with costs against appellant.  So  ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista  Angelo,  Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia,</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>93 Phil., 567. <br></div>
