				<H3>FILOMENO DIZON, PETITIONER, VS. NICASIO YATCO, JUDGE OF THE  COURT  OF  FIRST  INSTANCE  OF  RIZAL,  BRANCH  V, SHERIFF OF RIZAL  PROVINCE  AND  SAMSON YUTAN, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In civil case No. Q-2000 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, which was an action for the recovery of a sum of money, the defendant Filomeno Dizon was declared in default for failure to  file an answer,  and, after proof was  received in support  of  the  complaint, judgment for the sum claimed  was rendered against him on November 13, 1956.<br><br>Learning of the judgment, the defendant, on January 4, 1957,  filed a petition for relief,  asking  that the order of default be  lifted, the judgment set aside, and the case allowed to proceed to trial  with  the admission  of the answer and counterclaim attached  to  the petition.   But the petition  was denied on the ground that—to quote the court's own language—"up to the present such order of default has not as yet been  lifted and therefore defendant  has  no   personality in  this case as  yet."  An amended petition for relief filed before defendant received notice of the  denial of his original  petition was likewise denied.  And the court having moreover granted plaintiff's motion for execution filed without notice  to the defendant during the pendency of the amended petition  for relief, the defendant perfected his appeal.   But for reasons which do not appear the appeal was disallowed.<br><br>A motion  for  reconsideration was to  have been  filed, but with the  provincial sheriff already trying  to  execute the judgment  by default,  the defendant came to this Court with the present petition for certiorari,  praying that the order of  execution be set aside and that preliminary injunction issue, <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>, to  restrain its enforcement.<br><br>The petition was given due course and the preliminary injunction prayed  for  issued.   But  respondents  have neither answered nor appeared at the hearing. <br><br>The petition must be  granted.  It is true that a party who has been declared in  default  loses  his standing in  Nevertheless, the Rules of Court give that party the right to apply for relief from default in accordance with  Rule 38 and, if the application is denied, to appeal from the order  of denial.  Petitioner  did avail  of that right by filing his application for relief on time.   But the application  was denied on the ground that the applicant had as yet no standing in the case as the order of default had not been lifted. Needless to say, the preferred relief under Rule  38 would be but  a mockery  and a delusion if it  could be  denied on that ground.<br><br>It  should  not  also be overlooked  that once a  petition for the relief  provided for in Rule  38 has been  filed by the party declared  in default, such  party is  entitled to notice of all further proceedings (Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol.  1,  1957 ed., p. 484).  And this should be  borne  in mind  in connection with the  motion for execution  which was  granted without notice to  the adverse party, who, though already  declared  in  default, had filed his petition for relief. That petition was, it is true,  subsequently  denied.   But  the  denial was appealed.<br><br>In the case of Monteverde et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jaranilla, et al.  (60 Phil., 297), this Court  held  "that the court which orders the execution of a judgment by  default during the pendency of the perfecting of the appeal taken  against the order denying the  motion in which it is prayed that said judgment by default be annulled, acts  in excess of jurisdiction", and also "that the court abuses its discretion in ordering the execution  of  a judgment  from  which an appeal is pending, without previous  notice to the  adverse party and there being  no special ground  therefor."  In principle these pronouncements apply to the present case.<br><br>In view of the  foregoing, the petition for certiorari is granted and  the order of execution complained of annulled and set aside.  With costs against the respondent  Samson Yutan.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon,  Montemayor, Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br></div>
