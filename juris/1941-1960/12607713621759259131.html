				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; facts in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; not&nbsp; disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Valentin Descals, an American citizen, died on September' 17, 1948, in the City of Manila where he was a resident.&nbsp; He left as .heirs his brothers&nbsp; Antonio and Ricardo and&nbsp; a sister Angeles, all surnanied&nbsp; Descals.&nbsp;&nbsp; About two years before his death&nbsp; he and his&nbsp; brother&nbsp; Ricardo&nbsp; jointly bought a piece of real estate&nbsp; property situated in the city of Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; course of&nbsp; the administration of said property in Spain, the two brothers had&nbsp; differences, particularly about the repair and remodeling of the same, and to settle said differences, they agreed that Valentin become the owner pit the entire property&nbsp; by buying&nbsp; his brother Ricardo's&nbsp; interest in it.&nbsp; After an accounting, said interest of Ricardo was&nbsp; valued at&nbsp; P46.000&nbsp; and Valentin acknowledged the said sum&nbsp; as a debt by means&nbsp; of a&nbsp; promissory note dated November&nbsp; 1, 1946.<br><br>After the death of Valentin, proceedings were initiated in the City of Manila for the administration of his estate. The administrator did not include&nbsp; in his&nbsp; inventory that property in Spain.&nbsp; According&nbsp; to&nbsp; his accounts the gross value of the estate was, P64,000 but after the&nbsp; payment of the expenses, this was rendered to around P44,000.&nbsp; Ricardo filed before the probate court a claim for P46.000 with interest based&nbsp; on the promissory; note executed&nbsp; by his brother in. 1946.&nbsp; Said claim was approved.&nbsp; The administrator paid about P80.000 on account of this&nbsp; claim with interest leaving a balance of about P26,000.&nbsp; The "balance in favor of Ricardo was later reduced to about P4.000 after the&nbsp; administrator had delivered to him certain shares&nbsp; of stock&nbsp; and cash belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; basis of this accounting and&nbsp; report of the administrator,&nbsp; there, apparently,&nbsp; was no. property&nbsp; left in the&nbsp; estate subject&nbsp; to estate and inheritance tax.<br><br>The&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of 'Internal&nbsp; Revenue, however,&nbsp; assessed the&nbsp; estate for purposes of taxation without deducting the claim&nbsp; filed by Ricardo despite its approval&nbsp; by the probate court and fixed and demanded the payment of P701.53 by way of&nbsp; estate&nbsp; tax&nbsp; and P2,144.10&nbsp; as inheritance tax, a total of P2,845.63.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; administrator paid this amount under protest and&nbsp; later brought the present action&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila to get its&nbsp; refund.&nbsp; After hearing,&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint with costs.&nbsp; The administrator appealed to the Court.of Appeals, which court later indorsed&nbsp; the appeal to us as involving only questions of&nbsp; law.<br><br>For purposes of reference&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; reproducing sections 88 and 89 of the National internal Revenue Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 88. <i>Gross estate.</i>—The&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gross of&nbsp; the decedent&nbsp; shall be determined by&nbsp; including&nbsp; the value the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible, intangible, wherever situated <i>except real property situated outside Philippines.</i>&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br><br>"Sec. ,89. <i>Net&nbsp; estate.</i>—For&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of the&nbsp; taxes imposed in this&nbsp; Chapter,&nbsp; the value of the net&nbsp; estate shall be determined:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) In the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; a citizen or resident of&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp; by deducting from&nbsp; the value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gross estate—<br><br>(1) Expenses,&nbsp; losses,&nbsp; indebtedness and&nbsp; taxes:&nbsp; Such amounts—<br><br>(A)&nbsp; For funeral expenses&nbsp; which shall,&nbsp; in no&nbsp; case, exceed five percentum of the gross estate;<br><br>(B)&nbsp; For judicial expenses of the testamentary&nbsp; or intestate proceedings: <br><br>(C)&nbsp; For&nbsp; claims against the estate;<br><br>(D)&nbsp; For claims of&nbsp; the deceased against&nbsp; insolvent persons where the value of decendent's&nbsp; interest therein is&nbsp; included value of the gross estate; and<br><br>(E)&nbsp; For unpaid mortgages upon or .any&nbsp; <i>indebtedness respect to, property&nbsp; where the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; decedent's interest the undiminished by such mortgage or indebtedness, is included in the value of the gross&nbsp; estate."</i>&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; ours.)<br></blockquote>It will be seen&nbsp; that&nbsp; under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 88, real property situated outside&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; is&nbsp; not included in&nbsp; the value of the gross estate of a deceased resident.&nbsp; Not being included as&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; estate, it cannot be&nbsp; subject to taxation such as estate tax and inheritance tax.&nbsp; Because of this, section&nbsp; 89 (e)&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of the taxes imposed&nbsp; under, that&nbsp; chapter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tax Code, in the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of the value of the net estate, in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; indebtedness in respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; property&nbsp; pay be allowed to be deducted from the value of the gross estate, the value&nbsp; of decedent's&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; property,&nbsp; undiminished by said indebtedness must be included in the value of the gross estate.&nbsp; Where however, in the determination of the&nbsp; gross estate the law (section 88) does not permit the inclusion of property outside of&nbsp; the Philippines, then it is but just and reasonable that the indebtedness&nbsp; incurred by&nbsp; the decedent by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; property&nbsp; or in&nbsp; the acquisition&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; should also&nbsp; not be&nbsp; discounted&nbsp; from the gross&nbsp; estate for&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of taxation.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; also the rule and practice in the United States where in&nbsp; the determination&nbsp; of the gross and net&nbsp; estate of a decedent, properties outside&nbsp; the jurisdiction,&nbsp; and indebtedness&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; in respect to or by reason of said property, are&nbsp; not considered, being regarded as impossible items.<br><blockquote>'Inasmuch as real property situated outside of&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States does not form&nbsp; a part of the gross&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; no&nbsp; deduction may be taken&nbsp; of any mortgage&nbsp; thereon or&nbsp; any&nbsp; indebtedness in&nbsp; respect thereof." (Reg.&nbsp; Sec. 81,38.&nbsp; (Vol. 2,&nbsp; Rabkin and Johnson, <i>Federal lncome,&nbsp; Gift and Estate Taxation,</i> 1954 ed., Sec. 63.03(10), p. 6319) "'. .&nbsp; .now the deduction is allowed only in&nbsp; case tile mortgaged property was included in the gross estate;... (<i>Rodick vs. Helvering,</i> 87 Fed.&nbsp; (2d) 328, 331&nbsp; [1937].)<br><br>". .&nbsp; . among the deductions allowed were 'unpaid mortgages', an impossible item unless the whole value of the mortgaged property is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; included in&nbsp; the gross&nbsp; estate&nbsp; under&nbsp; section 402(a), 40&nbsp; Stat. 1097,&nbsp; as an&nbsp; interest&nbsp; subject to the payment&nbsp; of charges against his estate.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>City Bank&nbsp; Farmers' Trust Co. vs. Bowers,</i> 68 Fed. (2d)&nbsp; 909, 913&nbsp; [1934].)"<br></blockquote>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised in this appeal.<br><br>Finding no reversible&nbsp; error&nbsp; in&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from,&nbsp; the same is hereby affirmed, with costs in&nbsp; both Instances.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
