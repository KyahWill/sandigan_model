				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of First 
Instance of Davao finding the defendant guilty of the crime of abduction
 with consent and sentencing him to suffer a minimum penalty of 3 months
 and 11 days of <em>arresto mayor</em> and a maximum penalty of 1 year, 8
 months and 21 days of <em>prision correccional,</em> the accessories of
 the law, to indemnify the complainant Remedios Sarillo in the sum of 
P500, or to undergo subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the
 payment of the indemnity, not to exceed one-third of the principal 
penalty, to support the offspring, if any, and to pay the costs.
<p>The appellant assigns as one of the errors committed by the trial 
court the fact that in spite of the lack of complaint filed by the 
offended party, the Court proceeded to try the defendant, found him 
guilty and sentenced him to suffer the penalty above stated. After the 
filing of the appellant's brief, the Solicitor General filed a motion to
 dismiss on the ground that as provided for in article 344 of the 
Revised Penal Code "The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts 
of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed
 by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, * * *"
 and that such complaint to be filed by the offended party is essential 
to vest in the Court jurisdiction to try the defendant charged with any 
of the offenses enumerated in the aforesaid article. The fact that at 
the bottom of the information and above the signature of the prosecuting
 officer the offended party signed and that in the first paragraph of 
the information it is recited that "at the instance of the offended 
party" the provincial fiscal charges the defendant of the crime of 
seduction does not vest jurisdiction in the court, for a complaint must 
be sworn to by the offended party. Her signature at the bottom of the 
information does not comply with the requirement of the law that the 
complaint be sworn to. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>In view of the rule laid down in the cases referred to, the Court of 
First Instance of Davao acquired no jurisdiction to try the defendant in
 this case and the trial, verdict and judgment are a nullity.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is annulled and the information dismissed,
 without costs.</p>
