				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. AVELINO PANTIG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
acquitting the appellant of the crime of estafa, but sentencing him to pay the 
offended party the amount of P1,200, which is the amount alleged in the 
information to have been obtained through false and fraudulent representations 
from the offended party. The dispositive part of the judgment of acquittal, 
which contains the order complained of, is as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, the accused is hereby acquitted, with costs<em> de oficio</em>. 
However, it appearing that the sum of one thousand two hundred pesos (P1,200) 
secured by him from Consuelo R. Pablo has not as yet been paid, the accused is 
hereby ordered to pay the same to the offended party with interest at 6 per cent 
per annum from July 20, 1951. Upon his failure to do so within thirty (30) days 
from notice of this judgment, a writ of execution will be issued on motion of 
the offended party."</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant argues that the civil liability which is included in the 
criminal action is that arising from and as a consequence of the criminal act, 
and that since the defendant-appellant was acquitted in the criminal case no 
civil liability arising from the criminal charge could be imposed upon him. The 
Solicitor General agrees with this contention, citing the cases of Manila 
Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Honorable Rodolfo Baltazar, et al., 49 Off. Gaz., 
3874; Pueblo contra Abellera, 69 Phil., 623; and People <em>vs</em>. Manago, 69 
Phil., 496, and, therefore, recommends that the portion of the decision appealed 
from, ordering the payment of the civil liability, be set aside, with costs 
<em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p>The trial court found as a fact that the sum of P1,200, ordered to be paid in 
the judgment of acquittal, was received by the defendant-appellant as loan. This 
finding is inconsistent with the existence of the criminal act charged in the 
information. The liability of the defendant for the return of the amount so 
received arises from a civil contract, not from a criminal act, and may not be 
enforced in the criminal case.</p>
<p>The portion of the judgment appealed from, which orders the 
defendant-appellant to pay the sum of P1,200 to the offended party, is hereby 
revoked, without prejudice to the filing of a civil action for the recovery of 
the said amount. Costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
