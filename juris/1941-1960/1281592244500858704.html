				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In certiorari proceedings (CA-G.R. No. 11091-R), the Court of Appeals in its 
decision declared null and void the order of Judge Ceniza in Civil Case No. 1484 
of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental, dated February 17, 1955, 
appointing a receiver in the said case. Respondents in said certiorari 
proceedings filed with us an appeal by certiorari to review said decision of the 
Court of Appeals. The appeal was given due course and the parties filed their 
corresponding briefs, including a memorandum for the appellee. The facts of the 
case are rather complicated but we find it necessary to state them even in 
detail, not only those found by the Court of Appeals but also those we gather 
from the pleadings of the parties, so as to better understand the circumstances 
under which the order appointing a receiver, was issued.
<p>Before the year 1935 appellee Magdaleno Atad filed an application for a 
homestead with the Bureau of Lands for a portion of the public domain in 
Guinabot, Baliangao, Misamis Occidental (H.A. No. 114004 - E106070), which 
application included a large parcel with an area of about 17 hectares, later 
subdivided into 12 lots, occupied by the appellants Benito Bedad et al. Said 
occupants filed a protest against Atad's application, claiming that the 17 
hectares above referred to was not actually occupied by Atad but by themselves 
and they asked that that portion be segregated from his application. The 
Director of Lands overruled their protest and in an order dated November 10, 
1955, he denied their motion for reconsideration. On December 26, 1959, the 
Director of Lands issued an order of execution directing the Provincial Land 
Officer in Misamis to enforce his previous order, have the oppositors vacate the 
entire homestead, and place Atad in possession thereof. When the Land Officer 
went to the place to execute the order the oppositors-appellants Bedad et al 
refused to vacate their holdings and renewed and continued their protest against 
At ad1s homestead application, even with the Chief Executive. As a result of 
this persistent protest the Secretary of Agriculture in an order dated September 
2, 1941, directed that the application of Atad should be given due course only 
for the portion actually occupied by him, and that the remainder occupied by 
various, persons (presumably the protestants-oppositors) mentioned in the report 
of the ocular inspection submitted by Public Lands Inspector Atilano Villaceran 
and Surveyor Delfin Deligero, submitted on July 23, 1941, be adjudicated in 
favor of said occupants to be applied for by them under the homestead provisions 
of the Public Land Law. It would seem that Atad was far from satisfied with this 
order of the Secretary of Agriculture segregating from-his homestead application 
the 17 hectares, because he claimed that the oppositors and protestants were 
mere croppers working for him; that their protest had been duly overruled and 
denied by the Director of Lands and they did not appeal from said order to the 
Secretary of Agriculture, and consequently, said order became final. So, he 
apparently still claimed the whole area including the 17 hectares. And on 
November 11, 1946, Atad filed in the Court of First Instance of Misamis 
Occidental civil case No. 911 entitled UNLAWFUL DETAINER AND DAMAGES against 
oppositors- appellants. He also filed, a criminal action against them in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Baliangao for violation of Section 2725 of the 
Revised Administrative Code relating to interference with the execution of 
decisions, resolutions or decrees of the Bureau of Lands, presumably referring 
to the refusal of the appellants to vacate the 17 hectares occupied and claimed 
by them, as ordered by the Director of Lands.</p>
<p>In the Justice of the Peace Court, these occupants-appellants were found 
guilty and sentenced each to pay P10.00, but on appeal to the Court of First 
Instance in Criminal Case No. 2503 the information was quashed and the case 
dismissed. Civil Case No. 911 was also dismissed. There is reason to believe 
that the dismissal of both the civil and the criminal case was based on the 
belief of the trial judge that the order of the Director of Lands overruling the 
protest and opposition of Benito Bedad et al., and ordering them to leave the 
land, was vacated and set aside by the later order of the Secretary of 
Agriculture dated September 2, 1941, excluding the 17 hectares in question from 
Atadâ€™s homestead application, and awarding the said 17 hectares to the 
occupants-appellants and directing them to apply for it under the homestead 
provisions of the Public Land Law.</p>
<p>According to appellants, on December 10, 1951, Atad with his wife and 
children and several hired men entered five of the twelve lots occupied by them 
(appellants) and harvested coconuts. This invasion of the five lots and the 
reaping of fruits was repeated on July 22, 1952 and so the next day on July 23rd 
appellants filed Civil Case No. 1484 against Atad for the recovery of the value 
of the coconuts taken by him, and for damages. Acting on the prayer in their 
complaint for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, respondent Judge 
Ceniza granted the same ex-parte upon the filing of a bond of P1,000.00. This 
writ of preliminary injunction was later lifted upon Atad's filing a counterbond 
in the sum of P2,000.00. According to appellants, five days after the lifting of 
the writ of injunction, Atad and his men on September 10, 1952 again invaded not 
only the five lots already mentioned but the remaining seven lots, that is to 
say, the whole 17 hectares occupied by and adjudicated to them by the Secretary 
of Agriculture; not only this, but instead of picking coconuts every two or 
three months as was the practice in coconut plantations, they did it every 
month, picking even young, immature coconuts, which act disturbed the fruiting 
of the trees and rendered them less fruitful. Atad and his companions are said 
to have also carried away other fruits like jackfruits, bananas, coffee, 
avocados, etc. Because of all this, appellants filed an amended complaint 
alleging the estimated value of the coconuts and other fruits harvested by Atad 
and damages, and on February 17, 1953, they filed an ex-parte petition for the 
appointment of a receiver in order to take charge of the whole area involved. 
Judge Ceniza in his order dated February 17, 1953, granted said petition 
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appearing from the ex-parte urgent motion of the herein plaintiffs 
supported by affidavit that the herein defendants, after the writ of preliminary 
injunction had been lifted thru the filing of the counterbond, have been and are 
wantonly harvesting the nuts from the coconut tress on the land in question such 
that the plantation would be greatly damaged unless a receiver is appointed to 
preserve the litigated property in good condition;</p>
<p>"Finding the said urgent motion just and reasonable, Vicente Roa, the Clerk 
of Court is hereby appointed receiver to take care of the property and to 
administer the same during the pendency of this litigation upon filing a bond in 
the amount of P5,000.00 with solvent sureties.</p>
<p>"The receiver shall render an accounting of his receivership from time to 
time or not loss than once in every six months. He is further ordered to deposit 
the proceeds of the products from the land in question after all incidental 
expenses have been paid with the Philippine National Bank Agency of this 
province."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the order which was the subject of the certiorari proceedings brought 
by Atad before the Court of Appeals and which order was declared null and void 
by said Court. In annulling the said order the court of Appeals says that there 
was a counterbond of P2,000.00 filed by Atad which could respond for any damages 
that may have been caused by him, and that there was no proof that this bond was 
not sufficient for the protection of appellants. The Court of Appeals added that 
the respondent Judge should not have hastily granted the ex-parte petition for 
the appointment of a receiver, evidently relying upon his previous knowledge and 
information about the matter in litigation, presumably referring to the 
dismissal of Civil Case No. 911 and his quashing of the information in Criminal 
Case No. 2503. </p>
<p>After a careful study of the case, we regret our inability to agree the Court 
of Appeals in its decision annulling the order of the trial court of February 
17, 1953, appointing a receiver. Appellants have explained satisfactorily the 
reasons and circumstances under which they filed their petition for the 
appointment of a receiver. They say that Atad filed a petition in the trial 
court to dismiss the original Civil Case No. 1484 and when his motion was denied 
he filed a notice to appeal to the Supreme Court from the order denying his 
motion to dismiss and he duly perfected his appeal. Believing that his appeal 
was going to take its regular course in the Supreme Court which would take some 
time to decide, and that in the meantime Atad and his companions would be 
reaping the fruits of the whole area in question, to say nothing of damaging the 
coconut trees, appellants decided to file on February 17, 1953, an urgent motion 
for the appointment of a receiver in the belief that it was the most convenient 
or feasible means by which further destruction of the plantation and removal of 
its fruits could be avoided while the case remained pending in court. According 
to appellants, Atad withdrew his appeal only on March 7, 1953, that is, after 
the issuance of the order appointing of a receiver.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals does not approve of the action of the respondent Judge 
in relying upon his personal knowledge of the case in granting the petition for 
the appointment of a receiver. Frankly, we do not see any impropriety in 
respondent Judge making use of his knowledge of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the case, assuming that he did so, in considering the merits of the 
petition for the appointment of a receiver. We must remember that as a Judge of 
the Court of First Instance, he was authorized by law to grant meritorious 
petitions for the appointment of a receiver, even ex-parte (Rule 61, Sec. 3). 
Respondent Judge Ceniza must have been quite aware of the facts and 
circumstances obtaining in the case before him, namely, that the case involved 
about 17 hectares claimed by Atad on the one hand as included in his homestead 
application as decided by the Director of Lands in his orders of November 10, 
1935 and December 26 , 1939, but equally claimed by protestants-appellants, and 
actually occupied by them and which they had planted to fruit trees, especially 
coconut trees, actually bearing fruit, which 17 hectares had been adjudicated to 
them, correctly or wrongly, by the Secretary of Agriculture in his order of 
September 2, 1941; that the criminal case filed in Court by Atad against 
appellants for refusing to comply with the order of the Director of Lands for 
them to vacate the 17 hectares occupied by them was dismissed; so was Civil Case 
No. 911 also filed by Atad against them for unlawful detainer and damages for 
supposedly illegally withholding said 17 hectares from him. Both dismissals were 
ordered by his court. Then, according to the complaint against Atad in Civil 
Case No. 1484, he and companions illegally invaded these 17 hectares being held 
by appellants, collected the fruits not only from fruit trees like coffee, 
banana, avocado, but from the more valuable coconut trees, even collecting young 
coconuts thereby damaging the trees, and the only security put up by Atad was 
his counter- bond in the amount of P2,000.00. Not only this, but Atad threatened 
to take the case on appeal to this Court and actually perfected his appeal, 
thereby leading appellants to believe that they - were due for a long wait, 
considering not only the time required for the determination of his appeal but 
also of the case itself in the Court of First Instance, and this was what 
prompted appellants to file the petition for the appointment of a receiver. 
Respondent Judge Ceniza must have known these facts and circumstances, because 
they took place and were presented in his own court. Why could he not properly 
make use of this knowledge in deciding upon the advisability and propriety of 
appointing a receiver, not exactly to favor appellants who asked for said 
appointment but to preserve the property in litigation, including its fruits 
during the whole period that the case was pending not only in his Court but also 
in the Supreme Court?</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals also said that there was no evidence that the 
counterbond of P2,000.00 filed by Atad for the lifting of the writ of 
preliminary injunction was not sufficient to protect herein appellants. The 
partial report of the receiver quoted in the very memorandum of counsel for 
appellee Atad, in our opinion sufficiently shows the inadequacy of the P2,000.00 
counterbond for the proper protection of herein appellants. According to said 
partial report (page 9 of appellee's memorandum) from May 11, 1953 to April 7, 
1954, - a period of less than one year, from the copra made from the coconuts 
harvested from the parcel under his custody, there was a gross sale of 
P3,309.78. This does not include the value of other products such as coffee, 
bananas, avocados, bamboos, etc. Neither does it include the alleged damage to 
the coconut trees themselves because of the alleged picking of young and 
immature coconuts. Even assuming that a receiver had not been appointed and that 
this case had not gone to the Court of Appeals and to this Court, there is no 
telling how long a time Civil Case No. 1484 would have taken for a final 
decision, because the losing party in the trial court might have taken the case 
to the appellate-courts, specially since the case involved a legal question, 
namely, the conclusiveness and effect of an order of the Director of Lands dated 
November 10, 1935, finally overruling the opposition and protest of herein 
appellants and apparently adjudicating the entire area covered by the Homestead 
application and entry, including the 17 hectares in question, to Atad, which 
order apparently was not duly appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture, and 
considering the order of the Secretary of Agriculture himself, issued several 
years later (Sept. 2, 1941), excluding the 17 hectares from the Homestead 
application of Atad, and adjudicating them to appellants, which 1941 order was 
issued, presumably before any Homestead Patent was given to Atad for the entire 
area, including the 17 hectares actually occupied by herein appellants. We 
repeat that the P2,000.00 counterbond would have been clearly inadequate for the 
protection of the appellants.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Court of appeals is hereby 
reversed, and the order of the trial court of February 17, 1953, appointing a 
receiver is affirmed, with costs.</p>
