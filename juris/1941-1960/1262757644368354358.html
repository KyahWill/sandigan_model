				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On  May 10, 1956 respondent  Hao  Giok San filed with the Court of First Instance of Cebu, 14th Judicial District, then presided by respondent Hon. Judge Jose S. Rodriguez, a  complaint  against the  petitioner  herein, docketed as Civil Case No. R—4514, to secure an order enjoining the petitioner, his agents, subordinates  and other  persons acting in his  behalf, to perpetually refrain from affecting the collection  of the deficiency percentage taxes, surcharges or penalties and compromise in the total amount of P3,625 and from levying on  execution  any of  his property to satisfy the  aforesaid  deficiency  percentage   taxes,  surcharges  and  compromise  and,   after trial,  to make the writ of preliminary injunction issued  during  the pendency of the proceeding permanent and perpetual.  On the same date,  pursuant to  the prayer of  the complaint  and  upon filing by the plaintiff therein of a bond in the amount of P3,625,  the respondent Judge issued, ex-parte, a  writ of preliminary injunction.  Thereupon, on May 26, 1956, petitioner herein filed a  motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Court of First Instance of  Cebu lacked jurisdiction to try it, and  prayed for  the lifting  of the preliminary injunction issued  thereunder.  Upon  opposition of Hao  Giok  San, this motion was  denied  by the respondent Judge. Petition  for reconsideration  was  filed, but it was likewise dismissed. Hence petitioner initiated the present petition to secure from this  Court a  writ of prohibition (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) to  restrain respondent Judge, Hon. Jose S. Rodriguez, from taking  cognizance of the aforesaid  Civil Case No. R—4514, for lack of jurisdiction over its  subject matter; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) to secure  a  preliminary injunction to  prevent said respondent Judge  from  enforcing  the   preliminary injunction  issued in said civil case; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) after hearing, to make permanent the writ   of  preliminary injunction which may be issued  by this Court. <br><br>The record shows that on November 12, 1955, the Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue, Jose Arañas, sent to herein respondent the following communication:<br><blockquote>"From the report submitted to this  Office, it  appears that you have short  paid the  correct percentage  taxes covered  by Official Receipts  Nos. 218120, 704226, 699013, and 709019, dated April  20, 1955, July 20, 1964, April 20, 1954  and October 20,  1964, respectively, in the  total amount of  P2,900. Adding thereto the  25% surcharge for late payment, there is, therefore, due  from  you the sum of P3,625. <br><br>"You are  hereby demanded to pay the said  amount of P3,625, together  with the sum of P50.00 as  compromise for  late payment, or a total  of P3,675  within ten days from  your receipt  of  this letter. <br><br>"Please be warned  that your  failure to pay the aforementioned tax and  surcharge in the total amount of P3,625  together  with the suggested compromise of P50 within the period indicated above will constrain this office to enforce  the collection of the  tax and surcharge by the  summary remedies  provided  for  by law  and at the same time recommend your  prosecution in court  for  violation  of  section 183,  penalized under section  209, both of the National Internal Revenue Code."</blockquote>On  November 21,  1955, respondent Hao Giok San, thru counsel, wrote  the Deputy  Collector that  he had paid in full the correct percentage taxes for  the  period  referred to in  the aforequoted letter, and denied any  outstanding liability or deficiency in the payment of  said percentage taxes.  On December 19,  Deputy Collector Arañas wrote back demanding payment of the deficiency taxes, to which respondent Hao Giok San answered insisting that he has paid religiously all his  taxes to  the government  starting from the date he engaged in business up to the date of his letter, and reiterated his contention that he owes nothing to the  Government of the  Philippines by way of taxes; and in order to prevent the herein petitioner from collecting the  disputed  deficiency  taxes  and  levying  or distraining any property of the respondent Hao Giok San in satisfaction of said taxes, the latter initiated the aforesaid Civil Case  No. R—4514  in the Court of First Instance of Cebu.<br><br>As could be  readily  seen,  the main  question  we are called  upon to  decide is whether the respondent Judge, or more exactly, the  Court of First Instance of Cebu, has jurisdiction to try the aforesaid civil case where the matter involved is the collection of the deficiency percentage taxes from respondent Hao Giok San  and its enforcement by means of levy and distraint of respondent's properties in accordance  with the National  Internal Revenue  Code. Essentially, in said civil case, respondent  Hao Giok San sought to review the  actuation of the herein petitioner on the aforesaid collection of taxes and, for this reason,  petitioner claims that the Court of First Instance of Cebu has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of said civil case, contending that the question involved therein should be  brought on appeal, not to the Court of First Instance of Cebu, but to the Court of Tax Appeals in view of Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, which provides: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jurisdiction</span>.-The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive  appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided— <br><br>"(1)  Decisions of the Collector of Internal  Revenue in eases involving disputed  assessments,  refunds of internal  revenue  taxes, fees or  other charges, penalties imposed  in relation  thereto, or other matters arising  under  the National  Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;"</blockquote> Upon careful  examination of Appendix A of the petition, which is the complaint filed by  Hao Giok San in Civil Case No. R—4514,  we clearly find that therein  Hao  Giok San seeks not only to contest  the right of petitioner  to collect the deficiency percentage taxes, surcharges and compromise in question,  but also the legality or propriety of the levy by distraint on his properties, if same  is resorted to,  all of which should really be brought on appeal to  the Court of Tax Appeals, in view  of  the  aforequoted Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125. <br><br>It is our considered opinion that  the determination of the correctness or  incorrectness  of  a tax assessment to which the taxpayer is not agreeable falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals and not of the Court of First Instance, for under the aforequoted provision of law, the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review on appeal any decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue in  cases involving disputed assessments and other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. <br><br>Wherefore, petition is granted and the respondent Judge, Hon. Jose S. Rodriguez, is hereby prohibited  from further taking cognizance  of Civil Case No. R—4514;  his orders mentioned in the petition are hereby set  aside, and the preliminary injunction issued in this case made permanent, with costs against the respondent Hao Giok San. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
