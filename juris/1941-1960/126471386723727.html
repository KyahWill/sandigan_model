				<H3>INTERWOOD EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION,  PETITIONER, VS. INTERNATIONAL HARDWOOD  & VENEER COMPANY  OF  THE PHILIPPINES  (INTERWOOD), RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is a  petition filed under Rule 44 of the  Rules of Court to  have a  decision of the Court of Industrial Relations  dated 2 October 1953  and a resolution  dated 13 November 1953 denying the  motion for  reconsideration thereof reviewed,  reversed  and set  aside  and  the case remanded  to the  trial  court  for  further procedings  and determination  in  accordance  with law.   The decision of the Court of Industrial  Relations   declared  illegal  the strike staged by the members of the petitioner on 9 March 1953, because itvwas "for trivial, unreasonable and unjust purpose," and authorized the respondent to dismiss the strikers and  employ  others  for the operation of  the respondent's plant, except those who  had returned  and were allowed to work by the management of the respondent.</p>
<p>The  petitioner  alleges  and  contends  that the  strike staged on  9 March 1953 was a protest against the action of the  respondent in  separating from its  services  Enrique  L.  Marcelo, the  association president; that  a strike by members of a labor union  is but  a lawful exercise of their right  recognized by law  for the  purpose of rendering to  themselves  mutual aid or protection; that even assuming that Marcelo was separated for cause, still  the strike declared by  the members of the  petitioner aimed at his reinstatement  under an  erroneous belief  that  his discharge  was discriminatory is a protected activity;  and that the discharge of  Marcelo by the respondent was without any justifiable  cause.</p>
<p>The answer of the respondent is that Enrique L. Marcelo was not separated or discharged from his employment in the respondent's plant because of union  activities  but that he voluntarily resigned his position as  supervisor of the "Green End" section  of the  respondent's plant, which resignation was accepted  by the management of the respondent.</p>
<p>The Court of Industrial Relations found the following—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From  the evidence as well as  the  circumstances  surrounding this case, it appears that Mr. Enrique  Marcelo, president of the Interwood Employees Association, was originally employed by the petitioner since July 26,  1949, as  shop  helper with  a  daily com pertsation of P3; that since then he was holding different positions in the company and was likewise  given several increases in  pay corresponding to the position he holds;  that  up to December 10, 1952, he was holding the position of  Shift Engineer in the powerhouse; that on December 11, 1953, up to March 7, 1953, when he (Marcelo)  was separated from the company, he  was working as Supervisor in the  Green  End  (Exhibits "K"  and  "L"); that th« duties of Supervisor and that of Shift Engineer are different from each other; that his salary as Supervisor in  the Green End  was P7.15 (Exhibits "M" and "N"); that  as Supervisor he was directly working  under Mr.  Dalmacio,  the  Chief Engineer  (p.  32,  t.s.n., hearing of If arch 27, 1953); that from  December 11, 1952,  up to March 6, 1953, when he sent  his  letter of resignation,  he made several  requests  to  work overtime during  Sundays  to  clean  the boilers in the powerhouse  (Exhibits "P", "S" and "V");  that  on August  30 and on September  12 and 16, 1952, the  International Hardwood  &amp;  Veneer Company paid  Mr. Marcelo  the  amount  of PI ,200 for  replenishment of depleted  union  funds as  requested  by the officers of the respondent association  (Exhibit  "FF"); that notwithstanding the policy of the company not  to allow personal vales, except  in  emergency cases,  Mr.  William Murphy,  General Manager of  the  company  extended vale to Mr. Marcelo  in  the amount  of P60 from  his personal fund  (Exhibit "EE"); that  the company at  times has  to  adopt  the  rotation system for  lack  of glue and logs; that  his letter of  resignation  was duly accepted by the General Manager (Exhibit "D");  that the General Manager, Mr.  W.  B.  Murphy,  informed  Marcelo that  the position from which he resigned  on March 6,  1953, has  been abolished  on  the same  date  when he resigned  for  reasons of economy  and efficiency (Exhibit "J"); that  there is also  no vacancy  in the powerhouse (Exhibit "D"); that  after he  (Marcelo) was informed that there is also no  vacancy in the powerhouse, he sent a note to the Superintendent of the. Company that he wanted to  go back and work as  Supervisor  (Exhibit  "Z");  that Mr.  Marcelo was  advised  by the Management  to hold their meeting at  noon and  not during working  hours;  that contrary to the advice of  the  management the  association  held their  meeting  during office hours,  thereby stopping their work except the press department  (Exhibit  "H"); that  there were  some  incidents or  unusual happenings  wherein the strikers prevented the deliveries of plywoods to some customers of the company, namely: Manila  Lumber (t.s.n., pp. 76-78, hearing of April 10, 1953); Baguio Bus  (pp. 71-73, hearing of April  10, 1953; pp.  7-20,  hearing of April  13, 1953; and Exhibit "GG"); and Dy  Pac &amp; Company (pp.  73-76, hearing of  April 13, 1953); that when the strike was declared  the power plant stopped  operations; that during the  strike no. arrest  was made because  the  incidents  did not  amount to a crime  (t.s.n., pp.  29-30, hearing of April  13,  1953); that  the  strike was  declared because  of  the refusal  of  the management to reemploy  Mr.  Marcelo  in the service of  the  company;  and that many of those who joined  the strike have  already returned  to work  (Exhibit "II").</p>
  <p>On the claim of  the  respondent in  its answer that the dismissal of  Mr.  Enrique  Marcelo,  president  of  the Interwood  Employees Association, was  due to union activities, the Court finds not even an iota of evidence  to  substantiate the  same.  On the other hand, there is  an overwhelming evidence that Marcelo's separation from the service of the company is because of his voluntary resignation which  was duly  accepted  by the management.  There could have been no  motive for  the company to  sever his (Marcelo's)  employment with the company because  from  the  time Case No.  601-V was  settled,  up  to  March  6, 1953, when  he  sent  his  letter  of resignation  (Exhibit "A"),  there was  no dispute  whatsoever between  the  petitioner  and. the respondent.  The fact that the petitioning Company replenished the depleted funds of the Interwood Employees Association  in the amount of Pl,200  and  the fact that the  General  Manager  of  the Company extended personal  "vale" out  of his personal fund  to Mr. Marcelo notwithstanding  that  it is against  the policy of the management  to give personal  "vales" except in emergency cases, are convincing proofs that the company has  nothing against the association nor  against  Mr. Marcelo, President of the Interwood Employees  Association.   Hence, the claim of Mr.  Marcelo  that he was dismissed  on account  of union activities, is entirely  groundless.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Marcelo  also  claims  that his  letter of  resignation (Exhibit "A") was  misinterpreted by the management.   From the contents of Exhibit "A"  there  could  be  no  other meaning from the sentence "I am  resigning  from my present post as Supervisor effective  March 7, 1953," except that as  used  in ordinary parlance, he is quitting or  giving up  his  present  position  effective March  7, 1953.  The letter of resignation being clear and concise, it  should be taken in  its  face value.  Marcelo in his letter of resignation also  gave his reason why he is  resigning from his present position and  signified his desire or  intention to work in  the powerhouse.</p>
  <p>Here,  Marcelo wanted to assign himself to the powerhouse. The question  of transfer and assignment  of  employees or  laborers from one  section or  department  to  another is  purely  an  act  of the management  which Mr.  Marcelo  cannot  impose upon  the company, otherwise,  if he  will be allowed to do so,  it  would undoubtedly encroach upon the  managerial functions of  the  management.  Mr. Marcelo, in order to justify his contention that his  letter  of resignation was  misinterpreted by  the  management,  claims that aside from his  position  as  Supervisor  of the  Green End, he  is also  in charge of the powerhouse.  If it is true  that  he is working both as  Supervisor  and as  in charge  of the powerhouse,  then  it is absurd  to claim  that he  is  resigning  from  the  position  of Supervisor, and that he  is  going to work in the powerhouse, for the reason that there is no  necessity for him to ask the management  that  he will occupy  the  position to which he  claimed  to  be the' actual  occupant.  The truth and the  fact  is. that Marcelo before his resignation as Supervisor  in the Green End was  a Shift  Engineer  in the  powerhouse,  and from  the  time he was designated  as  Supervisor  since  December  11,  1952,  there were some  Sundays that he worked  overtime  in  the  powerhouse  cleaning the  boilers,  upon his own  requests. The service  records  of Mr. Marcelo as well  as the payrolls of  the company  duly  signed by him clearly show that since  December 11, 1952, he was already working as Supervisor and  not as  in charge of  the  powerhouse. Besides, the duties and nature of the  work of a Shift Engineer and that of a Supervisor  in  the  Green End are  entirely  different from each other, such  that  (those) jobs cannot be ordinarily  performed by one man.</p>
  <p>Even granting, just for the  sake  of argument, that  there was really  a misinterpretation of  the letter of resignation (Exhibit "A"), and  because of this, the management refused to readmit Mr. Marcelo, notwithstanding the request made  to  that  effect, is this a sufficient cause for  the members to declare a strike?   As lengthily  discussed  above,  Mr.  Marcelo was  not dismissed   for  union activities.  If  he  was  separated from the service of the company, it was because of his voluntary resignation which was duly accepted by the management.  If the  management refuses to  reemploy him, it is merely acting in  the exercise of its  prerogative.  What  would have been the proper step  for Mr. Marcelo to take before declaring the strike was to bring the  matter to this  Court  and  ask for his reinstatement, as  the exercise by the management of its prerogatives is basically subject to the  regulation  of the  State,  to wit:</p>
  <p>"The right  of  an  employer  to freely  select and  discharge  his employees is subject  to regulation by the  State basically  in  the exercise of its paramount  police power (Commonwealth  Acts Nos. 103 and 213)  . .  . and in  cases where the suspension or dismissal of an  employee  is whimsical or unjustified or is otherwise  illegal, the employee will be protected.  (Manila  Trading &amp; Supply Co. <em>vs.</em> Zulueta,  et al.  G. R. No.  46853;  Manila  Electric  Company  <em>vs.</em> National Labor Union, Inc.,  G. R. No. 47279; Manila  Trading &amp; Supply Co. <em>vs.</em> Philippine Labor Union, G. R. No. 47486.)"</p>
  <p>Mr.  Marcelo without resorting  to  some pacific means and processes  prevailed upon  the  members  of the  Association   to declare a strike simply because he was harboring  the belief that he was illegally dismissed.  A strike as a weapon of labor  must be used judiciously.  It should be used in redress  of just and lawful  grievances and not to be used whimsically or capriciously  even by the President  of the union who caused the  strike to be declared in protest of his fancied notion that he was  dismissed by  the management on account of union activities.  To the  mind of the Court, after careful study of the evidence as well as the facts and circumstances of this  case, the  reason, cause or motive of  the  strike declared on  March  9,  1953,  is trivial,  unreasonable and not sufficient to  justify a general  strike  which hampered the operation of the company.  In the  case of Luzon Marine Department Union <em>vs.</em>  Arsenio   C.  Roldan,  G.  R.  No.  L-2660,  the  Supreme  Court        i said:</p>
  <p>"That there is no provision of law, decision, ruling or doctrine which provides that a strike called for such a purpose  is against  the law.  We have adverted to the ruling of this Court in Rex Taxi cab Company <em>vs.</em>  Court of Industrial Relations, supra, that in cases not  falling within the prohibition against strikes, the legality of a strike depends, first, upon  the purpose for which it is  maintained, and,  second, upon the means employed  in  carrying it on. <em>Thus, if the purpose  which  the  laborers intend to accomplish  by means of a strike is trivial, unreasonable or unjust</em> (as in the case of the National  Labor Union, Inc. <em>vs.</em> Manila Gas  Corporation,  40 Off.  Gaz.,  37), <em>the  strike, although not prohibited by injunction, may be declared by the Court illegal, with the adverse consequences to the strikers."</em>  (Italics  supplied.)</p>
  <p>On the  allegation of the petitioners that the strike  was carried out with threats and intimidation, the Court finds that as a whole, the strike was conducted  in  a peaceful  and  orderly manner.  Although  the  union  picketed  the premises before, the permit  to picket was issued  and that there were  some  incidents  that  happened during the strike, these incidents did not amount to a  crime (t.s.n., pp. 29-30,  hearing of April 13,  1953).  (Decision of the Court of Industrial Relations dated 2 October 1953, Annex "C".)</p>
  <p>These  findings  cannot be  reviewed by, and are binding upon, this  Court.  It  is then clear  that the president  of  the  petitioner, a  labor  union,  was  not  separated or  dismissed from his  employment  in the respondent's  plant because of  union activities.  He  resigned.   The  resignation was accepted.  Resignation is not  synonymous  with separation  or  dismissal.  In his letter  of resignation he  stated or expressed the wish to  be returned to his former position as  shift engineer  in the powerhouse  which he, at that time,  did not  hold, because the job held by  him and  the one  to which he  wanted  to  be transferred or returned were two different positions.   Marcelo's  pretension which amounted to an imposition upon the respondent cannot  and should not be  countenanced and  sustained. There was  no vacancy in  the  powerhouse  to which he could be transferred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There remains only the point whether a  strike staged by members of a labor union may  be  declared illegal by the court if the striking members  of  the union believed in, good faith that they were  so  striking  because  of a grievance against the  management.   If the determination whether a strike is legal or illegal  were to depend  upon the reason or motive,  no matter how groundless or  false it may be,  the striking members  of a labor  union  had in mind or  believed in good faith at the time they staged the strike, there would then be no  need for the court to pass  upon that question, because what the strikers  had in mind or  believed in good faith at the time  they struck can  hardly be refuted,  rebutted  or  disproved.  If the Court of  Industrial Relations were bound to believe and so find  what the striking members of a labor union allege or claim to be the reason  or motive for their staging a strike, because as claimed  by the petitioner the right of the  members  of  a labor union to  strike for  mutual aid or  protection, as preconized in section 3,  Republic Act No.  875, is an absolute right, then  there would no longer be  any necessity  for  holding  or  conducting  a hearing, where both parties to the  controversy may present  their proofs  and upon which the Court is to determine which of the  claims  or contentions is true, correct and lawful, as  disclosed by the evidence before  it. Parenthetically, Republic Act  No.  875 took effect on 17 June 1953.   The strike held  illegal was staged by the members of the  petitioner on 9 March 1958.  The Act cannot be invoked and applied  to  a strike staged before  the  Act  took  effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Nevertheless, such right to strike for mutual aid or protection is not absolute.  It  comes into being and is safeguarded by law if and when the act or acts intended to render mutual  aid  or protection to affiliates of a labor union arise from a lawful  ground,  reason or motive.  If the motive be  lawful, any act that would  tend to give such mutual  aid or protection  should and must be protected and  upheld  But if  the  motive that  had impelled, prompted, moved or  led members  of  a labor  union  or organization  to stage a strike, even if  they had acted in good faith in  staging it,  be unlawful  illegitimate,  unjust, unreasonable or trivial,  and the Court of  Industrial Relations, the  agency entrusted  by the Government to determine it, finds it  so, then the strike may be declared illegal.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  Court of Industrial  Relations of 2 October  1953 and  the resolution  denying the  motion for reconsideration  thereof dated 13 November 1953 appealed from are affirmed, with costs  against the  petitioner.</p>

<p><strong>REYES, J. B. L., J., </strong>with whom <strong>PARAS, C. J., BAUTISTA</strong> and <strong>CONCEPCION, JJ.:</strong></p>
<p>I fully concur with the  majority in  its view that  Enrique Marcelo's conduct was unjustifiable  and that  he was  properly dismissed; but  regret not being  able  to assent to  the dismissal of the other  strikers, for this extreme penalty  seems  to  me  excessive  under the  circumstances of  record.  Where  unemploymnt is rife,  as at present, dismissal may  mean risk  of starvation  for the laborers  and their families.</p>
<p>It is practically conceded,,  and there  is  no showing otherwise, that the labor union declared the strike in the honest belief  that  Marcelo  had been  dismissed  because of union activities, and no unlawful means were employed. Such action can not be regarded as trivial, illegal or unreasonable :  defense of its members goes to the very root of a union's reason for existence  (cf.  Philippine Education Co.  <em>vs.</em> C. I. R. Ir-7156,  May 31,  1955).  I concede that, the strike was injudicious  and hasty, since no serious attempt was made  to ascertain the side  of management. But it seems  to me  that reinstatement without backpay would  have been a sufficient stern sanction for such inconsiderate  action and  a reminder against its  repetition in the  future.</p>
<p>Nor  is the guilt of  the  union  in acting without  due inquiry upon the biased report of its president  (Marcelo) too serious or unprecedented an offense.   Our experience is that precipitate  action  upon  one-sided reports  is not confined  to labor unions.  The truth is that if in labor capital conflicts  labor is often  too quick to conclude that every move of management  is an attempt to grind it back to slavery,  so are capital and management much too pre- disposed to view  every petition  of  labor as unjustified demand and harassing  insolence.  Save rare and  honorable exceptions, both sides appear to suffer from emotional infantilism.</p>
<p>In the present case  it does  not appear that management endeavoured to  present the true facts to the union. Had it done  so, the strike would  have probably  been averted,  for  a laborer  does not take lightly to the suspension of the  earnings upon which he  and his  family depend for their living.  No doubt it will be argued that it was incumbent upon the union to ascertain the true facts;  that  management was  not called  upon  to  make explanations, but had the right to  stand upon its dignity. I am  not sure that this view  is correct.  Blame for not seeking  a reasonable compromise  can not be  apportioned equally between labor and management, but in my opinion should  weigh more against  the latter.  Not because of any doctrinarian prejudice  but simply because management counts in its ranks the more educated and enlightened men, expected to possess tolerance and vision; and higher education  should shoulder heavier  responsibility.  Every member of society must contribute to the common welfare according  to his abilities.  Justice (and specially  social justice)  is not  equality  but proportion.</p>
