				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Asserting that they are the registered owners of two parcels  of  land  and the  improvements erected  thereon located in the district  of Sampaloc, city of Manila, described in transfer certificate of title Nos. 27091 and 27092 issued in their  name,  the plaintiffs, husband and  wife, brought this action against the Sheriff and chief deputy Sheriff of Manila and the Register of Deeds of Manila to secure a declaration that they are the owners in fee simple of  the  parcels of land described in the third paragraph of  their complaint  together  with  the  improvements existing thereon and  that the  attachment levied upon the aforesaid two  parcels of land and improvements thereon by the Sheriff and his chief deputy and the memorandum thereof  entered  upon the certificates by the Register of Deeds are illegal; and an order directing the Register of Deeds of Manila to cancel the attachment  memorandum on the certificates of title and the Sheriff and chief deputy Sheriff of Manila to pay jointly and severally to the plaintiffs  the sum of P10,000 as  liquidated  damages together with  lawful interest thereon  from the  date of the filing of  the complaint until paid, and all the  defendants to pay costs.  In suport of their prayer  they allege that  on  5 September  1951  they acquired the two parcels of land and improvements thereon from  the spouses Manuel B.  Doce and Victoria Golfardo y Rocha without knowledge of any flaw  or defect in the latter's title; that on 1 November 1951 pursuant  to an order  of the Justice  of  the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, entered in criminal case  No. 445, the Sheriff and chief deputy Sheriff attached the two  parcels of land and improvements thereon by filing with the office of the  Register of Deeds of Manila the aforesaid order of the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa; that the  Register  of Deeds of Manila entered a memorandum  of such attachment upon  transfer certificates of title  Nos.  27091 and 27092; that upon learning of the attachment they promptly filed on 4 February 1952 their third party claim with  the Sheriffs and a motion in the Court of First Instance of Palawan, to which criminal case No. 445 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa had  been  forwarded, praying  for the discharge of the attachment; and that the Sheriffs refused to release the two parcels of  land  and improvements  thereon  from the  levy upon attachment.</p>
<p>The defendants deny that the plaintiffs are the true and legitimate owners of the two parcels  of land and the improvements erected thereon,  the true fact being that the conveyance of the two parcels of land and improvements thereon to the plaintiffs  by Manuel B. Doce and his wife Victoria Golfardo y Rocha, the previous registered owners, was a simulated sale to defraud his creditors, for prior to the sale Manuel B. Doce, one of the vendors, who was the cashier  in the office of the Provincial Treasurer of  Palawan, was  being investigated for malversation of about P1,000,000 belonging  to  the  Republic of  the Philippines committed during the period  from 1 June 1950 to  August 1951; and allege that the fictitious conveyance was  made on  5 September 1951, or a few days before the filing on 17  September 1951 of a complaint  for  malversation of public funds against Manuel  B. Doce  in the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa, Palawan; that the Sheriffs did not act in bad  faith in attaching the two parcels of land because they merely complied with the writ of attachment issued on 18 October 1951 by the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa in  criminal case No. 445; and that there was another case pending in the Court of  First Instance of Palawan for the same  cause as  alleged by the plaintiffs in the eighth paragraph of  their complaint Upon these allegations they  pray that the complaint be dismissed; and that the purchase and  sale  between the plaintiffs and  Manuel B.  Doce and  Victoria  Golfardo  y Rocha being fictitious and simulated and  having been made to defraud the creditors of the vendors, particularly the Republic of the Philippines, be declared null and void. <br><br>Evidence was presented by the plaintiffs  tending to show that they had the  means and were in a position to acquire the two parcels  of land and  their improvements; and by the defendants, that the sale was simulated as the criminal case for malversation of  public funds was then about  to be brought against one of the  vendors and the vendees were not in a position to acquire  the parcels of land as shown by  their income tax returns prior to the purchase.</p>
<p>After trial the Court rendered judgment  dismissing the plaintiffs complaint without any special pronouncement as to costs.  The  Court did not pass upon the  main issue involved  in the case because it  was  of the opinion that it was not within  its province  to  grant the relief prayed for by the plaintiffs.  According to the Court there was no need for a declaration of ownership of the two parcels of land and their improvements inasmuch as  no one claimed adverse title thereto,  the  plaintiffs being  the registered owners thereof.  Furthermore, as the  plaintiffs prayed that the attachment of their two parcels of land and improvements thereon be declared illegal because  it had been done  in bad  faith  and  that   the  Register  of Deeds be directed to cancel the memorandum of the attachment on their transfer certificates of title, the question, according to the Court, involved the legality and  propriety of the writ of attachment issued by the Justice  of the Peace Court  of Puerto  Princesa, subsequently upheld  by  the Court  of First Instance  of Palawan in criminal case  No. 1457, into  and upon which it could not  inquire and  pass because  it had been  issued  by  a coordinate court.  If the plaintiffs, the Court added, sought  the discharge of the attachment, they should seek it in the Court of First Instance of Palawan instead of going to a court of equal jurisdiction.  As to the claim for liquidated damages, the Court held that it was unfounded because the defendant Sheriffs attached the two parcels of land  and improvements thereon in compliance with and in the performance of their ministerial duty of enforcing the writ of attachment issued  on  18  October 1951 by the  Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa in criminal case No. 445. However, the Court found that upon a plea of guilty on 27 June 1952 Manuel B. Doce, the cashier  in the office of the Provincial  Treasurer of Palawan,  was sentenced to suffer an  indeterminate penalty from 10 years of prision mayor, as minimum, to 14 years and  8 months of reclusion temporal, as  maximum, to  pay a fine of F546,054.65, to indemnify the  Province of Palawan  in  the  sum  of P1,092,109.30,  to suffer perpetual special  disqualification and to pay the  costs.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs  appealed to  this Court from the judgment thus rendered.</p>
<p>The main issue as framed by the  pleadings and joined by the parties  from which  the other  issues flow or are drawn being whether the plaintiffs are the true and legitimate owners of the two parcels of land and improvements theron, the defendants alleging and claiming that the sale of the two parcels  of land and  improvements existing thereon  made by the former owner  to the plaintiffs was simulated to defraud his creditors, particularly the Republic of the Philippines, the trial court committed an error when it held that, as  no  one claimed adverse  title thereto, the plaintiffs  being  the registered  owners  thereof, there was no need for a declaration  as to who  are the true and real owners of the parcels of land and improvements thereon. There  was an  adverse claim against the  title  of the plaintiffs to the  parcels  of land and improvements  thereon which were attached by virtue of a writ issued by the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa in criminal case No. 445.  The  Court did not determine or decide the controversy between the parties which it had to or was bound to  do.  Upon the filing of the  complaint  for malversation  of public  funds against  Manuel  B. Doce, one of the former  registered owners of the parcels  of land, the other  being his wife, the Justice of the Peace  Court of Puerto Princesa issued the writ of attachment (criminal case No.  445)  and after the  case  was forwarded to  the Court of First Instance of Palawan, the  said  writ of attachment  was  sustained and upheld by  the Court in criminal case No. 1457.</p>
<p>Another reason given by the trial court is to the effect that the legality  of the writ of attachment issued by the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa, upheld by the  Court of First  Instance  of Palawan, being directly involved in the case, it was improper for it as a coordinate of the Court of First Instance of Palawan to  inquire into the propriety of the issuance of that writ and that if the plaintiffs  sought  the  discharge of the attachment  they should seek relief in the Court of First  Instance of  Palawan.  If the trial court was competent and it was its duty to decide the main issue already adverted to,  the point of  legality  or  propriety  of the issuance of the writ of attachment  as  a  corollary thereto was properly  before it and had to be passed upon and decided by it.   In passing it may not be amiss to state  that Rule 122-A,  which is Republic Act No. 240 approved on 12 June 1948, authorizes the attachment of the property of a defendant charged with malversation of public funds.</p>
<p>The venue of the action for a declaration of ownership of  the two parcels of land and  improvements thereon was properly laid in the Court of First Instance of Manila where the two parcels of  land are located and where the plaintiffs and the defendants resided.</p>
<p>The pronouncement that the claim for liquidated damages was unfounded is correct, because the defendant Sheriffs attached the two parcels of land and improvements thereon in compliance with  the writ of attachment issued on 18 October 1951 by the Justice of the Peace Court of Puerto Princesa in criminal case No. 445.</p>
<p>Upon the evidence presented the trial court should make a finding as to whether or not the sale of the two parcels of land and improvements thereon made on 5 September 1951 by Manuel B.  Doce and his wife Victoria  Golfardo y Rocha in favor of the plaintiffs was  simulated  and whether it was  done in  order to defraud his creditors.</p>
<p>The dismissal of  the  complaint upon the two grounds stated by the trial  court being erroneous,  the judgment appealed from dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint is  set aside and the case  remanded to the  Court of First  Instance of Manila with instructions to render judgment upon the evidence presented by the parties,  without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
