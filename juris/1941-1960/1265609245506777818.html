				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari which seeks to set aside the decision of respondent referee-rendered on November 29, 1954 ordering the Director of Public Works to pay to the claimant the sum of&nbsp; P4,000 as compensation for the death of one Napoleon Alvaro, as well as the order of said referee&nbsp; entered on June 3, 1955 denying the petitions for relief filed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines.<p>On August 26, 1952, somewhere at Quezon Boulevard Extension, Quezon City,&nbsp; one Anicetas M.&nbsp; Yco, a&nbsp; project engineer, shot Napoleon Alvaro as the latter attempted to strike the former with a&nbsp; hammer, resulting in the death of Alvaro, for. which killing, Yco&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquitted&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; of self-defense in a decision rendered by the Court of First Instance of Quezon City on November 2, 1953.</p><p>On September 29, 1952, Filomena Mendoza, on her own behalf as widow of the deceased and on behalf of her minor children, Maria Corazon and Napoleon, Jr., filed a claim with&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Commission&nbsp; against Segundo Villacorta, as the employer of the&nbsp; decease Napoleon Alvaro, claiming compensation for the latter's death under Act No. 3428.&nbsp; Segundo Villacorta was made a party respondent because he entered into a contract with the Director of Public&nbsp; Works to construct the right lane of the Quezon Boulevard Project&nbsp; where the incident took place in accordance with&nbsp; certain plans and specifications.</p><p>On January 19, 1954, the claimant, through her counsel, amended her&nbsp; claim by including for the first time the Director of Public Works as party respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing held before referee&nbsp; Ernesto&nbsp; P. Hernando, Atty. Generoso Candelario appeared for the Director of&nbsp; Public Works and questioned the legality of including said Director as party respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This objection was disregarded. On November 29,&nbsp; 1954, the referee rendered his decision holding that (1) Segundo Villacorta is not an independent (Contractor;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Segundo Villacorta is not liable for the compensation sought for&nbsp; by the claimant;&nbsp; (3) the contract between the Director of Public Works and Segundo Villacorta, in so far as it exempts the government from the compensation of death benefits, is contrary to law; and (4)&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Public&nbsp; Works is&nbsp; liable&nbsp; to pay the compensation in&nbsp; question.&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; he&nbsp; ordered the latter to pay the claimant a compensation in&nbsp; the amount of P4,000.</p><p>Copy of the decision was served on the Director of Public Works on December 27, 1954, although long&nbsp; before that date, or&nbsp; on July&nbsp; 1, 1954, the Division of Highways of the Bureau, of Public Works which was formerly in charge of the construction of public roads was abolished, and its powers,&nbsp; duties and functions were transferred&nbsp; to the Bureau of Public Highways, headed by a Commissioner, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1192.&nbsp;&nbsp; As no substitution was made of the proper official&nbsp; despite&nbsp; the&nbsp; creation of the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Highways, copy of&nbsp; the decision was transmitted&nbsp; to the Commissioner of Public Highways only on January&nbsp; 13, 1955, who in turn transmitted&nbsp; the same to the&nbsp; Solicitor General with the&nbsp; request&nbsp; that the&nbsp; latter represent said official under Section 1661 of the Revised Administrative Code.</p><p>Shortly after the receipt of the copy&nbsp; of the decision by the Solicitor General, the latter filed on February 2, 1955 a "Petition to Disregard Service&nbsp; of Referee's Decision of this Honorable Commission&nbsp; to the Director,&nbsp; Bureau of Public Works and&nbsp; to Substitute Proper Party Respondent" alleging, among other things, that by virtue of the abolition of the Division of Public Highways of the Bureau of Public Works, and the creation in lieu&nbsp; thereof of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau of Public Highways, the decision of the referees should have been served on the Commissioner of Public Highways instead of the Director of Public Works, and&nbsp; in view of that mistake, service of the&nbsp; decision was made on the Solicitor General more than 15 days after its receipt by the Director of Public Works which&nbsp; made it impossible for him to take within the legal period such step as may be necessary to secure the review of the decision, for which reason the Solicitor General prayed that all the proceedings so far had as may affect the government be dismissed. And on March 23, 1955, the Solicitor General filed with the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission a&nbsp; suppletory&nbsp; petition praying that&nbsp; the decision be set aside on&nbsp; the ground of mistake and excusable negligence and that a new trial be granted the government.&nbsp; The referee, on June 3, 1955, denied both&nbsp; petitions.&nbsp; Hence&nbsp; the present petition for certiorari.</p><p>The question to be determined is whether the Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; is&nbsp; an indispensable&nbsp; party&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case&nbsp; such that, not&nbsp; having been given an&nbsp; opportunity to be heard,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; respondent referee should be considered as&nbsp; having been&nbsp; rendered in excess of his jurisdiction.</p><p>The pertinent provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act,&nbsp; as amended by Republic Act No.&nbsp; 722, in so far as they may have&nbsp; a bearing on the liability&nbsp; of&nbsp; the government, are those embodied in sections 3 and 53 which in substance provide that the provisions regarding compensation therein contemplated&nbsp; shall&nbsp; also be&nbsp; applicable "to the employees and laborers employed in public works and in the industrial concerns of the Government&nbsp; and&nbsp; to all other persons performing&nbsp; manual labor in&nbsp; the service of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Government and its political&nbsp; subdivisions and instrumentalities"&nbsp; (section 3),&nbsp; and that the national government "shall deposit with the office of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner&nbsp; an amount to&nbsp; be determined by said Commissioner to guarantee payment of compensation" (section 53).&nbsp; For ready reference, we are quoting hereunder the two sections above referred&nbsp; to:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 3.<em> Applicable to Government</em>.—This Act shall also&nbsp; be applicable to mounted messengers&nbsp; in the service of&nbsp; the National Government and all its political subdivisions and to the employees and laborers employed&nbsp; in public works and in the industrial concerns of the Government and to all&nbsp; other&nbsp; persons&nbsp; performing manual labor&nbsp; in the service of the National Government&nbsp; and its political subdivisions&nbsp; and instrumentalities: Provided,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; That laborers and employees&nbsp; insured with the Government Service Insurance System, and their dependents when entitled to the benefits of the said&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; System shall,&nbsp; in addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the same be entitled to the benefits granted&nbsp; by this Act."&nbsp; </p><p>"Sec. 53. <em>Deposits&nbsp; of government entities&nbsp; to guarantee payment of compensation</em>.—The&nbsp; National,&nbsp; provincial and municipal governments, as well as government-owned or controlled&nbsp; corporations employing laborers and employees comprised within the&nbsp; provisions of this Act shall deposit&nbsp; with the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner an amount&nbsp; to be&nbsp; determined&nbsp; by&nbsp; said Commissioner to guarantee payment&nbsp; of compensation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; said deposits shall&nbsp; be receive by the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; and disbursed,&nbsp; thru the authority&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; or&nbsp; his deputy,&nbsp; as&nbsp; compensation payments to injured laborers of the government entities making the contribution or the laborers' dependents in cases of death whenever the said laborers or their dependents are entitled to&nbsp; compensation under the&nbsp; provisions of this&nbsp; Act."</p></blockquote><p>From the above it clearly appears that the&nbsp; benefits of the Compensation Act&nbsp; equally apply with the&nbsp; same&nbsp; force and extent to all the employees and laborers employed in public&nbsp; works&nbsp; of the national government and&nbsp; its political subdivisions with the particularity that the law expressly enjoins that to make&nbsp; effective the payment of such compensation the government must&nbsp; deposit such&nbsp; amount as may&nbsp; be determined by the&nbsp; Commissioner with the&nbsp; office of the Workmen's Compensation Commission to guarantee the payment of such compensation, which clearly indicates that&nbsp; when it affects government employees and laborers employed in any public work, the party in interest is either the&nbsp; national government, or any&nbsp; of its political subdivisions,&nbsp; because the money involved is part of the public funds.&nbsp; In fact, with&nbsp; regard to national projects, the law expressly requires&nbsp; that the contracts covering awards be executed by the Director of Public Works (now by the Commissioner of Public&nbsp; Highways) ,"on&nbsp; behalf of&nbsp; the Government", with the approval of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications "(section 1920,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code).&nbsp; If such is the law on the matter, then the proper party who should be made respondent in a&nbsp; claim for death&nbsp; benefit or&nbsp; compensation affecting employees and laborers of the national government is&nbsp; the Republic of the Philippines, the service of process to&nbsp; be made upon the Solicitor General as required by section 15, Rule 7, of the Rules of Court&nbsp;&nbsp; And there is nothing strange if this be (Tone considering that, under&nbsp; our government set-up, the Solicitor General is the&nbsp; official&nbsp; called upon "to act for and&nbsp; represent the Government of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; its officers, and&nbsp; agents in any official investigation, proceeding, or matter&nbsp; requiring the services pf a lawyer" (section 1661, Revised Administrative Code).</p><p>While it is true&nbsp; that the Director of Public Works&nbsp; or the Commissioner&nbsp; of Public&nbsp; Highways can&nbsp; be&nbsp; sued&nbsp; on matters covering their&nbsp; official functions or activities,&nbsp; the situation varies when it refers to a claim for death benefit or compensation, for, as already adverted to, the proper party in interest is the national government because&nbsp; the money to be applied&nbsp; to the payment of the compensation belongs to it under section 53 of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the situation obtaining in the present case.&nbsp; And as it appears that the national government was not&nbsp; given its day in&nbsp; court,&nbsp; the decision of&nbsp; the referee&nbsp; cannot stand, since it was rendered&nbsp; in excess&nbsp; of his jurisdiction.&nbsp; In the circumstances, law and equity demand that the whole proceedings be set aside&nbsp; and&nbsp; the case remanded to the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission in order that&nbsp; a new hearing may be had with due notice to the national government.</p><p>Wherefore, petition&nbsp; is granted.&nbsp; The&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the referee dated November 29,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as his&nbsp; order dated June 3, 1955, are hereby set aside.&nbsp; The case is ordered remanded to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for further proceedings as ordered in&nbsp; this decision. No pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes J. B.
