				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an "Urgent Ex-Parte Petition to Require Sheriff of 
Manila to Re-attach Properties" filed in case No. L-2949, Robert L. Weadock and 
James T. Walker vs. Macario Ofilada, Sheriff for the City of Manila, and 
Batangas Base R. Surplus Company, entitled "Petition for a Writ of 
Prohibition."
<p align="justify">The pertinent facts are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">Robert L. Weadock and James T. Walker, the petitioners, brought 
an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila (civil case No. 6877, now 
pending in the said court) against Arthur H. Merritt and Insular Trades, Inc. to 
compel defendants to render an accounting of the profits in certain business 
transactions between them, it being alleged that said profits had been 
misapplied by defendants to their own use.</p>
<p align="justify">Acting on plaintiffs' petition, Judge Potenciano Pecson issued 
a writ of preliminary attachment, plaintiffs put up a bond, duly approved by the 
court, in the amount of P150,000, and the sheriff of the City of Manila attached 
the articles of personal property inventoried in Annex B.</p>
<p align="justify">On February 15, 1949, W. O. Merritt, said to be a brother of 
defendant Arthur H. Merritt, filed for and in behalf of Batangas Base R. Surplus 
Company, an alleged California partnership not registered in the Philippines, a 
third party claim for all or most of the attached property. <br></p><p align="justify">As A result of the 
filing of this third party claim, the sheriff required plaintiffs to put up a 
bond in the sum of P551,425, said to be the value of the property attached, with 
the warning that if they failed to post such bond he, sheriff, would deliver the 
said property to the third party claimant.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiffs opposed the third party claim on the grounds 
(<i>a</i>) that the affidavit in support of it was insufficient under section 
14, Rule 59, of the Rules of Court; (<i>b</i>) that the valuation of the 
property claimed, at P551,425, was highly excessive; and (<i>c</i>) that 
Batangas Base R. Surplus Company was not a person under Philippine laws, the 
same having been allegedly organized under the California laws but not 
registered nor licensed to transact business in the Philippines. As an 
affirmative remedy, plaintiffs prayed that the sheriff be prohibited from 
releasing the said property and asked the court to make a reasonable assessment 
thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">On March 23, 1949, Judge Pecson denied plaintiffs' opposition 
and their motion to prohibit the sheriff from releasing the property. It was at 
this stage of the case that plaintiffs filed, on May 31, the urgent ex-parte 
petition.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 14, Rule 59, of the Rules of Court reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If property taken be claimed by any other person than the 
defendant or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto 
or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, 
and serves the same upon the officer while he has possession of the property, 
and a copy thereof upon the plaintiff, the officer shall not be bound to keep 
the property under the attachment, unless the plaintiff or his agent, on demand 
of said officer, indemnifies him against such claim by a bond in a sum not 
greater than the value of the property attached and in case of disagreement as 
to such value, the same shall be decided by the court issuing the writ of 
attachment.* * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The third party claimant's affidavit, by reason of which he 
claimed the release of the properties in question and on the strength of which 
the plaintiffs were required to file a bond, states that "the affiant's right to 
the possession of said personal property is derived from the fact that the 
attached properties listed in Appendices A, B, and C have been purchased by the 
defendant Insular Trades, Inc. with the funds money of the said partnership 
Batangas Base R. Surplus Company and are therefore of the ownership of the said 
partnership."</p>
<p align="justify">The interest which W.O. Merritt claims to have in the attached 
property does not meet the requirements of section 14 of Rule 59, and should be 
ignored. He does not allege that Insular Trades, Inc. used Batangas Base R. 
Surplus Company's funds as the latter's agent or in the latter's name. The 
allegations are more susceptible of the interpretation that Batangas Base R. 
Surplus Company is a mere creditor of Insular Trades, Inc. It is not inferable 
from these allegations that W. O. Merritt's interest, or the interest of the 
partnership which he claims to represent, constitutes title to, or a lien on, 
the attached property and entitles him or his principal to its possession.</p>
<p align="justify">This being the case, the discharge of the attachment and the 
release of the property were improper and illegal. In consequence, the sheriff 
should retake, re-seize or re-attach the property which he has released and keep 
it in his possession or under his control, under the original order of 
attachment and the bond filed in pursuance of that order.</p>
<p align="justify">The urgent ex-parte petition is granted and the sheriff of 
Manila is ordered to proceed according to the tenor of this resolution.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Feria, Bengzon, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Paras, J.</i>, concurs in the result.</div>
