				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parties in this case, now over sixty years of age, contracted 
holy matrimony in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, on February 13, 1914.  Since then 
until about the first day of March 1942 they lived together as husband 
and wife without any issue.
  <p> On March 25, 1943, pursuant to the authority conferred upon him by
 the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Forces in the 
Philippines and with the approval of the latter, the Chairman of the 
Philippine Executive Commission promulgated a "New Divorce Law" 
(Executive Order No. 141), which repealed Act No. 2710 of the Philippine
 Legislature and provided eleven grounds for divorce, among which were:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "9. Intentional or unjustified desertion continuously for at least one year prior to the filing of the action.</p>
    <p> "x	x	x"</p>
    <p> "11. Slander by deed or gross insult by one spouse against the 
other to such an extent as to make further living together 
impracticable."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Taking advantage of that law the plaintiff, Justo Baptista, 
commenced this action on May 21, 1943, in the Court of First Instance of
 Ilocos Sur to dissolve the bonds of matrimony between him and the 
defendant, Consuelo Castañeda, alleging the two statutory grounds above 
mentioned—desertion and slander by deed by the wife.</p><p> The 
defendant chose not to contest this suit for divorce.  After hearing the
 evidence for the plaintiff, His Honor Manuel Blanco, trial judge, 
declared that the grounds alleged had not been established; that the 
most he could deduce from the testimony of the plaintiff was that there 
was an incompatibility of character between him and his wife.  Wherefore
 he denied the petition for divorce.</p><p> From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed and insists that this Court issue a decree of divorce.</p><p>
 Since this action was instituted, much water has passed under the 
bridge.  The Japanese invaders have been driven out and the Commonwealth
 Government has been restored.  Concomitantly with the restoration 
General MacArthur, as Commander-in-Chief of the Fil-American army of 
liberation, proclaimed and declared:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "1. That the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
is, subject to the supreme authority of the Government of the United 
States, the sole and only government having legal and valid jurisdiction
 over the people in areas of the Philippines free of enemy occupation 
and control;</p>
    <p> "2. That the laws now existing on the statute books of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines and the regulations promulgated pursuant
 thereto are in full force and effect and legally binding upon the 
people in areas of the Philippines free of enemy occupation and control;
 and</p>
    <p> "3. That all laws, regulations and processes of any other 
government in the Philippines than that of the said Commonwealth are 
null and void and without legal effect in areas of the Philippines free 
of enemy occupation and control." (Proclamation of Oct. 23, 1944, 41 
O.G. 148.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Without deciding whether  the "New Divorce Law" was validly 
promulgated, we are prepared to say, and so hold, that even if it were 
it is no longer of any force and effect.  (<em>See</em> opinions rendered in Peralta<em> vs.</em>
 Director of Prisons, 75 Phil., 285, and the authorities therein cited.)
  Under the proclamation above quoted Act No. 2710 prevails.
  </p><p> Its legal basis having vanished, this case must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.   
  </p><p><em>De Joya, Perfecto, Hilado,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ., </em>concur.
