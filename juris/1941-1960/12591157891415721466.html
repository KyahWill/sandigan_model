				<H3>THE PEOPLE  OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AMI; APPELLANT, VS. PETRONIO REMERATA, DEFENDANT  AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused Petronio Remerata was&nbsp; convicted of stealing a rifle. After&nbsp; sentence was passed,&nbsp; the Fiscal&nbsp; filed&nbsp; another information charging him with illegal possession of the same firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remerata set up <span style="font-style: italic;">autrefois convict, </span>and upon, his motion, the Court of First Instance of Cotabato, invoking Rule 113, section 9, dismissed the second information, on the theory that the illegal possession was inseparable from the theft of which the accused had already been convicted and sentenced. The Fiscal appeals to this court from the order of dismissal.<br><br>The appeal must be sustained.&nbsp; While in stealing a firearm the accused must necessarily come into possession thereof, the crime of illegal possession of firearms is not committed by&nbsp; mere transient possession of the weapon. It requires something more: there must be not only intention to own but also intent to use (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Estoista,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> 49 Off. Gaz. [8] 3330), which is not necessarily the case in every&nbsp; theft of firearms.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; stealing a firearm with intent&nbsp; not to use but to render the owner defenseless, may suffice&nbsp; for purposes of&nbsp; establishing a case&nbsp; of theft,&nbsp; but would&nbsp; not justify a charge of illegal possession of the firearms, since intent to hold and eventually use&nbsp; the weapon would&nbsp; be lacking.<br><br>Besides, an information charging larceny will not usually sustain a&nbsp; conviction for&nbsp; illegal possession of&nbsp; firearms, for it does not ordinarily allege that the accused had no previous authority or&nbsp; license to keep the&nbsp; weapon,&nbsp; this circumstance being immaterial to the theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this basis, we&nbsp; held in People vs. Alger,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 48, Off. Gaz. (11) 4799, that a previous conviction for homicide is no bar&nbsp; to subsequent prosecution for illegal possession bi the firearm employed in 'the&nbsp; killing.<br><br>The&nbsp; first information for theft in Remerata's case is not before us, not having been presented in&nbsp; evidence,, and we&nbsp; can not say&nbsp; that&nbsp; its terms would have enabled&nbsp; the State&nbsp; to convict him for illegal possession of&nbsp; the rifle involved.<br><br>Since&nbsp; there can&nbsp; be theft&nbsp; without&nbsp; illegal possession&nbsp; of firearms; and vice-versa, illegal possession may exist without the&nbsp; element of taking (asportation) that is essential in theft, conviction of&nbsp; one offense will&nbsp; not be&nbsp; a bar&nbsp; to prosecution for other. <br><br>The order&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the information is reversed&nbsp; and the case remanded for further proceedings.&nbsp; Costs against the accused.&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Par√°s, C. J., Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, </i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 93 Phil.,&nbsp; 647.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>92 Phil.,&nbsp; 227.</div>
