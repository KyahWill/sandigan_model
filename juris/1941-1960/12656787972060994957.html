				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1590, April 27, 1949</h4>
				<H3>RAYMUNDA SIVA ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FELIXBERTO IMPERIAL REYES, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOILO, AND CORNELIO QUIDATO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In the present petition for certiorari, the petitioners seek 
the review and annulment of the order of the respondent judge in civil case No. 
798 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, the dispositive part of which 
reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Procede ordenar, como por el presente ordena, a los 
demandantes que de hoy en adelante y hasta que recaiga decision final en este 
asunto se abstengan de cometer actos de usurpacion y de intromision en la 
posesion de los demandados en el terreno, objeto de este litigio, so pena de ser 
declarados incursos en desacato."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This order was entered before trial on the merits of civil case 
No. 798, and it is contended for the petitioners that until the question of 
ownership and possession has been detemined, they cannot be enjoined in the 
manner, stated in the order complained of.</p>
<p align="justify">It is insisted, however, by the respondents that said order 
amounts to a writ of preliminary injunction which the respondent Judge may 
issue during the pendency of said civil case.</p>
<p align="justify">The contention of counsel for the respondents as to the nature 
of the order in correct. Even so, we have no hesitancy in holding that its 
issuance was irregular, in that, contrary to the provisions of section 4 of Rule 
of Court No. 60, no bond was required by the respondent Judge and filed by the 
party in whose favor the order was issued. Said rule plainly provides that a 
preliminary injunction may be granted only, aside from the requirement that the 
complaint in the action must be verified and must show facts entitling the 
plaintiff to the relief demanded, when "the plaintiff files with the clerk or 
judge of the court in which the action is pending a bond executed to the party 
enjoined, in an amount to be fixed by the court, to the effect that the 
plaintiff will pay to such party all damages which he may sustain by reason of 
the injunction if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not 
entitled thereto."</p>
<p align="justify">Without deciding whether or not the facts of the case justify 
the issuance of any restraining order against the petitioners, we rule that, for 
lack of the requisite bond, the order in question should be, as the same is 
hereby, set aside. Petition granted with costs against respondent Cornelio 
Quidato. So ordered.</p>

Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></p></div>
