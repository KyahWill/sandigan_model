				<H3>MANILA PAPER  MILLS EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, NOVALICHES INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION (PLUM), AND MANILA PAPER MILLS, INC., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Manila Paper Mills, Inc., later referred to as the Company, is a corporation engaged in the manufacture of paper, with office at Sangandaan, Novaliches, Quezon City. The 95 odd employees working in said factory belong to two labor unions, namely, the Manila Paper Mills Employees and Workers Association, later referred to as the Association, and the Novaliches Industrial Workers Union, later referred to as the Union. It would appear that there was rivalry between these two labor organizations that caused and motivated the controversy that led to the petition for certification election filed by the Union, and the issuance of the order of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), dated January 9, 1957 (Annex E of the Revision), which order the Association now seeks to be reversed and set aside in its petition for certiorari.<br><br>For a better understanding of the origin of this case and to serve as background, the following undisputed facts may be stated. The Union filed a petition for certification election with the CIR, dated October 4, 1956, docketed as Case No. 401-MIC, alleging therein  that pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 (c) of Republic Act No. 875, its members constituted at least 10% of the approximate total of 95 workers in the factory, permanent and temporary; that some of the workers belonged to another labor organization, known as the Manila Paper Mills Workers Association, and that the petitioning Union would have no objection that said Association members participate in the election; that there had been no election for about a year, nor was there any existing agreement which would serve as a bar to the election. It was subsequently claimed by this petitioning Union that at least 72 of the 95 employees and workers were members of said Union.<br><br>The petition was opposed by the Association  (designated as the intervenor) by a written pleading, dated October 25, 1956, for the reason that the petitioning Union had committed unfair labor practices by reason of which, the intervenor had filed a complaint, a copy of which ws attached to the opposition, which complaint, dated October 25, 1956, was filed  with the CIR as Case No. 1099-ULP. This complaint was later supplemented by a regular complaint in the same case, filed by Antonio T. Tirona, acting prosecutor, charging the Company and the Union with unfair labor practice, to the effect that the Company had threatened members of said Association with dismissal if they remained members of said Association; that it had refused to bargain collectively with the Association, although it had received a written set of demands from it; that on the other hand, after receiving said demands, the Company instigated and hastened the preparation of and the service of the demand  of the rival Union; and that the officers and members of the Union threatened the families of the members of the Association with dismissal if they remained members of said Association; that it had refused to bargain collectively with the Association, although it had recieved a written set of demands from it; that on the other hand, after receiving said demands, the Company instigated and hastened the preparation of and the service of the demand of the rival Union; and that the officers and members of the Union threatened the families of the members  of the Association with bodily harm if the said members did not severe their connection and membership with the Association. The complaint ended with a prayer for an order by the CIR, finding the Company and the Union guilty of unfair labor practice, and directing the dissolution of the Union (Novaliches Industrial Workers Union).<br><br>It would also appear that Edilberto J. Pangan, another acting prosecutor, had filed a complaint with the CIR, apparently on behalf of the Union ( Novaliches Industrial Workers Union) against the same Company and its manager and also against the Association, dated November 13, 1956, docketed as Case  No. 1089-ULP, charging the Company and the Association with interfering with the free union activities of the Union, and threatening, coercing, intimidating, and restraining them in continuing their membership in the Union, and in assisting and giving support to the organization, called Manila Paper Mills Employees and Workers Association, in other words, charging company domination.<br><br>On January 23, 1957, Amando Gonzales, President of the Association, filed a complaint against the Company and the Union for unfair labor practice, docketed as Case No. 1179-ULP, formally charging the Company with instigating and fostering the formation and organization of the Union and thereafter giving favor  and aid to said Union and its members, and threatening members of the Association with dismissal if they did not severe their connection with said Association and join the Union. Included in the prayer was dissolution and cancellation of the permit of the Union. After hearing of the petition for certification election,  the CIR, through its Presiding Judge, Jose S. Bautista, granted the petition through the order of January 9, 1957, now sought to be reversed and set aside in the present petition.<br><br>The order, in our opinion, well and correctly stated the issues and the reasons for granting the petition for certification election, and we quote it with  favor and make it our own:<br><blockquote>"On October 5, 1956, a petition for certification electioin was filed by the Novaliches Industrial Workers Union (PLUM), alleging among others the following:<br><br>'(a) That petitioner's members constitute at least ten (10%) per cent of the approximate total of ninety-nine (95) workers, permanent and temporary, in said appropriate unit for collective bargaining;<br><br>'(b) That petitioner believes that some workers at said unit are affiliated with an allegedly legitimate union, "Manila Paper Mills Workers'  Association",  which  participation  in  this  election qualified,  the  herein petitioner would offer  no objection; and that the same  may be served with  summons  at Sangandaan, Novaliches, Quezon  City;  and ' <br><br>'(c) That there is no known legal impediment against the holding of this "certification  election",  there having  no  election  in said unit the last  twelve  (12) months nor  any agreement exists as  a bar  to  this election.'<br><br>''The Manila  Paper  Mills,  Inc. by way  of answer stated that they would deal with any union so chosen  by the  employees  as their sole  and  exclusive collective bargaining representative  in accordance with law. "<br><br>The Manila  Paper Mills  Employees and  Workers' Union filed its  opposition and alleged that the petitioning union in  order to increase its membership employed illegitimate means,  as threats of death, intimidation and coercion on the  members of the intervening union,  so that  they  might  secede  from the  other  union.  They (intervenor) further argued that there  is a pending case  in  Court whereby  the  intervenor charges  the  petitioner  of  unfair  labor practice and docketed as  Case  No. 1099-ULP, and by virtue thereof, sought  the suspension of the hearing of the instant  petition.  On the other hand, the petitioner claimed that the existence of a charge of company domination on the petitioning union is the  only instance which could be the basis of suspending the  petition for certification election.  Petitioner advanced  the arguments  that  authorities  are unanimous  to that effect, that the Court had ruled en bane in  a line  of decisions suspending the hearing of certification  election cases only where there is a charge of company  domination on  the part of the petitioning Union. <br><br>"The Court is  of the opinion that  certification election  would be in keeping with the objective of the Magna  Carta of  Labor, because it will  pave a  way  to a collective bargaining agreement which will advance the settlement of issues between employers and employees, maintain agreement concerning terms and  conditions of employment and  settle their differences  by mutual agreement. The employer  will not enter  into  such  agreement  without determining which of the two unions is the sole representative  of the employees, and  therefore, to hold an  election is  the  logical solution in this situation,  to promote  industrial peace. The contention of the intervenor that the petitioner is  company-dominated,  is untenable, because nothing is said  that  petitioner  is dominated, initiated and assisted by the employer to  warrant  a  charge of company-domination, but  only  charge the petitioner  of  threats, coercions, and intimidations,  which are not  impediments to the  instant petition. <br><br>"IN VIEW WHEREOF, the Court deemed it proper and logical to hold an election, and the payroll of the last week of September, 1956 shall determine who are eligible to vote. Pursuant to Section 12 (e) of Republic Act No. 875, the Department of Labor is hereby requested to conduct  an election in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Court.'</blockquote>We agree with the CIR on the reasons given in its order that  only  a formal charge of  company domination  may serve as a bar  to and  stop a certification  election,  the reason  being that  if there  is a union dominated by the Company, to which some of the  workers belong, an election among  the  workers and  employees of the company would not reflect the true sentiment and wishes  of  the  said workers  and employees from  the standpoint  of their welfare and interest, because as to the members of the company dominated union, the vote of the said members in the  election would not  be  free.  It is equally true, however, that the oposition to the holding of certification election due to a charge of  company domination  can  only be filed and maintained  by the labor  organization, which made the  charge of company  domination, because it is the entity that stands to lose and  suffer prejudice by the certification election, the reason being that  its members might be overwhelmed in the voting by the other members controlled and dominated by the Company. <br><br>In the present case,  the facts  already narrated  show that  the labor organization that filed the charge of company domination in Case No. 1089-ULP, is the  same labor entity that asked. for certification election,  at the  same time praying that the investigation of the  charge of company domination be in the meantime suspended.  In other words, it was willing and prepared to have a certification election, confident  that  the  majority  of the  workers and laborers in the Company would vote freely and have said petitioner declared the bargaining unit.  As found by the CIR, the complaint for unfair  labor practice filed by the Association  in Case No. 1099-ULP did  not charge any company domination, but only  accused the Company and the Union with alleged threats  and  coercion.   True, the Association later filed a formal charge of company domination in Case No. 1179-ULP, but this was on January 23, 1957, after the CIR, through Judge Bautista, had rendered the order  complained of, dated January 9, 1957. <br><br>We agree with  the respondent  CIR  that  we  should give  discretion  to  the  Court  of Industrial Relations in deciding whether or not to grant a petition for certification election, considering  the facts and circumstances of which  it has intimate knowledge.   Recently,  we had occasion to consider  and decide a case   (The  Standard  Cigarette Workers Union  (PLUM) vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., 101 Phil., 126, decided  by this Tribunal  on  April 22,  1957), wherein through Mr. Justice J. B.  L. Reyes, this Court commented, even stated a rule about the holding of certification election, pending determination  of charges of unfair  labor practice by the same labor organization which asked for the certification election, which comments and ruling may  shed more  light on our  reason for upholding the order of the CIR: <br><blockquote>'It is noteworthy, too,  as observed by Judge Lanting, that it was not  the petitioner union, but the company, the Standard Cigarette Manufacturing  Co., Inc., which  had  asked  for the suspension of the proceedings on the certification election pending final determination of the unfair labor practice complaint.  In the usual course of things, the complainant union would have been the one interested in the deferment of the  certification election, since the  unfair labor  practices of the employer could result in  the substantial reduction of its  membership and its failure to  get elected as the employees' bargaining representative. But  the complainant union did not ask for  the suspension; instead, it  had strongly opposed  the same in the  court below  and  has  even come to this Court on certiorari against such suspension. If the complainant  union itself  believes that it would not suffer prejudice in the  election because  of the employer's  alleged unfair  labor practices, or is willing to take the  risks in said election,  then we see no further reason  for the respondent court to suspend the holding of the election by the employees of their  collective bargaining agent. Upon the other hand, we can only agree with Judge Lanting that the move of  the company to suspend  the  certification election proceedings pending resolution of  the unfair labor  practice complaint against it, can be  taken only as  a  maneuver to  further delay such election  and  thereby favor the intervenor-union, with whom it had already concluded a collective bargaining  agreement." <br></blockquote>In view  of  the foregoing,  the  petition  for  certiorari is  hereby denied,  with costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
