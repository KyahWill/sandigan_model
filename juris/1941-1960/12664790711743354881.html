				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Review of a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals. During the Japanese&nbsp; occupation,&nbsp; Coconut&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Co., Inc. and Francisco Lavides&nbsp; executed the following promissory note: <br><blockquote>"For&nbsp; value received, we, the undersigned, jointly and&nbsp; severally promised&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; Messrs. Ponciano A. Bernardo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Procopio Eleazar, their heirs and assigns, the sum of twenty-five&nbsp; thousand pesos (P25,000.00) upon their demand, subject to the following conditions : <br><ol><li>That this loan shall&nbsp; be payable and collectible&nbsp; on demand to the option of the said Messrs. Bernardo and&nbsp; Eleazar&nbsp; within&nbsp; the period of time between ninety&nbsp; (90) days after the ratification of the Treaty&nbsp; of Peace&nbsp; ending the present&nbsp; war between&nbsp; the United States&nbsp; of America and Japan, and one (1)&nbsp; year after&nbsp; the said ratification; </li><li>That the said amount of twenty-five thousand pesos&nbsp; (P25,000.00) shall not bear interest&nbsp; until the time demand for payment of same is made, and shall be payable in current legal tender&nbsp; at the time of&nbsp; payment; </li><li>The demand for payment shall be made on Francisco Lavides when and only when the&nbsp; Coconut Central Co., Inc.&nbsp; fails to meet the full obligation of twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000.00) upon the&nbsp; demand of Messrs. Bernardo and Eleazar."</li></ol></blockquote>It is&nbsp; admitted that&nbsp; the loan consisted of P100,000.00, Japanese military notes, which were mostly used to redeem mortgages on the property of the Coconut Central Co. in favor of Tomas B. Morato&nbsp; (P41,075.58)&nbsp; and&nbsp; of National Warehousing Corporation&nbsp; (P48.356.32). <br><br>On September 25, 1944, the parties executed a so-called "confidential memorandum" (to express the real intent and purpose of the loan) in one portion of which they "agreed that the claim for payment shall first be made against the Coconut Central Co., Inc.,&nbsp; but if the said corporation cannot meet this&nbsp; obligation in full upon&nbsp; demand because of the destruction of its assets by this war or in any other cause,&nbsp; Hon. Francisco&nbsp; Lavides&nbsp; has agreed to&nbsp; settle&nbsp; the obligation from his&nbsp; own personal resources pledging his real properties&nbsp; for&nbsp; this purpose." <br><br>On December 1, 1953, Procopio&nbsp; Eleazor. and&nbsp; the heirs of&nbsp; Ponciano Bernardo&nbsp; demanded, from the&nbsp; Coconut Central, payment&nbsp; of the above note within 15&nbsp; days, but the corporation&nbsp; failed to comply.&nbsp; So&nbsp; on February 6, 1954, they required payment&nbsp; from Francisco Lavides; and upon his failure to pay, they instituted this action against both in the Rizal court of first instance.<br><br>Lavides set up several defenses: (a) the contract was leonine—for P10,000.00 Japanese currency, plaintiffs would receive P25,000.00 Philippine money; (b)&nbsp; the agreement was that he would pay only when the corporation should have no&nbsp; properties, but the latter has properties; and&nbsp; (c) he had requested plaintiffs to take possession of the factory of the corporation with all its buildings and improvements, but plaintiffs&nbsp; declined to accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also set up some counter-claims.<br><br>After&nbsp; trial, the court rendered judgment&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; defendants to pay jointly and severally the sum of P25,000.00 with&nbsp; interest of 6%&nbsp; from the presentation&nbsp; of the complaint, plus costs, and dismissing the counterclaims.&nbsp; On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, with the modification that Lavides shall have, as a mere&nbsp; guarantor, the benefit of exhaustion of the debtor's property. <br><br>Where upon Lavides presented this appeal by certiorari. <br><br>It was error says&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner to make&nbsp; him&nbsp; liable because his obligation was conditional, and arose only upon <span style="font-style: italic;">destruction of the properties </span>of the corporation, which&nbsp; the plaintiffs have failed&nbsp; to prove; in fact, the corporation has assets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner points out that in&nbsp; the confidential memorandum, he agreed to pay "if the said corporation cannot meet this obligation * * * because of the destruction of its assets by&nbsp; this war or in any&nbsp; other cause"&nbsp; which means destruction of assets <span style="font-style: italic;">by war or by any other cause."</span><br>In other words, petitioner contends he is not&nbsp; liable except <span style="font-style: italic;">in case of destruction of assets</span> by war or by any other cause.&nbsp; Observe&nbsp; that&nbsp; the confidential memorandum does not read&nbsp; "by&nbsp; any, other cause."&nbsp; It reads "in any&nbsp; other cause." <br><br>It is&nbsp; apparent from the confidential memorandum that the parties attempted to explain the real intent and purpose of the loan and the nature of Lavides' responsibility. In so doing, they&nbsp; made&nbsp; it&nbsp; clear&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was a simple&nbsp; guarantor—not a solidary co-debtor or solidary guarantor; The interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeals accorded with such purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation urged upon us by petitioner would practicaly exempt him from liability from the very beginning because as the properties of the corporation&nbsp; were <span style="font-style: italic;">real&nbsp; properties,</span>&nbsp; they&nbsp; would&nbsp; never be destroyed&nbsp; (the land at least).&nbsp; It might even convert him into an insurer of the properties—not a guarantor of the debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>Construing the memorandum in relation to the note, and giving effect to the obvious intention of the parties to make Lavides a guarantor, it should be read&nbsp; as imposing liability upon him when the corporation fails to pay because of destruction of its assets or because of any&nbsp; other cause. Stated&nbsp; otherwise, Lavides becomes liable when the&nbsp; corporation cannot meet the obligation&nbsp; for having lost its assets or for any other reason. Such construction accords with the secondary liability of&nbsp; a guarantor,&nbsp; which he admittedly is. <br><br>Another point raised, is the failure of the plaintiffs to demand payment "within&nbsp; the period between ninety (90) days after the ratification&nbsp; of the Treaty of Peace ending the present&nbsp; war&nbsp; between the United&nbsp; States of America and Japan, and&nbsp; one year after the said ratification."&nbsp; This failure is admitted.&nbsp; The demand was made more than one year after the expiration of such period.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as the Court of Appeals held, mere delay&nbsp; of&nbsp; the creditor&nbsp; in proceeding against the principal debtor does not release the guarantor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, the period was fixed principally to determine the kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; currency in which repayment shall be made.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; this&nbsp; guarantor does not&nbsp; show&nbsp; any prejudice&nbsp; suffered by&nbsp; him&nbsp; on account&nbsp; of such delay,&nbsp; nor of any alteration of currency values after the lapse of the period described. <br><br>It appears that "after liberation, Messrs. Eleazar Bernardo went to see Mr. Lavides at his office in Pasay City on several occasions and on one of them Lavides asked the former to take delivery of the factory and other properties of the Coconut Central Co.,&nbsp; Inc. which were&nbsp; still intact because they were neither bombed nor burned and offered to secure the corresponding resolution from the&nbsp; Coconut Central Co., Inc. to&nbsp; that effect; that Mr. Eleazar told him that they were going to think it over and&nbsp; on their subsequent visits&nbsp; they&nbsp; informed&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Lavides that it would entail on&nbsp; them much expense if they took delivery of the assets of said corporation and&nbsp; hence they&nbsp; declined the offer." <br><br>Petitioner insists that for such remissness and negligence of plaintiffs, the defendant&nbsp; Lavides should not be&nbsp; made to suffer.&nbsp; The refusal to take the assets seemed to be justified.&nbsp; At any rate, they are still available, and will surely be exhausted&nbsp; before recovery from Lavides may be enforced. <br><br>A new provision in the New Civil Code (Art. 2058) is cited to the effect that the creditor must resort to&nbsp; all legal remedies&nbsp; against the debtor before he can&nbsp; compel&nbsp; the guarantor&nbsp; to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever may&nbsp; be the effect of this provision&nbsp; in the&nbsp; circumstances of the&nbsp; instant lawsuit, it should be enough to remember that as this&nbsp; contract was entered into in 1944 the&nbsp; former Civil&nbsp; Code, not the new one,&nbsp; governs.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any&nbsp; rate the decision gives petitioner the benefit of excussion, which may amount to the same thing, the properties of the debtor&nbsp; being still available.<br><br>The&nbsp; foregoing, incidentally&nbsp; answers petitioner's claim that&nbsp; the action should have been filed&nbsp; against the debtor first, in accordance with Art. 2062 of the New Civil Code. The&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code which was the law in 1944, provided that "the creditor may sue the guarantor jointly with the principal debtor".&nbsp; Besides, this issue was&nbsp; not tendered in the court of first instance. <br><br>Wherefore, finding no reversible error, we hereby affirm the judgment under review.&nbsp; No costs&nbsp; in this instance, the appellee having filed no brief. <br><br><i>Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>A guarantor agrees&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay in case&nbsp; the debtor fails to&nbsp; pay (Art. 1822,&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code)—not when the&nbsp; debtor loses his property. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Banco Español <i>vs.</i> Donaldson Sim, 5&nbsp; Phil., 418;&nbsp; Bank of P.
