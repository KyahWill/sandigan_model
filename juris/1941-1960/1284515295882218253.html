</style><div align="justify">The Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas, hereafter referred to as 
TABACALERA is a sociedad anonima organized under the laws of Spain, and 
authorized to do business in the Philippines. In the year 1927 high executive 
officers of TABACALERA organized the Central Azucarera de Tarlac, hereafter 
referred to as AZUCARERA, as a corporation under the laws of the Philippines. Of 
its 16,000 shares of stock originally subscribed, 13,000 shares were subscribed 
by TABACALERA, 2,000 shares by its high executive officials and the remaining 
1,000 by other persons. Since its organization AZUCARERA continuously and up to 
the present has been managed by TABACALERA, and in 1943, Lorenzo Correa, then 
Assistant Manager of TABACALERA was the President of AZUCARERA.
<p>On November 15, 1928, AZUCARERA issued for sale to the public, first mortgage 
bonds in denomination of 1,000.00 each, payable to bearer on or before November 
15, 1943, with interest at the rate of eight per centum (8%) per annum payable 
semi-annually as per interest coupons attached to the bond certificates. Under 
said mortgage bonds, TABACALERA was appointed the trustee of all bondholders. 
Among the bondholders were Francisco Javier de Pitarque y Elio with 8 bonds; 
Isabel Maria de Ynchausti with 29 bonds; Maria Elia de Ynchausti with 23 bonds; 
and Ana Maria de Pitarque y de Ynchausti with 18 bonds, all with a total value 
of P78,000.00.</p>
<p>In April, 1943, AZUCARERA decided to call in all its bonds then outstanding, 
amounting to 2,500 with a total value of P2,500,000.00. Because it was not then 
in a position financially to effect the redemption, it decided to borrow the 
necessary amount of 2,500,000.00 from the Bank of Taiwan. At that time there was 
a trust mortgage of its properties in the amount of P4,000,000.00 in favor of 
TABACALERA; there was also a second mortgage on all its properties in the amount 
of P5,000,000.00 also in favor of TABACALERA. These two mortgages were cancelled 
thereby enabling AZUCARERA to mortgage the same properties in favor of the Bank 
of Taiwan to secure the loan of P2,500,000.00 given to it.</p>
<p>The corresponding notice of redemption was published in two Manila dailies, 
the Tribune and La Vanguardia, to the effect that the principal and interest 
will be paid by the trustee (Tabacalera) at its office in Manila “on or after 
May 15, 1943, against surrender of the bonds and attached interest coupons”. 
Pursuant to said notice numerous bondholders presented their bonds for payment 
and were paid; and according to the record 717 bonds valued at P717,000.00 held 
by the TABACALERA were also redeemed and paid by the trustee.</p>
<p>On July 22, 1943, Gregorio Araneta Inc., hereafter referred to as ARANETA 
INC., representing itself as the duly authorized attorney-in-fact or agent of 
bondholders Francisco Javier de Pitarque y Elio, Maria de Ynchausti, Maria Elia 
de Ynchausti and Ana Maria de Pitarque y de Ynchausti, then all residing in 
Spain, applied for payment according to the plaintiffs TABACALERA and AZUCARERA 
of the principal and interest of the bonds owned by its principals. According to 
ARANETA INC., however, it never applied for payment but was notified and was 
even pressed to present the bonds of its principals for payment. Anyway, Jose 
Araneta, then President of ARANETA INC., filed with the AZUCARERA the following 
affidavit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I, JOSE ARANETA, President of the Gregorio Araneta, Inc., and the latter as 
attorney-in-fact of Da. Maria Elia de Ynchausti, D. Francisco Javier de Pitarque 
y Elio, Da. Maria Isabel de Ynchausti, and Da. Ana Maria de Pitarque y de 
Ynchausti, do hereby declare and swear:-</p>
<p>That under date of July 3, 1943, the said Gregorio Araneta, Inc. wrote a 
letter to the Bank of the Philippine Islands of the following tenor:</p>
<p>‘Muy Srs. Nuestros:</p>

2739, 2741/4, 3965, 3969/70 a nombre de D.a Ana Maria de Pitarque y de 
Ynchausti.'</p>
<p>That under date of July 6, 1943, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, in reply 
to the Above mentioned letter of Gregorio Araneta Inc., answered as follows:</p>
<p>‘Muy Sres. Nuestros:</p>
<p>En contestacion a su atenta carta de fecha 3 del presente mes, mucho sentimos 
no poder remitirles, como nos piden, los titulos de los bonos u obligaciones del 
Casino Español del Manila y de la Central Azucarera de Tarlac que se detallan en 
su carta y que obraban en nuestro poder en calidad de deposito en custodia, en 
razon a que, por orden de fecha 29 de Diciembre de 1941 del anterior Alto 
Comisionado de los Estados Unidos de America en Filipinas, tales titulos 
tuvieron que ser entregados por este Banco al mencionado funcionario.</p>
<p>Deplorando el inconveniente que nos priva del placer de complacerles, nos 
reiteramos de Vds. attos. Y ss. ss.,</p>
<p align="right">PEDRO J. CAMPOS<br>Presidente’</p>
<p>That for the reasons alleged in the letter of the Bank of the Philippine 
Islands, the said Gregorio Araneta, Inc. is not in a position to produce the 
above-mentioned certificates of bonds of Casino Español and the Central 
Azucarera de Tarlac;</p>
<p>FURTHER, affiant sayeth not.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) JOSE ARANETA”</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of the non-presentation of the bonds of its principals, AZUCARERA and 
TABACALERA refused to make payment of the amounts of said bonds and interest, 
and required ARANETA INC. to specify that it was applying for payment of the 
principal and interest of the bonds, and that it would undertake to indemnify 
plaintiffs for any damage that might be caused them if in the future they should 
be called upon to make a second payment of the same bonds. Complying with this 
requirement ARANETA INC. sent a letter to the TABACALERA dated January 23, 1943, 
which is quoted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">“GREGORIO ARANETA, INCORPORATED<br>4 th Floor, Samanillo 
Bldg.<br>Manila</p>
<p align="right">Manila, 23 de Julio de 1943</p>
<p>Compañia Gral. de Tabacos de Filipinas<br>Marques de Comillas<br>Manila</p>
<p>Muy Srs. Nuestros:</p>
<p>La presente tiene por objecto informarles que tan pronto como el Banco de las 
Islas Filipinas nos pueda remitir las obligaciones de la Central Azucarera de 
Tarlac anotadas en el adjunto affidavit, nos comprometemos a entregar las 
mismas.</p>
<p>Deseamos tambien hacer constar que asumimos la responsabilidad de reembolsar 
a Vds. de cualquiera duplicidad de pago en que pueda incurrir a causa de la no 
presentacion de dichas obligaciones.</p>
<p align="right">De Vds. attos, y ss., ss.,</p>
<p align="right">GREGORIO ARANETA, INCORPORATED<br>Apoderados de los 
Sres:<br>Maria Isabel de Ynchausti<br>Maria Elia de Ynchausti<br>Francisco 
Javier de Pitarque y Elio<br>Ana Maria de Pitarque y de Ynchausti<br>Isabel de 
Ynchausti de Pitarque</p>
<p align="right">Por:</p>
<p align="right">(Fdo.) Jose Araneta<br>Presidente.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With this letter or undertaking TABACALERA paid the value of the bonds and 
interest belonging to the four principals of ARANETA INC. including six other 
bonds in the name of Isabel de Ynchausti and eight other bonds with interest 
coupons attached thereto in the name of Ana Maria de Ynchausti which were in the 
Philippines, in the form of and by means of checks issued by TABACALERA in favor 
of ARANETA INC. on account of each co-principal, drawn on the Bank of Taiwan, 
dated August 7, 1943. ARANETA INC. received the abovementioned checks for its 
principals in payment of the principal and interest of the bonds owned by said 
principal, and deposited them in the Bank of the Philippine Islands in separate 
accounts.</p>
<p>After the war, the bond certificates belonging to the four principals of 
ARANETA INC. which according to the Bank of the Philippine Islands had been 
delivered to the High Commissioner of the United States, presumably for 
safekeeping, were returned to ARANETA INC. and they were in turn delivered to 
the law firm of Ramirez &amp; Ortigas for collection. Said law firm duly advised 
the AZUCARERA that it had received the bonds in question from ARANETA INC. and 
asked that the same be noted for purposes of Republic Act No. 62. AZUCARERA 
through its attorneys advised Ramirez &amp; Ortigas that said bonds not only had 
already been paid in 1943 but that ARANETA INC. had undertaken to reimburse 
AZUCARERA for any loss which might be sustained by it in case of double payment, 
and had promised to deliver said bonds to AZUCARERA as soon as it received them 
from the Bank of the Philippine Islands. Because of the refusal of ARANETA INC. 
to deliver to AZUCARERA the said bonds, AZUCARERA and TABACALERA filed present 
action against ARANETA INC. and its principals to recover them and for damages, 
including the amount of P754.31 which was the amount of annual premium on the 
surety bond filed by the AZUCARERA and P10,000.00 as attorney’s fees. After 
trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila presided over by Judge Potenciano 
Pecson rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, 
ordering the latter “to deliver to the plaintiffs sixty-four (64) bonds 
described in paragraph IV of the complaint; and (2) ordering defendant to pay 
the plaintiffs, attorney’s fees in the sum of P5,000.00 and the annual premiums 
on the bond in the sum of P754.31 with interest on the latter at the rate of six 
per centum per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully 
paid,” and dismissing the counterclaim of the defendants for lack of sufficient 
and convincing evidence in support thereof. Both parties have appealed. 
Plaintiffs appealed because the lower court awarded them only P5,000.00 as 
attorney’s fees and because it held that in May, 1943, AZUCARERA was indebted to 
the TABACALERA in the sum of P5,000.00 secured by a second mortgage. The 
defendants appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in holding that ARANETA 
INC. as attorney-in-fact of its co-defendants applied in 1943 for the redemption 
of the 78 bonds valued at P78,000.00 in Japanese military notes; in not finding 
that the payment of the said bonds had been affected through threats, duress and 
moral coercion; in not holding that the TABACALERA in enabling the AZUCARERA to 
redeem the bond in 1943 committed a breach of trust against the appellant 
bondholders; in not holding that the defendants-appellants are now entitled to 
receive the redemption price of the bonds from either TABACALERA or AZUCARERA; 
in holding that appellants had acted in bad faith in refusing to surrender to 
the plaintiffs the bonds in question in 1947, and adjudging them liable for 
attorney’s fees as well as the annual replevin bond premium for P754.31.</p>
<p>As to whether or not ARANETA INC. applied for the payment of the bonds in 
question, under the circumstances we are inclined to agree with the trial court 
that application for payment was made. The notice issued by the AZUCARERA 
published in two Manila Dailies for the redemption of its bonds was made in 
general. There was no specific notice to or demand upon ARANETA INC. to present 
apply for payment of the bonds owned by them. It is even doubtful whether the 
AZUCARERA then knew that ARANETA INC. was acting as agent or attorney-in-fact 
for any bond owner, and yet we find the affidavit made by Jose Araneta as 
President of ARANETA INC. to support its claim that he could not produce and 
present those bonds for payment. There is, therefore, reason to believe and to 
hold that ARANETA INC. applied for payment of the bonds of its principals but 
because of the refusal of AZUCARERA to pay them unless they were produced and 
surrendered, the affidavit was made.</p>
<p>But it is claimed by ARANETA INC. that there was intimidation and duress 
exercised over its president into accepting payment of the bonds; that during 
the Japanese occupation the Japanese authorities had issued notifications and 
proclamations to the effect that those who held Japanese military notes were 
authorized to use them in making payments of all kinds and if any person 
interfered with the circulation of said notes, such person refusing to receive 
or accept them in payment would be severely punished; that because of Jose 
Araneta’s fear that he might be punished for refusing to accept payment of the 
bonds in Japanese military notes, he accepted them reluctantly and that under 
those conditions his acceptance of the payment should be considered invalid as 
done under duress and coercion. We have already said that ARANETA INC. applied 
for payment. Applying for payment implies voluntariness which is incompatible 
with alleged duress and coercion. But even if we consider the attitude of the 
Japanese occupation authorities in viewing with disfavor, even hostility, any 
act of rejection of payment of obligations in Japanese military notes, as 
influencing creditors in accepting payment of pre-war obligations in Japanese 
military notes and accepted by the creditor though in compliance with the orders 
of the Japanese military occupant enjoining acceptance of said military notes 
under severe penalty for non-acceptance, cannot be considered as made under 
collective and general duress, because an act done pursuant to the laws or 
orders of competent authorities can never be regarded as executed involuntarily, 
or under duress or illegitimate constraint or compulsion that invalidates the 
act. (Philippine Trust Co. vs. Luis Ma. Araneta et al., G.R. No. L-2734, March 
17, 1949 [46 O.G. p. 4254].) Moreover, the undertaking of ARANETA INC. included 
in its letter to TABACALERA dated July 23, 1943, that it assumed responsibility 
of reimbursing TABACALERA for any damage incurred by reason of double payment of 
the said bonds should the same be paid twice because they came into the hands of 
third parties, far from implying any reluctance or unwillingness to accept 
payment of the bonds would appear to show willingness, not to say active 
interest, even desire to accept payment. Why should ARANETA INC. go out of its 
way and make said undertaking? It did not have the bonds in question because 
they were being kept in the United States. That would have been a good excuse 
for not presenting them for payment even if actually notified and called upon to 
present them. Furthermore, in the letter of ARANETA INC. to the Bank of the 
Philippine Islands asking for the delivery of the bonds deposited with it, it 
said that ARANETA INC. needed those bonds in order to cash them (cobro) or have 
them paid. It did not say that they were being demanded by TABACALERA or 
AZUCARERA. Besides, in 1943, the Japanese military notes were about at par with 
the Philippine peso, perhaps slightly less in value. The trial court said that 
the ratio was 1.50 military notes for one genuine Philippine peso, although in 
the case of Hernaez et al., v. McGrath et al., G.R. No. L-4044, July 9, 1952, 
this Tribunal held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The disparity in value, if any, between Japanese war notes and the 
Philippine peso in February 1943 was not great, however. According to the 
Ballantyne conversion table, the exchange ratio between the two currencies in 
February 1943 was P1.00 to P1.10. It is to be kept in mind that this scale did 
not pretend to be exact. The ratio could have been still even.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there could not have been much, if any, valid objection to accepting 
Japanese military notes in payment. In fact, ARANETA INC. itself was paying its 
own employees in the same military currency.</p>
<p>As to the validity of payment during occupation of pre-war obligations in 
Japanese military notes and the alleged reluctance of creditors in accepting 
said payments, we have uniformly held that said payments were valid –</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Under the applicable law and uniform decisions of this Court, however, the 
payment was enforceable irrespective of the attitude of the creditor. The debtor 
or his successor-in-interest had the right to pay the mortgage in Japanese war 
notes, which were the authorized currency in circulation, not to say the only 
currency available. In other words, the payment would have released the mortgage 
even if it had been tendered by the mortgagor personally and had been turned 
down by the mortgagee. That was the unfortunate situation into which thousands 
of prewar creditors were thrust by the war, most of them being forced to accept 
Japanese military notes when these were little better than useless. Four-square 
with this case is Reyes v. Zaballero, G.R. No. L-3561, May 23, 1951, in which 
the debt was paid in December, 1944.” (<u>Hernaez et al. vs. McGrath et al., 
supra</u>.)</p>
<p>“When the payment was tendered and consigned by the debtors and accepted by 
the creditors, the same was due and demandable, and the only currency then in 
circulation was the Japanese fiat money. Not to pay their debts at that time in 
the only money then in circulation, the plaintiffs would subject themselves to a 
lawsuit and possible loss of their property. Certainly, they would have to 
continue paying a high rate of interest.</p>
<p>“Payments of pre-war debts in Japanese war notes have been uniformly held 
valid and effective to discharge the obligations if the contract did not specify 
the currency with which the debt was to be satisfied and was silent as to the 
date of maturity. On the authority of these decisions it was immaterial whether 
duress or coercion, general or specific, was exerted on the creditors.” 
(<u>Gustilo et al. vs. Jagunap et al., G.R. No. L-4249, November 20, 
1951</u>)</p></blockquote>
<p>From whatever angle we view the payment of the bonds in question, the only 
legitimate conclusion is that it was valid and properly made by the plaintiffs. 
The bonds were matured and due for payment and AZUCARERA was authorized to 
redeem them. Even if ARANETA INC. refused to accept payment in defiance of the 
notices and proclamations issued by the Japanese military occupant, plaintiffs 
could have consigned the value of said bonds in court and said consignment would 
have released them from its obligations.<span class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>As to the attorney’s fees in the amount of P5,000.00 awarded the plaintiffs, 
we also agree with the trial court that said bonds having been duly and validly 
paid in 1943, AZUCARERA had every right to their possession and ARANETA INC. was 
justified in withholding them. Not only this, in its letter to TABACALERA dated 
July 23, 1943, ARANETA INC. undertook and promised to deliver said bonds as soon 
as it received them. Far from complying with this undertaking, it is not only 
refused to give them up but directed its lawyers, RAMIREZ &amp; ORTIGAS, to 
collect their value. Under these circumstances, we believe that the trial court 
was justified in awarding damages in the form of attorney’s fees. The same thing 
may be said about awarding damages for the annual premiums on the surety bond 
filed by plaintiffs.</p>
<p>As to the claim of plaintiffs that the attorney’s fees fixed by it at 
P10,000.00 should not have been reduced to 5,000.00, we do not feel warranted in 
disturbing the discretion of the trial court on this point.</p>
<p>We deem it unnecessary to discuss and pass upon the other questions raised in 
the appeal.</p>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, and finding no reversible error in the decision 
appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>
