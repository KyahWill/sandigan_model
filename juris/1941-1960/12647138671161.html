				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from an order of the fourth branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila in  the following consulta", or query, submitted by the Register of Deeds of Rizal:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On  December 18, 1951, Atty. Fortunato G. Ignacio, R-415 Dona Mercedes Bldg., Plaza Miranda,  Manila, presented in  this office for registration a deed  of sale  executed by  Catalino  Milan  in favor of Enrique C. Lopez et al., covering a certain  parcel of land situated in  Caloocan,  Rizal,  covered by  transfer certificate  of title No. 12629  in  the  name of said Catalino Milan.  A  true  copy of said  deed of sale is herewith attached as Exhibit 'A'.</p>
  <p>"Much earlier,  that is  on April 4, 1949,  Nelly  Ymzon  Ricaza, 1487 Int. 1-B, San Andres, Manila,  presented in  this  Office for registration two orders of the  Court of First Instance  of Rizal (Caloocan  Branch) in which the Register of Deeds  of Rizal was ordered to cancel transfer certificate of title No. 64681,  in the name of Eliseo Ymzon (issued  by the  Register  of Deeds of Manila  during the Japanese  occupation)  and  to issue  in lieu  thereof a  new certificate  of title  in  the name of Hi Caiji, 9/10,  and the heirs of  Eliseo Ymzon, 1/10, and  to annotate in the new  title an interest in the property of Nelly Ymzon, in the amount of P5,000. True copies of the  orders are  herewith attached as Exhibits 'B' and  "C".  These orders were denied registration because the originial transfer certificate of title  No. 64681 could  not be found in the office of the  Register of Deeds  of Manila  and  the  owner's duplicate also  was not presented to this office.</p>
  <p>"The property covered by transfer certificate of title No. 12629 in the name of Catalino  Milan and that covered by transfer certificate of title No. 64681, in the name of Eliseo Ymzon, (the latter title as mentioned in the order's  of the Court of  First  Instance  of Rizal [Caloocan Branch]) is the same and identical parcel of land. The  said two  titles both came from transfer  certificate of  title No.  21860—transfer  certificate  of  title.No.  64681 having been issued by the Register of Deeds of Manila during the Japanese occupation  and transfer certificate of title No. 12629 having been issued by the Register of  Deeds of Rizal after  liberation from the judicially reconstituted transfer certificate' of title No. 21860.</p>
  <p>"Now,  my  doubt  is whether  I should  disregard the two  orders of the Court of First Instance of Rizal  (Caloocan  Branch) with regard to the existence  of transfer certificate of title  No.  6468V in the name of Eliseo Ymzon, and proceed with  the registration of the deed  of sale executed by  Catalino Milan  in favor of Enrique C. Lopez  et al., or whether I should  deny registration of the said deed of sale  executed by Catalino. Milan in favor of Enrique C. Lopez  et  al.,  and wait until transfer certificate  of title No. 64681 has been cancelled by a  competent court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heirs  of  Hi Caiji and Eliseo Ymzon  objected to the  registration of  the aforementioned  deed  of sale, executed by Catalino Milan in favor  of Enrique  Lopez,  on December 17,  1951, upon the ground that said reconstitution of transfer certificate of title No. 21860—which paved the way to  the issuance of  transfer certificate of title  No. 12629 in the  name of Catalino Milan—had been "secured fraudulently and  thru false representations" and "is null and  void for  lack  of the notice required by law"  (Record on  Appeal,  pp.  32-42).  Passing  upon the  issues  thus raised, the  Court  of  First  Instance  of Manila issued,  on February 2,  1952,  the following order.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It appearing from the 'Consulta' of the Register of Deeds of Rizal as  well as in the  memoranda presented by the parties that the  matter in  dispute refers to the  validity  and legality of the issuance of a new title in the name of Catalino Milan by virtue of the orders of the Court  of First Instance of Rizal dated June  11, and August 14,  1951; it  appearing  furthermore that the said  orders have been issued by a  competent  court of equal,  if not superior, and coordinate  jurisdiction with this court, which  orders have become  final and have been executed, and  it appearing lastly that the oppositor has an adequate and proper  remedy by instituting a separate and independent action, the said 'Consulta' is hereby decided in the sense that the Register of Deeds may give due course to the deed of sale executed by the registered owner in  whose name a transfer certificate of title  has been issued, provided that all legal formalities  with respect thereto have been complied with, and  the present order has become  final."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On motion  of  Catalirio Milan,  this order was  implemented by smother of February  15, 1952, the pertinent part of which  states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Considering the fact that the  Register of Deeds of Rizal  does not intend to appeal from the order of this court dated February 2, 1952,  and that the other parties did hot appear to  oppose  the petition  in  spite of the fact that they have been  furnished with copies of the, petition and notified  of its hearing and considering further that the rights of said  other  parties shall not be prejudiced  in  the event  that  the said order  be enforced  immediately insofar as  their  right to  institute a separate  and independent action is safeguarded in that  order, the  Register of  Deeds of Rizal is hereby, instructed  to give immediate course to the deed of sale presented by the  said petitioner,  provided all the conditions mentioned in  the, previous order  have been  duly  complied with and that  the property covered by the new title will not  be disposed of until the finality  of the  above-mentioned order dated February 2, 1952, this condition to  be annotated on the title."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heirs of Hi 'Caiji and those  of Eliseo Ymzon have appealed from  these  orders, and  their  counsel  now  asserts, in his belief,  that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The lower court erred  in issuing its orders of February 2 and 15, 1952  and thus  ordering the  registration of  the  deed  of sale presented by Enrique Lopez  et al. even under the conditions stated in the order of February  15, 1952."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  support of this lone  assignment  of error, appellants maintain  that  the order of  the  Court of First Instance of Rizal,  dated February 1,  1949, the dispositive part  of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Wherefore</em>, the court  approves  the  petition  for reconstitution and orders the Register of Deeds  of Rizal to reconstitute the original of transfer certificate  of the title No.  21860 on the basis of the description and other  data  appearing on  T.C.T.  No. 21013, with<em> the reservation that said certificate of title as reconstituted is without prejudice  to any  claim  of any party whose right or interest in the property was duly  noted in the original at the time it  was lost  or  destroyed,  but  entry  or notation  of which  has Hot been made on the reconstituted title. </em>The corresponding  owner's duplicate of the reconstituted certificate  shall be issued in favor of the  registered owner.  The lost original and owner's duplicate of the  title in question are hereby  declared cancelled and null and void."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is null  and void, it  having been  issued without complying with section 13  of  Republic Act No. 26,  which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  court  shall cause  a notice of the petition, filed under the preceding  section, to be published, at the expense  of the petitioner twice in successive issues  of the <em>Official Gazette,</em> and to be  posted on the main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal building of the municipality or city in which the land  is situated, at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing.   The  court shall likewise cause a copy  of  the notice  to be sent, by registered mail or otherwise, at the expense  of the petitioner, to every person  named therein  whose address is  known, at least  thirty days prior  to the date of hearing.   Said  notice shall  state among other things, the number of the lost or  destroyed certificate of title,  if known, the name of the registered owner, the names  of the occupants or  persons in possession of the property, the owners of the adjoining properties and all other interested parties, the location,  area and boundaries  of  the property,  and  the  date  on  which  all persons  having any  interest therein must appear and file their claim or  objection to the petition.  The  petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit proof of the publication, posting and service of the notice as  directed by the  court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellants alleged, relying upon a certification of a deputy clerk  of the Court  of First  Instance  of  Rizal, that the  hearing of  Milan's  petition for reconstitution,  which led  to the issuance of  said order  of February 1,  1949, "was  held  without  notice thereof  having  been  made  by either  publication or otherwise,  except by personal  notice to the Register of  Deeds of Rizal."   (Record on  Appeal, p. 39.)</p>
<p>It should  be noted, however, that this is not an "action" in the sense of  "an  ordinary suit in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong as the  expression  is defined in the  Rules of Court (Bule 2, Section 1).  Neither is this a special proceeding, for  we are not concerned with the grant of  any "remedy" or relief  (do. do.; Rule 73).  All we  have before us is a  consultation of the Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal—pursuant  to  section 200 of  the  Revised  Administrative Code—who  is  "in  doubt" on  the question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Is  the deed of sale executed by Catalino Milan  in favor of Enrique C. Lopez et al. registerable, under the circumstances?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, said officer wants to know whether it is proper for him—in the performance of his  official duties— to register said deed of sale.  In deciding such  question, the Court must  place itself in  the position  of the Register of Deeds of Rizal,  whose functions  (under the  Torrens system) are generally regarded as ministerial only (sections  193 to 198, Revised Administrative Code; Land Titles and  Deeds,,  by  A.  Noblejas,  [1953  ed.],  pp. 155-156). Obviously,  said  officer has  ho power  to  pass  upon  the legality of  an order issued by a court  of justice, much  less of a Judge of First Instance, for registers of deeds are, "for  administrative purposes, *  * * under  the  General Land Registration Office" (section 192[a], Revised Administrative Code),,the head of which is  "deemed to be clerk of the  fourth branch of the Court of First Instance of the Sixth Judicial District  (City of Manila) in the exercise of the functions conferred upon said branch or the judge thereof in  matters  relating  to the  registration of land," as well as "chief clerk of all Courts of  First  Instance, save in the Sixth Judicial District  (City of Manila) insofar as it concerns the discharge of functions conferred by  law upon  such courts of judges thereof  on matters  relating ta the  registration  of land * * * (section 176,  Revised Administrative Code),   In other ,Fprd&amp; the Register of Deeds of Rizal is subordinate to an official, who, in turn, is subordinate to the Judges of  First Instance of Rizal.</p>
<p>Said lack of authority becomes more apparent when we consider that the Court  of  First  Instance  of Rizal  was* admittedly,  competent to entertain the petition for reconstitution above referred to, the  only question nbw raised being the  regularity of  the  proceedings  in connection therewith and the effect of the  irregularity  allegedly committed therein upon the validity of the order of February 1, 1949.  The determination of such issue demands  the exercise of judicial power in an ordinary "action".  It is beyond  the  scope of our jurisdiction in  dealing with the consultation submitted by the Register of Deeds of Rizal, who thereby seeks advice on how  he, <em>as an officer of the Court,</em>   shall discharge  his  administrative or  executive duties in relation to the deed of sale in question.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  without  prejudice to  such proceedings  as may be proper and to such measures as  appellants herein may deem fit to  take in order to protect,  in  the meantime, their alleged rights, the orders  appealed  from are hereby affirmed, with  the  costs  of this  instance against  said appellants.  It  is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,  J.  B. L.,</em>  and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
