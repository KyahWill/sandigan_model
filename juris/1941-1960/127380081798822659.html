				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Petitioners Benguet Consolidated, Inc. and Balatoc
Mining Co., are engaged in the raining industry, developing and
operating under joint management a number of mining claims in the
sub-province of Benguet, Mountain Province, where they employ
approximately 6,000 workers. These workers are distributed in the five
camps known as Balatoc Camp, Antamok Mining Camp, Acupan Mining Camp,
Bobok Timber Project, and Irisan Lime quarry. Their operations are as
follows:</p>
<p align="justify">Balatoc: This camp is operated jointly by the
companies. In it are located the mills, administration offices,
warehouses and shops of the companies.</p>
<p align="justify">Antamok Mining Camp:—This department conducts the
underground and surface operations of the Ant amok Fines. Ore taken
from this mine is sent to Balatoc where it is milled.</p>
<p align="justify">Acupan Mining Camp:—This department also conducts
mining operations. Ore dug from its mines is sent to Balatoc and
likewise milled there.</p>
<p align="justify">Bobok Timber Project: This department produces timber and lumber for the exclusive use of the Benguet-Balatoc Mining Companies.</p>
<p align="justify">Irisan Lime Quarry:— This department or unit produces lime to be used principally for the companies' milling purposes.</p>
<p align="justify">On December 9, 1953, the Court of Industrial
Relations issued an order (Cases Nos. 3-MC and 9-MC) declaring the said
camps as separate bargaining units. In a certification election
subsequently held, the Benguet-Balatoc Workers Union won at Balatoc,
Antamok, Acupan and Bobok camps and the United Mine Workers Union at
the Irisan camp. Accordingly, the said court certified these two unions
as the exclusive bargaining agencies in their respective camps.</p>
<p align="justify">The Bobok Lumber Jack Association (which was
organized and registered in 1954) filed, a petition with the Court of
Industrial Relations on January 24, 1955, praying that a certification
election be ordered in the Bobok Timber Project (Case No. 225-MC). On
February 19, 1955, a similar petition (No. 235-MC) was filed by the
Benguet Consolidated Mining Company Laborers Union, praying that a
certification election be held in the Acupan, Antamok and Balatoc
canps. In its turn, the Benguet-Balatoc Workers Union filed on March
14, 1955, a petition (Case No. 231-MC) praying that the aforesaid five
camps be declared an employer unit and that it be certified as the
exclusive representative of all the employees therein.</p>
<p align="justify">In their joint answer to the said petitions, the
petitioning companies agreed to the holding of a certification election
but prayed that its five camps be merged into one employer unit.</p>
<p align="justify">The three petitions were heard jointly. On May 29,
1956, the Court of Industrial Relations issued sn order holding that it
finds no valid reason to change the status of the petitioners' five
camps as separate bargaining units. According to this court, while "the
history of collective bargaining by this different unions with
management and the functional interdependence of the different
departments of work to each other would indicate that the employer unit
is the appropriate unit", there are other factors favoring the
maintenance of the five camps as separate bargaining units. These
factors, the court held, are the distribution of the workers in the
five different camps, which are separated from each other by some
distance, the presence of a superintendent, and the difference in the
nature of the work in each camp.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners companies and the Benguet-Balatoc
Workers Union moved for the reconsideration of the said order, but the
Court of Industrial Relations denied the request. Hence these appeals,
which raise the issue whether or not the five camps should be combined
into a single employer unit for collective bargaining purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">In concluding that the system of having one
collective bargain unit for each camp (as decided in 1953 in cases Nos.
3-MC and 9-MC) should be maintained and continued, the industrial court
found as follows: that such system had operated satisfactorily; that
the prime and decisive element in determining whether a given group of
employees constitutes a proper bargaining unit is whether it will,
without inequity to the employer, best serve all employees in the
exercise of their bargaining rights; that in the present case,the
separation between the camps (which extends to 60 kms. between the
Antamok and Acupan camps) and the different kind of work in each
(except Acupan and Antamok) all militate in favor of the present system
of separate bargaining units, since the problems and interest of the
workers are peculiar in each camp or department. The court also found
that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">"As the union officials will
undoubtedly come from each unit, they will be in a much better position
to know what is best for their members than those who would come from
other units, if the employer unit were to be held appropriate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The findings and reasoning of the Court of
Industrial Relation appear cogent and warrant the conclusion it has
arrived at. There is no ground for altering a system that takes into
account the different nature of the work in the various camps, as well
as the necessity of the laborers' representatives being familiar with
the peculiar problems of each camp, specially since such a system has
hitherto worked satisfactorily.</p>
<p align="justify">The main argument of the appellants is that if the
five camps are not integrated into a single bargaining unit, a strike
in any one of the camps, even the smallest, could paralyze the
operations of all. But this possibility already existed even before the
1953 decisions that implanted the present system of separate
representation for each camp; and yet these appellants assented to said
decisions, and did not seek to have them reversed by the superior
courts. Nor have the appellants shown that new factors have arisen since then to increase or enhance the danger of stoppages. On
the contrary, new facts that have subsequently arisen are the
organization of purely local unions (such as respondent Bobok Lumber
Jack Association) that do not claim to represent workers in the other
camps; and their existence emphasizes the local laborers'
non-conformity with inter-camp organizations.</p>
<p align="justify">Considering that certification proceedings are Investigatory in nature, since—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">"the object of the proceedings is
not the decision of any alleged commission of wrongs nor asserted
deprivation of rights but is merely the determination of proper
bargaining units and the ascertainment of the will and choice of the
employees in respect of the selection of a bargaining representative.
The determination of the proceedings does not entail the entry of
remedial orders or redress of rights, but culmination solely in an
official designation of bargaining units and an affirmation of the
employees' expressed choice of bargaining agent." (Rothenberg on Labor
Relations, pp. 514-515; Labor Laws by Francisco, 3rd ed., Vol. I, p.
458);</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">taking into account that the conduct of such
proceedings has bean entrusted specifically to the Court of Industrial
Relations (R. A. 875, sec. 12), and that they should be expedited as
much as possible, this Court should not interfere with the discretion
and judgment of that specialized tribunal in connection with such
proceeding at least in the absence of clear and patent abuse that in.
this case has not been shown to exist.</p>
<p align="justify">The orders appealed from are affirmed. Costs against appellants. So Ordered.</p>
