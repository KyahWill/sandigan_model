				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Prosecuted for robbery with homicide, Leonora Camias was found 
guilty of murder and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> to pay the 
heirs of the deceased P4,000.00 as indemnity jointly and severally with 
her two co-accused, and proportionate share of the costs.  Charged with 
the appellant as co-principals and likewise found guilty of murder were 
Julian Capulao and Prudencio Concha who did not appeal.
  <p>    Teodora Dongon, deceased's 80-year old mother, testified in 
substance as follows:</p>
  <p>    One day in March, 1950, Camias came to her house and asked from
 her son P50.00 which the witness handed Camias.  For the first time she
 heard from her son that he was going to marry the appellant.  Rizaldo, 
her son, told her that Camias demanded as consideration for the marriage
 a carabao and a sewing machine.</p>
  <p>    On May 9, Camias came back, this time with Capulao, and invited
 the deceased to come with her and buy the promised carabao and sewing 
machine.  It was 11:00 o'clock in the morning.  Her son was away selling
 tuba and did not arrive until 12:00 o'clock.  After eating Leonora told
 her son that they should be going.  Then Rizaldo asked his mother for 
money and she gave him P250.00.  Besides this amount, she knew that her 
son had loose money in his pocket.  After counting the money, Rizaldo 
handed it over to Leonora and the three left, saying that they would be 
back soon.</p>
  <p>    But Rizaldo did not return, and on the morning of the next day,
 after looking in vain for him, the mother called on the chief of police
 of Silay, Romulo Lopez, and told him all that had happened.</p>
  <p>    The chief of police testified that the three defendants were 
later arrested, Camias two or three days ahead of her co-accused, and 
all admitted that they had killed Rizaldo.  Camias' declaration was 
reduced to writing.</p>
  <p>    Camias gave the chief of police this story, which corroborated 
Teodora Dongon's in some of its details:</p>
  <p>    On May 1, 1950, at about 10:00 o'clock, she went with Julian 
Capulao to Benjamin Rizaldo's house at Hacienda Tanza.  On the way, she 
and Capulao stopped at the house of Prudencio Concha and told Concha to 
wait for them in town in the afternoon.  In Rizaldo's house, she 
introduced Capulao to the deceased as her uncle and told Rizaldo that 
there was a carabao and a sewing machine for sale for P250.00.  She 
requested Rizaldo to buy that carabao and that machine for her, and 
Rizaldo's mother gave her P250.00.  Then she, Rizaldo and Capulao went 
to Hacienda Binonga passing through Silay where they picked up Prudencio
 Concha who was waiting for them.</p>
  <p>    Before crossing a stream in that hacienda she told Capulao to 
carry Rizaldo on the back, and in the middle of the river she shouted to
 Prudencio Concha to hit Rizaldo.  Concha was provided with a pipe and 
struck the deceased with it on the nape.  Rizaldo fell into the water in
 consequence of the blow, whereupon Capulao took a sugarcane and beat 
Rizaldo, too.  Noticing that Rizaldo was not yet dead, Camias hit him 
with her umbrella and told Concha to stab him with his scissors to be 
sure that he was dead; Concha stabbed Rizaldo in the heart.  Then they 
carried the body to the bank of the river and buried it in the sand.</p>
  <p>    The other defendants made similar statements to the chief of 
police.</p>
  <p>    Besides her confession, the chief of police found in the house 
where appellant lived, an undelivered letter signed by her and addressed
 to Julian Capulao.  It was dated April 19.  In that letter she told 
Capulao, among other matters, that "this horrible old man" was rich and 
wanted to marry her; that her "mind is troubled as to how and by what 
means I could free myself from him" that she would "give him a pretext" 
that she would attend a dance at her relative's house where she was 
invited.  She pleaded with Capulao to "tell uncle Prudencio to help me 
in case I bring this man because I want that he will be bound by you."  
She assured Capulao that "nobody will look for him because once he will 
be bound by you I will kill him."</p>
  <p>    Capulao and Concha after their arrest accompanied Mauricio 
Giguera, municipal policeman, to Hacienda Binonga, Silay, and found 
Rizaldo's body already in a state of decomposition on the bank of a 
creek.  At the same place the patrolman also found the pipe with which 
Concha had struck the deceased and Rizaldo's hat and shoes.</p>
  <p>    Leonora Camias who gave her age as 18 denied at the trial 
having committed the crime.  She said she did not remember having 
written Exhibit "D", and denied that the signature thereon was hers.  
She denied having borrowed P50.00 from Teodora Dongon in March.  She 
said the money was given to her with the request that she buy <i>tuba.</i>
 She denied that she had gone back to Rizaldo's house in May or received
 from his mother P250.00 to buy a sewing machine and a carabao.  She 
said that she had known Rizaldo since March and admitted that Rizaldo 
told her that he loved her.  She declared that on May 1 Rizaldo took her
 to the movie downtown and they left the show about 11:00 o'clock in the
 morning.  On the way home they met Julian Capulao, and when Rizaldo saw
 her and Capulao talking and walking together, he got jealous, 
approached Capulao, grabbed him by shirt, and was about to box her uncle
 when she tried to pacify the deceased.  She said Benjamin Rizaldo did 
not heed her intervention and proceeded to give her uncle blows.</p>
  <p>    The mere recital of the prosecution's evidence is enough to 
show appellant's guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  Appellant's 
confession, fully confirmed as it was by Teodora Dongon's testimony, by 
her co-defendants' confessions, and by the discovery of Rizaldo's body 
and of the articles with which, according to her, the deceased had been 
slain, was as strong and overwhelming as her denial in court was weak 
and unconvincing.</p>
  <p>    Appellant was 17 years of age at the time of the commission of 
the crime.  Pursuant to Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, by which 
she is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of minority, the proper 
penalty is <i>prison mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion 
temporal</i> in its medium period, to be imposed in its maximum period 
in view of the presence of the aggravating circumstances of craft and 
evident premeditation, or from 14 years eight months and one day to 17 
years and four months of <i>reclusion temporal.</i> Pursuant to the 
indeterminate sentence law, she should be sentenced to an indeterminate 
penalty of from 10 years of <i>prison mayor</i> to 17 years and four 
months of <i>reclusion temporal.</i></p>
  <p>    With this modification, the appealed judgment is affirmed, with
 costs against the appellant.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
