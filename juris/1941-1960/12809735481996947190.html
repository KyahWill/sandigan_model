				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Pedro Rivera, a special policeman at the Canlubang Sugar Estate, 
Calamba, Laguna, while patrolling the premises of his employer on 
February 23, 1949, was shot and killed.  Autopsy having been performed, 
Dr. Eusebio P. Pañganiban, president of the sanitary division with 
residence at Calamba, found on the body of the deceased three gunshot 
wounds which he described as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"(a) Posterior right lumbar, three wounds, gun shot, 1 cm. 
diameter.</p>
    <p>"(b) Anterior left lumbar; 2 wounds, lumbar left. 1-½ cm. 
diameter, respectively.  Epigastric wound 1-½ cm. diameter."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The complaint filed by the chief of police with the justice of 
the peace of Calamba charged Bonifacio Plaza, Gelacio Palma, Dionisio 
Terrible, Eladio Lacatan, Adriano Pesquiza and Pedro Magnaye with the 
killing, but Plaza, Terrible and Lacatan were at large, while Gelacio 
Palma was omitted from the information lodged with the Court of First 
Instance on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence to convict, 
leaving Pesquiza and Magnaye the only defendants to be brought to trial.
  Further elimination occurred with the acquittal of Magnaye after the 
trial.  This appeal is by Pesquiza who has found guilty as charged and 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of 17 years, four months and one day of 
reclusion temporal with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased in the amount of P6,000, and to pay one-half of 
the costs.</p>
  <p>    Direct evidence for the prosecution consists of testimony of 
Gaudencio Rivera, deceased's son, and Pesquiza's confessions.</p>
  <p>    Gaudencio Rivera declared that from a distance of about 20 
meters from where his father dropped dead, he heard gunshots and saw 
Adriano Pesquiza, Pedro Magnaye and Dionisio Terrible fun off.  He said 
that there were three other persons who also ran away, but did not 
recognize them.  Pesquiza and Magnaye, according to the witness, were 
carrying a firearm each but he could not tell what kind of weapons they 
were.</p>
  <p>    We do not believe that this witness was present at the scene of
 the crime or, if he was, that he recognized his father's assailants.  
It is to be noted that the crime was committed about seven p.m.  The 
admitted fact that Rivera did not tell the authorities the name of any 
of the assailants until arrests had been made about six months later, 
and that not even to his sister with whom he and his father lived and 
who, after his father was killed, was his only house companion, did he 
disclose the identity of any of the accused, is hardly compatible with 
the veracity of his statements at the trial.  The prosecution's own 
evidence shows that all that time police operatives were making 
investigations to discover the criminals and questioned this young man 
among other persons.</p>
  <p>    The appellant's confession, however, which was made to 
Philippine Constabulary Lieutenant Pablo T. Mendoza in the form of 
questions and answers, was taken down by Sergeant Nicasio de los Reyes 
of the same organization, and sworn to before Assistant Provincial 
Fiscal David Carreon in the latter's office, establishes appellant's 
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p>    In this confession Pesquiza stated in substance that he and 
Magnaye had shot Rivera with carbines which they had borrowed from 
Bonifacio Plaza and Gelacio Palma respectively.  Asked why he killed 
Rivera, he answered that the deceased had threatened to shoot him, and 
did in fact shoot at him with a Garand four days before.  He stated 
further that the last-mentioned incident arose from Rivera's suspicion 
that he had been stealing coconuts of the company and from the fact that
 the owed Rivera P10.00.</p>
  <p>    Lieutenant Mendoza, Sergeant De los Reyes and Fiscal Carreon 
all swore that appellant's confession had been made without any threat, 
violence, or offer of reward of any kind.  Aside from Pesquiza's 
unsupported testimony, which is none too convincing, the record 
discloses no proof or indication that his confession was otherwise than 
free and voluntary, as the three prosecution witnesses declared.</p>
  <p>    Corroborating, albeit indirectly, the above confession was 
Chief of Police Dizon's testimony, which has not been denied, to the 
effect that when he arrested the appellant the latter made to him a 
similar admission, which, he said, was the reason why he turned Pesquiza
 over to the Constabulary.</p>
  <p>    It is significant that Bonifacio Plaza and Gelacio Palma owned 
licensed carbines, which were confiscated by the constabulary following 
Pesquiza's and Magnaye's confessions, and that no witness was put on the
 stand to confirm Pesquiza's evidence that he was in the poblacion of 
Calamba and arrived at his sister's home where he lived only after 
Rivera was slain.</p>
  <p>    As to the motives for the killing, Trinidad Rivera supplied 
corroborative proof.  Trinidad Rivera, 30-year old daughter of the 
deceased, swore that on the morning of the fatal date, she tried to 
collect from Pesquiza a debt — P11.87 — for merchandise bought at her 
store on credit; that Pesquiza on that occasion instead of paying got 
angry; that she complained to her father, whereupon the deceased with 
her looked for Pesquiza at his home where there was "an exchange of 
words" between the two men and Pesquiza told Rivera that some day he 
"will face".  She further said that her father was disliked by the 
workers at the Canlubang Sugar Estate because he was strict with those 
who had been stealing coconuts and working animals of the company.</p>
  <p>    The crime of murder was committed without the concurrence of 
any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, and the corresponding 
penalty should be <i>reclusion perpetua.</i> The appealed sentence is 
hereby so modified, with costs against the defendant-appellant.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, 
Reyes, Jugo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.<br> 
    <i>Bautista Angelo</i>,<em> J.</em>, no part.</p>
