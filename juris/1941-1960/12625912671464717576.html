				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for review of a&nbsp; resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals, dismissing an appeal of the petitioner against an order&nbsp; of&nbsp; seizure issued by the Collector of Customs of Manila.<br><br>On&nbsp; September 19, 1955, the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs of Manila ordered&nbsp; the forfeiture in favor of the Government of 7,166 bales and&nbsp; bundles&nbsp; of old newspaper consigned to the Shanghai Ting Ting Soy Factory for failure of the importers to secure a release certificate of the said merchandise in accordance with Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 of the Central&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; and&nbsp; as&nbsp; said&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; had already been released to consignee under surety&nbsp; bonds,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the forfeiture of the latter. Copy of this decision was furnished the Shanghai Ting Ting Soy Factory on October 24, 1955.&nbsp; As no appeal to the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs was presented within 15 days,&nbsp; the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs required&nbsp; the importer&nbsp; to pay the amount&nbsp; of the&nbsp; surety bonds filed to secure the release of said merchandise.&nbsp; On December 5,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; importer moved to reconsider the order demanding payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; amounts of the surety bonds,&nbsp; explaining that its failure to appeal from the decision&nbsp; of the Collector of Customs within&nbsp; 15 days&nbsp; as provided for&nbsp; by law was caused&nbsp; by belief on its part that full period of 30 days&nbsp; is&nbsp; granted for the&nbsp; said&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>The Collector of Customs&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration.&nbsp; Appeal&nbsp; against the&nbsp; order and the order of denial was made to&nbsp; the Commissioner of Customs but the latter also denied and dismissed the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; A petition for review was filed with the Court of Tax Appeals, but this court in&nbsp; a resolution dated&nbsp; January 4,&nbsp; 1957, also dismissed the&nbsp; petition on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction because the petitioner failed to appeal within the time provided for&nbsp; by law.&nbsp; It is against this order of the Court of Tax Appeals that the present petition is presented.<br><br>The petition admits that a copy of the decision of the Collector of Customs&nbsp; was&nbsp; furnished the petitioner on October 24, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he claims that he believed from the notice received from the Collector of Customs that" the period within&nbsp; which he should appeal was 30 days from the date of demand for payment; that his failure to appeal within 15&nbsp; days&nbsp; was due to an honest mistake. This is the gist of the brief&nbsp; in his behalf by his&nbsp; counsel. It is argued in support of this claim that a rule of procedure may&nbsp; be&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp; if it&nbsp; does not involve a public policy and when a lapse&nbsp; in&nbsp; procedure arises&nbsp; from an&nbsp; honest mistake or an&nbsp; unforseen event not prejudicial to the adverse party.&nbsp; We find no merit in&nbsp; this argument.&nbsp; The period&nbsp; of 15&nbsp; days&nbsp; prescribed by law for an appeal in cases of&nbsp; forfeiture&nbsp; is&nbsp; not a matter&nbsp; of procedure which courts may ignore.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; provisions of the customs law, like those of the internal revenue code, are not directory merely but mandatory.&nbsp; The period for an appeal is fixed by&nbsp; law at 15&nbsp; days&nbsp; in order that penalties for violation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws or rules&nbsp; on importation may be promptly enforced.&nbsp; Questions involving forfeiture should be decided&nbsp; promptly&nbsp; and expeditiously, as delays therein&nbsp; may result in the clogging of customs warehouses with merchandise&nbsp; illegally imported.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is beyond the power of the courts to extend the period for appeal.&nbsp; The Commissioner of Customs&nbsp; and the Court of Tax Appeals acted correctly in dismissing the appeal of the petitioner, as it was not filed within the period of 15 days&nbsp; prescribed by law.<br><br>It&nbsp; is also argued that the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs has already authorized the appeal in its letter of March 19, 1956 when said&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; said therein:&nbsp; "This Office considers the same meritorious and&nbsp; the&nbsp; said appeal&nbsp; will be given due course."&nbsp; All that the Commissioner of Customs means is that he gives due course to the appeal, meaning, that he will allow the appeal to&nbsp; be&nbsp; prosecuted&nbsp; to the Court of Tax Appeals.&nbsp; Appeal to the Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals is a matter of right on the part of any party who claims to have&nbsp; been prejudiced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to appeal&nbsp; is granted by, law&nbsp; and the right&nbsp; does not&nbsp; depend upon the correctness of the order appealed&nbsp; from.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in this sense that the Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs allowed the appeal&nbsp; and permitted the petition for review to be filed in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals.&nbsp; This order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs cannot&nbsp; have the&nbsp; effect of waiving&nbsp; the provision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law requiring that an&nbsp; appeal from the decision of&nbsp; the Collector of Customs on&nbsp; forfeiture must be filed within 15&nbsp; days.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals dismissing the appeal is hereby affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
