follows:
<p align="center">PROSECUTION</p>
<ol><li>Eusebio Abria, 20, single, farmer, Jinangutdan, Santa Rita, 
Samar.—On October 3, 1946, he was in the provincial jail, detained for illegal 
possession of firearm, but his case was dismissed. Ignacio Lagata was a 
provincial guard. Six prisoners were then assigned to work in the capitol's 
plaza: Jesus, Tipace, Eusebio, Mariano, the witness, and Epifanio Labong. 
Lagata, their guard, ordered them to go to the nursery to pick up gabi. Not long 
afterwards, they were called to assemble. Epifanio Labong was missing. The 
nursery is near the provincial hospital in Catbalogan. The place was grassy. 
Lagata ordered the five prisoners to call Labong. (4-7). As Labong did not 
answer, Lagata ordered the five prisoners to look for him. They followed the 
trail. Upon reaching the national highway, Lagata called them. As Labong did not 
answer their call, Lagata ordered the five to look farther for him. The five 
prisoners went towards the mountain. Upon reaching a camote plantation, "I saw 
footprints. I called my companions. While we were all in the camote plantation, 
I did not know that I was shot by Ignacio Lagata. He was about four meters away 
from me. He fired at my left arm." At the time the witness was standing, one of 
his companions was at his right side and the rest were with Lagata. Tipace was 
about three or four meters behind him. All walked almost together at the moment 
because they wanted to see the footprints pointed by the witness. "At the moment 
thatjhe was hit, he immediately called the attention of Ignacio Lagata, 'Mano, I 
am wounded.' He said, 'It is because you did not approach to me.' " (8-9). "When 
I saw that he again manipulated the chamber of his gun, I ran away. When I saw 
that my other companions ran away, I ran also. I noticed that my left arm was 
wounded. When I was already sitting by the front of the coconut tree, I heard 
another gun shot." Tipace "is already dead." "I did not see him anymore. When 
Ignacio Lagata passed by where I was, I requested him to take me. He brought me 
to the Justice Building. (10). Then he brought me to the Samar provincial 
hospital. My left arm is amputated just right at the joint between the shoulder 
and the arm. It is not yet completely healed." The witness had no intention to 
run from Lagata. (11). Labong asked Lagata for permission to gather gabi. The 
other prisoners did not say anything. Lagata told them to go to the nursery. 
While they were gathering gabi, Lagata was near them. (12). But he could not see 
everybody because there was talahib growing in the place) and it was tall. The 
witness heard three shots. The second one hit him. After the first shot, "we 
were all assembled." (13-14). The witness did not see Tipace being shot. "The 
reason as to why I ran was because I was afraid that I might be shot again." 
(16). His companions were probably scared and that is why they ran. (17).<br><br></li><li>Mariano Ibañez, 25, married, detained prisoner, Zumarraga, 
Samar.—On October 3, 1946, he was in the provincial jail as a detained prisoner. 
After breakfast, six prisoners were called: Epifanio Labong, Ceferino Tipace, 
Eustaquio Galet, Jesus Mañoso, Eusebio Abria and the witness, Mariano Ibañez. 
They went at work in the plaza of the provincial jail. At about 11:00 o'clock, 
they were taking a rest and while they were taking a rest, the witness heard 
Lagata inviting the prisoners to go to the nursery to gather gabi, near the 
provincial hospital. They scattered to get gabi. "We scarsely got three gabis 
when I heard Ignacio Lagata calling us to assemble." The place was grassy with 
talahib plants growing thereon. While the prisoners were picking gabi, Lagata 
was standing by the side of a mango tree. At the call of Lagata, only five 
prisoners assembled. Labong was absent, and Lagata ordered them to call for him. 
(19-21). "Inasmuch as Epifanio Labong did not answer our call, Ignacio Lagata 
ordered us to go to the mountain and look for Epifanio Labong. Eusebio Abria 
then went to the camote plantation. He found footprints and he called Ignacio 
Lagata to inform him that he saw footprints. On account of this report of 
Eusebio Abria that he saw flattened grass and that he was unable to look for 
Epifanio Labong so Ignacio Lagata fired at him and he was hit on the left arm." 
He was at about three meters from Lagata. (22). The witness was at the left side 
of Ceferino Tipace at about two meters from Abria. Abria said, "Mano, I am 
wounded." Lagata said in turn, "Come around, assemble here." Abria came to the 
right side of Lagata. (23). "Once we were already assembled there, Ignacio 
Lagata cocked his gun and shot Ceferino Tipace and when I saw that Ceferino 
Tipace was hit then I ran away because I had in mind that had I not ran I would 
have been shot also." At the time Tipace was "standing and carrying with him on 
his left arm some gabi and when he turned to the left that was the time when he 
was shot by Ignacio Lagata. The bullet penetrated from the left side of the 
armpit and came;out from the right side of the body." Tipace was at about two 
meters then from Lagata. "At about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that day, I 
returned to the provincial jail. I did not return immediately because I was 
afraid." Tipace was killed. (23-24). One morning, Lagata gave the witness fistic 
blows on the abdominal region and kicked him at the back, because the previous 
night the witness told the prisoners not to make much noise. "I did not have 
ill-feeling because he had the right to maltreat me even if I was not at fault." 
(29). At the time they were searching for Labong, before the shooting, they were 
walking in an ordinary way, looking towards the ground, one after another, at 
about half a meter from each other. Lagata was behind all of them. (31).<br><br></li><li>Gilberto C. Rosales, 63, married, president, Sanitary 
Division, Catbalogan, Samar.—On October 17, 1946, the cadaver of Ceferino Tipace 
was exhumed. (35). The witness found in it, "A gun shot wound which went through 
the body from the lower left axillary region to the right shoulder." (36).<br><br></li><li>Eustaquio Galet, 20, married, detained prisoner.—On October 
3, 1946, he was one of the six prisoners who worked in the premises of the 
capitol building. (38). "We went to the nursery and each one of us got gabi. The 
guard, Ignacio Lagata, was under the mango tree. I was about ten meters away 
from him. It was grassy in the place where we were picking gabi. Not long after 
we were called by Ignacio Lagata because we were going home already. One was 
missing, Epifanio Labong. Ignacio Lagata ordered us to call Epifanio Labong but 
Epifanio Labong did not answer." (39). The <i>talahib</i> plants growing in the 
place "were taller than myself." Lagata ordered us to search for Epifanio 
Labong. We went around the place and then crossed the national highway and went 
up the mountain until we reached to a place where cogon grass were growing. 
Eusebio Abria and myself saw flattened grass. We informed Ignacio Lagata that 
there was a trace where a person had passed by or he may have gone that way. 
Then Ignacio Lagata fired one time. While we were searching for Epifanio Labong 
each one of us were bent and leaning looking downward. I heard a gun shot and 
that was the time when Eusebio Abria was shot and then once he was hit, he 
called Ignacio Lagata telling him, 'Mano, I am wounded,' and immediately placed 
his hand at his wound and then got near to Ignacio Lagata." (40). "Upon seeing 
that one of our companions was already shot without fault, I ran away and came 
down to the Capitol Building and then went to the provincial jail and reported 
the matter to the Sergeant of the guards." His companion then was Jesus Mañoso. 
They reached the provincial jail at about 12:00 o'clock noon. The shooting took 
place at about 11:30. (41). The witness heard Labohg ask Lagata to accompany the 
group to the nursery to gather gabi. When he was shot, Abria was bent and 
leaning his body downward to the ground while Lagata was behind him. (42). The 
witness heard the shot that killed Ceferino Tipace. "I was already descending 
near the Capitol Building that was the time when I heard the shot." (43). Jesus 
Mañoso ran away with the witness, but Ceferino Tipace and Mariano Ibañez 
remained. The treatment received by the witness from Lagata was good. (44).<br><br></li><li>Pedro Mayuga, 39, married, Chief, Samar provincial 
hospital.—On October 3, 1946, prisoner Eusebio Abria was brought to the hospital 
with a wound on the upper side of his left arm which was amputated from the 
shoulder joint. "The patient was at first given resusciting medical treatment to 
combat the shock caused by the hemorrhage and later the shoulder joint was 
disarticulated." After his arm was cut, he was confined in the hospital until 
November 6. (46-47). The wound must have been produced by a gun shot. There are 
indications that the shot was fired at close range. Very likely around five 
meters. (48). There was no possibility of saving the arm because "all the vital 
tissues were destroyed and the bone was completely cut." (49). "Powder-burn was 
noticeable in all the vital parts of the tissues destroyed from outward and 
inward." (50).</li></ol>




<p align="center">DEFENSE</p>
<ol><li>Andres Saludario, 49, married, nursery foreman, Catbalogan, 
Samar.—On October 3, 1946, he saw Lagata in the nursery guarding six prisoners. 
(53-54). The prisoners were just within the premises of the nursery just beyond 
the mango tree. Lagata was about seven meters from them and he was looking at 
them all the time. The place was grassy. The grass was about half a meter tall. 
(55). The ground near the hill was covered with cogon and <i>talahib</i>. By the 
height they could cover a man in standing position. The witness heard about the 
disappearance of prisoner Epifanio Labong. At the time, the witness was already 
far, because he had to attend to several laborers detailed at the Capitol, 
Building. When he returned from the Capitol Building, he was informed that 
Epifanio Labong disappeared. (57-59). The witness did not hear any gun shot 
explosion in the nursery. He saw the accused guarding the prisoners at about 
8:00 o'clock in the morning. (60). The witness stayed in the nursery until about 
8:30, when he came to the Capitol Building. (61).<br><br></li><li>Ignacio Lagata, 27, married, Catbalogan.—On October 3, 1946, 
he accompanied the six prisoners from the provincial jail to the plaza of the 
provincial capitol. He remained there until 10 o'clock in the morning, when he 
told them to return to the provincial jail. The six prisoners requested him to 
allow them to get some gabi in the nursery. Lagata went with them to a spot 
around the mango tree. (63-64). The grass in the place was knee-high. Lagata was 
under a mango tree about five meters from the prisoners. He was watching all of 
them. They were scattered around the mango tree. (65). While he was looking 
back, Epifanio Labong took advantage and escaped. "I did not discover that but 
when I called them to assemble I found out that one was missing. I asked the 
rest of the prisoners as to where Epifanio Labong was. I told them that what 
shall we do he is already far and they said that in that plaee there is plenty 
of gabi. I told the prisoners to go to that spot. We went there and the 
prisoners were ahead because they know the place. (66). When we arrived at the 
place, we did not see Labong and Tipace called our attention telling us that 
this is the place through which Epifanio Labong passed." The witness did not see 
the track of Epifanio Labong but the prisoners, however, were the ones who 
indicated to him the place through which Epifanio Labong passed. "I followed 
them. Up to above the national highway. When we reached up the place another 
prisoner called also our attention telling us that here is the place through 
which Labong passed and so we went up. When we reached above, they were already 
far from me. So I told them to stop because they were already far from me. They 
did not heed order to stop. Then I fired up to the air. They scattered. I could 
only see two of them. I also saw one of them running towards the mountain. So I 
fired at him." It was Eusebio Abria, and he was at about five meters from him. 
"He was going up the mountain. After I fired at Eusebio Abria, I saw him 
running. I just left him because I was looking for the rest. I saw also Ibañez 
running. He was running towards me and then around me. I called his attention 
and told him to stop from running or else lie down and give up your arm. He did 
not heed my order. I fired at him." (67-69). The witness saw Ibañez running 
before him towards the south road. He was Tipace. One minute elapsed from the 
time the witness fired at Abria to the time he fired at Ibañez. The witness 
fired a to them because he sympathizes with other policemen from whom other 
prisoners escaped. (70). "Because if it so happened that a prisoner escaped 
under my custody, I would be the one to be put in jail and if I cannot fire at 
him, I will be the one to be put in jail. "The truth is that they ran away." At 
the time he fired at Tipace and Abria, they were running away. (71). "That was 
in my mind was that if I could overtake them and not fire at them, I would meet 
the same situation as what other guards met under whose custody prisoners 
escaped and some of them were discharged from their duty." Ibañez testified 
against the accused because the latter fired at his father-in-law. (72). One 
day, the accused maltreated Ibañez. He slapped him two times. He was the only 
prisoner he slapped. (73). At the time they were looking for Labong, the 
prisoners were walking in line one meter from one to another. The accused was 
near them. (77). When he fired at Abria, the latter was about five meters from 
him and when he fired at Tipace, the latter was four meters from him. At the 
time, Tipace was running sidewise to the accused and he could see where the 
accused was. His face was facing the accused. (78). When he fired at Abria, he 
lost hope to recover Labong. "I was hopeless already." (80). The picking up of 
gabi was hot part of the work of the prisoners. (81).</li></ol>

<p align="justify">Appellant was charged with murder, serious physical injuries 
and evasion through negligence in three separate cases which have been tried 
jointly. Finding him guilty, the trial court sentenced him as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<i>a</i>) For Murder (Case No. 809)—<i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> 
with civil interdiction for life and perpetual absolute disqualification, 
indemnify the heirs of Ceferino Tipace Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000) and pay the 
costs of this action;</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>b</i>) For serious physical injuries (Case No. 810)—An 
indeterminate imprisonment of two (2) years and four (4) months as minimum to 
four (4) years, nine (9) months and ten (10) days of <i>prision correccional</i> 
as maximum and to pay the costs of this action; and</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) For evasion through negligence (Case No. 811)—An 
indeterminate imprisonment of two (2) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto 
mayor</i> as minimum to one (1) year, one (1) month and ten (10) days of 
<i>prision correccional</i> as maximum, and to pay the costs." (p. 45, 
rec.)"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The evidence is conclusive to the effect that the escape of 
prisoner Epifanio Labong was due to the negligence of the appellant. The six 
prisoners were supposed to work in the plaza of the Provincial Capitol and to 
return to jail after said work, but appellant allowed them instead to go to the 
nursery to gather gabi, without any apparent authority to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">Considering that the place was grassy and tall <i>talahib</i> 
was growing therein, the height of which could conceal persons in standing 
position, appellant must have seen immediately that it was a choice place for 
any prisoner that may want to escape. Such negligence of appellant is 
punishable, under article 224 of the Revised Penal Code, and the penalty imposed 
by the trial court is in accordance with law.</p>
<p align="justify">As regards the shooting of Abria and Tipace, we are convinced 
that the facts were as narrated by the witnesses for the prosecution. Abria was 
shot when he was only three meters away from appellant and the latter has not 
even shown that Abria attempted to escape. Tipace was also shot when he was 
about four or five meters away from appellant. The latter's allegatIon that 
Tipace was running,—conveying the idea that said prisoner was in the act of 
escaping,—appears to be inconsistent with his own testimony to the effect that 
Tipace was running sidewise, with his face looking towards appellant, and with 
the undisputed fact that Tipace was hit near one axilla, the bullet coming out 
from the opposite shoulder. If Tipace's purpose was to escape, the natural thing 
for him to do would have been to give his back to appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">The criminal responsibility of appellant regarding the killing 
of Tipace can be exacted from him on the basis of his own testimony. The way he 
fired at Tipace (whom he misnamed first as Ibañez) is described by appellant in 
the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"He was running towards me and then around me.</p>
<p align="justify">"I called his attention and told him to stop from running or 
else lie down and give up your arm. He did not heed my advice.</p>
<p align="justify">"Inasmuch as he did not heed my advice so I fired at him.</p>
<p align="justify">"His direction while he was running was not exactly towards me 
but running in front of me to the left side." (69).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Explaining his reason for firing at Abria and Tipace, appellant 
gave the following reason: "Because I sympathize with the other policemen from 
whom prisoners escaped." (70). "If it so happened that a prisoner escaped under 
my custody, I would be the one to be put in jail and if I cannot fire at him, I 
will be the one to be put in jail." (71) . (Italics ours.)</p>
<p align="justify">It is clear that Lagata had absolutely no reason to fire at 
Tipace. Lagata could have fired at him in self-defense or if absolutely 
necessary to avoid his escape. The record does not show that Tipace was bent on 
committing any act of aggression or that he attempted to escape. According to 
Lagata, "<i>he was running towards and then around me</i>." (Italic ours.) How 
could anyone in his senses imagine that Tipace intended to escape by <i>running 
towards and around the very guard</i> he was supposed to escape from?</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question that the escape of Labong scared 
appellant, according to him, because of the experience of other guards who were 
dismissed from office or even prosecuted because of prisoners who had escaped 
under their custody, and that it was his duty to fire against the prisoners if 
he wanted to be exempt from any responsibility. Even if appellant sincerely 
believed, although erroneously, that in firing the shots he acted in the 
performance of his official duty, the circumstances of the case show that there 
was no necessity for him to fire directly against the prisoners, so as to 
seriously wound one of them and kill instantaneously another. While custodians 
of prisoners should take all care to avoid the latter's escape, only absolute 
necessity would authorize them to fire against them. Theirs is the burden of 
proof as to such necessity. The summary liquidation of prisoners, under flimsy 
pretexts of attempts of escape, which has been and is being practiced in 
dictatorial systems of government, has always been and is shocking to the 
universal conscience of humanity.</p>
<p align="justify">Human life is valuable, albeit, sacred. Cain has been the 
object of unrelentless curse for centuries and millennia and his name will 
always be remembered in shame as long as there are human generations able to 
read the Genesis. Twenty centuries of Christianity have not been enough to make 
less imperative the admonition that "Thou shalt not kill," uttered by the 
greatest pundit and prophet of Israel. Laws, constitutions, world charters have 
been written to protect human life. Still it is imperative that all men be 
imbued with the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount that the words of the gospels 
be translated into reality, and that their meaning fill all horizons with the 
eternal aroma of encyclic love of mankind.</p>
<p align="justify">As recommended by the prosecution, appellant is entitled to the 
benefit of the mitigating circumstance of incomplete justifying circumstance 
defined in paragraph 5 of Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code. Consequently, 
appellant should be sentenced for homicide to an indeterminate penalty of six 
years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> to twelve years and one day of 
<i>reclusion temporal</i> and, in the case of serious physical injuries, to an 
indeterminate penalty of four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i> to two 
years, four months and one day of <i>prision correccional</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Modified as above stated, the appealed decision is affirmed 
with costs against appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Feria, Briones, Tuason,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, 
concur.</p><p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J.</i>, in the result.<br></p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>PARAS,<i> J.</i>: 
<p align="justify">The accused, Ignacio Lagata, a provincial guard of Catbalogan, 
Samar, was in charge of six prisoners charged with murder, assigned to clean the 
Capitol Plaza of Samar. On their return to the prison compound, he gave said 
prisoners permission to gather gabi, in the presence of the accused who 
rama&amp;ned at a distance of about six meters. Instantly, he discovered that 
prisoner Epifanio Labong had escaped. The accused then asked the remaining 
prisoners to help in locating him, but in so doing he was led by said prisoners 
to places where escape was much easier. The accused fired his gun in the air in 
order to stop the fleeing prisoners. Some of the prisoners were already going to 
the nearby mountain apparently in attempt also to escape. Whereupon the accused 
decided to aim his gun at those who were fleeing until one of them was hurt and 
another was killed.</p>
<p align="justify">The question now is, under the circumstances, what was the duty 
of the appellant guard? If he allowed, them to escape, he would have been 
charged with infidelity in the custody of prisoners. He was provided with a gun 
for some purpose. In my opinion, he made use of it legally in the performance of 
his official duty. (United States vs. Magno, 8 Phil., 320, 321; People vs. 
Delima, 46 Phil., 738.) To hold otherwise would be to plainly encourage the 
escape of prisoners, what with the many jailbreaks that had already taken 
place.</p>
<p align="justify">As stated in the majority opinion, appellant fired at Eusebio 
Abria because, as the latter himself stated on direct examination at the trial, 
he did not approach the appellant guard when called. Indeed, he further stated 
that "when I saw my other companions run away, I ran also."</p>
<p align="justify">Eustaquio Galet, a prosecution witness, on direct question by 
counsel <i>de oficio</i>, stated: "I heard Epifanio Labong ask Lagata to 
accompany the group to the nursery to gather gabi." "About how many minutes was 
the interval between the shot of Eusebio Abria and the next shot that you 
heard?" Galet answered: "About 15 minutes."</p>
<p align="justify">The accused fired three shots, one in the air to call the 
prisoners back or as a warning that they should not run away; the second hit 
Abria; and the third hit Ceferino Tipace. "And it was during the time that the 
rest were running when you heard the next shot and you ran too?" Asked this 
question, Abria answered:"Yes, Sir." As may be seen, the testimony of the very 
witness for the prosecution confirms the statement of the accused that he fired 
at Abria when he was running away with the rest of the prisoners. (<i>See</i> p. 
71,. t. s. n.)</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the above considerations, I vote for the acquittal 
of the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Pablo, M.</i>, Concurro con la absolucion del acusado.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Bengzon, J.</i>, I also vote to acquit.
</p><p align="justify"><i>Montemayor, J.,</i> I concur in this opinion of Mr. Justice Paras.</p></div>
