				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Dolores Kapungan as administratrix and part-owner of a parcel of land of 67 
hectares situated in Labangon, Cebu. filed on May 9, 1958 a petition before the 
Court of Agrarian Relations of Cebu City praying that they be allowed to remove 
their tenant Victorino Maribojoc ordering him to pay the damages they had 
suffered since 1957 because of his failure to pay them their share in the 
crop.
<p>Maribojoc was duly served with summons but failed to answer the petition and 
so he was declared in default upon motion of Dolores Kapungan. Thereupon, 
Kapun-gan presented her Evidence before Commissioner Eliseo C. Alinsung who in 
due time' submitted his report. On the strength of the evidence presented, the 
agrarian, court found that Maribojoc violated paragraphs (b) and (c), section 50 
of Republic Act 1199 for having failed to give to his landlord her share of the 
crop of 1957 and, accordingly, rendered judgment allowing Kapungan to eject him 
and put another in his place as tenant. No damages were awarded because the 
evidence on this point presented by petitioner was found to be insufficient.</p>
<p>On July 16, 1958, Maribojoc filed a motion for reconsideration alleging (1) 
that the order declaring him in default was procured by petitioner thru fraud, 
deceit and misrepresentation; and (2) that, the decision rendered against him is 
null and void because he was not given his day in court. The motion was denied 
on October 1, 1958. Maribojoc gave notice of his desire to appeal on October 7, 
1958. On October 20, 1958, he interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>The only issue for determination is whether the agrarian court has abused its 
discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration of petitioner praying that 
its order declaring him in default be set aside for the reasons set forth 
therein in order that he may be given his day in court.</p>
<p>The record shows that as soon as petitioner received copy of the decision of 
the agrarian court wherein because of his failure to put in an answer he was 
declared in default and so his landlord presented evidence against him on the 
strength of which judgment was rendered allowing his landlord to eject him, he 
immediately took steps to have the order of default set aside and the decision 
declared null and void. Thus, he filed a verified motion for reconsideration 
supported by an affidavit of merit wherein he stated that he is ignorant and 
paralytic and at the time he received the summons he was living more than a 
kilometer from thfe nearest highway which could only be reached by going over 
high hills and rugged dales; that despite such handicap, he went to the office 
of the clerk of court to ask for advice and was told to look for a lawyer; that 
being penniless, he went to the JAGO Tenancy Office to look for Lt. Caluna whom 
he knew but unfortunately he was not available; and that when he came upon Atty. 
Antonio Roque of the Land Tenancy Commission the latter told him that he should 
just wait for the trial because he would be duly notified thereof; so he went 
home but to his surprise the next paper he was served on was a copy of the 
decision of the court.</p>
<p>In his affidavit he also stated the reasons for the desire of his landlord to 
eject him from the land. He said that sometime in July, 1956, or on July 5 to be 
exact, he was ordered by a daughter of Dolores Kapungan, who instituted the 
present case, to fetch water because she desired to take a bath. Inasmuch as it 
was getting dark, being already six o'clock in the evening, and the well was one 
kilometer away from the house, he asked to be excused. This enraged Dolores who 
told him that she would do everything in her power to eject him and his family 
from the land.</p>
<p>All these reasons fell in a deaf ear. The court merely denied his motion 
without stating any reason for its action. It is no wonder that he has now come 
asking for relief.</p>
<p>Considering the equities of this case, we are of the opinion that the 
agrarian court has acted quite harshly in dealing with petitioner and in denying 
him his day in court. While a motion for reconsideration is addressed to the 
discretion of the court, the same should be exercised judiciously having in mind 
the circumstances of each case. Here the circumstances furnish sufficient 
justification for a more liberal attitude considering the ignorance and lack of 
instruction of petitioner who, in spite of all odds, took reasonable steps to 
comply with the law but failed because of a faulty advice. Yet, respondent court 
curtly denied his motion for relief. We consider such attitude contrary to the 
spirit of the law which commands that the court shall always endeavor to effect 
an amicable settlement of every agrarian case anÂ£ that in the hearing and 
determination thereof it should not be bound strictly by the technical rules of 
evidence. (Section 10, Republic Act 1267, as amended; Section 1, Rule 8, Court 
of Agrarian Relations.) And speaking of its own rules, the agrarian court 
postulates "that they shall be <em>liberally</em> construed in order to effect 
the settlement and disposition of disputes arising from the relationship of 
landlord and tenant with promptitude and dispatch and to enable the parties to 
obtain just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and 
proceeding.1' (Section 2, Rule 1, <em>Ibid</em>.) We, therefore, find warranted 
petitioner's contention that he was not given his day in. court.</p>
<p>The contention that the present petition was filed beyond the reglementary 
period is without merit. It appears that petitioner filed his motion for 
reconsideration on July 16, 1958. This was denied on October 1, 1958, copy of 
which was received by petitioner on October 6, 1958. On October 20, 1958 he 
filed the present petition for review. Verily, this petition was filed within 
the period of 15 days prescribed by law bearing in mind that the same is 
addressed <em>not to the decision on the merits</em> but to the <em>order</em> 
denying his motion for relief.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted. The order of respondent court dated October 
1, 1958 is hereby set aside. It is ordered that this case be remanded to 
respondent court for trial on the merits after petitioner had been given time to 
file his answer. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition granted</em>.</p></div>
