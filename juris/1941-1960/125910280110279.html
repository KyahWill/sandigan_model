				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  an action filed by  plaintiff-appellant on November 24,  1958 in the  Court  of  First Instance of  Capiz to recover a piece of  land situated in barrio Majanlud, Sapian, Capiz, alleged  to  have been seized in April, 1948  by  defendant-appellee Jesus Odiaman and  others, by means of deceit, fraud and strategem and under false pretenses, and damages in the sum of P190.00 yearly, as products of the land since 1948, plus P800.00 for attorney's fees and other incidental expenses.</p>
<p>Upon motion of the defendant to dismiss  the complaint on the ground that plaintiff's cause  of  action is already barred by the  statute of  limitations,  for the reason that the complaint was filed after  the  expiration of  10 years from the date the cause of action  accrued in April, 1948, the court dismissed  said  complaint in  an  order of this tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From the context of  the complaint, it  is clear that  the cause of action herein accrued  in April, 3948.  The 10-year  period from the date of accrual, therefore, expired after  April,  1958.  There is no allegation in  the complaint tending to show that the running; of said 10-year period has  been interrupted.  The within cause, having  accrued before the new Civil  Code  took effect,  the question whether the  said cause has  prescribed  or  not  should  be  answered from the  old Code  of Civil Procedure, Act  No.  190, which provides that 'actions to enforce written contracts or to recover real property prescribe after  ten years' (Osorio vs. Tan Jongko, et al., 98 Phil., 55, 51 Off. Gaz., 6221).</p>
  <p>"Therefore, this  case  is  hereby dismissed without  special  pronouncement as  to costs.</p>
  <p>"So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After  a motion for reconsideration  was denied,  plaintiff filed an  amended  complaint  alleging the  same  facts  as those alleged  in  the  original  complaint,  but  adding the following allegations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"3. That on September 8, 1948, plaintiff filed against the defendant Jesus Odiaman  and others, a case of  Forcible Entry in the Justice of the Peace Court  of Sapian,  Capiz, in which the defendants appealed to  this Court and  was registered as Civil  Case No. V-484 of the  Court of First Instance  of  Capiz.  That  said  case  was dismissed  on July 17,  1951, upon  plaintiff's own motion.  That  on May 29, 1952,  the  herein  plaintiff filed  a  case registered  as  No. V-755 of the Court  of First Instance of Capiz, against the defendant Jesus Odiaman, Florencio Obo, and  Generoso  Obo for ownership and for damages over the same parcel of  land, but the complaint was dismissed  on September 13,  1957, without prejudice of refiling the same.  This case is  a  refiling of that dismissed case No. V-755 and the complaint is a  reproduction of the  same."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court, treating said motion to amend the complaint as a  second  motion  for reconsideration,  denied the same on January  13, 1959, in an  order  which, in part, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Plaintiff now offers to  amend her complaint by including therein allegations to the effect that on September  18, 1948, she filed  with the JP  court of Sapian, Capiz, a forcible entry and detainer  case, which she  won in said JP court but which was dismissed on appeal by the CFI  of Capiz on July 17,  1951 upon plaintiff's own motion; rxr.d  that  on  May 29,  1952 said plaintiff  filed another case  with the CFI of Capiz involving the same cause and the same parties, but said case was likewise dismissed on September  13, 1957, albeit without prejudice.</p>
  <p>"Plaintiff now  argues  that the filing of said  cases constitute' judicial  demands  which interrupted  the running  of  the  extinctive prescription period.</p>
  <p>"It is  evident that the period of prescription started to  run when the law  applicable to the question was Act No. 190  which, in  sections 40 and 43,  provide that actions  to enforce  written contracts or to recover real property prescribe after ten  years, and that the running of said  period is not interrupted either by  extra-judicial demand  (Osorio vs. Tan Jongko, et  al., 98 Phil.,  55;  51  Off. Gaz.. 6221)  or by the presentation of judicial action  (Peralta vs. Alipio, 97 Phil., 719).</p>
  <p>"In view of the foregoing, plaintiff's  motion  of  December 29. 1958,  which is treated as second  motion  for reconsideration, is hereby denied,  and the order of this  Court  dismissing the within complaint  stands.</p>
  <p>"So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence,  this  appeal. </p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellant, in assailing the lower court's action in dismissing her complaint, argues that the  filing of  the- two cases involving the  same property  (one for ejectment, Civil  Case No. R-7 of the  Justice of the Peace  Court of Sapian, dismissed  while on appeal,  upon  her motion on July 17, 1951; and  another for recovery, Civil Case No.  V-755,  which  was  also  dismissed,  without  prejudice,  on September 13,  1957) interrupted  the running  of  the prescriptive period of her cause of action.  In support of  her contention, she cites Articles 1943, 1945  and  1946 of  the old Civil Code.  But these refer to interruption of possession in relation to  acquisitive prescription.   The  dismissal of the action here is because of the extinctive prescription of action,  and the pertinent article, if at all,  is Article 1973 of the.old  Civil Code.   However, this article has been repealed by Section 50 of Act 190 as held by this Court  in Pelaez vs. Abreu  (26 Phil., 415).  The cases cited  by appellant  (Ii re Estate of Mijares, 13 Phil., 63, and Lichauco vs. Soriano. 35 Phil., 203)  are  inapplicable  because in  both cases,  the causes of action arose in 1889 and 1890, respectively, long before the enactment of Act 190, effective October 1, 1901.</p>
<p>It  is  disputed  that herein plaintiff's cause of  action accrued  in April,  1948, when defendant and 3 others unlawfully deprived  her of the possession of the property  in question.</p>
<p>Article  1116 of the new Civil Code, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART. 1116.  <em>Prescription already running before the effectiivity of this Code shall be governed by laws previously in force;</em> but if since the time this Code took effect the entire period herein required for prescription should elapse the present Code shall be applicable, even though by  the former laws  a  longer period might be required." (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the prescriptive period in the case  before us had already  run  (in  April, 1948) prior  to the effectivity  of the new Civil  Code (on August  30, 1950),  and  as the prescriptive  period  provided  in the  new  Civil  Code has not yet elapsed since its effectivity, then Art. No. 190,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  the law in force in 1948,  is the one applicable to the present case.   Section 40 of said Act, states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"SEC. 40. Period of Prescription as to Real Estate.â€”An action for recovery of title to, or possession of, real  property, or an interest therein, can only be brought <em>within  ten years  after the  cause  of such action  accrues."</em>  (Italics supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interpreting this provision, we held in the case of Peralta et al. vs. Alipio (97  Phil., 719),  that "the statute of  limitations contained in the old  Code of Civil Procedure  (Act No, 190)  contains no specific or express provision on the suspension or interruption of the running period of prescription by the institution of an  action."  Earlier, in two other  cases,  those of Oriental  Commercial  Co.,  Inc. vs. Jureidini,  Inc., et al.  (71 Phil., 25)  and  Conspecto vs. Fruto (31  Phil., 144),  this  Court declared that  the  filing of an action within the prescription period, if the plaintiff desists in its prosecution or  is dismissed, does not suspend the running of the statute of limitations and takes no time out of the period of prescription  under  Act  190.   The parties are left in exactly the same position  as though no action  had been commenced at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing, we hold that the filing of the aforementioned Civil Case No. V-484 in the Court of First Instance of Capiz in 1948, which was dismissed upon plaintiff's motion in 1951, and of Civil Case  No.  V-775 in the same court in  1952, which  was dismissed  without prejudice in  1957, did not interrupt the running of the 10-year prescriptive period provided in  the aforesaid Section 40 of Act No. 190  for  the  bringing of the present action.  As already stated, herein  plaintiff's cause of action accrued in April,  1948.  The present action was instituted only in November, 1958, or 7 months after the period for bringing the same had elapsed.  It is undoubtedly, barred by the  Statute of Limitations.  The lower court, therefore, correctly dismissed it.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed  from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff-appellant. So ordered.</p>
