				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
dismissing the action with costs against the plaintiff. The purpose of the suit 
is to recover money, and the complaint contains the prayers:
<ol><li>Under the first cause of action, to pay plaintiff the sum of P49, 088.45 
with 8 interest thereon per annum compounded annually from December 31, 1941; 
<br><br>
</li><li>Under the second cause of action, to pay plaintiff the sum of P12,920.00 as 
part of his salary from March, 1942 to May, 1945 with 8 interest thereon per 
annum compounded annually from March, 1942; and to pay P380.00 per month from 
May, 1945 until the contract of employment is terminated; <br><br>
</li><li>Under the third cause of action, to pay plaintiff the sum of P800.00 with 8% 
interest thereon per annum from July 21, 1942 compounded annually until paid; 
</li></ol>It appears that for some years before 1942, plaintiff was employed by 
defendant corporation, a sugar central in Occidental Negros, as administrator of 
defendant's San Juan Estate situated In the municipality of Kabankalan of that 
province. Defendant accepted cash, deposits from its employees and paid six and 
eight per cent yearly interest thereon. Plaintiff was one of those who took 
advantage of this arrangement. 
<p>On October 16, 1941, plaintiff notified defendant of his intention to 
withdraw all his deposit. Under the term of the agreement which required six 
months' notice n advance of any withdrawal, plaintiff was to get his money on 
April 16, 1942. Because of the outbreak of war, action on that application was 
not acted upon, defendant': office being in Manila and plaintiff in Negros.</p>
<p>Plaintiff came to Manila in April, 1943 to stay. On October 11, 1943, 
defendant handed him a statement of his account hearing the same date, a 
statement which showed a balance of P55, 957.75 in his favor. On the 18th 
defendant sent plaintiff a check for the above balance, drawn on the Philippine 
National Bank, along with, a receipt for his signature. On the same date 
plaintiff received the check and signed the receipt. The receipt stated that the 
amount of P was in full payment of the balance as of October 11, 1953 and that 
it accorded with the liquidation or extract of plaintiff's current account. The 
next day, the 19th, plaintiff opened an account with the Philippine National 
Bank and deposited the check in his name. By the time of liberation the account 
had been closed.</p>
<p>So far the facts are not in dispute. But plaintiff testified that he accepted 
the check and signed the receipt under duress and did not read the statement of 
his account. He testified that by that time he had lost interest in withdrawing 
his deposit. He said he was afraid he would be taken to Port Santiago if he 
refused, and that it was one Valentin Vidarte who brought him the check at Hotel 
Cantabria in Intramuros where he was staying and made the threat.</p>
<p>Against plaintiff's testimony, Pascual Pagola, vice-president of defendant 
corporation, swore that Valentin Vidarte was the cashier of Lizarraga Hermanos 
but had no connection with the Kabankalan Sugar Company. He said that In April, 
1943 defendant arrived in Manila from Occidental Negros for the first time since 
the advent of the Japanese occupation; that in his (witness) presence plaintiff 
required Tirso Lizarraga, president of Lizarraga Hermanos and Kabankalan Sugar 
Company, to pay his deposit; that Tirso Lizarraga protested that there was no 
money; that plaintiff returned to Tirso Lizarraga's offiee in May and reiterated 
his demand, that as Tirso Lizarraga again pleaded laek of funds, plaintiff 
reduced the amount of his request to P6,000.00 that Lizarraga replied that even 
that amount he was not a position to pay; that finally Lizarraga and plaintiff 
agreed that the latter should be paid P500.00 monthly and the balance as soon as 
the defendant was able to do so.</p>
<p>To corroborate Pascual Pagola's testimony that plaintiff Insisted on being 
given his money back, Jose Azparren, an employee of Elialde &amp; Co., testified 
that at the Casino Espa√±ol, in October, 1943, he, plaintiff and one Ignacio de 
Oliarte sat around a domino table; that plaintiff complained that Tirso 
Lizarraga's refusal to give him his money was keeping him from going into 
business, and made offensive remarks against Lizarraga.</p>
<p>Ignacio de Oliarte corroborated the testimony of Jose Azparren and added 
that, being assistant manager of Lissar &amp; Co., of which Tirso Lizarraga was 
president, he, witness, the next day told, Lizarraga what he had heard the 
plaintiff say.</p>
<p>This conflict of evidence resolves itself into the veracity of the witnesses 
and is the issue around which the whole case revolves. There is an overwhelming 
support for the trial court's finding. Disregarding the personal interest of 
plaintiff and the serious contradictions in his testimony, some of which are 
pointed out in appellee's brief, plaintiff's assertion that he was forced 
against his will to accept the check and sign the receipt does not next with his 
subsequent conduct and other attending circumstances.</p>
<p>These facts speak for themselves: We have seen that after depositing the 
check, with which he opened a bank account the day following its receipt, 
plaintiff withdrew on that account "poco a poco", and when the present action 
was brought there was none of the deposit left. Exactly what he did with the 
money can not be made out from his contradictory statements, but there is enough 
admission on his part to permit the assurance that he spent part of it "to live" 
and invested some in business. He admits that he had wines which were burned or 
destroyed during the fighting for liberation. The large quantity of these 
liquors gives weight to the conclusion that they had been bought for the purpose 
of resale.</p>
<p>On plaintiff's own showing the alleged coercion is utterly untenable. All 
that Vidarte told plaintiff, according to him, was this, and we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"P. What was it that the cashier said when he delivered the check to you and 
which made you fear and thereafter made you accept the check?</p><p>R. Me dijo que si 
no firmaba dicho vale que tendria las consequencias; que como Vd. comprendera si 
dieran parte a las fuerzas militares japonesas, me meterian en el Puerte 
Santiago, lo mas natural."</p></blockquote>
<p>To the next question whether anything more was said plaintiff answered 
no.</p>
<p>This supposed threat was not one to inspire genuine fear in a man of 
plaintiff's position "Consequences" is susceptible of various meanings. A 
matured man, Intelligent and well educated, as we gather from his personal 
circumstances, it is unbelievable he could have been Impressed by such vague 
innuendo as that quoted above. Certainly it could not have overawed and 
overwhelmed him to the point of making him helpless to reason or talk with Tirso 
Lizarraga or other officers of the defendant corporation before signing the 
receipt and accepting the check.</p>
<p>This observation proceeds on the assumption that Vidarte made the remarks 
attributed to him. There is room for serious doubt of the truth of the 
Imputation. Vidarte, who had been killed by the Japanese, was cashier of 
Lizarraga Herinanos, not of Kabankalan Sugar Co., and had no personal or 
official interest in the matter. As for Tirso Lizarraga, who had also suffered 
the same fate as Vidarte, if he had anticipated any objection to the payment by 
plaintiff and he had intended to force it on the latter, he would have 
undertaken the forcing himself, and the payment would have been made in cash 
instead of by check since by the last method the payee might refrain from 
cashing the instrument and thereby frustrate defendant's object of ridding 
itself of its obligation to plaintiff. All of this Tirso Lizarraga had a chance 
to do in his awn office a few days before the payment was made, when plaintiff 
was handed a statement of his account.</p>
<p>Incidentally, plaintiff's silence on that occasion is at war with his alleged 
unwillingness to withdraw his deposit. If, as he says, he did not read the 
statement because he did not have his eye-glasses with him, there is no pretense 
that he was not aware that aware that his account was being settled and that he 
was to be paid in Japanese war notes. Knowing this, there is likewise no 
pretense that he told anybody connected with defendant corporation that he 
desisted from his application to withdraw his money.</p>
<p>Defendant has shown by Exhibit 5-C that upon liberation it had a long list of 
employees and other creditors to whom it owed a total of , ranging from , and to 
whom it did not make any attempt to pay during the Japanese occupation, 
although, according to plaintiff, defendant had an abundance of Japanese 
currency. Defendant had no cause to single plaintiff out. On the contrary, being 
a former trusted employee, defendant had reason to be more considerate and 
sympathetic toward him.</p>
<p>Even if it be admitted that plaintiff was opposed to being paid in Japanese 
war notes, by his subsequent actions he unequivocably ratified the payment. If 
he was intimidated into accepting the check, no compulsion was used to make him 
spend its proceeds. By leaving the check untouched he could have saved himself 
from the alleged danger he dreaded and at the same time preserved his credit. <br></p><p>The "Micky Mouse" had value. It does not require any argument to show the 
falsity of plaintiff's assertion that they were worthless. Indeed, we take 
judicial notice of the fact that in October, 1943, they had as much purchasing 
power, if not more, than the Victory notes had at the time the plaintiff filed 
his suit in April, 1945 at least as regards local foodstuffs and products. The 
very evidence of plaintiff says he used the notes to survive.</p>
<p>We refrain from considering whether the Japanese notes were legal tender. 
This question does not enter into this case. The point might be material if the 
plaintiff had avoided a tendered payment in those notes, or if he had really 
accepted them under coercion, express or implied. Neither of these factors, it 
has been demonstrated, was present in the instant litigation. On the contrary, 
as has also been demonstrated, it was upon his instance and insistence that the 
payment was effected. Neither was there any surprise, deceipt, fraud or mistake. 
There was only lack of foresight or business ability.</p>
<p>The second cause of action raises the question whether plaintiff is entitled 
to wages after December 31, 1942.</p>
<p>Although plaintiff neither tendered resignation nor received notice of 
discharge there is sufficient evidence to show both express and implied mutual 
consent to terminate the relation of employer and employee between him and 
defendant. Pagola testified that in April, 1943, shortly after plaintiff arrived 
in Manila, Domingo Aurrecoechea informed witness and Tirso Lizarraga that he was 
out of defendant's employment. This is confirmed by the parties1 actions. It 
appears that plaintiff left Kabankalan for Bacolod on December 15, 1942, and 
from Bacolod he came to Manila in April, 1943. From the time of his departure 
from Kabankalan he performed no services for defendant. From the time he arrived 
in Manila he obtained, upon his request, various amounts on account of his 
deposit, but he never mentioned any amount as due him for salary. Find when he 
was handed a statement of his account in which he was credited with wages up to 
December 31, 1942, and when he got a check and signed a receipt on the basis of 
that statement, he made no protest or comment. Not even in his attorney's letter 
of demand of April, 1945 shortly before he brought this action, was any item 
included for wages for any period posterior to 1942.</p>
<p>The payment of P800.00 which is the subject of the third cause of action is 
not urged in plaintiff's-brief. At any rate, this amount was included in the 
statement of account and covered by the check paid to and the receipt signed by, 
the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The assigned error that the lower court failed to decide that "the management 
of the defendant corporation, particularly in Central Bearin, Kabankalan, Negros 
Occidental, was working with, strong and influential with the Japanese", is 
irrelevant in the light of the findings and conclusions reached on the main 
Issues, and the point was properly passed up.</p>
<p>The Judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila is affirmed with costs 
against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, Actg. C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and <em>Padilla, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><i>Perfecto, J</i>.,<strong></strong> We concur except in the pronouncement as to 
the relative purchasing powers of the military notes in October, 1943, and of 
the Victory notes in April, 1945. <br></p><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION<br></em></p>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>We are of the opinion that this Court has no appellate jurisdiction over the 
present case.</p>
<p>Section 138 (3) of Commonwealth Act No. 3, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 
259, provides;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Supreme C0urt shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review, revise, 
reverse, modify or affirm, on appeal, certiOrari or writ of error, as the law or 
rules of court may provide, final judgments and decrees of inferior courts as 
here in provided in‚Äî</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"5. All civil cases in which the value in controversy exceeds fifth- thousand 
pEsos, exclusive of interests and costs, or in which the title or possession of 
real estate exceeding in value the sum of fifty thousand pesos to be ascertained 
by the oath of a party to the cause or by other competent evidence, is involved 
or brought in question. The Supreme Court shall likewise have exclusive 
jurisdiction over all appeals in civil cases, even though the value in 
controversy, exclusive of interests and costs, in fifty thousand pesos or less, 
when the evidence involved in said cases is the same as the evidence submitted 
in an appealed civil case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court as 
provided herein."</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint of the plaintiff-appellant in this case contains two distinct 
and separate causes of actions. In the first, he claims the sum of P48,088.45 
with 8 per cent interest thereon per annum, compounded annually from December 
31, 1941, which he delivered to the defendant and the latter accepted as a cash 
deposit. In the second, plaintiff seeks to recover the sum of P12,920.00 as part 
of his salary, as plaintiff's employee from March, 1945, also with 8 per cent 
interest, he third cause of action for the recovery of P800.00, which is not 
urged in plaintiff's brief, may be considered as a part of the first cause of 
action.</p>
<p>There is doubt that the alleged first and second causes of action are based 
on different transactions or contracts, the former" on a contract of deposit, 
and the latter oil a lease or contract of services. And the only question for 
determination is whether the two claims or causes of action, may be added 
together to make up the required jurisdictional amount necessary to give 
appelate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the answer must be in the negative o hold otherwise would 
be to make it depend upon tho will of the parties to confer appellate 
jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, because it is 
discretionary on the part of the plaintiff to join different causes of action in 
a complaint against the opposite party. Jurisdiction over the subject matter, 
whether original or appellate, is conferred by law, and cannot be conferred by 
the will, agreement, or consent of the parties. It is a rule unanimously laid 
down by the Courts that each separate claim furnishes the jurisdictional test.

<p>This Court in the case of Villase√±or vs. Erlanger &amp; Galinger, 19 Phil. 
574, following the rule above cited, held that a justice of the peace has 
jurisdiction to try and decide a civil case containing two or more separate 
causes of action though the total amount claimed in all of them exceeds the 
jurisdiction of the court, provided each one of the claims or causes of action 
is within said court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The provisions of the last sentence of the above quoted paragraph (5), 
Section 13.8, of Commonwealth Act No. 3 as amended, corroborate the rule above 
stated. Under the said provisions when a complaint contains two or more causes 
of action, if the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over one of them, it 
will have jurisdiction over the other causes although the amount involved in the 
latter is fifty thousand pesos or less exclusive of interests and costs, because 
the evidence involved therein is the same as the evidence submitted in the 
appealed case or cause of action within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of 
this Court. If the Jurisdictional amount is determined by the total sum tot two 
or more causes of action, there would not be one claim or cause of action 
involving an amount more and another less than fifty thousand pesos.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Court of Appeals, and not this Supreme Court, has 
appellate jurisdiction over the present appeal, and the present case should, 
therefore, be remanded to the Court of Appeals, for proper action. So 
ordered.</p>
