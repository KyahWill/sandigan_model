				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Two&nbsp; hundred sixty-five (265)&nbsp; employees of the&nbsp; Manila Hotel Co., who had to be&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; and paid the value of their accumulated leave under section 286 of the&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code, as&nbsp; amended by Republic Act No. 611, when the hotel was leased to a private concern on June 30, 1954 brought the present action&nbsp; to recover from&nbsp; the&nbsp; company an additional amount for accrued leave alleged&nbsp; to&nbsp; be due them under the same section of the Administrative&nbsp; Code, as later amended by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 1081, approved on June 15, 1954,&nbsp; that is to&nbsp; say,&nbsp;&nbsp; fifteen&nbsp; days before they were separated from the service.<br><br>On defendant's motion, the lower&nbsp; court ordered&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; dismissed on the ground&nbsp; that it did not state a cause of action in that Republic Act No. 1081 did&nbsp; not have a retroactive effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; that order plaintiffs&nbsp; appealed directly to this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the total amount&nbsp; claimed being more&nbsp; than P50.000.<br><br>We find&nbsp; the appeal to be without merit.<br><br>As already stated, plaintiffs&nbsp; have already been paid&nbsp; the value of their accrued leave&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 28S&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 611,&nbsp; which reads;<br><blockquote>"Sec. 286. <i>When vacation leave&nbsp; and sick&nbsp; leave may&nbsp; be taken</i>.— Vacation leave and sick&nbsp; leave shall he cumulative and any part thereof which&nbsp; may not be taken within the calendar year in which earned may&nbsp; "be carried over to the&nbsp; succeeding years, but whenever any officer, employee, or laborer of the Government of the Philippines shall voluntarily resign, or be separated from the service through no fault of his own, he shall&nbsp; be entitled to the commutation&nbsp; of&nbsp; all accumulated&nbsp; vacation and/or sick leave to his credit: <i>Provided, That the total vacation leave and sick leave that can accumulate&nbsp; to the credit of any officer or employee shall, in no case, exceed five: months: Provided, further</i>, That the proper&nbsp; Department&nbsp; Head may in his discretion authorize&nbsp; the commutation of the&nbsp; salary that "would be received during the&nbsp; period of vacation and&nbsp; sick leave&nbsp; of any&nbsp; appointed officer&nbsp; or employee or&nbsp; teacher or laborer of the Philippine Government&nbsp; and direct its payment on or before&nbsp; the beginning of such leave from the fund&nbsp; out of which the salary would have been paid: <i>Provided, furthermore</i>, That no person&nbsp; whose leave has been commuted&nbsp; following his&nbsp; separation&nbsp; from the&nbsp; service shall&nbsp; be reappointed or reemployed under the&nbsp; Government of the&nbsp; Philippines before the expiration of the leave commuted unless he first refunds the money value of the unexpired portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the leave&nbsp; commuted." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>Plaintiffs,&nbsp; however, claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were entitled&nbsp; to ten months' accrued leave&nbsp; because&nbsp; the aforementioned section of the Administrative Code was, several days before their dismissal,&nbsp; amended by Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1081, to read as follows:<br><br>"SEC. 286.&nbsp; <i>When vacation leave and&nbsp; sick leave&nbsp; may be taken.</i>— Vacation, leave&nbsp; and&nbsp; sick leave shall be cumulative and any part thereof which may not be taken within the calendar year in which earned may be carried over to the succeeding years, but "whenever any officer, employee, or laborer of the Government of the Philippines shall voluntarily&nbsp; resign or be separated from the&nbsp; service through no fault of his own, he shall be entitled to the commutation of all accumulated vacation and/or sick leave to his credit: <i>Provided, That the total vacation leave and sick leave that&nbsp; can accumulate&nbsp; to tha credit of any officers or employee shall, in no case, exceed ton months: Provided,&nbsp; further</i>,&nbsp; That the proper Department Head&nbsp; may&nbsp; in his discretion&nbsp; authorize the commutation of the salary that "would ho received during' the period of vacation and&nbsp; sick&nbsp; leave of any appointed officer or employee or teacher or&nbsp; laborer&nbsp; of the Philippine Government and&nbsp; direct its payment on or before the beginning of such leave from, the fund&nbsp; out of which the salary would have been paid: <i>Provided, furthermore</i>,&nbsp; That no&nbsp; person whose leave has been commuted&nbsp; following his separation from the service shall be reappointed or reemployed under the Government of the Philippines be- fore&nbsp; the expiration of the leave commuted&nbsp; unless he first refunds the money value&nbsp; of the unexpired portion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; leave commuted," (Italics supplied.)<br><br>The question to determine is whether this latter amendment applies retroactively&nbsp; to&nbsp; employees&nbsp; whose length&nbsp; of service prior to its approval would give them, an accumulated leave in excess of five months,&nbsp; the limit fixed by law" before the last&nbsp; amendment.<br><br>Article 4 of the new Civil Code provides&nbsp; that laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided. As Republic Act No. 1081 does not&nbsp; provide that it is to have retroactive effect, it can only be given effect from the date of its approval.<br><br>As a matter of&nbsp; fact, this is the&nbsp; construction that has been placed upon that&nbsp; Act by&nbsp; the department of the Government&nbsp; charged with its enforcement.&nbsp; Thus, when&nbsp; the Commissioner of Civil&nbsp; Service, on August 10, 1954, passed upon the claim of the present plaintiffs against the Manila Hotel management, he&nbsp; ruled that "the accumulation of the additional five&nbsp; months&nbsp; total vacation&nbsp; and sick&nbsp; leave&nbsp; (to the original five months allowed under Republic Act No. 611) should begin only from June 15, 1954."<br><br>Confirmatory of&nbsp; that ruling&nbsp; is&nbsp; the opinion rendered by the Secretary&nbsp; of Justice, Hon.&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Tuason, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; request of the Executive&nbsp; Secretary, which reads:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 320px;"><i>November&nbsp; 27, 1954</i><br></div><br>THE EXECUTIVE&nbsp; SECRETARY <br>Malacañang, Manila <br>Sir:<br><br>This is with reference to your request for&nbsp; opinion on whether or not Republic Act No. 1081,&nbsp; which, has increased the maximum&nbsp; accumulable leave of a government officer&nbsp; or employee from 5 months to 10 months, applies&nbsp; retroactively&nbsp; to those whose length of service prior to&nbsp; its approval&nbsp; would have entitled them to an accumulated leave in&nbsp; excess of five months.<br><br>Prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 1081, section 286 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code provides as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>(Sec. 286. <i>When vacation leave and sick leave may be taken.</i>— Vacation leave and sick leave shall be cumulative and any part thereof which may&nbsp; not be&nbsp; taken within&nbsp; the calendar year in which earned may be carried over to the succeeding years, but whenever any officer, employee,&nbsp; or&nbsp; laborer of the Government of the Philippines&nbsp; shall voluntarily&nbsp; resign or be separated&nbsp; from the service through no&nbsp; fault of&nbsp; his own, lie shall be entitled to the commutation of&nbsp; all&nbsp; accumulated vacatication and/or sick&nbsp; leave to his credit: <i>Provided, That the total vacation&nbsp; leave&nbsp; and sick leave that&nbsp; can accumulate to the credit of any&nbsp; officers or employee shall,&nbsp; in no&nbsp; cane, exceed five&nbsp; months. * * *.'</i> (As&nbsp; amended by Rep. Act&nbsp; No. 611.)</blockquote>We are informed that the Bureau&nbsp; of Civil&nbsp; Service had construed and enforced the above-quoted provision in the&nbsp; sense that&nbsp; after an officer or employee had&nbsp; accumulated more than five months' vacation and&nbsp; sick leave, any leave&nbsp; accruing during the calendar&nbsp; year but not- taken within that year was&nbsp; automatically&nbsp; forfeited.<br><br>The Congress is deemed to have been&nbsp; aware&nbsp; of this long-continued, contemporaneous&nbsp; and practical interpretation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; statute by&nbsp; the administrative officer charged with its&nbsp; administration and&nbsp; enforcement, when Republic Act. No. 1081 was enacted, and to have&nbsp; sanctioned that interpretation as the&nbsp; legislative intent.&nbsp; The result then is that upon the&nbsp; approval of the amendatory&nbsp; law,&nbsp; no leave already earned in excess&nbsp; of the five-month maximum&nbsp; stood to the credit of any officer or employee.&nbsp; Totally and&nbsp; absolutely lost and legally non-existent,&nbsp; such excess could&nbsp; only be&nbsp; validated&nbsp; or restored by an&nbsp; express or&nbsp; clear declaration by the law-maker.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing in Republic Act No. 1081 from which an intention of this sort can be gathered.<br><br>I am, therefore, constrained to answer the query in the negative. <br><br>Respectfully,<br><br><div style="margin-left: 280px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp;&nbsp; PEDRO&nbsp; TUASON<br></div><div style="margin-left: 320px;"><i>Secretary of Justice"</i></div></blockquote>It is a rule of&nbsp; statutory&nbsp; construction&nbsp; that&nbsp; "courts&nbsp; will and should respect the contemporaneous construction placed upon a statute by&nbsp; the executive officers, whose duty it is to enforce&nbsp; it&nbsp; and&nbsp; unless&nbsp; such interpretation&nbsp; is&nbsp; clearly erroneous will&nbsp; ordinarily be controlled thereby."&nbsp; (Molina vs. Rafferty, 37 Phil. 545; see also In re Allen, 2 Phil. 630, Everett vs. Bautista, 69 Phil. 137.)<br><br>But it is not only the executive branch of the Government that&nbsp; has&nbsp; construed Republic Act No. 1081 as having only a prospective effect.&nbsp; For Congress itself so construed that Act when in 1955 it approved a bill (House Bill No. 3097)&nbsp; to give the Act retroactive effect, for the reason— so it was&nbsp; explained—that though its&nbsp; proponent had intended it to have&nbsp; a retroactive&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; it "has&nbsp; (in fact) prospective effect" in the sense that "leave earned but not enjoyed prior to its approval was not&nbsp; counted."&nbsp; The bill, however, never became law because it was vetoed for lack of funds.<br><br>Plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; invoke the ruling of&nbsp; this Court in the&nbsp; case of Manila Railroad&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; vs. CIR et&nbsp; al., G.&nbsp; R. No. L-4616, July&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1952, where the heirs of&nbsp; an employee of the Manila Railroad Company who died&nbsp; in 1945 were awarded the money equivalent of his unused vacation and sick leave&nbsp; although the&nbsp; law then in force provided for the forfeiture thereof upon the employee's separation from the service, for the reason, it is&nbsp; alleged, that&nbsp; Republic Act 611, effective only on May 5, 1951, which suppressed that part of the law relating to forfeiture,&nbsp; was&nbsp; applied.&nbsp; But a careful reading of the decision will show that the ruling was specifically based on a circular issued by the manager of the railroad company relative to the "grant of monetary aid to former employees and/or to the latter's dependents, who could not be reinstated on account of illness or death" and also on the "long-standing policy of the railroad company to&nbsp; pay vacation and sick leave duly acquired by&nbsp; its employees and laborers&nbsp; effective upon separation from the service."&nbsp; Such portion&nbsp; of the decision as mentions Republic Act No.&nbsp; 611 was mere dictum and cannot, therefore, be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; as&nbsp; the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the&nbsp; case.<br><br>Lastly, plaintiffs-appellants cite article 1702 of the new Civil Code,&nbsp; which provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; in case&nbsp; of doubt,&nbsp; labor legislation shall be construed in favor of the laborer.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the article is expressly intended to apply in case of doubt, it can have no&nbsp; application where, as in the present case, no doubt exists.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the order of&nbsp; dismissal is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
