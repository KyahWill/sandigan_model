				<BR><BR><div align="justify">After the last&nbsp; (Pacific) war the Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite witnessed&nbsp; a series of kidnappings where peaceful residents of&nbsp; the province were&nbsp; snatched and kept in custody&nbsp; by organized&nbsp; gangs,&nbsp; for&nbsp; purposes of ransom.&nbsp; One of said kidnappings is involved in the present case.<br>&nbsp;<br>On May 11, 1953, Bayani Dragon, an aviation student of the FEATI, and a resident of General Trias,&nbsp; Cavite, while playing&nbsp; pingpong near&nbsp; his home at about 8 o'clock in the evening, saw a masked man approach him menacingly.&nbsp; Sensing that the man not only because of his being masked&nbsp; but&nbsp; also because of his attitude, was after him, Bayani made a dash for his home but&nbsp; the man ran after and finally caught him.&nbsp; After that, they were joined&nbsp; by five or&nbsp; six men also&nbsp; masked and&nbsp; Bayani was by them conducted on foot eastward to a place unknown to him. That night he&nbsp; was made to sleep in a hut all by himself but guarded by his masked captors.&nbsp; For the next two or three days Bayani was taken by this&nbsp; group to different places,&nbsp; all isolated and&nbsp; uninhabited,&nbsp; until&nbsp; they finally reached a hut&nbsp; at&nbsp; a place called Pasong Bayog within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of Dasmariñas, Cavite,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there&nbsp; he was delivered to&nbsp; another group of men,&nbsp; some of them masked. In&nbsp; this&nbsp; hut and by this latter group Bayani was held in custody for almost two months.<br><br>There is evidence to the effect that about the&nbsp; same time that Bayani was&nbsp; kidnapped,&nbsp; one Dr.&nbsp; Velasco was also snatched&nbsp; in the Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite,&nbsp; presumably&nbsp; by the members of the same gang because Velasco was also taken to the same hut in Pasong Bayog. Since the&nbsp; ransom of P10,000 demanded by the kidnappers from Velasco's family was paid, he&nbsp; was released from&nbsp; custody, leaving&nbsp; Bayani in the hut with his guards.<br><br>About a year before the kidnapping of Bayani or rather on May 4, 1952, there was staged&nbsp; a mass&nbsp; jailbreak in the municipal jail&nbsp; of Imus,&nbsp; Cavite in which&nbsp; about&nbsp; twenty prisoners escaped. Among these&nbsp; escapees&nbsp; were Sergio Villanueva, Ruben Ordonez, Simplicio Rupiso, and Serafin Timbang.&nbsp; Sergio was being detained under a charge of robbery while his companions were charged with kidnapping a&nbsp; Chinaman.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that&nbsp; after escaping, Sergio Villanueva organized a gang for purposes&nbsp; of kidnapping; Ruben was second in command and Serafin acted&nbsp; as&nbsp; Secretary-Treasurer&nbsp; of the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gang operated mostly in the Province of Cavite. On May&nbsp; 26, 1953, a raid was conducted by a Constabulary patrol in the barrio of Salawag,&nbsp; Dasmariiias,&nbsp; Cavite.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eupiso was captured with a&nbsp; Thompson machinegun&nbsp; which he was&nbsp; carrying. From Rupiso the Constabulary obtained valuable information about the whereabouts and hiding places of the&nbsp; kidnapping group of Villanueva,&nbsp; Lt.&nbsp; Berenguel, commanding officer of the Constabulary detachment at Malinta, Cavite, made a reconnaissance of one of the places indicated&nbsp; and he was&nbsp; able to pinpoint,the exact&nbsp; location of the hut in Pasong Bayog where Bayani was being detained.<br><br>Early in the morning of July 4,&nbsp; 1953, while it was still dark, a Constabulary patrol of 21&nbsp; men led by Lt. Reyea stealthily&nbsp; surrounded and&nbsp; approached this hut and&nbsp; saw Serafin Timbang&nbsp; cooking breakfast in&nbsp; an&nbsp; outhouse of the hut.&nbsp; A carbine was&nbsp; lying on the ground within his reach. Upon detecting the presence of the raiding party,&nbsp; Serafin grabbed his carbine&nbsp; but the soldiers jumped on him&nbsp; and placed&nbsp; him under control.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inmates of&nbsp; the hut&nbsp; still sleeping&nbsp; and rudely&nbsp; awakened&nbsp; from their slumber, were ordered to file&nbsp; out quietly, which&nbsp; they did.&nbsp; They were six inside the hut, including Bayani.&nbsp; As&nbsp; soon as&nbsp; Bayani recognized the raiders as Constabulary men, he immediately identified&nbsp; himself as&nbsp; Bayani Dragon, a kidnap victim&nbsp; and he pointed to his&nbsp; companions in the hut, including&nbsp; Serafin as his guards.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; companions&nbsp; were questioned on the spot by the raiders and they admitted that Bayani&nbsp; was their kidnap-victim. , The hut was searched.&nbsp; Four automatic&nbsp; rifles were found inside which the inmates of the hut&nbsp; admitted to belong to them.&nbsp; In a leather bag were found a pair of field glasses, medicines, a rubber stamp, a pencil and a bunch of papers or documents.&nbsp; The persons found in the hut besides Serafin Timbang were his nephew Marciano Timbang, Igmidio Camagong, Melecio Pakingan, Bienvenido&nbsp; Mojica and Eicardo&nbsp; Gonzales.&nbsp; With&nbsp; Bayani they were taken to&nbsp; Malinta where they were questioned by Lt. Berenguel.&nbsp; Because Malinta had no stockage where to keep the prisoners, they were later taken to Imus, Cavite, where they were further investigated.<br><br>The Constabulary investigator was Sgt. Magtangol Prim. Serafin Timbang and his five companions finally admitted that they formed part of the group of Sergio Villanueva and Ruben Ordonez&nbsp; and that they had guarded&nbsp; Bayani in the hut at Pasong Bayog to prevent his escape.&nbsp;&nbsp; The five&nbsp; automatic rifles captured in the raid were&nbsp; laid or placed on a table and each prisoner was asked to identify the&nbsp; gun&nbsp; that belonged to&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception of Marciano Timbang each of&nbsp; the prisoners identified a&nbsp; firearm as belonging to him.&nbsp; The result of the investigation was embodied by&nbsp; Sgt.&nbsp; Prim&nbsp; in&nbsp; ten different affidavits (Exhibits J to S).&nbsp; He found that Serafin Timbang had a wound&nbsp; or injury between his legs, around the anus and because&nbsp; Serafin complained of severe pain, through&nbsp; Sgt. Prim's recommendation to his commanding officer, Serafin was taken to the Philippine General Hospital in&nbsp; Manila, that is, after he had signed his affidavit.<br><br>On July 7, 1953, the remaining five prisoners were taken before&nbsp; deputy clerk of court Bayani&nbsp; del&nbsp; Rosario.&nbsp; Del Rosario testifying at the trial told the court that he questioned each&nbsp; affiant, asking him&nbsp; to listen&nbsp; while he&nbsp; (Del Rosario)&nbsp; read the contents&nbsp; of their&nbsp; affidavits which are in Tagalog, and&nbsp; to stop him and to&nbsp; call his&nbsp; attention to any inaccuracy or&nbsp; error in the statement or narration of facts.&nbsp; He also asked each&nbsp; affiant whether there had been. any&nbsp; irregularity or&nbsp; anomaly committed&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation with the preparation of the affidavit and whether the affiants had&nbsp; any complaint to make, and when&nbsp; he was assured that everything was in order and regular, he administered the oath to each affiant who then subscribed or&nbsp; signed the affidavit or affidavits.<br><br>On the&nbsp; basis of the accusation by Bayani made at the hut&nbsp; in Pasong Bayog immediately&nbsp; after the&nbsp; raid, and before the Constabulary officers&nbsp; at&nbsp; Malinta&nbsp; and&nbsp; Imus, that Serafln Timbang and&nbsp; his&nbsp; five companions had been guarding him for&nbsp; almost two months and because of the admission of that charge&nbsp; by them not only at" the hut after the&nbsp; raid but also before&nbsp; the Constabulary officers, particularly Sgt. Prim, as&nbsp; shown by their affidavits, said six men were jointly accused of kidnapping, and with the exception&nbsp; of Mareiano Timbang, were separately charged with illegal possession of firearms, Simplicio Rupiso whd as already stated, was captured on&nbsp; May 26,&nbsp; 1953 in a separate raid and who supposedly admitted that he was a member of the&nbsp; gang of&nbsp; Villanueva and Ordonez, was included in the charge.<br><br>There was a joint trial of the case of kidnapping and of the, five separate cases of&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; possession of firearms, After the prosecution had rested its ease,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for Simplicio&nbsp; Rupiso&nbsp; asked for the dismissal of the case&nbsp; of kidnapping against him on the&nbsp; ground of insufficiency of evidence, and without objection on the part of the prosecution the trial court granted&nbsp; the motion; and the&nbsp; remaining six defendants presented their evidence.<br><br>Each one of the accused&nbsp; claimed that far from being a kidnapper and a&nbsp; guard of&nbsp; Bayani at the hut&nbsp; in Pasong Bayog, he was&nbsp; a kidnap-victim himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marciano Timbang told&nbsp; the court that one day he went out to look for his uncle Serafin&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to help him cut grass, but he was suddenly pounced upon by&nbsp; unknown men and unceremoniously&nbsp; taken to&nbsp; the hut in question&nbsp; where&nbsp; he was detained unguarded with Bayani&nbsp; Dragon.&nbsp; Another defendant stated that his sister had disappeared, presumably kidnapped and&nbsp; while&nbsp; out looking for her, he&nbsp; was also captured&nbsp; by unknown men and taken to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same hut. Two&nbsp; others&nbsp; said&nbsp; that they were&nbsp; looking&nbsp; for&nbsp; {heir lost carabaos and while doing so they&nbsp; were also apprehended and taken to the said hut.&nbsp; Still others claimed that they went out to cut firewood and were similarly captured and taken to the hut against their&nbsp; will.&nbsp; All of them told the trial&nbsp; court that&nbsp; although there were no guards&nbsp; in the hut or even around the place whom they could see, nevertheless they&nbsp; dared not escape&nbsp; for fear of&nbsp; being&nbsp; recaptured&nbsp; or otherwise prevented from escaping by their kidnappers who might have been watching them from&nbsp; their hiding place. The trial court presided by&nbsp; Judge Juan 0. Reyes correctly gave scant consideration to these strange, not to say fantastic claims,&nbsp; and found five&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants guilty of illegal possession of firearms and&nbsp; sentenced each to&nbsp; an indeterminate sentence of from&nbsp; five&nbsp; to eight years imprisonment, with the&nbsp; exception of Serafin Timbang who,&nbsp; being an escapee and therefore not&nbsp; entitled to the benefits of the indeterminate sentence law,&nbsp; was given the maximum of eight years.&nbsp; All&nbsp; of the six defendants were also found guilty&nbsp; of kidnapping and were&nbsp; sentenced each to&nbsp; life&nbsp; imprisonment.&nbsp; They have&nbsp; all appealed&nbsp; from said decision, and because of the penalty involved their appeal was directly taken to us.<br><br>Bayani although he testified for the&nbsp; prosecution, did so in&nbsp; a&nbsp; half-hearted manner.&nbsp; He told the court&nbsp; on&nbsp; direct examination that&nbsp; he was apprehended by a group of six or&nbsp; eight men while he was playing pingpong;&nbsp; that&nbsp; after hiking&nbsp; for&nbsp; several days, he was&nbsp; finally delivered by his captors to another group of men at the hut&nbsp; in Pasong Bayog and there detained for almost two months; but on cross examination he made statements more favorable to the defense&nbsp; than for the prosecution.&nbsp; For&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; he said that he did not recognize any of the men who snatched him&nbsp; in&nbsp; the evening of May&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1953, nor the group to "which he was delivered in the hut and that the defendants-appellants herein were not his guards but were companions in&nbsp; the&nbsp; hut, giving&nbsp; the impression&nbsp; that they were fellow kidnap-victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; When pressed by&nbsp; the court to&nbsp; reconcile his testimony on&nbsp; cross-examination with his spontaneous accusation&nbsp; of herein&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; before the&nbsp; raiders who rescued him, pointing to appellants as his guards, he reluctantly admitted that they really guarded him but not during the whole period of his captivity&nbsp; but only for a few days, as&nbsp; for&nbsp; instance, Marciano Timbang guarded him for one week, Serafin Timbang for eight days,&nbsp; Melecio Pakingan for another&nbsp; eight days, Ricardo&nbsp; Gonzales&nbsp; for about one week and&nbsp; Bienvenido Mojica for&nbsp; only two&nbsp; days.&nbsp; This attitude and change of front of Bayani Dragon is indeed strange, but was&nbsp; reasonably,&nbsp; even satisfactorily explained by the trial&nbsp; judge&nbsp; in&nbsp; a portion of&nbsp; his&nbsp; decision&nbsp; which&nbsp; we quote below:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; Court also observed that during the&nbsp; trial even the kidnap victim himself Bayani Dragon, when presented&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness by the Provincial Fiscal,&nbsp; seemed to be afraid and reluctant to testify As a&nbsp; matter of fact, after two questions had been propounded by the Fiscal, he told the court that he was feeling dizzy and requested to be&nbsp; excused from testifying, but the Court did not excuse him&nbsp; and finally lie was&nbsp; able to testify&nbsp; until the several&nbsp; defense attorneys all finished their cross-examination of&nbsp; him.&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; is therefore suspicious that Bayani Dragon must have been threatened before he appeared in Court, and that&nbsp; explains&nbsp; his answers to the questions of the defense counsels -which tended to favor all the accused.&nbsp; Such statements,&nbsp; however, are&nbsp; found to be&nbsp; in contradiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; his subscribed&nbsp; statements&nbsp; and&nbsp; declarations&nbsp; (Exhibit T)&nbsp; taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; and subscribed before the Assistant Provincial Commander of the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary for the Province of Cavite, a few days after his rescue."<br></blockquote>Counsel for appellants questions the regularity of&nbsp; the investigation conducted by Sgt. Magtangol Prim and assails the&nbsp; validity and&nbsp; admissibility&nbsp; of the&nbsp; affidavits&nbsp; prepared ."&nbsp; by him on the basis&nbsp; of the answers of said appellants in reply to his questions, on the ground&nbsp; of use of force and torture. The trial court discounted the claim, of. the use of force and the infliction of physical injuries on the affiants, this after carefully examining the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; of the defendants and failing to&nbsp; find any mark or&nbsp; vestige of wounds and physical injuries said to have&nbsp; been inflicted on them by Sgt. Prim.&nbsp; And as to Serafin Timbang who, as already stated,&nbsp; sustained a wound around&nbsp; the&nbsp; anus,&nbsp; there is evidence to the effect that when questioned at the hospital where he had been taken, first he said that he fell upon a stump striking his anus against&nbsp; it, thereby causing his physical injury.&nbsp; Later,&nbsp; he said that he was boxed by a soldier,, and according to one of his co-defendants, he saw Serafin boxed by a soldier in Malinta&nbsp; not in Imus&nbsp; where Sergeant Prim was and, where he questioned the defendants, including Serafin.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Sgt. Prim really used force on Serafin and produced the&nbsp; wound which caused his being taken to the hospital, Sgt. Prim would have tried to&nbsp; hide this proof of his use of force and violence; but instead, it was he who recommended that Serafin be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; to the hospital for treatment, even if by doing so, he failed to have Serafin ratify and swear to his affidavit before the Deputy&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; also proven&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Provmcial Fiscal visited&nbsp; Serafin at the hospital and Serafin made no complaint&nbsp; whatsoever&nbsp; to him on&nbsp; the supposed ill-treatment and torture by&nbsp; Sgt. Prim in order to&nbsp; obtain his&nbsp; affidavit.&nbsp; As&nbsp; regards the rest of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants, as already said, Deputy Clerk of Court Del Rosario assured the trial court that he read and&nbsp; explained the contents of their affidavits and gave&nbsp; them every opportunity to correct any error or&nbsp; mistake in the facts stated therein&nbsp; and to complain of any irregularity or&nbsp; anomaly in relation with the preparation of said&nbsp; affidavits, but&nbsp; he was assured by all of them that&nbsp; everything was correct and regular.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each affiant signed his affidavit.&nbsp; The regularity, smoothness and firmness of the&nbsp; strokes in their&nbsp; signatures seem to&nbsp; show spontaneity and willingness on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of the signers, instead of the fear, emotional disturbance and compulsion under which they supposedly affixed&nbsp; their signatures.<br><br>There is one legal point raised by the Solicitor General. He says that while counsel for the appellants claims that the&nbsp; affidavits&nbsp; in question were obtained&nbsp; irregularly and by the&nbsp; use of force, violence and intimidation, there is no claim or insinuation that the contents of said affidavits are not&nbsp; true&nbsp; and&nbsp; he contends that an affidavit or confession may be rejected only when the affiant is compelled against his will to state or admit something which is against the truth.&nbsp; In other words, the admissibility&nbsp; of that&nbsp; kind of evidence&nbsp; depends&nbsp; not&nbsp; on the&nbsp; supposed illegal manner in which&nbsp; it is obtained&nbsp; but on&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth or falsity&nbsp; of the facts or admission contained&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with the Solicitor General on this point.&nbsp; In the case of People <i>vs.</i> De los&nbsp; Santos, et al., 93&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 83, this Court said:<br><blockquote>"A confession, to be repudiated, must not only be proved to have been obtained by force and violence, but&nbsp; also&nbsp; that&nbsp; it is false or untrue, for&nbsp; the law rejects the confession when, by force or violence or intimidation, the accused is compelled against his&nbsp; will&nbsp; to tell&nbsp; a falsehood,&nbsp; not&nbsp; when&nbsp; by&nbsp; such force and&nbsp; violence he is compelled to tell&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; in consonance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; principle&nbsp; that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of&nbsp; the means with which it was secured,&nbsp; (Moncado&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; People's Court, et al., 80 Phil. 1)"<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; which not only received the&nbsp; evidence but&nbsp; also questioned the witnesses on&nbsp; important points and who 'had&nbsp; the opportunity to observe their behavior on the witness stand, was convinced&nbsp; of&nbsp; the guilt of appellants. We&nbsp; reproduce pertinent portions of its decision.<br><blockquote>"There is no quarrel&nbsp; between&nbsp; the prosecution and the defense over the fact that the herein six accused were surprised in the&nbsp; hut at Pasong Bayog, Dasmarinas, in the early morning of July 4, 1953, together with Bayani&nbsp; Dragon, who immediately identified himself to the P. C. authorities.&nbsp; They were then arrested and later on Bayani Dragon&nbsp; was released, while the&nbsp; six accused were first brought to Malinta barracks and subsequently, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon, to the&nbsp; P.&nbsp; C. Headquarters at Imus, Cavite.&nbsp; The accused themselves,&nbsp; in their testimonies,&nbsp; admitted such&nbsp; facts&nbsp; and&nbsp; even&nbsp; explained the circumstances&nbsp; under which they were surprised&nbsp; and arrested oh the date mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; They, however, claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; if they were&nbsp; in the hut at Pasong&nbsp; Bayog during the period and on&nbsp; the days when they admitted having lived in that hut, it was due to the order of their captors not&nbsp; to leave the place, otherwise they would be liquidated.&nbsp; Should the&nbsp; testimonies of these accused as well as&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; few&nbsp; witnesses presented by them, who are all their relatives,&nbsp; either as&nbsp; father, mother or brother, be given full credence, it would appear that the six; accused, together with&nbsp; Bayani Dragon,&nbsp; would all be considered as kidnap victims,&nbsp; without&nbsp; any&nbsp; kidnappers.<br><br>"The accused wanted&nbsp; the Court to believe that they were&nbsp; either captured&nbsp; or compelled by&nbsp; force&nbsp; and intimidation&nbsp; to go&nbsp; with the supposed&nbsp; armed men who brought them to that hut,&nbsp; and that they stayed there until their capture by the Philippine Constabulary men and&nbsp; officers&nbsp; on July 4, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; This assertion, however, is diametrically opposed to their admissions&nbsp; made before the&nbsp; P. C. officers and&nbsp; investigators.&nbsp; To their affidavits, Exhibits J, K, L, M, N, and O, as well as in their&nbsp; statements, Exhibits P,&nbsp; Q,&nbsp; R, and S, they categorically admitted&nbsp; that they mere members of the bandit&nbsp; gang led by Sergio Villanueva&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; all of them,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; single&nbsp; exception&nbsp; of Marciano&nbsp; Timbang, were provided with&nbsp; firearms.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>"The prosecution, through the testimonies&nbsp; of the officers&nbsp; and men who took part in the raid&nbsp; and in the subsequent arrest&nbsp; of these accused,&nbsp; affirmed before the Court&nbsp; that those firearms were&nbsp; taken within the hut where the accused were found.&nbsp; Sergeant Magtangol Prim and Deputy Cleric of Court Bayani del Rosario also testified that the affidavits in which&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused admitted their participation or their connection with the gang led by Sergio&nbsp; Villanueva, as well as their ownership of the five firearms, were given voluntarily and the&nbsp; said&nbsp; statements had been sworn to and signed before Bayani del Rosario, an officer of the Court, without any compulsion, after the contents of the&nbsp; said documents were read to the accused&nbsp; individually.&nbsp; It is significant to note that Scrafm Timbang, who&nbsp; seems to bex the principal accused in&nbsp; this case—the two leaders&nbsp; of the gang, Sergio Villanueva&nbsp; and Ruben Ordonez, not having been as yet apprehended up to this&nbsp; time—when asked why he did&nbsp; not&nbsp; escape from that hut during all the time of his alleged&nbsp; confinement thereat on orders of the armed men, answered that he was afraid to escape because the premises were&nbsp; guarded&nbsp; by&nbsp; armed men day and night. This accused, however, admitted that some time on May&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1952, he escaped from jail&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with another charge of kidnapping, together with several ether&nbsp; detained prisoners on that occasion, and the prosecution proved that among&nbsp; those who escaped with Serafin Timbang&nbsp; were&nbsp; Ruben Ordonez and Sergio Villanueva&nbsp; (Exhibit JJ).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Furthermore, all the six herein accused put the blame in connection with their tie-up&nbsp; with the bandit gang of Sergio Villanueva and Ruben Ordonez&nbsp; to the supposed armed men who&nbsp; allegedly captured them and brought them to the hut at Pasong Bayog where they are ordered not to leave, otherwise it would cost them their lives.&nbsp; Of course the said accused knew that such armed men whom they were mentioning&nbsp; as their&nbsp; captors could not&nbsp; very well contradict them, because&nbsp; even&nbsp; their&nbsp; names&nbsp; were&nbsp; not disclosed. and therefore the authorities could not take hold of said men to testify&nbsp; in this case.<br><br>In general, the testimonies of all the accused seem to have followed the' same pattern of reasoning, denying having&nbsp; voluntarily&nbsp; signed their affidavits or admissions, that they were brought by armed men to that hut in Pasong Bayog, that they never handled or were never provided with any arm,&nbsp; and that they were&nbsp; all&nbsp; compelled to make their statements&nbsp; and&nbsp; admissions of the said accused" and their relatives, who were&nbsp; presented to corroborate part of their testimonies, could not be given any credence.&nbsp; In addition, the fact that all the accused&nbsp; stayed&nbsp; in that&nbsp; hut&nbsp; for&nbsp; days&nbsp; and weeks or,&nbsp; maybe, even months, and did not care to leave the place and go home or returned to their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; families,&nbsp; show that&nbsp; the sis accused are really members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bandit&nbsp; gang led by their two&nbsp;&nbsp; co-accused,&nbsp; Sergio Villanueva and&nbsp; Ruben Ordonez.&nbsp; The Court could not&nbsp; believe their story&nbsp; that they&nbsp; were allegedly guarded clay and night by&nbsp; armed men&nbsp; whom&nbsp; they did&nbsp; not even&nbsp; care&nbsp; to&nbsp; identify. On the&nbsp; contrary, it has&nbsp; trcen&nbsp; proved by the prosecution, and this Court&nbsp; is convinced to a moral&nbsp; certainty that the&nbsp; six accused&nbsp; were&nbsp; there&nbsp; in&nbsp; that hut in Pasong Bayog during all the time that they&nbsp; stayed there with Bayani Dragon as the custodian of the said kidnap victim, awaiting the orders from their leaders as to what was to&nbsp; be dons with their youthful victim,&nbsp; Scrafin&nbsp; Timbang admitted in his statements (Exhibit N)&nbsp; that he and his companions&nbsp; were expecting, some&nbsp; P5,000 ransom from tho parents of&nbsp; Bayani Dragon,&nbsp; but&nbsp; because,&nbsp; probably, of theii'&nbsp; unexpected arrest on July 4, 1953, they&nbsp; did not succeed in obtaining any amount from the victim's parents. "The&nbsp; tie-up of these six accused with the organization of&nbsp; Sergio Villanueva having been&nbsp; conclusively&nbsp; shown not only in their own statements and&nbsp;&nbsp; admission,&nbsp; but also&nbsp; from the other&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on record,&nbsp; they&nbsp; could not now escape responsibility&nbsp; for the&nbsp; crime of kidnapping with&nbsp; which they&nbsp; are&nbsp; charged.&nbsp;&nbsp; The firearms that were also&nbsp; found in that&nbsp; hut&nbsp; having been proved as&nbsp; firearms in&nbsp; their possession, or&nbsp; at&nbsp; least under their custody as members of that gang, the five accused&nbsp; for the illegal possession of said&nbsp; firearms shall also suffer the penalty provided by&nbsp; law,"<br></blockquote>After a&nbsp; careful review of the&nbsp; evidence we are convinced that&nbsp; the appellants&nbsp; herein although&nbsp; they&nbsp; may not have been the persons who actually&nbsp; snatched&nbsp; Bayani&nbsp; Dragon on the night of May 11, 1953, still, everything points to the fact of their being part or members&nbsp; of the group to which he was delivered at the hut at&nbsp; Pasong Bayog and which group guarded him during the whole period of his detention there.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were&nbsp; evidently members&nbsp; of the organization, of Sergio&nbsp; Villanueva and Ruben Ordonez, engaged in kidnapping and were in conspiracy&nbsp; with said two gang leaders.&nbsp; The story of appellants that they were also&nbsp; kidnap-victims in that hut is highly incredible, too fantastic to be given any serious consideration.&nbsp; According to the evidence and their own admissions,&nbsp; there&nbsp; were no guards in or around the hut to prevent their escape. They were adequately provided with food; and there were five automatic rifles&nbsp; with ammunitions which they&nbsp; could have used to force their&nbsp; way out of&nbsp; the hut and&nbsp; shoot down any person that may possibly try to&nbsp; prevent their escape.&nbsp; And to show that there were no&nbsp; such, guards around the&nbsp; hut or in its&nbsp; vicinity, two days before the actual raid Lt. Berenguel riding in&nbsp; a jeep and later getting down from the&nbsp; same, was&nbsp; able to approach the hut within a relatively short distance without seeing or encountering any guard; and during the actual raid on July 4, 1953, the patrol consisting of 21 men was able to&nbsp; surround, approach and&nbsp; raid the hut without meeting or seeing any guard. All that the raiders saw&nbsp; when&nbsp; they approached the hut, was&nbsp; Serafin&nbsp; Timbang. peacefully&nbsp; cooking breakfast and with a carbine within easy reach.&nbsp; When approached by the raiders,&nbsp; instead of welcoming them as his rescuers he grabbed his carbine&nbsp; presumably to fight them&nbsp; off.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the raiders made themselves known to the inmates, including Serafin Timbang, it was only&nbsp; Bayani&nbsp; Dragon who identified himself as the&nbsp; kidnap victim and he&nbsp; right then and there pointed to the&nbsp; herein appellants as his guards who&nbsp; had been keeping him in&nbsp; custody for almost two&nbsp; months&nbsp; against&nbsp; his will,&nbsp; and&nbsp; said appellants, instead of also claiming that they were kidnap-victims, admitted that they were there to guard Bayani Dragon and prevent his&nbsp; escape.&nbsp; There is every reason to believe that the hut in Pasong, Bayog was used for the detention&nbsp; not only&nbsp; of Bayani but&nbsp; also of all persons whom the gang to which appellants belonged&nbsp; could kidnap such as Dr. Velasco already referred to.<br><br>In his brief the Solicitor General recommends the imposition of the death penalty for the&nbsp; crime of kidnapping because of the presence&nbsp; of the aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; aid&nbsp; of&nbsp; armed men.&nbsp; Considering the gravity of the offense and the fact that the Legislature has increased the&nbsp; penalty for the crime of kidnapping because of its serious surge and recrudescence, and bearing in mind its threatening proportions in the Province of&nbsp; Cavite,&nbsp; we were at&nbsp; first inclined&nbsp; to follow the recommendation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Government counsel, were it only to serve&nbsp; as an effective deterrent on the criminal elements of the community and help in the drive to protect peaceful and law-abiding citizens from this grave threat to their liberty and their lives.&nbsp; But&nbsp; on further reflection and deliberation, the necessary votes to impose the extreme penalty is found wanting.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; satisfactory evidence that the group that snatched and took' into custody Bayani&nbsp; on the night of&nbsp; May 11, 1953,&nbsp; was&nbsp; armed. Of course there is the other&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; circumstance&nbsp; of night time, but this&nbsp; is a&nbsp; circumstance which may well&nbsp; be included in the material execution of the kidnapping or in the means employed to accomplish it.&nbsp; It should be borne in mind that defendants-appellants though forming&nbsp; part of the conspiracy&nbsp; of kidnapping,&nbsp; were not the ones who actually kidnapped Bayani; and, under Article 62,&nbsp; paragraph 4 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code, they are not bound i or affected by the&nbsp; aggravating circumstance of night time unless they knew that it would be availed of in accomplishing the offense,&nbsp; and there is no proof of said knowledge. Again, although there was the use of armed strength&nbsp; or show of the same in&nbsp; guarding Bayani in the hut at Pasong Bayog,&nbsp; some of us are inclined to think that some use of arms or show&nbsp; of&nbsp; armed strength is necessary to guard a kidnap victim to prevent or discourage escape and so in a sense it may be justly regarded as included in or absorbed by the offense&nbsp; itself.&nbsp; Anyway, lacking&nbsp; sufficient votes to impose the death&nbsp; penalty, we have to&nbsp; affirm as we do the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the lower court for the&nbsp; crime of kidnapping, at the same&nbsp; time expressing our belief that appellants are not deserving of any executive&nbsp; clemency which may in anyway&nbsp; shorten the normal period of their incarceration.&nbsp; We find the penalty imposed in the cases&nbsp; of illegal possession of firearms to be in accordance with&nbsp; law, and so also affirm that part&nbsp; of the decision.&nbsp; The&nbsp; five&nbsp; guns&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in them&nbsp; are declared confiscated in favor of the Government.&nbsp; With these modifications, the appealed decision is affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.
