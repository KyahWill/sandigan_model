				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-2162, September 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. BENITO TUASON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Benito Tuason was charged with treason in the People's Court, 
and after trial was found guilty and sentenced to suffer 20 years of 
<i>reclusion temporal</i> and to pay a fine of P7,000 and costs. He appeals from 
said judgment.
<p align="justify">In the morning of 21 November 1944, about 7 o'clock, in the 
barrio of Ugong, municipality of Pasig, province of Rizal, the appellant and 
several companions, some of them carrying rifles, arrested Miguel Castillo, 
Candido Cruz, one Daniel, and another unidentified individual. After their 
arrest, Miguel Castillo, Candido Cruz and the other two have not been seen 
again.</p>
<p align="justify">In the morning of 24 November 1944 in the same barrio, the 
appellant and several Japanese and Filipino companions, who were known to be 
Makapilis, all armed with rifles and pistols, arrested Bibiano Azores, Eustaquio 
Santos, Elpidio Cruz, Valentin Cruz, Pedro Cruz, Rafael Bernardo, one 
Victoriano, Rafael Raymundo, Daniel Santos, Cirilo Jose and Salvador San Pedro, 
who were suspected of being guerrillas. After their arrest they were exposed to 
the sun, tortured, tied and loaded in a banca. Since their arrest they have not 
been seen again, except Valentin Cruz and Rafael Raymundo who were released.</p>
<p align="justify">On 10 December 1944, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the 
appellant and several other persons, known to be Makapilis, all carrying 
firearms, arrested Pedro Natividad because they suspected him to be a guerrilla. 
The appellant and his companions demanded the surrender of the key to the 
wardrobe for the avowed purpose of searching for firearms. Instead, they found 
jewelry, clothing and money which they took away. The value of the jewelry was 
P500. Pedro Natividad was brought to the house of the mayor used as garrison and 
there maltreated. That was the last time he was seen by his wife. The following 
morning Teodora Silverio saw Pedro Natividad and several companions with swollen 
faces being dragged away. He could hardly walk. That was the last time Teodora 
Silverio saw her brother-in-law Pedro Natividad.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant is a Filipino citizen. Several witnesses 
testified that they had known the appellant to be a native of the Philippines, 
born of Filipino parents. The appellant admits that he was a "Ganap."</p>
<p align="justify">The arrest of Miguel Castillo and Candido Cruz was witnessed by 
Leona Natividad and Rita Pascual. The house of the former is adjoining that of 
the latter and the arrest was made in front of the house of Rita Pascual. The 
arrest of Bibiano Azores, Eustaquio Santos and Elpidio Cruz is established by 
the testimony of eyewitnesses Pedro Santos and Eleuteria Bautista, parents of 
Eustaquio Santos, and Fidela Bonifacio, a neighbor of Eustaquio Santos and 
Bibiano Azores. The arrest of Daniel Santos, Cirilo Jose and Salvador San Pedro 
is proved by the testimony of eyewitnesses Leona Natividad and Fidela Bonifacio. 
The latter saw the arrested persons at the ferry already tied. And finally, the 
arrest of Pedro Natividad is proved by the testimony of eyewitnesses, his widow, 
Ceferina Raymundo, and his son, Deogracias Natividad.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for the appellant contends that his client is not 
guilty of treason but at most of illegal detention as that crime is defined in 
article 267 of the Revised Penal Code. There is no merit in the contention, 
because the arrest of the victims constitutes not only adherence to the enemy 
but also it gave him aid and, therefore, is treason as defined in article 114 of 
the Revised Penal Code. It is clear that the crime committed by the appellant 
does not come under the amnesty, because it was not in furtherance of the 
resistance movement. It was just the reverse. The claim or theory that 
sovereignty of the legitimate government was suspended during the occupation of 
the country by the enemy has been rejected in this jurisdiction as unsound 
principle of unwholesome consequences (Laurel vs. Misa, L-409, 44 Off. Gaz., 
1176<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>).</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant denies having taken part in the arrest of the 
victims. He claims that from the 1st to the 20th day of December he was in 
Manila. If that were true, the only arrest in which he could not have taken part 
was that of Pedro Natividad in the morning of 10 December 1944. But the 
testimony of Ceferina Raymundo, widow of Pedro Natividad, and that of his son, 
Deogracias Natividad, prove beyond doubt that the appellant was with the 
arresting party on that occasion. In another part of his testimony the appellant 
also claims that he was in Manila on 21 November; but again the testimony of 
Leona Natividad and Rita Pascual, in front of whose houses Miguel Castillo and 
Candido Cruz were arrested, proves that the appellant was in Ugong on 21 
November 1944.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant admits that Rita Pascual entertained no ill-feeling 
towards him but believes that Leona Natividad was resentful, because when she 
requested him to find means by which her husband could be released, the 
appellant told her that he knew no Japanese at that time. If that were a fact, 
Leona Natividad could not feel resentful as there was no reason for such 
resentment. It was not sufficient motive for her to testify against the 
appellant. The imputation to Fidela Bonifacio being the same as that attributed 
to Leona Natividad should also be disregarded. It was not sufficient motive for 
her to incriminate the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">Counts 12, 13 and 15 of the information filed against the 
appellant have not been proved in accordance with the two-witness rule. The 
testimony of Leona Natividad and that of Fidela Bonifacio refer to two different 
stages of the arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">Counts 8, 9, 10, 14, 16 and 22 of the information filed against 
the appellant having been established by competent evidence and in accordance 
with the two-witness rule, the judgment rendered by the People's Court should 
be, and the same is, affirmed. The principal penalty, however, is modified and 
that of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with the accessories of the law, is imposed 
upon the appellant, with costs against him.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor, Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
