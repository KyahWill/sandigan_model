				<H3>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ISIDORO DE LA  CRUZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is  an  appeal by  the Philippine  National  Bank from the order of the Court  of  First Instance  of Manila dated  October 19, 1954,  in  Civil Case  No.  23236,  dismissing the complaint filed therein  and  from  the  order of November  22, 1954,  denying  plaintiff's motion for reconsideration  of said order of dismissal.  The facts of the case are  as follows: <br>   <br>On October 8,  1946, Isidoro de la  Cruz  obtained a  loan of P5,000.00 from the Philippine National Bank,  payable within  120  days,  with interest at 6 per cent  per annum and an additional 10 per cent of the amount due as attorney's fees in ease the collection of the indebtedness would be effected  through court  proceedings.  To secure said loan, De la Cruz executed a mortgage  in  favor of the bank over  a  certain  property  situated  at  Dasmariñas, Cavite.   It  seems that the  mortgagor  failed  to satisfy his obligation and for  this reason the bank foreclosed the mortgage and  the  property was  actually sold at  public auction by the Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff of Cavite.  The property was awarded to the bank for P5,000.00,  it being the highest  bid received for the property.   As the mortgagee's total indebtedness reached the sum of P7,879.29 as of January 5, 1953, after  deducting P5,000.00 representing the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property, there still  remained  an unsatisfied balance favor of the  bank in the sum of  P2,879.29.   Thus,  on  June  22, 1954, the Philippine National Bank filed a  complaint against Isidoro de  la  Cruz  praying the  Court that  defendant  be ordered to pay the deficiency of  P2,879.29,  with interest at the rate of  6  per  cent per annum  from  January 6, 1953, untill  fully paid. <br>   <br>Defendant filed bis  answer contending that the  price of P5,000.00 for which the property was  allegedly sold at public auction was  too inadequate and unconscionable because the said property was  worth far more than defendant's indebtedness and  its sale should  be taken to have  released  him   from  his  obligation.  Defendant, therefore, prayed that he be declared relieved of  his obligation  and  that the complaint  be dismissed. <br>   <br>The issues having been joined,  the hearing of  the case was  set for October 19, 1954, but on October 18, counsel for defendant  filed an urgent motion for  postponement, bearing  the  conformity of counsel for  plaintiff, stating among others that there was a chance  that the parties could reach  an amicable settlement; that  for such purpose, they needed some time, and praying that the hearing be postponed until the next calendar of the court.  Acting upon said  motion, the court a quo issued an order which reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"When this case was called for  hearing this afternoon,  the defendant presented an urgent motion for postponement.  This motion for postponement being contrary to law and to the Rules of Court, the same  is  hereby denied; <br>   <br>"And it appearing that the plaintiff in this case  consented to this motion without tile approval  of this Court and  for this reason did not appeal this afternoon—and this  has heen the practice of the Philippine National Bank to be  negligent in its duties—this case is hereby dismissed for non-appearance of the plaintiff,  without pronouncements as to costs"  (p. 8, Record on Appeal). </blockquote>Plaintiff thereafter filed a  motion for reconsideration asserting that it acceded to the motion for  postponement in view of defendant's intention  to settle the  case amicably and  also of the bank's policy to give its clients all the opportunity  for the  easy settlement  of their  obligations; that there  was no  intention on the part of  plaintiff not to appear  at  the hearing of the case, but the  lawyer  personally handling the same suddenly was taken ill on  that day.  An  affidavit  of  said  lawyer to  that  effect was attached to the motion.   Under  date of November 2, 1954, the  Court  denied  the motion  for  lack  of  merit.  From these 2 orders, plaintiff brought  the  matter to the Court of Appeals, but the case was certified to  Us by the latter Tribunal pursuant to the provisions of Section 17—6 of Republic Act No.  296. <br>   <br>There is no question that the granting or  denial  of  a motion for postponement rests upon the discretion  of the court, but this doctrine should not be taken to mean an absolute authority,  it being qualified in the  sense that the discretion  to  be so exercised must  be sound and  reasonable, not  arbitrary or capricious.   The only  issue,  therefore, raised by this appeal  is whether the lower court, in denying  the  motion  for  postponement involved  herein, abused such prerogative. <br>   <br>It   may  be  conceded  that postponements,  particularly those manifestly intended to delay the proceedings,  should be discouraged,  but where a  transfer of the hearing to  some other time was sought for on reasonable grounds, as when the parties are trying to reach an amicable settlement oil their controversy, it behooves the court to grant the same in order to afford the parties  opportunity to thresh  out their differences out of court.   Indeed,  it is a  sound policy for the  Court to favor  and  encourage litigants to settle their controversies extra-judicially where same is possible and lawful, not only  because it minimizes the expenses and troubles a litigation usually entails, but also due to the fact that in most cases, such  agreement redounds to  the benefit  of  both parties  and  results in their mutual satisfaction.   In  the  case  at  bar, considering that defendant's motion for postponement of the hearing was the  first and  that  same was  requested obviously to enable the parties  to  find a  common meeting ground wherein the matter in litigation could be settled, We feel that the ends of justice  could have been better served if it  wore allowed. The trial Judge  on the other hand, in denying the same, made the pronouncement that the motion thus filed  was contrary to  law,  probably  having in mind the provisions of Section  4, Rule 31 of the Rules of Court restricting the postponement of a trial to a  period not exceeding  one  month.  It  must   be  noted,  however, that although the motion for postponement prayed  that the hearing be included in the next calendar of the court, which may exceed the  1-month period provided  for by law, it appears that the written conformity of counsel for plaintiff was expressed in the following tenor:  "No objection : for 30 days".  This remark of counsel for the plaintiff contained in the  pleading  filed with the Court  may be taken as a modification of the prayer so as  to specify that the period of postponement so  requested shall not exceed 30 days.  Thus, the aforementioned motion  cannot be held to  be violative of the provisions of the Rules of Court.  (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Arts. 2029 and 2030, Civil Code.) <br>   <br>Similarly, although a party has no right to presume that a motion for  postponement would be granted by the Court  to justify his failure to appear on the date of the hearing, yet taking into account the explanation offered by plaintiff which was  not controverted,  aside from the conclusion We have already  arrived  at  that defendant's  motion  should have been  allowed,  the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a  quo </span>should  not have  dismissed the case on account of plaintiff's  alleged failure to prosecute.<br>   <br>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are hereby set aside and the  case  remanded  to the  lower Court for  further proceedings.   Without pronouncement as to  costs.  It is so ordered. <br>   <br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
