				<H3>THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. COMPAÑIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From the records of this case it appears that the
        
respondent Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas filed
        
 its income tax returns for the calendar years 1939 and
        
 1940 on April 22, 1940 and April 19, 1941, respectively.
        
 On March 14, 1946, the petitioner assessed against said
        
 respondent the amounts of P90,664.43 and P51,457.27 as
        
 deficiency income taxes for said years and gave it until
        
 March 31, 1946 to show cause why said deficiencies should
        
 not be paid.
  <p>    Between April 2, 1946 and October 29, 1948, several
          
letters were exchanged between the petitioner and the
          
respondent company resulting in revised assessments of
          
P65,594.96 and P36,046.37 for the years 1939 and 1940,
          
respectively. On March 20, 1951, said respondent requested the petitioner to countermand the assessments.
          
On October 31, 1955, the petitioner wrote respondent's
          
counsel, affirming the income tax assessment for 1939 in
          
the sum of P65,594.96 but reducing the income tax assessment for 1940 to only P849.21. On January 26, 1956, a
          
warrant of distraint and levy was issued by the petitioner
          
against the properties of the respondent company which
          
refused to accept the same. On May 19, 1956, notice of
          
seizure and sale was issued by petitioner, announcing the
          
sale of respondent company's two parcels of land and their
          
improvements on July 16, 1956.</p>
  <p>    The Court of Tax Appeals, on motion of the respondent
            
company, issued a preliminary writ of injunction, restraining the petitioner and any and all parties who may
            
act in his behalf or under his orders from taking further
            
action on or giving effect to the aforesaid notice of seizure
            
and sale. The petitioner, the Collector of Internal Revenue, has filed the present petition for certiorari.</p>
  <p>    The Court of Tax Appeals, following the pronouncements
              
of this Court, ruled that, pursuant to the provisions of
              
Section 51 (<i>d</i>) of the National Internal Revenue Code,
              
 after the lapse of three years from the date the income
              
 tax returns are due or have been filed, the Collector of
              
 Internal Revenue may no longer proceed to collect income
              
 taxes by summary method. The petitioner does not dispute this ruling, but contends that the lower court should
              
 have held that the respondent company was estopped from
              
 interposing the defense of prescription. This contention
              
 is untenable.</p>
  <p>    The respondent Company filed its 1939 and 1940 income tax returns on April 22, 1940 and April 19, 1941,
                
respectively. Under Section 51 (<i>d</i>)
of the National Internal Revenue Code, the petitioner had three years
from the date of the filing of said returns within which to determine
the deficiencies and enforce their collection by summary remedies. Yet
no such step was taken until 1956.</p>
  <p>    It is to be noted that it was only on March 14, 1946
                  
that the determination of the deficiencies corresponding
                  
to 1939 and 1940 was made by the Collector of Internal
                  
Revenue. Even if summary collections were then made,
                  
the petitioner would still have been barred therefrom pursuant to the provisions of Section 51 (<i>d</i>) of the National
                  
 Internal Revenue Code. The alleged communications between the petitioner and the respondent company which,
                  
 according to the petitioner, constituted a waiver of the
                  
 defense of prescription, were exchanged long after the
                  
 statutory three-year period had expired.</p>
  <p>    Regarding, the contention of the petitioner that the Court
                    
of Tax Appeals should have required the respondent company to put up a bond in accordance with Section 11 of
                    
Republic Act No. 1125 before granting the relief of injunction, we reiterate our ruling in the case of Collector
                    
of Internal Revenue <i>vs.</i> Jose Avelino, et al., 100 Phil, 327;
                    
 53 Off. Gaz. (3) 645, that since that court has found
                    
 the action of the Collector to be contrary to law, to require a bond would indeed be illogical and improper.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is affirmed,
                      
without costs. So ordered.</p>
  <p>
                        

    <i>Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,
                        
 J. B. L., Barrera</i>, and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ</i>., concur.<br> 
 <i>Concepcion, J</i>., reserves his vote. </p>
