				<H3>AMERICAN PRESIDENT LINES, LTD., PETITIONER VS. RICHARD A. KLEPPER, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Richard A. Klepper brought this action before the Court of First Instance of 
Manila to recover the sum of P6,729.50 as damages allegedly sustained by his 
goods contained in a lift van which fell to the ground while being unloaded from 
a ship owned and operated by the American President Lines, Ltd. to the pier, 
plus the sum of P2,000.00 as sentimental value of the damaged goods and 
attorney's fees.
<p>It appears that on February 17, 1955, Klepper shipped on board the S. S. 
President Cleveland at Yokohama, Japan one lift van under bill of lading No. 82, 
containing personal and household effects. The ship arrived in the port of 
Manila on February 22, 1955 and while the lift van was being unloaded by the 
Gantry crane operated by Delgado Brothers, Inc., it fell on the pier and its 
contents were spilled and scattered. A survey was made and the result was that 
Klepper suffered damages totalling P6,729.50 arising out of the breakage, 
denting and smashing of the goods.</p>
<p>The trial court, on November 5, 1957, rendered decision ordering the shipping 
company to pay plaintiff the sum of P6,729.50, value of the goods damaged, plus 
P500.00 as their sentimental, value, with legal interest from the filing of the 
complaint, and the sum of P1,000.00 as attorney's fees. The court ordered that, 
once the judgment is satisfied, co-defendant DeJgado Brothers, Inc. should pay 
the shipping company the same amounts by way of reimbursement. Both defendants 
appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed <em>in toto</em> the decision of 
the trial court. The shipping company interposed the present petition for 
review.</p>
<p>Anent the liability of petitioner relative to the damage caused to the goods 
in question, the Court of Appeals made the following comment: "At the outset, it 
may be well to state that the party primarily liable to plaintiff ia appellant 
American President Lines, Ltd., the carrier whose,duty it, was to deliver the 
cargo in good order to the consignee. Articles 1734, 1736, Civil Code; Articles 
355, 363, Code of Commerce. This appellant does not question the finding below 
that the damage to plaintiff's goods was due to negligence."</p>
<p>To this we agree. And we may add that, regardless of its negligence, the 
shipping company's liability would attach because being a common carrier its 
responsibility is extra-ordinary and lasts from the time the goods are placed in 
its possession until they are delivered, actually or constructively, to the 
consignee or to the person who has a right to receive them (Article 1736, Idem.) 
It can only be exempt therefrom for causes enumerated in Article 1734.</p>
<p>But, while petitioner does not dispute its liability as common carrier, it 
however contends that the same cannot exceed $500.00 invoking in its favor the 
bill of lading Exhibit A and Section 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 
(Commonwealth Act No. 65).</p>
<p>The pertinent provision of the bill of lading alluded to is clause 17 which 
in part provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"17. In case of any loss or damage to or in connection with goorls exceeding 
in actual value $500 lawful money of the United State, per package. * * * the 
value of the goods shall be deemed to be SoOil per package * * * on which basis 
the freight is adjusted and the Carrier's liability, if any, shall be determined 
on the basis of a valuta of $500 per package * * * or pro rata in case of 
partial" loss or damage, unless the nature of the goods and a valuation higher 
tlian $500 shall have been declared in writing by the shipper upon delivery to 
the Carrier and inserted in this bill of lading and extra freight paid if 
required and in such case if the actual value of the goods per package * * * 
shall exceed such declared value, the value shall nevertheless be deemed to be 
the declared value and the Carrier's liability, if any, shall not exceed the 
declared value and any partia loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the 
basis of such declared valued."</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is apparent from the above that the carrier has expressly agreed 
that in case of any loss or damage to the goods in question exceeding the sum of 
$500.00 per package the extent of its liability shall be deemed to be merely 
$500.00 per package, and not more, the Court of Appeals ruled out the above 
stipulation, holding that the same is not binding upon the shipper. Its 
reasoning follows: "Neither plaintiff nor any agent of his signed the bill of 
lading; neither has agreed to the two clauses just recited. In fact, plaintiff 
received the bill of lading only after, he had arrived at Manila. In this 
posture and lifting from the decision of the Supreme Court in Mirasol 
<em>vs</em>. Robert Dollar Co., 53 Phil., 124, 128, we hold that plaintiff 'was 
not legally bound by the clause which purports to limit defendants' liability' 
". Petitioner now assigns this finding as an error.</p>
<p>We are inclined to agree to this contention. Firstly, we cannot but take note 
of the following clause printed in red ink that appears on the very face of the 
bill of lading: "in accepting this bill of lading the shipper, consignee and 
owner of the goods agree to be bound by all its stipulations, exceptions, and 
conditions whether written, printed, or stamped on the front or back hereof, any 
local customs or privileges to the contrary notwithstanding." This clause is 
very revealing. It says that a shipper or consignee who accepts the bill of 
lading becomes bound by all stipulations contained therein whether on the front 
or back thereof. Respondent cannot elude its provisions simply because they 
prejudice him and take advantage of those that are beneficial. Secondly, the 
fact that respondent shipped his goods on board the ship of petitioner and paid 
the corresponding freight thereon shows that he im-pliedly accepted the bill of 
ladingwhich was issued in connection with the shipment in question, and so it 
may be said that the same is binding upon him as if it has been actually signed 
by him or by any other person in his behalf. This is more so where respondent is 
both the shipper and the consignee of the goods in question. These circumstances 
take this case out of our ruling in the Mirasol case (invoked by the Court of 
Appeals) and places it within our doctrine in the case of Mendoza <em>vs</em>. 
Philippine Air Lines, Inc., (90 Phil., 836), where we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Later, as already said, he says that he was never a party to he 
contract of transportation and was a complete stranger to it, that he is now 
suing on a tort or a violation of his rights as stranger (culpa aquiliana). If 
he does not invoke the contract of carriage entered into with the defendant 
company, then he would ftsrdly have any leg to stand on. His right to prompt 
delivery of the can of film at the Pili Air Port stems and is derived from the 
contract of carriage under which contract, the PAL undertook to carry the can of 
film safely and to deliver it to him promptly. Take away or ignore that contract 
and the obligation to carry and to deliver the right to prompt delivery 
disappear. Common carriers are not obligated by law to carry and to deliver 
merchandise, and persons are not vested with the Tight to prompt delivery, 
unless such common carriers previously assume the1' obligation. Said rights and 
obligations are created by a specific contract entered into by the parties.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"Here, the contract of carriage between the LVN Pictures Inc. and the 
defendant carrier contains the stipulations of delivery to Mendoza as consignee. 
His demand for the delivery of the can of film to him at the Pili Air Port may 
be regarded as a notice of his acceptance of the stipulation of the delivery in 
his favor contained in the contract of carriage, such demand being one for the 
fulfillment of the contract of carriage and delivery. In this case he also made 
himself a party to the contract, or at least has come to court to enforce it. 
His cause of action must necessarily be founded on its breach."</p></blockquote>
<p>With regard to the contention tKat the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act should 
also control this case, the same is of no moment. Article 1753<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> provides that the law of the country to 
which the goods are to be transported shall govern the liability of the common 
carrier in case of loss, destruction or deterioration. This means the law of the 
Philippines, or our new Civil Code. Under Article 1766, "In all matters not 
regulated by this Code, the rights and obligations of common carriers shall be 
governed by the Code of Commerce and by special laws," and here we have 
provisions that govern said rights and obligations (Articles 1736, 1737, and 
1738). Therefore, although Section 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 
states that the carrier shall not be liable in an amount exceeding $ 500.00 pet 
package unless the value of the goods had been declared by the shipper and 
inserted in the bill of lading, said section is merely Wppletory to the 
provisions of the Civil Code. In this respect, we agree to the opinion of the 
Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>On the strength of the opinion we have above expressed, ¦sve are constrained 
to rule that the liability of the carrier with regard to the damage of the goods 
should only be limited to $500.00 contrary to the conclusion reached by the 
Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with the modification that petitioner shipping company should only 
pay to respondent the sum of $500.00 as value of the goods damaged, the decision 
appealed from should be affirmed in all other respects, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p>
