				<H3>ADVERTISING ASSOCIATES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals 
affirming the ruling of the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue which 
denied the refund to petitioner of the sum of Pll,986.18 paid by it as 
percentage taxes on sales of neon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric 
advertising devices, pursuant to section 185 (k) of the National Internal 
Revenue Code. The basic facts in this case are not disputed and are stated in 
the decision of the Tax Board which we reproduce below:
<blockquote>
<p>"The petitioner is a manufacturer of neon-tube signs for advertising 
purposes. Petitioner manufactures neon-tube signs upon previous orders from 
advertisers. After the neon-tube signs with their corresponding armatures are 
finished, they are delivered to petitioner's customers, who pay the 
corresponding sales price, according to contract. Sometimes neon-tube signs are 
rented by customers. The respondent assessed the amount of P8,581.59 
corresponding to the 3rd quarter of 1948 to 4th quarter of 1919 and the sum of. 
P3,404.59, corresponding to the period covered from 1950 to 1951, as sales tax 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 185(<em>k</em>) of the Tax Code. The 
petitioner paid the total sum of P11,986.18 as demanded by the respondent. On 
May 12, 1949, petitioner demanded the refund of P8,581.59 as excess tax, 
alleging that petitioner should be taxed as a contractor or publisher and not as 
a manufacturer in accordance with the provisions of Section 191 of the Tax Code. 
Respondent denied the petitioner's request for refund in his letter dated 
December 20, 1950 and received by petitioner on January 2, 1951. On June 23, 
1951, petitioner addressed a letter to the Secretary of Finance requesting 
advice as to what steps petitioner should take in order to perfect its appeal 
before this Board. Inasmuch as no action was taken by the Department of Finance, 
petitioner on April 28, 1952 addressed a letter to the respondent requesting 
reconsideration of its letter dated December 20, 1950 and at the same time 
requested the refund of the additional sum of P3,404.59, taxes paid for the year 
1950-1951. Respondent in his communication dated October 14, 1952, and received 
by petitioner on October 20, 1952, refused to reconsider his ruling and 
considered his decision dated December 20, 1951, final. Petitioner now comes to 
this Board for the review of the respondent's decision.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also reproduce the pertinent portions of the two sections of the Tax 
Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 185. <em>Percentage tax on sales of automobiles, sporting goods, 
refrigerators, and others</em>.—There shall be levied, assessed and collected 
only once on every original sale, barter exchange or similar transaction 
intended to transfer ownership of, or title to, the articles herein below 
enumerated, a tax equivalent to <em>thirty per centum</em> of the gross value in 
money of the articles so sold, bartered, exchanged or transferred, such tax to 
be paid by the <em>manufacturer, producer</em> or <em>importer:</em> * * *</p>
<p>"(<em>k</em>) Neon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric advertising 
devices.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 191. <em>Percentage tax on road, building, irrigations, artesian well, 
waterworks, and other construction work contractors, proprietors or operators of 
dockyards, and others</em>.—* * * publishers, except those engaged in the 
publication or printing and publication of any newspaper, magazine, review, or 
bulletin which appears at regular intervals, with fixed prices for subscription 
and sale, and which is not devoted principally to the publication of 
advertisements; printers, and bookbinders, shall pay a tax equivalent to three 
<em>per centum</em> of their gross receipts."</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the contention of petitioner that it is not a manufacturer but only a 
contractor of neon-tube signs for the reason that it makes neon-tube signs, 
electric signs, and electric advertising devices only by contract and by 
previous order of the party paying for the signs or devices; also, that 
petitioner may also be considered a publisher for the reason that the neon signs 
made by it really publish a product or a business, and that consequently, it 
should be taxed under section 191 of the Tax Code which imposes as much lower 
tax both in rate and in amount. According to the Solicitor General, however, the 
very articles of incorporation of petitioner rebuts its contention that it is 
not a manufacturer. We quote a portion of said articles of incorporation, 
viz.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To conduct a general advertising business, both as principal and agent, 
including the preparation and arrangement of advertisements, and the 
<em>manufacture</em> and <em>construction</em> of advertising devices and 
novelties; * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner makes extensive arguments and citation of authorities as to the 
meaning of manufacturer in an endeavor to show that it does not really 
manufacture neon-tube signs, electric signs and electric advertising devices but 
only sells or leases its services in making said signs according to the wishes 
and instructions of the customer. To us there is no need of seriously 
considering said authorities and arguments because the decisive point involved 
in the case is the meaning and purpose of section 85(<em>k</em>) of the Tax 
Code. What was the intention of the Legislature in enacting said legal provision 
and what did it mean to tax? In this connection, it is both relevant and 
interesting to give a brief history of this legal provision. According to the 
decision of the Tax Board, and we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The original text of the Tax Code (Commonwealth Act No. 466) approved 
on June 15, 1939, does not include the manufacture of neon-tube signs as taxable 
under Section 185. This was due to the fact that the business of manufacturing 
neon-tube signs was not at the time very lucrative for lack of demand. But as 
years went by, the demand for such devices increased, so, under Republic Acts 
Nos. 41, 217, 588, and 594, the rate of percentage tax was increased from 10% to 
15% and then to 30%."</p></blockquote>
<p>And, the Solicitor General adds that at the beginning When the tax was only 
10 per cent the petitioner without question or protest paid the same; and it was 
only when the tax was increased to 15 per cent and then to 30 per cent that it 
thought of questioning the legality of the assessment and for the first time 
claimed that it did not fall under the provisions of section 185(<em>k</em>). 
From the time that the tax on neon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric 
advertising devices was imposed there had been no such neon-tube signs and 
electric devices mass-produced for sale to the public. And even at the present 
time petitioner admits that no such signs and devices are made or sold to the 
public except upon orders by the customers. This being the case, and if as 
contended by petitioner that its business of making and manufacturing neon-tube 
signs, electric signs, and electric advertising devices does not come under 
section 185 (<em>k</em>) of the Tax Code then one may ask what neon-tube signs, 
electric signs, and electric advertising devices does said section 
185(<em>k</em>) tax? As the Tax Board aptly frames the question in the last part 
of this decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If petitioner does not come within the purview of section 185 (<em>k</em>) 
of the Tax Code, what neon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric advertising 
devices does Congress intend to tax?"</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer would be "none". In other words, Congress would be placed in the 
position of imposing a tax on something that did not exist and so will have 
performed a futile and useless legislative act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A statute is a solemn enactment of the state acting through its legislature 
and it must be assumed that this process achieve result. It cannot be presumed 
that the legislature would do a futile thing." (Sutherland Statutory 
Construction, Vol. 2, p. 237.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As a rule taxes are imposed on existing industries, occupations, 
transactions, products and articles and not on those that may possibly exist or 
come in the future. Tax law makers, and tax collectors who generally propose and 
recommend the enactment of tax laws, are usually practical-minded people who 
deal with and consider existing situations and problems and not those that may 
possibly arise in the future. When the 10 per cent, then 15 per cent and later 
30 per cent tax was imposed on neon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric 
advertising devices sold, exchanged, or transferred the Legislature could not 
have had in mind and referred to any other signs or devices than those which 
were being made and manufactured by previous order, such as those manufactured 
by petitioner. The Legislature was not so much interested in how those neon-tube 
signs and electric advertising devices were made and manufactured as it was in 
their eventual sale to the public and to customers who ordered them. We 
therefore find and hold that the Tax Board committed no error in affirming the 
ruling of the Collector of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p>Petitioner also claims that it should be allowed deductions for the materials 
used in the making of these electric signs which are now being taxed under 
section 185(<em>k</em>). But according to the Solicitor General, although he 
agrees that the cost of the materials used in the manufacture of the finished 
articles on which the sales tax has been previously paid may be deductible from 
the gross selling price of the finished article, petitioner did not raise this 
issue before the Tax Board, and during the hearing before said body no proof, 
was presented to show that said deduction had not been allowed, as a result of 
which the Tax Board did not make any finding on the point. We agree with the 
Solicitor General that at this stage of the case, this matter cannot be 
considered.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Tax Board is hereby affirmed 
with costs. We find it unnecessary to pass upon the other points raised in the 
petition.</p>
