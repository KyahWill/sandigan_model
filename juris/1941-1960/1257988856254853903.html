				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 2, 1958, C. K. Vaswani filed Civil Case No. 34725 against P. 
Tarachand Bros, in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the amount 
of P2,160.00, the value of merchandise allegedly sold on thirty days' credit and 
delivered to defendant from June to November, 1956, plus legal interests and 25% 
of the principal amount due as attorney's fees. On January 21, 1958, defendant 
answered the complaint, claiming that plaintiff had also purchased from it 
various merchandise on an open account basis, the value of which amounts to no 
less than plaintiff's claim; and that before the accounting of the parties' 
respective purchases from each other is completed, neither party has any valid 
claim against the other. Defendant likewise counterclaimed for damages and 
attorney's fees.
<p>Issues having been joined, trial was set for March 14, 1958. Two days before 
the hearing, or on March 12, 1958, counsel for defendant moved to postpone the 
trial on the ground that his client was in Legaspi City attending to some 
important business transactions and would not be back until the end of the 
month; and that furthermore, defendant had already submitted the case to the 
Indian Chamber of Commerce in Manila for arbitration, as is customarily done by 
Indian nationals in the Philippines. Having thus filed said motion, neither 
defendant nor counsel appeared in court on March 14, 1958. In view of; 
plaintiff's vigorous opposition to the motion for postponement, however, the 
court denied the same and forthwith received the evidence for the plaintiff. The 
day following, March 15, 1958, the court promulgated its decision in the 
case,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,160.00 with 
interest at 1% per annum from December 9, 1956, thirty (30) days after the date 
of the last invoice, up to the date of full payment, plus an amount equivalent 
to 25% of the said sum of P2,160.00, and the costs of the 
action."</p></blockquote>
<p>Notified of the judgment, defendant, on April 7, 1958, moved for a new trial, 
claiming that its failure to attend the hearing was due to unavoidable 
circumstances, namely, that partner C. Tarachand was delayed in Naga City and 
Was not able to return to Manila in time for the hearing; and that defendant had 
in its possession records that would off-set plaintiff's claims. To the motion 
was attached an affidavit of C. Tarachand attesting to the facts asserted in the 
motion for new trial. Opposed by plaintiff as being <em>pro forma</em> and not 
alleging sufficient grounds to constitute excusable mistake or negligence, the 
motion was, on April 19, 1958, denied for lack of merit. Whereupon, on May 7, 
1958, defendant filed a second motion for new trial, alleging for the first time 
that the obligation sued upon had already been settled or paid; and attaching 
thereto an affidavit of C. Tarachand swearing to such payment, as well 'jas 
copies of certain entries in defendant's books of account supposedly showing the 
payments made. Before this second motion for new trial could be acted upon, 
however, defendant, on May 10, 1958, perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals 
from the decision in the case as well as the court's order denying its first 
motion for new trial. On July 27, 1958, the appeal was forwarded to as by the 
Court of Appeals on the ground that it raises purely questions of law. </p>
<p>Appellant claims that the court <em>a quo</em> erred (1) in denying its 
motion for postponement; (2) in denying its first and second motions for new 
trial; (3) in rendering a void judgment; and (4) in finding appellants evidence 
sufficient to justify the decision. We find no merit in all these claims. </p>
<p>As to the denial of appellant's motion for postponement, it is settled that 
such motions are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, which 
discretion will not be interfered with unless it has been abused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> And equally settled is the rule that a 
party moving for postponement must be in court on the day set for trial so that 
if his motion is denied, he can proceed with the hearing, and that rhe has no 
right to presume that his motion would be granted or to rely on the court's 
liberality or the generosity of the adverse party<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>, especially on less than three cteys' 
notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>We find no abuse of discretion in the lower court's denial of appellant's 
motion to postpone. The parties had been notified of hearing as early as 
February 3 1958, almost one and a half months before the date set; consequently, 
appellant had more than ample time to adjust its business affairs so that any of 
its representatives could be in court on the scheduled hearing. As its motion 
for postponement reveals, partner C. Tarachand of the defendant firm was not 
called to Legaspi City unexpectedly or for some urgent reason, it having been 
alleged in the motion "that the defendant is now in Legaspi City attending on 
some important business transaction and wouldn't be back until the end of this 
month" (R.A., p. 6). But even if Tarachand's trip were unavoidable, counsel 
should have been in court at the date of the hearing, considering that less than 
three days' notice of the motion for continuance was given to the adverse party. 
Defendant having thus taken the risk of a denial of its motion to postpone, it 
can not later be heard to complain that it was deprived of its day in court when 
trial was had in its absence.</p>
<p>As for the allegation that defendant had already handed the case to. the 
president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Manila for arbitration, we do not 
think that the same, even if true, would have justified a continuance of the 
trial of the case, considering that plaintiff does not appear to have agreed to 
or concurred in the proposal to submit the case to arbitration. Besides, 
appellant had all the time between the filing of the case and the day set for 
the trial to propose arbitration by the Indian Chamber of Commerce if it really 
wanted to settle the matter out of court. Article 2030 of the Civil Code does 
not include offers to arbitrate but only refers to compromise, upon terms that 
the Court can ascertain and determine if they are reasonable. A compromise could 
dispense with a trial; but an arbitration would merely prolong the case, since 
the arbiter's decision would remain appealable to the Courts.</p>
<p>Neither do we see any error in the lower court's denial of appellant's first 
and second motions for new trial. The first motion was correctly denied because 
it was not supported by any affidavit of merit showing any valid defenses 
appellant might have against the complaint that might change the result of the 
case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The general allegation in 
Tarachand's affidavit that he had records in his possession that would offset 
plaintiff's claim can not take the place of the affidavit of merit prescribed by 
law, since it is required that such affidavit must state facts, not mere 
conclusions or opinions, or it will not be considered valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> As for Tarachand's supposed excusable 
failure to return to Manila in time for the trial, allegedly due to some 
unavoidable and compelling reasons, the allegation is contradicted by 
appellant's own motion for postponement averring that Tarachand planned to stay 
in Legaspi until the end of March, 1958; which shows that he had no intention 
whatever to return earlier to Manila, much less on the day of the trial on March 
14, 1958.</p>
<p>Appellant's second motion for new trial was likewise rightly denied. In the 
first place, the grounds alleged were already available to appellant at the time 
of the filing of first motion for new trial, and consequently, such grounds are 
deemed waived and can not be entertained in a second motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> What is more, appellant, obviously 
realizing that its second motion for new trial could not have interrupted the 
period for appeal, perfected its appeal even before the lower court could act on 
its second motion, thereby abandoning the same, since by the perfection of the 
appeal, the trial court lost jurisdiction over its judgment and could no longer 
vacate or modify the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p>Appellant also claims that the judgment promulgated in its absence by the 
court below is void because it was deprived of its day in court. It is only when 
movant is deprived of his day in court through no fault or negligence on his 
part, as when he is declared in default before his time to answer has expired, 
that the judgment rendered in his absence would be considered void and a new 
trial is demandable as of right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
<p>Appellant finally argues that the evidence presented by plaintiff does not 
justify the judgment in his favor. We do not think so. That there is unpaid 
merchandise obtained by appellant from plairitiff during the period from June to 
November, 1956, is admitted in appellant's answer, the only defense asserted 
therein being that plaintiff also purchased from defendant various merchandise 
on an open account basis, which were still unpaid for, and the value of which 
would offset plaintiffs claim (par. 2, Answer, Rec. on App., p. 4). That 
defendant still has an unpaid account with plaintiff is also supported by the 
letters Exhibits C-1 and C-3 written by its counsel to plaintiff before this 
action was filed, in answer to demands for payment by plaintiff's counsel. If it 
is true, as appellant now alleges, that it has already paid for all the. 
merchandise sued upon by plaintiff, it would certainly have asserted. such 
payment in the letter Exhibits C-1 to C-3, as well as in its answer to 
plaintiff's complaint. That the invoices Exhibits A, A-1 to A-4 presented by 
plaintiff are unsigned, does not prove that they have been paid. Appellant's 
very failure to attach the originals to its first or second motion for new trial 
disproves its daim that they had been surrendered to it by plaintiff because 
they have already been paid.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
appellant P. Tarachand Bros.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em><br>
