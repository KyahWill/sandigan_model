				<H3>DOMINGO CRUZ AND CRESCENCIA AUSTRIA, PETITIONERS, VS. EULALIO GARCIA, JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, MANUEL JOAQUIN, AND THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF, RIZAL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The respondent Manuel Joaquin filed an ejectment suit in the justice of the 
peace court of Pasay, Rizal, against the petitioners Domingo Cruz and Crescencia 
Austria, the complaint alleging in the main that the respondent had bought the 
house situated at No. 18 O'Farrell Street, Pasay, Rizal, from one Eulalio Algoso 
on April 16, 1946, and that prior to, and at the time of the purchase, the 
petitioners were in possession of said house. In their answer, the petitioners 
alleged that they are the sole and absolute owners of the property in question 
and that the alleged vendor, Eulalio Algoso, was never its owner. The justice of 
the peace court, after denying a motion for dismissal filed by the petitioners, 
allowed the respondent Manuel Joaquin to present his evidence and thereafter 
rendered a judgment ordering the petitioners to vacate the house and to pay a 
monthly rental of P30. Upon appeal to the Court of First Instance of Rizal, the 
petitioners reiterated the defenses set up in the court of origin. In line with 
their theory, the petitioners did not deposit in the Court of First Instance the 
rental awarded by the justice of the peace court, whereupon the respondent 
Manuel Joaquin moved for immediate execution. In their opposition, the 
petitioners prayed for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of lack of 
jurisdiction on the part of the justice of the peace court, the case involving a 
question of ownership. This opposition was overruled, and the Court of First 
Instance issued an order for execution. Hence, the present original petition for 
certiorari was instituted by the herein petitioners against Honorable Eulalio 
Garcia, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Manuel Joaquin and the 
provincial sheriff of Rizal, and it is prayed that the order of execution be set 
aside, that the proceedings held before the justice of the peace court of Pasay 
be declared null and void, and that the respondent judge be ordered to desist 
from further proceeding with the case.
<p>There can be no doubt that under the pleadings as well in the justice of the 
peace court as in the Court of First Instance, the principal issue relates to 
the ownership of the house in dispute, and that any question of possession that 
may be involved necessarily depends upon the result of the inquiry into the 
title. In other words, it is clear that the petitioners cannot be ousted without 
a judicial finding that they are not the owners. As a matter of fact, the 
complaint filed in the justice of the peace court does not allege any cause of 
action against the petitioners for forcible entry or unlawful detainer within 
the meaning of section 1 of Rule of Court No. 72. The suit should, therefore, 
have been dismissed by the said justice of the peace court; and the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal did not acquire appellate jurisdiction over the 
case.</p>
<p>The case at bar is substantially on all fours with Peñalosa and Peñalosa 
<i>vs</i>. Garcia (78 Phil., 245) and Torres and Paglinawan <i>vs</i>. Peña (78 
Phil., 231). Conformably to our decisions therein, judgment is hereby entered, 
ordering the respondent judge to take cognizance of, and proceed with, the case 
in question in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, and annulling the 
order of execution issued therein, by said respondent judge. So ordered, with 
costs against the respondent Manuel Joaquin.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, 
Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Hontiveros, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
