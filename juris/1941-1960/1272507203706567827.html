				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; May&nbsp; 1954, Manila Motor&nbsp; Company&nbsp; filed in&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Manila a complaint to recover from Manuel T.&nbsp; Flores the&nbsp; amount of P1,047.98&nbsp; as&nbsp; chattel mortgage installments which&nbsp; fell due in September 1941. Defendant pleaded prescription: 1941 to 1954.&nbsp; The complaint was dismissed.&nbsp; On&nbsp; appeal, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance saw differently, sustaining plaintiff's contention that the moratorium&nbsp; laws had interrupted the running of the prescriptive&nbsp; period, and that deducting&nbsp; the time during which said laws were&nbsp; in&nbsp; operation—three&nbsp; years and eight months<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> —the ten-year term had not yet elapsed when complainant sued for collection in May&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; Wherefore said court&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the return of the case to the municipal judge&nbsp; for trial on the merits.<p>Defendant appealed, arguing principally that the moratorium laws did&nbsp; not have the effect of suspending the period of limitations, because they were&nbsp; unconstitutional, as declared by this court in&nbsp; Rutter <em>vs.</em> Esteban, 49 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. (5) 1807.&nbsp;&nbsp; He cites&nbsp; jurisprudence holding that&nbsp; when a statute is adjudged unconstitutional it is as inoperative as if it had never been passed, and no&nbsp; rights&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; built upon it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>Some members expressed doubts as to whether the order of the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; was&nbsp; appealable&nbsp; in&nbsp; nature;&nbsp; but&nbsp; we agreed not to discuss the point, inasmuch as the&nbsp; question submitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; could&nbsp; speedily&nbsp; be&nbsp; disposed&nbsp; of. In Montilla <em>vs.</em> Pacific Commercial <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> we held&nbsp; that&nbsp; the moratorium laws&nbsp; <em>suspended</em> the period of prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was rendered after the Rutter-Esteban decision.&nbsp; It should be stated&nbsp; however,&nbsp; in&nbsp; fairness to&nbsp; appellant, that the Montilla decision&nbsp; came down after he had submitted his brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in answer to&nbsp; his&nbsp; main&nbsp; contention,&nbsp; the following portion is quoted from a resolution of this Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><blockquote>&nbsp;"2. Rutter <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Esteban&nbsp; (93 Phil.,&nbsp; 68) may be&nbsp; construed to mean that at the time&nbsp; of the decision the Moratorium law could&nbsp; no longer be validly applied because of the prevailing&nbsp; circumstances. At any rate, although the general rule is that an unconstitutional&nbsp; statute—&nbsp; <blockquote>'confers&nbsp; no right,&nbsp; creates&nbsp; no office, affords no protection and justifies no acts performed under it.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 Am.&nbsp; Jur.,&nbsp; pp. 828,&nbsp; 829.)&nbsp; </blockquote>&nbsp;there are several instances wherein courts, out of&nbsp; equity, have relaxed its operation&nbsp; (cf.&nbsp; notes in Cooley's Constitutional Limitations 8th ed.,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 383&nbsp; and Notes&nbsp; 53 A. L. R., 273) or&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; its effects&nbsp; 'since the actual existence&nbsp; of a&nbsp; statute&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to such declaration is an operative fact, and may have&nbsp; consequences which cannot justly be ignored (Chicot County <em>vs.</em> Baster, 308 U. S., 371) and a realistic approach is eroding the general doctrine&nbsp; (Warring <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Colpoys, 136 Am. Law Rep., 1025, 1030)."</blockquote><p>Judgment affirmed, without costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
