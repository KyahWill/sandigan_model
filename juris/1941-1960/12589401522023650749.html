				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal&nbsp; originally&nbsp; taken if the Court of Appeals was forwarded to this&nbsp; Tribunal for the reasons that the briefs filed&nbsp; by the parties raised&nbsp; questions&nbsp; of law only. It must,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; be&nbsp; dismissed, because upon examination of the record, we&nbsp; find it to be either tardy or useless. In&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 5245 of the Quezon&nbsp; court&nbsp; of first instance, plaintiffs in August&nbsp; 1951, asked for recovery of a&nbsp; parcel of land, plus damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following&nbsp; month, they petitioned for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the property&nbsp; and&nbsp; its&nbsp; products.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; prevent such receivership,&nbsp; defendant Daniel Paglinawan, submitted a bond subscribed by Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., for the amount of P2,000 "under&nbsp; the condition that&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * will, on demand, pay&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff the damages adjudged by the&nbsp; Court which&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; may suffer * * *."<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; and their evidence,&nbsp; said Quezon Court rendered judgment&nbsp; for&nbsp; plaintiffs, requiring defendant to vacate&nbsp; the land&nbsp; and to pay Pl,064.00&nbsp; per year until he leaves the premises&nbsp; "and should not&nbsp; he not be able to pay it, the&nbsp; bond&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by him would have to answer therefor."&nbsp; Whereupon, plaintiffs asked that&nbsp; the surety be directed to deposit&nbsp; with the Court the amount of the bond for the satisfaction of such&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; The court deferred action on the request "until after&nbsp; the appellate court shall have decided the appeal&nbsp; in this case." (Defendant had appealed to&nbsp; the Court of Appeals.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 3, 1955, the last-mentioned&nbsp; court dismissed defendant's appeal.&nbsp; Consequently, upon reiteration of plaintiffs' request, the Quezon court, by its order dated January 11,&nbsp; 1956, required<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Company to deposit with the Clerk of Court the amount of P2,00O which is the amount of the bond posted in behalf of Daniel Paglinawan,&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to the disposition&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; by the&nbsp; said plaintiffs, for the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment in this case."<br></blockquote>Of this&nbsp; order&nbsp; the&nbsp; surety company&nbsp; received&nbsp; notice&nbsp; on January 20, 1956,&nbsp; [Record on Appeal p. 81] <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>; and&nbsp; on February 20, 1956, it filed a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration asserting the illegality of the order "because it does not make a finding of facts."&nbsp; On March 14, 1956, this motion was denied, and the surety&nbsp; knew&nbsp; of such&nbsp; denial on April 24,&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp; Then on May&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; it&nbsp; registered "its intention&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal from&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dated March 14,&nbsp; 1956."<br><br>It appears, however, that the appellant's brief actually questions&nbsp; the order of January&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1956, herein&nbsp; above quoted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact, the second assignment ascribes error&nbsp; to the&nbsp; lower court "in issuing its orders of January 11, 1956 and&nbsp; March&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1956." Obviously it realizes the futility of this&nbsp; appeal unless the order of&nbsp; January 11, 1956,&nbsp; is set&nbsp; aside.&nbsp; But&nbsp; said order had become&nbsp; final long before this appeal was perfected on May&nbsp; 24, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; (January 20 to February 20-31&nbsp; days;&nbsp; April 24&nbsp; to May 24-30&nbsp;&nbsp; days; total 61 days.)<br><br>Of course, the surety&nbsp; was aware&nbsp; of the number of days (61) that had elapsed; wherefore, its notice&nbsp; of appeal only mentioned the order of March&nbsp; 14, 1956.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless,&nbsp; it urges here the&nbsp; revocation of the order of January 11,&nbsp; 1956.<br><br>Needless to say, the appellant may not&nbsp; circumvent&nbsp; the finality of the questioned order (January 11) by the subterfuge of merely appealing from the denial of&nbsp; its motion to reconsider&nbsp; (March 14).<br><br>Appeal dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp;</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Allegation of plaintiffs in their "Oposicion&nbsp; a la mocion de reconsideracion" of&nbsp; February 23, 1956, which was never denied by the&nbsp; surety in its pleadings,<br><br><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> The appeal would be within 30 days&nbsp; from April 24, 1956.&nbsp; But, as explained, it is useless.</div>
