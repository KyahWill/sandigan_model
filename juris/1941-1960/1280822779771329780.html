				<H3>LUCIA JAVIER, PETITIONER, VS. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF ANGELA S. TUASON AND FIDEL IBAÃ‘EZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH IX, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October 30, 1951, this Court dismissed the petition for 
certiorari interposed by Lucia Javier and dissolved the preliminary 
injunction issued as prayed for in said petition.  Before this decision 
has become final, a petition was filed in this Court praying that the 
damages suffered by respondent resulting from the issuance of the writ 
be assessed either by the Supreme Court or by the court of origin.  On 
November 21, 1951, acting favorably on said petition, this Court 
directed the trial court to make a finding of the damages allegedly 
suffered by respondent, and on August 13, 1953, this Court was furnished
 with a copy of the order entered by the trial court on August 12, 1953,
 wherein it denied the motion of respondent to assess the damages as 
directed by this Court and ordered that the record be forwarded to the 
latter Court for whatever action it may deem proper to take in the 
premises.
  <p>  It appears that while the trial court was in the process or 
receiving evidence on the damages incident to the issuance of the writ 
of preliminary injunction, Lucia Javier, the defendant, died and because
 of this supervening event, the trial court entertained the view that 
the claim for damages should be denied because that claim should be 
filed against the estate of the deceased.  It also appears that, when 
respondent pressed for action on his motion for assessment of damages, 
counsel for the bonding party, Alto Surety Company, opposed said move on
 the ground that the action contemplated is too late because the order 
of the trial court denying respondent's motion for reconsideration and 
cancelling the bond filed by the surety has already become final and 
unappealable; and considering that a petition for damages holding the 
surety liable should be filed before the judgment becomes final, the 
court sustained the opposition and denied the motion to assess damages. 
 The incident is now before this Court for the corresponding appropriate
 action.</p>
  <p>  The finding of the trial court that the claim for damages of 
respondent should be denied because of the death of the debtor, Lucia 
Javier, and the claim should be filed against the estate of the latter, 
is not well taken.  This result only obtains if the claim is for 
recovery of money, debt or interest thereon, and the defendant dies 
before final judgment in the Court of First Instance, (Rule 3, Section 
21, Rules of Court), but not when the claim is for damages for an injury
 to person or property, (Rule 88, Section 1, Idem).  In the present 
proceeding, the claim for damages had arisen, not while the action was 
pending in the Court of First Instance, but after the case had been 
decided by the Supreme Court.  Moreover, the claim of respondent is not 
merely for money or debt but for damages to said respondent.  Thus, 
Chief Justice Moran, commenting on Section 1, Rule 3, says: "The above 
section has now removed all doubts by expressly providing that the 
action should be discontinued upon defendant's death if it is for the 
recovery of money, debt, or interest thereon, while, on the other hand, 
in Rule 88, Section 1, it is provided that <i>actions to recover damages
 for injury to person or property,</i> real or personal, may be 
maintained against the executor or administrator of the deceased." 
(Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 1, 1952 ed., p. 109.)</p>
  <p>On the other hand, under Rule 3, Section 17, Rules of Court, when a
 party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court shall 
order the legal representative of the deceased, or the heirs, to be 
substituted for him within a period of 30 days, or within such time as 
may be granted.  Here, it appears that no step has so far been taken 
relative to the settlement of the estate, nor an executor or 
administrator of the estate has been appointed.  This deficiency may be 
obviated by making the heirs take the place of the deceased.</p>
  <p>    The claim that the move of respondent to have the damages 
assessed against Lucia Javier has come late because the order of the 
court denying the motion for reconsideration of respondent and 
cancelling the bond filed by the surety has already become final and 
unappealable, is not also well taken, it appearing that the motion of 
respondent pressing for action on the motion to assess damages was filed
 only five days after said order has been entered.  It should be noted 
that the original order entered by the court on April 7, 1953, was not a
 denial of the claim but merely a statement of its view that no action 
thereon can be taken in view of the death of Lucia Javier because in its
 opinion the claim should be filed against her estate, and the order 
which ordered the cancellation of the bond was entered only on May 27, 
1953.</p>
  <p>    It appearing that the trial court has refrained from assessing 
the damages which it was directed to assess in the resolution of this 
Court issued on November 21, 1951, for reasons which, in the opinion of 
the court, are not well founded, it is the sense of this Court that the 
record should be remanded to the trial court for it to act as directed 
in said resolution.</p>
