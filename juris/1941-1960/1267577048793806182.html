				<H3>ANTONIO NARVAEZ, PETITIONER, VS. DIONISIO DE LEON, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, LADISLAO PASICOLAN, SHERIFF OF MANILA, AND CENTRAL SURETY INSURANCE COMPANY, AS PLAINTIFF IN CIVIL CASE NO. 2255 IN THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Ramon P. Bernal was indebted to the Central Surety Co. in the 
sum of P3,000 and together with the petitioner Antonio Narvaez signed, as 
co-makers, a promissory note for said amount in favor of the creditor. Besides, 
the debtor Bernal executed a chattel mortgage on pertain personal properties 
belonging to him that had an inventory value of about P7,000 to secure the 
payment of his said debt. On April 8, 1947, the respondent Central Surety 
Insurance Co. instituted an action against R. Bernal and the petitioner for the 
recovery of the aforementioned sum of P3,000, and obtained a writ of attachment 
on the same properties mortgaged to the plaintiff to secure the payment of said 
amount, according to the verified allegation in the petition filed in the 
present case and not denied under oath by the respondents.
<p align="justify">Sometime before the rendition of the judgment, the plaintiff 
and the defendant Bernal, without the knowledge of the petitioner Narvaez, 
entered into an extrajudicial agreement whereby Bernal assigned and transferred 
to the plaintiff Central Surety and Insurance Co. the same personal properties 
that were mortgaged to the plaintiff and subsequently attached upon the latter's 
petition to secure the payment of the debt, authorizing the plaintiff "to keep 
and preserve it or sell it with my consent, the proceeds of which shall be 
applied to whatever judgment may be rendered against me in the civil case of 
which I am the defendant" (Annex A, respondent's answer.)</p>
<p align="justify">After the rendition of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff 
and against the defendants had become final and before any action had been taken 
by the plaintiff on the personal properties of Bernal that were first attached 
and afterwards delivered to the plaintiff for the purpose above mentioned, a 
writ of execution was, upon plaintiff's motion, issued against the properties of 
petitioner Narvaez. The petitioner filed a motion to set it aside on the ground 
that, by the plaintiff's acceptance of Bernal's chattels or personal properties, 
delivered by the latter to the plaintiff to be sold and the proceeds of the sale 
applied to the payment of the judgment, the petitioner was only liable for the 
balance of the judgment that would remain unsatisfied. The petitioner's motion 
was denied, and hence this petition for certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner's contention in the present case is that the 
judgment creditor having already secured possession of the property of the other 
solidary debtor Bernal by attachment and voluntary surrender, to be kept and 
sold by the said judgment creditor to satisfy the judgment, the respondent judge 
abused his discretion in ordering the execution of the petitioner's property, 
citing article 1148 of the Civil Code in support of his contention. And the 
respondents, on the other hand, maintain that they have the right to proceed 
against the petitioner without previously disposing of the properties of Ramon 
P. Bernal, because the petitioner is a joint and solidary debtor according to 
the final decision of the respondent judge, in accordance with article 1144 of 
the Civil Code, which provides that the creditor may proceed against any of the 
solidary debtor or against all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that said article 1144 provides that the creditor 
may sue either any of the solidary debtors or all of them simultaneously, but 
whether only one or all of the solidary debtors are sued jointly "any solidary 
debtor may interpose against the claim of the creditor all defenses arising from 
the nature of the obligation," as well as those "personal to the other solidary 
debtors * * * with respect to the share of the debt for which the former may be 
liable." As the surrender of the personal properties of the defendant Bernal to 
the plaintiff in order that the latter may preserve and sell them and apply the 
proceeds thereof to the satisfaction of the judgment, was made after trial and a 
short time before the rendition of the judgment, the petitioner could not have 
set it up as a defense in his pleading or before the trial of the case, but he 
may plead it against the execution of the whole judgment against him. Because, 
although a solidary debtor is bound to perform not only his share in the 
solidary obligation but also that of his solidary co-debtor since a solidary is 
also a joint obligation, if any one of the other solidary debtors ha d already 
paid or transferred his property to the creditor to secure the payment of his 
share, the defendant solidary debtor has the right to have that payment or the 
property given as security by the other debtors sold and the proceed applied to 
the satisfaction of the latter's shares in the obligation for which the 
defendant may be liable, pursuant to the above quoted article 1148 of the Civil 
Code.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present case, before the levy of the execution on the 
petitioner's property, the petitioner can not tell whether or not he is to be 
made to pay the whole amount of the judgment, without previously selling the 
property of the defendant Bernal in the hands of the plaintiff and applying the 
proceeds thereof to the papient of Bernal's share (one-half) in the solidary 
obligation, or only petitioner's share plus Bernal's unsatisfied share. 
Therefore, it is premature to contend that the court has acted contrary to the 
provision of article 1144 of the Civil Code in ordering merely the execution of 
the judgment on the petitioner's property, since the latter, as solidary 
co-debtor, is liable to pay at least his own share in the solidary obligation, 
as well as that of his co-debtor's Bernal which would remain unpaid.</p>
<p align="justify">If the respondent judge or court would not allow the petitioner 
to set up in due time such defense he shall commit an error but not exceed the 
court's jurisdiction and much less abuse a discretion whiCh the court does not 
have, in view of the express provision of the law on the matter, and therefore 
certiorari would not lie.</p>
<p align="justify">Should the court insist, after the execution of the 
petitioner's property, on applying the proceeds of the sale thereof to the 
payment of the whole judgment without ordering the sale and applying the 
proceeds of the sale of Bernal's property in the hands of the judgment creditor 
to the satisfaction of the letter's share, the petitioner may appeal from the 
court's order denying his petition to that effect, because it would be a final 
order that affects a substantial right of the petitioner rendered after the 
judgment has become final. In the same way as appeal is allowed from an order 
allowing or disallowing costs, affirming or disapproving a sale inaforeclosure 
proceeding, or an order of the court on a report submitted by a commissioner 
appointed to determine a question of fact in order to carry a judgment or order 
into effect.</p>
<p align="justify">"In many States the statutes allow an appeal for a final order, 
or from an order or final order affecting a substantial right made after 
judgment, order or decree, or made on a summary application in an action after 
judgment" (3 C. J., sec. 269). "Under express staturory provisions in many 
jurisdiction, varying somewhat in language, an appeal will lie from an special 
'any special order made after final judgment,' or from 'an order' or a 'final 
order', or an order or final order 'affecting a substantial right', 'in an 
action after judgment' etc." (3 C. J., sec. 352). And section 2, Rule 4 of Rules 
of Court provides that appeal lies against a <i>final</i> judgment or 
<i>order</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of all the foregoing, the petition for certiorari is 
denied with costs against the petitioner. So ordered.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>PARAS, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner, Antonio Narvaez, and Ramon P. Bernal were 
solidary co-makers of a note for P3,000 in favor of the respondent Central 
Surety Insurance Company. As a security for said note, Ramon P. Bernal executed 
a chattel mortgage in favor of the company on certain personal properties 
belonging to Ramon P. Bernal, valued, according to the inventory attached to the 
mortgage, at about P7,000. For failure to pay the obligation on time, the 
company instituted on April 8, 1947, a personal action in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 2255) against Ramon P. Bernal and the 
petitioner, Antonio Narvaez, for the recovery of the sum of P3,000. Upon the 
commencement of said action, the company obtained from the court a writ of 
attachment against Ramon P. Bernal with a view to devying upon the Same personal 
properties already covered by the chattel mortgage. From the pleadings it does 
not definitely appear that said properties were actually levied upon in 
pursuance of said attachment. Indeed, on May 6, 1947, Ramon P. Bernal assigned 
to the company the properties, for the company "to keep, and preserve it or sell 
it with my consent, the proceeds of which shall be applied to whatever judgment 
may be rendered against me in the civil case of which I am the defendant, and 
the Central Surety &amp; Insurance Company is the plaintiff." (Annex A of 
answer.) Judgment in civil case No. 2255 in favor of the company was rendered by 
the Court of First Instance of Manila on May 31, 1947. After this judgment had 
become final and executory, the company obtained a writ of execution, directed 
against the petitioner Antonio Narvaez. Efforts to quash this writ of execution 
against the petitioner having failed, the latter has come to this Court for the 
purpose of preventing its inforcement against the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify">It is contended for the petitioner that the lifting of the 
attachment abtained by the company against the properties of Ramon P. Bernal, 
without notice to the Court of First Instance of Manila, was illegal, and that 
before the petitioner could be bound to pay anything to the company, there must 
be a showing that the company has sold the properties mortgaged by Bernal and 
later sought to be attached by the company, and that the proceeds of the sale 
were not sufficient to pay off the obligation of P3,000.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no merit in the contention. It is true that the 
properties in question were covered by a mortgage in favor of the company, and 
that the latter really intended to attach the same upon the commencement of 
civil case No. 2255. But there is no indication in the record that the company 
ever proceeded to foreclose the chattel mortgage or that actual levy was made on 
said properties. On the contrary, it appears that the properties were turned 
over by Ramon P. Bernal to the company for the latter to preserve it or sell it 
with the consent of Bernal. Under these conditions, the company was not bound to 
sell said properties; as a matter of fact, it is not pretended that they were 
sold by the company. The latter has every right to waive any advantage accruing 
under the mortgage, the attachment, and the voluntary surrender of said 
properties by Ramon P. Bernal. It appearing that the petitioner is a solidary 
debtor, it is elementary that the company may proceed against him independently 
of his co-maker Ramon P. Bernal. As long as the solidary obligation, now the 
subject matter of a final and executory judgment, is not paid, the company may 
go against the petitioner alone. The latter of course has his legal remedies 
against the co-maker Ramon P. Bernal.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner has called attention to a letter of Bernal dated 
August 5, 1947, informing the petitioner that the company had taken all the 
personal chattels valued at more than P7,000 which Bernal considered the loan of 
P3,000 fully settled. If there was such a letter, the same cannot overcome the 
force and effect of Annex A of the answer of respondent company, which 
specifically authorized the company merely to keep and preserve said properties 
or sell them with the consent of Ramon P. Bernal.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, I vote for the dismissal of this petition for 
certiorari, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO, J.:</p> We concur in the above concurring opinion.</div>
