				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal complaint dated August 17, 1955, accused Eustaquio Hinaut, Odona Taguran and Agapito&nbsp; Hinaut were charge&nbsp; with the crime of theft before the Justice of the Peace of Lopez Jaena&nbsp; (Criminal Case No. 2496).&nbsp; After arraignment,&nbsp; wherein all&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; "not guilty", the prosecution presented its evidence, both testimonial&nbsp; and documentary, and thereafter rested its&nbsp; case with&nbsp; reservation to introduce additional evidence, which was stated&nbsp; to be&nbsp; unavailable&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defense followed, and likewise offered its evidence,&nbsp; but before it had&nbsp; entirely&nbsp; closed, the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal submitted a motion&nbsp; for the provisional dismissal&nbsp; of the case.&nbsp; Accused expressed their consent thereto by&nbsp; placing their thumbmarks (only Agapito Hinaut signed&nbsp; his&nbsp; name) at the end of the motion, after the word "with our conformity".<br><br>In&nbsp; its order of December 19, 1955, the&nbsp; Justice of&nbsp; the Peace dismissed the&nbsp; case&nbsp; provisionally as&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for. About six months later, the prosecution filed&nbsp; a motion to revive the case, which was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by the Justice of&nbsp; the Peace court&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; order dated January 8,&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp; The corresponding information&nbsp; was&nbsp; rented by the Fiscal on June 1,&nbsp; 1956.<br><br>The defense appealed to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Misamis Occidental, and after review of the above facts the court opined: "when a criminal&nbsp; case, after&nbsp; due arraignment and plea had been made and after the trial had almost been completed,&nbsp; even if the&nbsp; case is dismissed with an express conformity of the accused,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said accused had already been&nbsp; placed in double jeopardy".<br><br>Hence,&nbsp; this appeal by the prosecution.<br><br>The plea of double jeopardy was&nbsp; improperly sustained by the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; Rule 113 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>"When a defendant shall have been convicted or acquitted, or the case&nbsp; against him&nbsp; dismissed or otherwise&nbsp; terminated <i>without the express consent of&nbsp; the defendant,</i> by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon&nbsp; a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, and after the defendant had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be&nbsp; a bar to another&nbsp; prosecution for the offense&nbsp; charged, or&nbsp; for any attempt to commit the same&nbsp; frustration&nbsp; thereof, or for&nbsp; any&nbsp; offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>When the accused signified their express conformity with the&nbsp; provisional dismissal of&nbsp; the case, there was neither acquittal&nbsp; nor dismissal that would put them twice in jeopardy of the same offense upon the refiling of the case. The resolution of this Court&nbsp; dated May 21, 1951,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gandicela <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Lutero,&nbsp; 88&nbsp; Phil., 299&nbsp; (wherein it was hinted that the addition of the words "without prejudice" or "provisional" to a court's order&nbsp; dismissing a case are without legal effect)&nbsp; contemplates a dismissal <i>on the merits</i> amounting to acquittal or a dismissal after arraignment and plea without&nbsp; the <i>express</i>&nbsp; consent of&nbsp; the accused.&nbsp; This is not true in&nbsp; this case, for the dismissal, according to the Justice of the Peace, was premised&nbsp; on the need of the prosecution to have more time in securing a missing piece of evidence necessary for the conviction of the accused.&nbsp; It is important to note that what was sought for&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal,&nbsp; to&nbsp; which the accused expressed their agreement, was not a simple or unconditional dismissal of the&nbsp; case, but its&nbsp; <i>provisional</i>&nbsp; dismissal that prevented it from being&nbsp; finally&nbsp; disposed of.&nbsp; Certainly, the&nbsp; accused cannot now validly claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; the dismissal was, in effect, on the&nbsp; merits and deny its provisional character.&nbsp; Even assuming moreover, that there was double jeopardy, they should be considered as&nbsp; having waived the constitutional safeguard against the same.<br><br>This case is not to be likened to that of People <i>vs.</i> Cabarles, 102 Phil., 926; 54 Off. Gaz., [29],&nbsp; 7051 where the motion to quash was based on the insufficiency of the evidence after the prosecution&nbsp; had rested its case, and what was prayed for was not&nbsp; a provisional&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of the case, but such a dismissal as would&nbsp; amount to an acquittal or one on the&nbsp; merits.<br><br>As stated&nbsp; in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Alejo Labrador in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Jabajab,&nbsp; 100&nbsp; Phil., 307; 53 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [3], 632:<br><blockquote>"I concur.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my&nbsp; humble opinion the decisive fact which determines whether jeopardy attached upon the issuance of the order of dismissal is the provisional nature of the dismissal&nbsp; and&nbsp; the reservation of the&nbsp; right of the fiscal to 'refile these two cases if he so desires in the interest of Justice.'&nbsp; Jeopardy can be invoked&nbsp; only if the case is&nbsp; finally disposed of or terminated.&nbsp; Dismissal under Section 9 of Rule 113 implies <i>final dismissal</i>,&nbsp; a positive termination of the case.&nbsp; If the dismissal contains a reservation of the right to file another action, the case can not be said to have terminated and jeopardy does&nbsp; not attach.&nbsp; This is the reason for our ruling in Jaca <i>vs.</i> Blanco, 86 Phil., 452."<br></blockquote>What could have been done by the accused in the case at bar was the action suggested by this Court in the case of Gandicela <i>vs.</i> Lutero&nbsp; (see Resolution, supra), by&nbsp; invoking their constitutional right to speedy trial&nbsp; rather than consent to a provisional dismissal of the case that would allow a valid reinstatement thereof&nbsp; (Go Te Hua <i>vs.</i> Encarnacion, 50 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 599).<br><br>Do the words "with our conformity" operate as a sufficient conveyance of express consent within the purview of the Rules of Court (see <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>) ?&nbsp; We believe so, for these words imply not merely passive assent but an active manifestation on the part of the accused of their express agreement to&nbsp; the provisional dismissal of the case.&nbsp; This Court had occasion&nbsp; to pass upon the meaning of "express consent" in the case of&nbsp; Pendatun <i>vs.</i> Aragon,&nbsp; (93 Phil., 796; 49 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [10], 4372) :<br><blockquote>"The words 'No objection' written on the motion to dismiss directly conveyed, as&nbsp; undoubtedly they were intended to convey,&nbsp; the idea of full accordance with the proposed dismissal.&nbsp; It was not the same as acquiescence manifested by signs,&nbsp; actions, facts, inaction or silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the same as saying 'I&nbsp; agree' although it&nbsp; was not as emphatic&nbsp; as the latter expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having manifested 'no objection' to the motion for the express purpose of obtaining a ruling of the court upon such motion, counsel&nbsp; could not&nbsp; have meant&nbsp; other than that he was&nbsp; in&nbsp; agreement with the dismissal, and there&nbsp; is no question that that was what the court and the prosecution understood him to mean;&nbsp; otherwise, trial could&nbsp; have&nbsp; been postponed instead of the case being temporarily dismissed, there being good grounds for&nbsp; the continuance."<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside and the case remanded for&nbsp; further&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
