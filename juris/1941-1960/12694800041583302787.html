F., por las presente,<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">HAGO CONSTAR:<br></div><br>Que vendo, cedo y traspaso en calidad de venta con pacto de retro por 5 años, a contar desde la fecha de esta escritura al mencionado Benvenuto Managbanag, sus herederos y causahabientes, la parcela de terreno secano o maizal en el barrio Caridad, sitio Hipgup, del municipio de Baybay, cuya descripcion mas detallada es como sigue:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Al Norte, confina con el riachuelo sin nombre; <br>Al Este, con Arsenio Veloso; <br>Al Sur, con Arsenio Veloso y <br>Al Oeste, con Magdaleno Mantua;<br></div><br>Es conocido como Lote No. _______y Tax No. ________ <br>Sus mojones son los postes de cemento por la medicion Catastral; <br>Del que terreno soy propietario y lo adquiri por herencia de mi difunta madre, posesionando quieta y pacificamente hasta la fecha.<br><br>Hago constar tambien, que queda convenido y pactado con el mencionado Benvenuto Managbanag, sus herederos y causahabientes, que si yo lo devolviere o hiciere pagar la suma de P178.00 en o antes de 5 años, como se ha dicho arriba, el o sus representantes me otorgara una escritura de retroventa y quedara nula o de ningun valor esta escritura, pero si trascurre dicho termino sin haberse utilizado el derecho de redencion, adquirira el caracter de absoluta esta venta o irrevocablemente consumada.&nbsp; Por ultimo hago constar, que esta parcela de terreno esta libre de toda carga y gravamen y que prometo defender ahora y siempre contra las reclamaciones justas de quien las presentare.<br><br>En testimonio de lo cual, firmo la presente ante los testigos presenciales en el Municipio de Baybay, Leyte, hoy 11 de Marzo de 1936.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Fdo.)&nbsp; PEDRO DAPITON <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Vendedor</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><br>En presencia de: <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(Fdo.)&nbsp; F. SOFRO<br></div><br>(Fdo.)&nbsp; MARTIN DAPITON<br><br>(The acknowledgment before a notary public follows.)</blockquote>The plaintiffs cannot question now the identity of the parcel of land by claiming that it is different from the lot described in original certificate of title No. 16923 issued in the name of Pedro Dapiton, because the stipulation of facts states that it is the same parcel of land.<br><br>The instruments in the cases cited in the opinion of the trial court and in the briefs of the parties reveal the intent of the parties not to sell but just to convey the parcel of land as a security for the payment of a loan.&nbsp; In the case of Olino <i>vs.</i> Medina, 13 Phil. 379, a previous creditor indorsed the documents on the parcel of land to the defendant Medina who at the request of the plaintiff furnished the money with which to redeem it; in Padilla <i>vs.</i> Linsañgan, 19 Phil. 65, the terms "pledged" and "debt" are used in the instrument; in Cuyugan <i>vs.</i> Santos, 34 Phil. 100, citing Lichauco <i>vs.</i> Berenguer, 20 Phil. 12, partial payments were accepted by the vendee which is inconsistent with the idea of sale; in Manlagnit <i>vs.</i> Sanchez, 34 Phil. 325, the word "mortgage" and three times the word "creditor" are used in the instrument; in Pamintuan <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez et al., 37 Phil., 876, the rule laid down in Cuyugan <i>vs.</i> Santos, <i>supra,</i> was reiterated; in Villa <i>vs.</i> Santiago, 38 Phil., 157, the same rule in Cuyugan <i>vs.</i> Santos, <i>supra,</i> was adhered to; in Cuyugan <i>vs.</i> Santos, 39 Phil., 970, the rule in Cuyugan <i>vs.</i> Santos, <i>supra,</i> was again reiterated.<br><br>The instrument in the instant case reveals clearly the intention of the parties.&nbsp; It is a sale with a right reserved by the vendor to repurchase the parcel of land sold.&nbsp; There is no room for doubt or interpretation as to the intent of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>As to inadequacy of the price, the rule in Askay <i>vs.</i> Cosalan, 46 Phil., 179, that mere inadequacy is not sufficient ground for the rescission or resolution of a contract when both parties were in a position to form an independent judgment concerning the transaction, and that in Manalo <i>vs.</i> Gueco, 42 Phil., 925 which holds that the purchase price of P3,728, whereas the value of the property was estimated at P7,000, was not grossly inadequate or unconscionable to indicate that it was a mortgage and not a <i>pacto de retro</i> sale, are in point.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is modified thus: the plaintiffs or anyone of them who is in possession of the owner's duplicate of original certificate of title No. 16923 are directed to surrender it to the Registrar of Deeds for the province of Leyte and the defendant to attach documentary stamps as by law provided to the notarial document executed by Pedro Dapiton on 11 March 1936 and to the other notarial document executed by Benvenuto Managbanag on 16 July 1936 in favor of Arsenio Veloso, to pay the required fees not only for the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in lieu of No. 16923 to be cancelled but also the fees for the registration of all the documents, including the order of the probate court or the extrajudicial partition or adjudication, as the case may be, of the parcel of land in favor of the defendant Nicolas Veloso, to be recorded, and the fee provided for in section 99, Act No. 496, and to show to the Registrar of Deeds that he has paid the inheritance tax.&nbsp; The rest of the judgment not inconsistent herewith is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
