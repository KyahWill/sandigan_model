				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 16, 1950, Consuelo Roxas and her husband Salvador Gomez filed an 
action for illegal detainer in the Municipal Court of Manila against Juan Ysmael 
&amp; Co., Inc., a local corporation, seeking to eject the latter from a parcel 
of land registered in their name, located on Calle Conception and bordering the 
Pasig River, near or next to the Ayala Bridge, and the payment of the sum of 
P37,700 as back rentals. It would appear that sometime in 1948, portion of the 
parcel in question were being occupied and rented by one Louis B. Varney and 
Jose Barredo for the deposit of scrap iron; that the defendant corporation later 
bought Varney's and Barredo's scrap iron and continued the occupation of the 
premises or at least a portion of the same for the same purpose; that sometime 
before the filing of the complaint the defendant corporation notified the 
plaintiffs that it was vacating the premises, but that as a matter of fact, 
according to plaintiffs, although it had removed a portion of the scrap iron 
deposited, still, it retained a portion of the premises of about 1,000 square 
meters in area where it kept what was termed "Mostly Old Stock" (materiales 
viejos), by reason of which the plaintiffs could not make use of the land. The 
Municipal Court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and sentenced the 
corporation to pay the former the sum of P37,700 for rents plus interest. The 
Municipal Court made a finding that the defendant had vacated the premises on 
January 8, 1950, that is, eight days prior to the filing of the action for 
illegal detainer.
<p>Upon the case being elevated to the Court of First Instance where the 
complaint filed in the Municipal Court was reproduced, the defendant filed a 
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the theory that inasmuch as the 
suit for ejectment was filed in the Municipal Court about eight days after the 
premises had been vacated, it was evident that there was no case of illegal 
detainer and that consequently, the suit was one to collect a sum of 
money—P37,700—over which the Municipal Court had no jurisdiction; and the 
Municipal Court being without jurisdiction, neither had the Court of First 
Instance jurisdiction on appeal. The trial court denied the motion for dismissal 
on the ground that the jurisdiction of a court to try a case was determined by 
the allegations of the complaint and that according to said allegations, at the 
time it was filed the defendant was still occupying about 1,000 square meters of 
the land in question.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance eventually rendered judgment in favor of the 
plaintiffs and, against the defendant but reduced the amount of said judgment to 
P12,813.32 "for the use and occupation of plaintiffs' land, with costs against 
the defendant." The trial court found as a fact that the defendant vacated the 
remaining 1,000 square meters only on February 14, 1950, that is to say, about a 
month after the filing of the action in the Municipal Court. Both parties 
appealed to the Court of Appeals but the latter court in a resolution found that 
the question of jurisdiction was involved in the appeal and so certified it to 
us. The theory of the Court of Appeals in making the certification is that 
inasmuch as the Municipal Court in its decision found that the land was vacated 
on January 8, 1950 and the suit for ejectment was filed about eight days later, 
there no longer was a case for illegal detainer but only for the collection of a 
sum of money (P37,700) in the form of back unpaid rentals, and that the 
Municipal Court had no jurisdiction because of the amount; and neither had the 
Court of First Instance on appeal; and that although the parties do not raise 
this point of jurisdiction before the Court of Appeals, nevertheless, the 
parties cannot with their silence or even by their express consent or agreement 
confer jurisdiction on a court; and so considering jurisdiction to be in issue, 
it held that only this Tribunal can entertain the appeal.</p>
<p>In the first place, when the parties themselves do not raise the question of 
jurisdiction on appeal, ordinarily the appellate courts will not pass upon the 
same. In the present appeal the defendant-appellant in its brief says that it is 
not raising and it does not wish to raise the question of jurisdiction and that 
it desires to have this case terminated as soon as possible, and that it is 
willing to pay reasonable rents for the land it had occupied. It is true that in 
its decision the Municipal Court found that the defendant had vacated the 
premises on January 8, 1950. But it should be remembered that on appeal to the 
Court of First Instance this decision of the Municipal Court was vacated. As far 
as the Court of First Instance was concerned, said decision did not exist 
because the case was to be tried <em>de novo</em>. To determine its jurisdiction 
the Court of First Instance had to rely on the allegations of the complaint in 
the Municipal Court, reproduced in the Court of First Instance, and according to 
said complaint at the time of the filing of the suit on January 16, 1950, the 
defendant was still occupying about 1,000 square meters of the land; in other 
words, there was illegal detainer. And, what is more, as already stated, the 
Court of First Instance found as a fact that defendant corporation continued 
occupying this portion up to February 14, 1950.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, and because we are of the opinion that not only was 
the question of jurisdiction not raised in the present appeal but that it would 
appear that the court below had jurisdiction to entertain and decide the case, 
it is hereby ordered that the present appeal be returned to the Court of Appeals 
for decision.</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</em> and 
<em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Case returned to the Court of Appeals for decision</em>.</p></div>
