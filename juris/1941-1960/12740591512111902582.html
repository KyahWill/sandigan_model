				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First
Instance of Zambales, Hon. Lucas Lacson, presiding, finding Silvino
Guerrero and Justo Ebid, defendants-appellants, guilty of the murder of
Candido Disengaño under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code and of
kidnapping of one Paulo Disengaño under Article 267 of the same Code,
and sentencing each of them to suffer for each of the above offenses
the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua,</em> to indemnify jointly and
severally the heirs of the deceased Candido Disengaño in the amount of
P6,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears that on or about September 28, 1951, nine
Huks named Commander Murphy, Commander Silang, Berling, Claro, Violeta,
Gabriel, Silvino Guerrero, Justo Ebid and Felipe Eclarino, were in the
mountains of Cabangan, municipality of Cabangan, province of Zambales,
foraging for camotes, rice and other kinds of food. In the morning of
September 28, they left the place in the direction of the mountains
east of the municipality of Botolan. While on their way they met two
individuals, Candido Disengaño, father, and Paulo Disengaño, his minor
son, who were then looking for a lost carabao. Candido and Paulo were
residents of the barrio of Panan, municipality of Botolan. Thereupon
Commander Murphy asked Candido if he knew any Huk, to which Candido
replied that he did, pointing to defendant-appellant Silvino Guerrero,
who was one of the group of nine Huks that had come from Cabangan.
Commander Murphy then asked Guerrero what kind of persons the two whom
they met were, upon which Guerrero, according to the witnesses for the
prosecution, replied that Candido was or could be a spy, as he had a
son in the navy and another in the army. (Witnesses for the prosecution
who testified on this point were Felipe Eclarino, one of the Huks whose
case was dismissed for the purpose of utilizing him as government
witness, and Justo Ebid, one of the defendants-appellants).</p>
<p align="justify"> Upon hearing what Guerrero stated regarding Candido
Disengaño, Murphy ordered that Paulo, the minor, be left at the foot of
the mountain, guarded by two Huks, while all the other Huks brought
Candido with them up the mountain. This mountain is known as <em>Yamut Bancal. </em>Once
they reached a place in the mountain, Murphy tied the hands of Candido
at the back and ordered Guerrero to dispose of him. Guerrero took a
piece of wood about two feet long and two inches thick, and began
beating Candida at the nape and at the back, while the latter had his
hands tied at the back and could offer no resistance or defense. The
appellant delivered the blows until Candido fell and died. Thereupon
one of the Huks named Violeta got hold of Candido's own bolo and used
it in severing the head from the already lifeless body of Candido. The
pants which Candido wore were taken away, his corpse and his head then
abandoned, the Huks went down to the place of their companions, who
were left at the foot of the mountain, and thereafter proceeded on
their way to a <em>caingin</em>. (gasak), where they passed the
evening. They brought Paulo along with them. There they stayed for two
days and two nights, but early at dawn on the second night, Paulo was
able to escape.</p>
<p align="justify">When Candido and Paulo failed to return to their
barrio, a party headed by his son Teodoro began looking for them in the
mountains where they thought they had gone looking for their lost
carabao. This was on September 29. The first day yielded no result, but
on the second, that is on September 30, in the afternoon, they found
the dead body of Candido Disengaño on top of the mountain, with his
severed head a few feet away. The corpse and the head were brought down
to the barrio and there interred.</p>
<p align="justify">It further appears that defendant-appellant Silvino
Guerrero surrendered to the Philippine .army in Porac, Botolan,
Zambales on December 2, 1952. The Constabulary report regarding him was
that he had escaped from the provincial jail where he was detained for
robbery and was suspected for the killing of Candido Disengaño. Soon
after the surrender of Guerrero, many of the surrenderees were gathered
at the Philippine Army headquarters at Botolan, Zambales, and there
Paulo Disengano was able to identify Silvino Guerrero, Justo Ebid and
Felipe Eclarino, as among those who formed the band of Huks who had
taken him and his father and who had caused the disappearance of the
latter on September 26, 1951.</p>
<p align="justify">The criminal complaint against the
defendants-appellants and others was filed on February 5, 1953, and it
charged Silvino Guerrero, Jus to Ebid and Felipe Eclarino, etc. with
kidnapping and murder of Candido Disengaño and the kidnapping of his
son Paulo Disengaño. Upon petition of the prosecution, because of the
absence of any direct evidence against the accused, the accused Felipe
Eclarino was discharged and made a Government witness.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants-appellants do not dispute the fact
that they were members of the band of nine Huks headed by Commander
Murphy, and that they took along with them Candido Disengaño and Paulo
Disengaño and caused the death of the former. Defendant-appellant Justo
Ebid corroborated the testimony of Felipe Eclarino that upon orders of
Commander Murphy defendant-appellant Guerrero beat Candido Disengaño to
death with a piece of wood at the back of the head and at the nape, but
he claims that he could not be made responsible for the killing of
Candido Disengaño because he did not take part therein. For his part
Silvino Guerrero denied having informed Commander I'iurphy that Candido
Disengaño was a spy and that two of his sons were serving in the navy
and in the array. He asserted that he told Murphy that Candido was a
good man and that first he refused to comply with the order of
Commander Murphy to beat Candido; that upon his refusal to do:, so
Commander Murphy struck him (Guerrero) on the head with a revolver and
he lost his senses; that thereupon for fear of his own life he beat
Candido, but that he did not beat him to death as testified to by
Eclarino and Ebid.</p>
<p align="justify">The claim of innocence by the defendant-appellant
Silvino Guerrero is not corroborated by any witness or by any other
circumstance. Had it been true that Guerrero had assured Commander
Murphy that Candido Disengaño was a good man and was not a spy,
Commander Murphy would not have ordered that Candido be killed. We take
judicial notice of the fact that Huks had always tried to be on good
terms with people provided they would not spy on them or would not
cause them trouble, and that on the other hand, they ordered the
killing of those who would spy on them or who would report them to the
authorities. The testimony of Eclarino that Guerrero informed Murphy
that Candido Disengaño was a spy is corroborated by a statement of
Paulo Disengaño and that of Justo Ebid. And the order of Murphy to
liquidate Candido would not have been given had not someone told him
that Candido was an enemy or a spy.</p>
<p align="justify">The claim of Guerrero that he was forced to beat
Candido because of fear of Murphy and because Murphy had assaulted him
with a revolver, finds no corroboration either in the testimony of any
of the witnesses or in the facts and circumstances of the case. When
the dead body of Candido Disengaño was examined, after it was taken
down from the mountains, it was disclosed that the skull at the nape
was broker; and so were the bones at the back which show that defendant
Silvino Guerrero must have beaten Candido to death and not merely hit
him as he claims. The above findings also refute the claim of Guerrero
that when Violeta cut the head of the victim, the latter was not yet
dead. We. have read the transcript of the record and we are fully
satisfied that the crime was committed by the defendant-appellants as
members of the Huk band in the manner indicated by the witnesses for
the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify">On this appeal, counsel for Justo Ebid argues that
the trial judge erred in not dismissing the case against his client,
upon the presentation by him of a motion for dismissal after the
evidence for the prosecution had been submitted. We find no merit in
this argument. Eclarino and Paulo Disengaño testified that Justo Ebid
was a member of the band that caused the detention of Paulo Disengaño
and the death of Candido Disengaño. As before the motion for dismissal
was filed no evidence had been submitted that Justo Ebid was not a
member of the Huk band, or did actually refuse to take part or objected
to the detention of the two, or resisted the killing of Candido
Disengaño and the detention of Paulo Disengaño, his motion for
dismissal could not have been granted.</p>
<p align="justify">On this appeal, it is again urged on his behalf that
as he took no part in the killing of Candido Disengaño, or in the
detention of Paulo Disengaño, he should not be held responsible
therefor. We also find no merit in this contention. We may take
judicial notice of the well-known practice of Huks to kill people
spying on them, as a necessary means to protect their organization. We
can, therefore, presume that Ebid, as a member, was agreeable to such
practice and adhered thereto. As a member of the Huk band, it was his
duty to eliminate spies and to destroy all those who hamper their
activities. As he showed no signs that he did actually object to the
detention and the killing or refused to take part therein he is
presumed to have agreed or conformed to the killing of the deceased and
the kidnapping of his son and be jointly responsible therefor with the
other members of the band (U.S. <em>vs.</em> Bundal, et al., 3 Phil. 89; U.S. <em>vs.</em> Diris, 26 Phil. 133; People <em>vs.</em> Timbol, et al., G.R. Hos. 47471-73, Aug. 4, 1944; People <em>vs.</em> Villamora, et al. L-2054, prora. Aug. 29, 1950.)</p>
<p align="justify">The court <em>a quo</em> found the
defendants-appellants guilty of the murder only of Candido Disengaño
and of the illegal detention of Paulo Disengaño. As the court <em>a quo</em>
has correctly held, appellants cannot be convicted of the complex crime
of kidnapping with murder under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code,
for the reason that kidnapping was not a necessary means to commit the
murder. Candido was detained and brought to a mountain to be killed
this we have held may not be considered as kidnapping with murder but
mere murder (People <em>vs.</em> Camo, G.R. No. L-4741, prom. Hay 7, 1952; People <em>vs.</em> Remalante, G.R.No. L-3512, 4o O.G. pp. 3331-3833; People <em>vs.</em>
Villapa et al., G.E. No. L-4259, prom. April 30, 1952.) The conclusion
of the trial court that defendants-appellants are also guilty of
serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code
is also correct, in view of the fact that the person detained, Paulo
Disengaño, was a minor, about fourteen years old at the time of the
detention.</p>
<p align="justify">The crime of murder was committed with the qualifying circumstance of <em>alevosia</em>,
as the victim was hog-tied at the time he was beaten to death, with no
aggravating circumstance, as it is not disclosed in the record how many
in the band were armed. The penalties imposed by the trial court in the
murder case and in the case of kidnapping are in the medium period and
we find them to be correct. The sentences appealed from are therefore
affirmed, with costs.</p>
