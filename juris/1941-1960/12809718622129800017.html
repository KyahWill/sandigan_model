				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This appeal is before us on a motion for reconsideration of this 
Court's decision.  Whereas formerly six Justices voted for reversal and 
five for affirmance of the probate court's order admitting the will to 
probate, the vote upon reconsideration was six for affirmance and five 
for reversal, thereby making the dissenting opinion, which had been 
filed, the prevailing rule of the case.  Under the circumstances, this 
resolution will largely be confined to a restatement of that dissenting 
opinion.
  <p>    The will in question was presented for probate in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila in 1943 with Roberto Toledo y Gil, decedent's 
sister, opposing the application.  Toledo's legal right to intervene was
 questioned by the proponent of the will, and the objection was 
sustained in an order which was affirmed by this Court in G.R. No. 
L-254.  As a result of the latter decision, Toledo was eliminated from 
the case and did not appear when the trial was resumed.</p>
  <p>    The proceeding seems to have been held in abeyance pending 
final disposition of Toledo's appeal, and early in 1945, before the 
application was heard on the merit, the record, along with the will, was
 destroyed, necessitating its reconstitution after liberation.  In the 
reconstitution, a stipulation of facts was submitted in which, according
 to the appealed order, "both parties x x x agreed that the will as 
transcribed in the record on appeal in Case G. R. No. L-254 is true and 
correct copy."</p>
  <p>    The will consisted of only two pages, and the attestation 
clause as thus copied reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"NOSOTROS los que suscribimos, todos mayores de edad, 
certificamos: que el testamento que procede escrito en la lengua 
castellana que conoce la testator, compuesto de dos paginas utiles con 
la clausula de atestiguameineto paginadas correlativamente en letras y 
numeros en la parte superior de la casilla, asi como todos las hojas del
 mismo, en nuestra presencia y que cada uno de nosotros hemos 
atestiguado y firmado dicho documento y todas las hojas del mismo en 
presencia del testador y en la de cada uno de nosotros.</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td width="33%">"(Fdo.) ALFREDO T. RIVERA </td>
        <td width="26%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="41%">(Fdo.) RAMON MENDIOLA</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"(Fdo.) MARIANO OMANA"</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It will be noted from the above copy that the last of the compound 
sentenced is truncated and meaningless.  This defect is the main basis 
of the appellant's sole assignment of error.</p>
  <p>    Counsel for appellee contend that the phrase "han sido firmadas
 por el testador" or equivalent expression between the words "del mismo"
 and the words "en nuestra presencia" should be inserted if the 
attestation clause is to be complete and have sense.  With this 
insertion the attestation clause would read "x x x, asi como todas las 
hojas del mismo <i>han sido firmadas por el testador</i> en nuestra 
presencia x x x." The point is well taken.</p>
  <p>    It seems obvious that the missing phrase was left out from the 
copy.  The probabilities of error in the copy are enhanced by the fact 
that the form of the will was not in controversy in Toledo's appeal.  
The form of the will being immaterial, it is easily conceivable that 
little or no care was employed in transcribing the document in the 
agreement or record on appeal.  The absence of the signature of the 
testator on the first page of the copy is an additional proof that 
little or no pain was taken to insure accuracy in the transcription.  
The appearance of "la testadora" in the copy instead of "el testador" is
 another indication of haste and carelessness in the transcription.</p>
  <p>    Quite aside from all this, the testator was presumed to know 
the law, as the trial court says.  Certainly, Attorney Mariano Oma√±a, 
who drew the instrument and signed it as an attesting witness, knew the 
law and, by the context thereof, has shown familiarity with the rules of
 grammar and ability to express his idea properly.  In the light of 
these circumstances and of the further fact that the clause was brief 
and, by its importance, must have been written with utmost concern, so 
important an omission as to make the clause or sentence senseless could 
not have been made, intentionally or otherwise, in the original.</p>
  <p>    There is insinuation that the appellee in agreeing that the 
will read as it was "reproduced in the Record on Appeal" is bound by the
 agreement.  This is not an absolute rule.  The binding effect of a 
stipulation on the parties does not go to the extent of barring either 
of them from impeaching it on the score of clerical error or clear 
mistake.  The mistake just pointed out clearly brings the case within 
the exceptions to the rule.  The able counsel for the proponent of the 
will could not possibly have subscribed to the agreement if they had 
noticed the incomplete sentence in the copy without making an objection 
or reservation.</p>
  <p>    The problem posed by the omission in question is governed, not 
by the law of wills which requires certain formalities to be fulfilled 
in the execution, but by the rules of construction applicable to 
statutes and documents in general.  And this rule would obtain whether 
the omission occurred in the original document or in the copy alone.  In
 either case, the court may and should correct the error by supplying 
the omitted word or words.</p>
  <p>    In Testamentaria del Finado Emiliano Alcala, a similar 
situation arose and the Court said: </p>
  <blockquote>"Es evidente que leyendo la clausula de atestiguacion se 
note a simple vista que en su redaccion se ha incurriae en omisiones que
 la razon y el sentido comun pueden suplirlas sin alterer ni tergiversar
 la intencion tanto del testador como la de los tres testigos que 
intervinieron en el otorgamiento de la misma.  Teniendo en cuenta la 
fraseologia de la segunda parte de la clausula se observara que las 
omisiones, aunque son substanciales, consisten en meros errores 
gramaticales que los tribunales, en el ejercicio de su discrecion y en 
la aplicacion de las reglas de interpretacion de documentos, pueden 
subsanarlos para dar efectividad a la intencion y hacer que el conjunto 
de los terminos de la clausula de atestacion surtan sus efectos." </blockquote>
  <blockquote>"La interpretacion que se acaba de dar a la clausula de 
atestacion y la correccion de los errores gramaticales de que la misma 
adolece, incluyendo la insercion del verbo "firmamos" que se omition 
involuntariament, esta de acuerdo con las reglas fundamentales de 
interpretacion de documentos segun las cuales se debe hacer prevalecer 
siempre la intencion del que haya redactado el instrumento (art. 286, 
Cod. de Proc. Civil; Pecson <i>contra</i> Coronel, 45 Jur. Fil., 224; 28
 R.C.L., Sec. 187, pags. 225, 226.)" 
    <p>"La solucion que se acaba de dar al asunto es la que se halla mas
 conforme con la justificia en vista de que no se ha presentado prueba 
alguna que insinue siquiera que en el otorgamiento del testamento se ha 
cometido dolo o fraude con el animo de perjudicar a cualquiera.  
(Testamentaria de Emiliano Alcala, 40 G.O., 14.o Suplemento, No. 23, 
pags. 131, 132.)"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> From 69 C. J. 82, 83, we quote: "Words omitted from a will may be 
supplied by the court whenever necessary to effectuate the testator's 
intention as expressed in the will; but not where the effect of 
inserting the words in the will would alter or defeat such intention, or
 change the meaning of words that are clear and unequivocal."  On pages 
50 and 51, the same work says:  "To aid the court in ascertaining and 
giving effect to the testator's intention in the case of an ambiguous 
will, certain rules have been established for guidance in the 
construction or interpretation to be placed upon such a will, and in 
general a will should be construed according to these established rules 
of construction."  And referring to construction of statutes which, as 
has been said, is applicable to construction of documents, C. J. S. in 
Vol. 59, p. 992, tells us that "Where it appears from the context that 
certain words have been inadvertently omitted from a statute, the court 
may supply such words as are necessary to complete the sense, and to 
express the legislative intent."</p>
  <p>  Adding force to the above principle is the legal presumption that
 the will is in accordance with law.  (2 Page on Wills 840, 841, Am. 
Jur. 720.)</p>
  <p>  But let it be assumed, for the sake of this decision only, that 
the attestation clause was drawn exactly as it was copied in Toledo's 
record on appeal, was the mistake fatal?  Was it, or was it not, cured 
by the testator's own declaration?  to wit: "En testimonic de lo cual, 
firmo este mi testamento y en el margen izquierdo de cada una de sus dos
 paginas utiles con la clausula de atestiguamiento en presencia de los 
testigos, quienes a su vez firmaron cada una de dicha paginas y la 
clausula de atestiguamiento en mi presencia cada una de ellos con la de 
los demas, hoy en Porac, Pampanga, I. F., el dia 27 de marzo de mil 
novecientos treinta y nueve." The answer is in the negative.</p>
  <p>  As early as 1922 a similar case, in which the validity of the 
will was sustained, found its way into this Court.  See Aldaba <i>vs.</i>
 Roque, 43 Phil. 378.  That case was more than foursquare behind the 
case at bar.  There the departure from the statutory formality was more 
radical, in that the testator took charge of writing the entire 
attestation clause in the body of the will, the witnesses limiting their
 role to signing the document below the testator's signature.  Here, at 
the most, the testator took away from the witnesses only a small part of
 their assigned task, leaving to them the rest.</p>
  <p>  Referring to "the lack of attestation clause required by law," 
this Court, in a unanimous decision <i>en banc,</i> through Mr. Justice 
Villamor said in the Aldaba-Roque case (Syllabus):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"When the attestation clause is signed by the witnesses to the 
instruments, besides the testator, such attestation clause is valid and 
constitute a substantial compliance with the provisions of section 1 of 
Act No. 2645, even though the facts recited in said attestation clause 
appear to have been made by the testator himself."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  That ruling should set the present case at rest unless we want to
 revert to the old, expressly abandoned doctrine in a long line of what 
we believe better-considered decisions.</p>
  <p>  This Court noted in Dichoso de Ticson vs. De Gorostiza (1922), 57
 Phil. 437, "that there have been noticeable in the Philippines two 
divergent tendencies in the law of wills - the one being planted on 
strict construction and the other on liberal construction.  A late 
example of the former views may be found in the decision in Rodriguez 
vs. Alcala (1930), 55 Phil. 150, sanctioning a literal enforcement of 
the law.  The basic case in the other direction, <i>predicated on 
reason,</i> is Abangan <i>vs.</i> Abangan (1919), 40 Phil. 476, 
oft-cited approvingly in later decisions."</p>
  <p>  In the Abangan case, a unanimous court, speaking through Mr. 
Justice Avance√±a, later Chief Justice, observed:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The object of the solemnities surrounding the execution of wills
 is to close the door against bad faith and fraud, to avoid substitution
 of wills and testaments and to guaranty their truth and authenticity.  
Therefore the laws on this subject should be interpreted in such a way 
as to attain these primordial ends.  But, on the other hand, also one 
must not lose sight of the fact that it is not the object of the law to 
restrain and curtail the exercise of the right to make a will.  So when 
an interpretation already given assures such ends, any other 
interpretation whatsoever, that adds nothing but demands more requisites
 entirely unnecessary, useless and frustrative of the testator's last 
will, must be disregarded."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Subsequent decisions which followed and adopted the Abangan 
principle were: Avera <i>vs.</i> Garcia (1921), 42 Phil. 145; Aldaba <i>vs.</i>
 Roque (1922), 43 Phil. 378; Unson <i>vs.</i> Abella (1922), 43 Phil. 
494; Pecson <i>vs.</i> Coronel (1923), 45 Phil. 216; Fernandez <i>vs.</i>
 Vergel de Dios (1924), 46 Phil. 922; Nayve <i>vs.</i> Mojal (1924), 47 
Phil. 152; De Gala <i>vs.</i> Gonzales (1929), 53 Phil. 104; Rey <i>vs.</i>
 Cartagena (1931), 56 Phil. 282; Ticzon <i>vs.</i> Gorostiza (1932), 57 
Phil. 437; Testamentaria de N. Ozoa (1933), 57 J. F., 1007; Sebastian <i>vs.</i>
 Pa√±ganiban (1934), 59 Phil. 653; Rodriguez <i>vs.</i> Yap (1939), 40 
Off. Gaz. 1st Suppl., No. 3, p. 194; Grey <i>vs.</i> Fabia (1939), 40 
Off. Gaz. 1st Suppl., No. 3, p. 196, Leynes <i>vs.</i> Leynes (1939), 40
 Off. Gaz. 35d Suppl. No. 7, p. 51; Martir <i>vs.</i> Martir (1940), 40 
Off. Gaz., 7th Suppl. No. 11, p. 215; Sabado <i>vs.</i> Fernandez 
(1941), 40 Off. Gaz., 1844; Mendoza <i>vs.</i> Pilapil (1941), 40 Off. 
Gaz. 14th Suppl. No. 23, p. 131; and Lopez <i>vs.</i> Liboro (1948), 46 
Off. Gaz., Suppl., No. 1, p. 211.</p>
  <p>    It is objected that "If we cure a deficiency by means of 
inferences, when are we going to stop making inferences to supply fatal 
deficiencies in wills?  Where we are we to draw the line?" These same 
questions might well have been asked by the opponents of the new trends 
in the cases above cited.  But the so-called liberal rule does not offer
 any puzzle or difficulty, nor does it open the door to serious 
consequences.  The later decisions do tell us when and where to stop; 
they draw the dividing line with precision.  They do not allow evidence <i>aliunde</i>
 to fill a void in any part of the document or supply missing details 
that should appear in the will itself.  They only permit a probe into 
the will, an exploration within its confines, to ascertain its meaning 
or to determine the existence or absence of the requisite formalities of
 law.  This clear, sharp limitation eliminates uncertainty and ought to 
banish any fear of dire results.</p>
  <p>    The case at hand comes within the bounds thus defined.  If the 
witnesses here purposely omitted or forgot to say that the testator 
signed the will in their presence, the testator said that he did and the
 witnesses by their signatures in the will itself said it was so.  No 
extraneous proof was necessary and none was introduced or taken into 
consideration.</p>
  <p>    To regard the letter rather than the spirit of the will and of 
the law behind it was the thing that led to unfortunate consequences.  
It was the realization of the injustice of the old way that impelled 
this Court, so we believe, to forsake the antiquated, outworn worship of
 form in preference to substance.  It has been said, and experience has 
shown, that the mechanical systems of construction has operated more to 
defeat honest wills that prevent fraudulent ones.  That, it must be 
conceded, would be the effect in this case if the will under 
consideration were rejected.  For the adverse party now concedes the 
genuineness of the document.  At any rate, the genuineness in 
superobvious, and there is not the slightest insinuation of undue 
pressure, mental incapacity of the testator, or fraud.</p>
  <p>    It is said that for the testator to certify that he signed the 
will in the witnesses' presence "would be like lifting one's self by his
 own bootstraps." The simile does not look to us quite well placed.  
There is no impossibility or impropriety in one attesting to his own act
 unless forbidden by rules of positive law.  The rationale of this 
decision is that he is not.  If we were to make a metaphorical 
comparison, it would be more correct to say that a man can and generally
 does himself pull the bootstraps when he puts his boots on.</p>
  <p>    Coming to execution of wills, we see no legitimate, practical 
reason for objecting to the testator instead of the witnesses certifying
 that he signed the will in the presence of the latter.  The will is of 
the testator's own making, the intervention of attesting witnesses being
 designed merely to protect his interest.  If the sole purpose of the 
statute in requiring the intervention of witnesses is to make it certain
 that the testator has definite and complete intention to pass his 
property, and to prevent, as far as possible, any chance of substituting
 one instrument for another (1 Page on Wills, 481), what better guaranty
 of the genuineness of the will can there be than a certification by the
 testator himself in the body of the will so long as the testator's 
signature is duly authenticated?  Witnesses may sabotage the will by 
muddling and bungling it or the attestation clause.  For the testator, 
who is desirous of making a valid will, to do so would be a 
contradiction.  If the formalities are only a means to and end and not 
the end themselves, and that end is achieved by another method slightly 
different from the prescribed manner, what has been done by the testator
 and the witnesses in the execution of the instant will would satisfy 
both law and conscience.</p>
  <p>    A second ground of attack on the questioned will is that the 
first page or sheet thereof does not bear the testator's signature.  The
 discussion on the correctness of the copy of the attestation clause 
amply answers this objection.  In fact, the appellee's case is much 
stronger on this point for the reason that there is not only speculative
 but also positive basis for the conclusion that the testator's 
signature was affixed to the first page of the original.  Both the 
testator and the attesting witnesses stated in the will and in the 
attestation clause, respectively, that the former signed both pages or 
sheets of the testament.</p>
  <p>    Upon the foregoing consideration, the order of the probate 
court is affirmed with costs.</p>
  <p>    A motion dated February 17, 1953 was filed after the motion for
 reconsideration was deliberated and voted upon, in behalf of the minor 
children of Carlos Worrel, who was a residuary legatee under the will 
and who is alleged to have died on February 6, 1949.  The motion prays 
that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> be appointed for the said children, and 
allowed to intervene and file "A Supplementary Memorandum in Support of 
Appellant's (Appellee's?) Motion for reconsideration." Counsel for the 
appellant objects to the motion on the ground that the movants having 
only a contingent interest under the will are not of right entitled to 
intervene.</p>
  <p>    As this case has already been considerably delayed and 
thoroughly considered and discussed from all angles, it is the sense of 
the Court that the children's intervention with the consequent further 
delay of the decision would not serve the best interest of the parties. 
 For this reason, the motion is denied.</p>
