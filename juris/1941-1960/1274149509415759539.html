				G.R. No. L-10290, May 28, 1958</h4>
				<H3>COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. TOTOY OTEYZA, ET. AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for the review of the decision of the 
Court of Tax Appeals exempting the respondent, Totoy Oteyza, from the payment of 
amusement taxes including surcharge and penalties prescribed in Section 260, in 
connection with Section 558, of the National Internal Revenue Code. Said court 
held that the ballet performances sponsored by respondent Oteyza came within the 
following provisions of Republic Act No. 728:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. The holding of operas, concerts, recitals, dramas, painting and 
art exhibition, and literary, oratorical or musical programs, except film 
exhibitions and radio or phonographic records thereof, shall be exempt from the 
payment of any national or municipal amusement tax on the receipts 
therefrom."</p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioner maintains that ballet performance is not expressly exempted 
from the payment of the amusement tax and, under the principle of "<u>expresio 
unius est exclusio alterius</u>", the enumeration in Republic Act No. 732 should be 
considered exclusive.</p>
<p>Ballet means a theatrical dance; specially a pantominic dance executed ay a 
group, especially women; a kind of artistic dancing, marked by a great variety, 
intricacy, and expressiveness in its movements. (Webster's International 
Dictionary.) When used without any qualifying adjective or phrase, the term is 
frequently used to signify art in its higher manifestations, or art <u>par</u> <u>
excellence</u>, as it is represented in works of art by those who are distinctively 
denominated artists. (5 Corpus Juris, p. 568.)</p>
<p>It is conceded that ballet is an art; that under our Constitution (Art. XIV, 
Sec. 4) arts are under the patronage of the State; that Republic Act No. 722 
seeks te implement the constitutional provision. Miss Jovita Fuentes, whose 
qualification as an expert witness was admitted by counsel for the petitioner, 
testified that "recital"includes violin, piano, songs and ballet, and that 
"concert" includes symphony ana ballet. Mrs. Trinidad Fernandez-Legarda, another 
expert witness, in effect testified that an opera, concert or recital refers to 
a group of people interpreting a story and employing, for instance, a ballet 
presentation with orchestral accompaniment as the medium of expression or 
interpretation.</p>
<p>The conclusion is thus inevitable that ballet performance, besides being 
truly an art, an art <u>par</u> <u>excellence</u> is in fact included in the terms "concert", 
"opera" or "recital" and therefore exempted from the payment of the amusement 
tax.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed without costs. 
So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia, </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
