				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs  brought this  action in the  proper court  of first instance seeking to nullify Ordinance No. 92, series of  1950,  and  Ordinance No. 116,  series of 1951, of  the Municipal Board  of the  City of  Cebu, and to  recover the  taxes paid by them under said  ordinances.   Plaintiffs claim that these ordinances are <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires </span>and, therefore invalid.  Defendants answered the complaint alleging that said ordinances  are valid  having  been enacted pursuant  to  the power  conferred upon the  City of Cebu by its charter,  Commonwealth Act No. 58. <br><br>Deciding the case  on the  basis of facts agreed  upon by the parties,  the  lower court  upheld the  validity of the  ordinances  and  dismissed  the case without costs. Plaintiffs appealed from the decision  but took the case directly to us on  the  ground that only questions  of law are involved in the appeal. <br><br>Ordinance  No.   92, as subsequently modified by Ordinance  No.  116,  imposes upon every  person,  individual, company or  corporation engaged in the  sale of lumber a tax of  P2  "for every  first  local sale of  one thousand board feet of lumber sold during  the month", which shall be paid not  later than the  first twenty  (20)  days of the succeeding  month.   Failure to pay  the tax  within said period subjects the taxpayer to  a  surcharge  of 20 per cent which shall be  added to the tax.  Plaintiffs claim that the Charter of the  City  of Cebu   (Commonwealth Act No. 58)  does not confer upon it the power to impose the tax provided for in said  ordinances. <br><br>The pertinent portion on which the power of the City of  Cebu is  predicated is  section  17 (<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>) of Commonwealth Act No. 58, which provides: <br><blockquote>"Sec.  17. General powers and duties of the Board.—Except as otherwise provided by law, and subject to the conditions and  limitations thereof, the Municipal Board shall have the following powers:         <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * * <br><br></div>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>) To tax, fix the license fee for, regulate the business, and fix  the location of match factories, blacksmith shops, foundries, steam boilers,  lumber yards,  shipyards, the storage and sale of gunpowder, tar, pitch, resin, coal, oil, gasoline, benzine, turpentine, hemp, cotton, nitroglycerin, petroleum, or any of the products thereof,  and  of all other establishments  likely to endanger the  public safety or give rise  to conflagration or  explosions, and, subject to the  provisions of ordinances issued by  the  Philippine Health Service in accordance with law,  tanneries, renderies, tallow  chandleries, bone  factories,  and  soap  factories." </blockquote>Under the  provision above-quoted, it would appear that the City of Cebu is given the  power (1)  to tax the business of,  among other things, lumber yards, and  (2) to tax the sale of  gunpowder, tar, pitch, resin, coal, oil, gasoline, benzine, turpentine,  hemp,  cotton,  nitroglycerin,  petroleum, or any other products thereof.   Note that  lumber is not therein  enumerated.   Considering the  well-known principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">inclusio unius  est exclusio</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">alterius</span>, the conclusion  is  inevitable that  the power  to  tax the  sale  of lumber  has been  withdrawn. <br><br>But it is contended that the power to tax the business of lumber  yards  necessarily includes that  of taxing  the sale of  lumber stocked  therein,  for,  as the  lower  court said, "it is evident * * *  that the intention was to include the sale of lumber, inasmuch as  it cannot be  denied that the ultimate  business of  maintaining a lumber yard is the accumulation of  lumber  and  building materials and their subsequent sale for profit."   But this reasoning is  untenable  considering  that the  Charter  of  the City  of Cebu has  expressly  withheld,  as we have already  pointed out, the power to tax  the sale of  lumber.  Moreover, a municipal corporation,  unlike a sovereign state,  is  clothed with no inherent  power of  taxation.   Its  charter must plainly show an intent to confer that power  or the  corporation cannot assume it.  And  the power when granted is to be construed  <span style="font-style: italic;">strictissimi juris</span>.  Any  doubt  or  ambiguity arising  out  of the term used  must be resolved against the corporation.<br><blockquote>"It  is  settled that a municipal corporation, unlike a sovereign state, is clothed with no inherent power of taxation.

As such, said corporations  have only such powers as  the  legislative department  may have  deemed fit to grant  them. By reason of the limited powers of local governments and  the nature  thereof, said  powers  are  to  be construed strictly and 'any doubt  or  ambiguity arising out  of the  terms used in granting' said powers 'must be resolved against the municipality.'"  (Syllabus, Fulgencio Vega, et al., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. The Municipal Board of the City of Iloilo, et al., 50 O.  G., No. 6, p. 2456) </blockquote>A case squarely in  point is Jos S. Johnston &amp; Sons, Inc. vs. Ramon Regondola,  G. R. No. L-9355  (November 26, 1957).  In  that case  plaintiff,  a corporation engaged in lumber business in  the City of  Zamboanga, was made to pay a tax on its sales  of lumber by virtue  of an ordinance approved by the Municipal board and the question that arose was whether the  city had the power  to impose a tax on the sale of lumber under its charter, Commonwealth Act No. 39.   This  Court held  that  the  ordinance was <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires</span>  because  its enactment was beyond the power of the city,  making on  this point the following comment:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>"This provision of the city charter, it  should be noted, authorizes the city to tax certain establishments—among  them,  lumber yards. It also  authorizes the city to impose  a tax  upon   'the storage and sale' of certain  materials therein expressly named or described, to wit: gunpowder,  tar, pitch, resin, coal, oil,  gasoline,  benzine, turpentine, hemp, cotton,  nitroglycerine,  petroleum, 'or any of  the products thereof,  and of  all other highly combustible or explosive materials.'  It is  appellant's contention that the phrase 'or any of the products  thereof refers to products  of the establishments mentioned, so that lumber, as  a lumber yard product, is, in his opinion, among the articles  whose storage and  sale the  charter means to subject to a municipal  tax.  To this we  cannot agree.  Appellant's interpretation of  the phrase would do violence to the language of the statute,  for  it  is  obvious  from the context that the phrase has reference to products made  from  the materials enumerated. This is made more  patent by  the  succeeding phrase  'and of all other highly  combustible  or explosive  materials', which necessarily implies  that  the materials  already mentioned are  of that same character, that is to say, highly combustible or explosive.  In other words, the materials whose storage and sale  are authorized  to be taxed by  this provision of the charter  are (1)  those specifically mentioned for that purpose, namely, gunpowder, tar, pitch, etc.,  (2) any product made from them, and (3) all other highly combustible or  explosive  materials.   Lumber  is  not  specifically  mentioned. Neither is it of the category described,  because,  though capable of undergoing combustion, it is not a highly combustible or explosive material.  We therefore think that  the  trial judge  was right  in holding that the  ordinance  in  question insofar  as  it  imposes a tax on the sale of lumber is not authorized by the city charter." </blockquote>Wherefore, the  decision appealed  from  is   reversed. The  Court declares  the  ordinances in  question illegal and orders appellees to return  to appellants  the sum  of P97,542.57  and  all  such  sums  as may  have been  paid by the later after February, 1953, by virtue of  said  ordinances.   No costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes,  J.  B.
