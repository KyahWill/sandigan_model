				<BR><STRONG>DE JOYA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On June 11, 1945,  the  respondents Pedro Mossesgeld Santiago and Mercedes Alonzo Mossesgeld filed, in  the Municipal  Court of the City of Manila, a complaint against herein petitioner, for forcible entry and detainer,  alleging that they were  illegally deprived of the possession of the lot  and house in question, by herein  petitioner,  by means of  force  and intimidation, since May 7, 1945.</p>
<p>Petitioner, as defendant therein, moved for the dismissal of the  case, stating that the alleged  sale of the  lot and house in question, now  claimed by respondents, is null and void, as it was  executed under a power of attorney, which had been  forged,  allegedly under  duress.</p>
<p>After hearing said petition for  dismissal, the respondent municipal judge dismissed the case, for lack of jurisdiction, on the  ground  that  the question involved is  not one of  possession but of  ownership.</p>
<p>Respondents  appealed  to the  Court of First  Instance of the  City  of  Manila, which,  on motion  of respondents, claiming that the  question involved in the  ease is really one of possession and not of ownership, and that the respondent judge of the municipal court has jurisdiction to try the case, remanded it to the respondent municipal judge, for trial on the merits; and  the  trial has already been commenced.</p>
<p>Petitioner  tried to appeal from  said order, but the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, holding that said order was interlocutory and unappealable, disapproved petitioner's  record  on appeal.</p>
<p>At this stage of the proceedings, the defendant in said case for forcible  entry and detainer filed a petition  for certiorari and  prohibition in this Court, alleging the facts above stated, and asks for the annulment of the order of the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of  the City of Manila, declaring that the respondent judge of the municipal court has jurisdiction  to try the case on  the merits, at the same time remanding it to the latter for that purpose.   Petitioner likewise asks that the respondent municipal judge be prohibited from taking further cognizance of the case.</p>
<p>Respondents filed an answer, also alleging the facts above stated.</p>
<p>On the date  set for the hearing of the case before this Court, counsel for the parties appeared  and argued  the case.</p>
<p>It is a well-established doctrine in this jurisdiction that, in a forcible entry and detainer case,  in any municipal court or  justice of the peace court, when the case is dismissed, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and an  appeal is taken  to  the  Court of First  Instance, the only question  to be  determined is whether or not, the inferior court has jurisdiction to try the case on  the merits (Rule 40,  sec. 10, Rules of Court;  U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ang Suyco, 17 Phil., 92; Carroll <em>vs.</em> Paredes, 17 Phil., 94; Davis <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons,  17 Phil., 168; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Bernardo, 19 Phil., 265). If the Court  of First Instance should decide that the municipal court  or justice of the peace court has jurisdiction to try the case, as correctly held in this case, it must be remanded to said court, for trial on the merits (Lucido <em>vs.</em> Vita, 25 Phil., 414).   The order of the respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, the Hon. Pompeyo Diaz,  remanding the case to  the municipal court, for its trial on the merits, is strictly  in accordance with the law and authorities above cited.</p>
<p>In order that a petition  for certiorari may prosper, it is absolutely necessary to show that the respondent judge acted without  jurisdiction or in excess thereof (De la Cruz <em>vs.</em> Moir, 36 Phil., 213),   In the instant case, the respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance has acted strictly in accordance  with law.</p>
<p>The petition for certiorari and prohibition, being completely and absolutely devoid of merits,  it is hereby dismissed, with  costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J.,  Ozaeta, Paras,  Jaranilla,  Feria, Pablo, Bengzon</em>,  and  <em>Briones, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><strong>MORAN, C J.:</strong></p>
<p>I hereby certify that  Mr. Justice Hilado  voted for the dismissal  of the  petition.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.,  </strong></p>
<p>Respondent  Mossesgeld filed in the Municipal  Court of Manila  a complaint  for forcible entry against the petitioner.  The municipal court, after  hearing,  dismissed the case on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction in view of the allegation  of ownership  made by the petitioner.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs appealed the case  to the Court  of  First Instance of Manila, which, upon  motion of  plaintiffs, ordered, on July 31, 1945, the case remanded to the municipal court, directing it to hear  and make the  necessary adjudication after finding that the municipal court had jurisdiction  over the  case.</p>
<p>The defendant appealed from said order and filed a record on appeal, but the Court of First Instance disapproved the same for the reason that its order of July 31, 1945, was interlocutory in nature and no appeal would lie therefrom.</p>
<p>We do not agree with this opinion.  The order of July 31, 1945, is not interlocutory in- nature.  It  disposed  of finally the appeal interposed by plaintiffs  against the order of dismissal issued  by  the municipal court.  If, instead of appealing, plaintiffs had filed a petition for mandamus to compel the municipal court to proceed with and decide the forcible entry case, the decision of the Court of First Instance granting the petition would be  substantially the same as the order of July 31, 1945.  Undoubtedly, the decision granting the  petition for mandamus would  be appealable.  The allegation of respondents  to.the effect that the order of July 31,  1945, did not dispose of finally the case in  untenable.  The same thing would  have  happened if, instead of appealing,  plaintiffs resorted to a mandamus proceeding.   The question presented in the appeal, or which would have been presented in the mandamus  proceeding, would be exclusively whether or not the municipal court had jurisdiction to try the forcible entry case,  and that question was decided finally in the order of  July 31, 1945, as would be in a  decision granting mandamus for the same purpose.</p>
<p>If petitioner had filed before this  Court a  petition for mandamus to compel the Court of First Instance of Manila to approve his record on appeal and give  due course to his appeal,  his  action would, undoubtedly, have  prospered.</p>
<p>The petitioner decided to follow a different course by presenting squarely,  in  these certiorari  proceedings, the question whether or not the municipal  court has jurisdiction  to try and decide the  forcible entry case.  In this question, our conclusion  is not favorable  to the petitioner.</p>
<p>It appears that the plaintiffs filed  the  complaint, alleging that on May 7, 1945, they were  deprived  by force  of the possession of the property in question.   If this is the fact, the plaintiffs are entitled to respect in their possession.   The  possessors are entitled to be protected in their possession even  against the  real owner who  ousted them by force.  No one has a right to take justice in his own hands.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the summary proceedings in a forcible  entry case is to preserve  order and peace. In view of the foregoing, we concur in  the  denial of the petition.</p>
