				<H3>ILDEFONSA CORONADO, PETITIONER VS. HONORABLE BIENVENIDO A. TAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, CATALINA ESTEBAN AND PELAGIO VICTORINO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Statement.—Petition for certiorari to annul the two orders of the respondent 
judge of January 26 and 27, 1953 allowing the other respondent Catalina Esteban 
to operate the Makati-Jolo Ferry, and for mandamus to return to the petitioner 
the possession of the same ferry.
<p>Facts.—The pleadings and their annexes disclose the following material 
facts:</p>
<ol><li>Pursuant to a lease contract properly executed, Catalina Esteban was the 
lessee and operator of the Makati-Jolo Ferry in the municipality of Makati, 
Rizal during the fiscal year July 1, 1951 to June 30, 1952; 
</li><li>On September 15, 1952 the municipality advertized for bids for the operation 
of said ferry during the fiscal year October 1, 1952 to September 30, 1953; 
</li><li>At the public bidding Ildefonsa Coronado, the petitioner, offered the 
highest bid; 
</li><li>Consequently, by authority of the council, the mayor formalized the 
corresponding lease contract with petitioner (marked Annex 6) which was ratified 
and approved by the council on October 19, 1952; 
</li><li>Immediately thereafter and until January 26, 1953. the petitioner operated 
the aforesaid ferry in accordance with the terms of her lease contract; 
</li><li>On January 22, 1953, the respondent Catalina Esteban, assisted by her 
husband Pelagio Victorino filed, in the court of first instance of Rizal, 
against herein petitioner and the mayor and councilors of Makati, Rizal, a 
complaint alleging that the lease contract Annex B was illegal and void, and 
requesting that her previous contract be declared subsisting. Catalina also 
prayed for a preliminary writ enjoining the aforesaid defendants from making use 
or enforcing the contract with Ildefonsa Coronado; 
</li><li>By his order of January 26,1953 the respondent judge issued the writ as 
prayed for; and on the next day he amended such writ "to the effect that the 
plaintiff is allowed to operate the ferry service * * * during the pendency" of 
the case; 
</li><li>After failing in a move to reconsider, the petitioner came to this Court 
with a petition, which, rejected at first for lack of supporting papers, was 
subsequently amended to meet procedural requirements; 
</li><li>As requested in the amended petition, we issued a writ of preliminary 
injunction to prevent the execution of the complained of directives of the 
respondent judge. </li></ol>
<p><em>Discussion</em>.—It is not denied that the notice calling for bids on 
September 15, 1952 contained this essential condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the fares per crossing to be collected shall not exceed the 
following:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="65%">For adult 
.............................................................</td>
<td width="35%">P0.05</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>For children 
............................................................</td>
<td>.03</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>For every bicycle 
.......................................................</td>
<td>.08</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>For every head of pig, goat, 
etc.........................................</td>
<td>.10</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>For every sack of rice, corn, camote, darak, 
etc........................</td>
<td>.10,"</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>It is also admitted that the contract (Annex B) extended in favor of 
Ildefonza Coronado, after she had won the public bidding, contained in addition 
to the above quoted condition the special stipulation,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Provided however that from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the Second Party 
(Ildefonsa Coronado) may collect twice the amount of rates" (above 
itemized).</p></blockquote>
<p>When the municipal council ratified the contract, it passed a resolution (No. 
144) taking notice of the additional provision; but it explained it was 
prevailing custom since time immemorial of ferry concessionaries to charge such 
double rates for night work.</p>
<p>However, prosecuted later for falsification of public document—on account of 
such addition—the mayor of Makati and Ildefonsa Coronado were convicted after 
trial, by the Honorable Bienvenido Tan, who branded the resolution No. 144 as 
"of doubtful creation" and expressed the opinion that it could not legalize an 
act illegal <em>per se</em>. The conviction has been appealed to the Court of 
Appeals, where it is presently pending.</p>
<p>In issuing the preliminary mandatory injunction commanding petitioner to 
desist from operating the ferry and placing Catalina Esteban in possession 
thereof, the respondent judge obviously acted upon the strength of two legal 
propositions, to wit: (<em>a</em>) by reason of the falsification, the contract 
of lease in favor of petitioner became null and void and (<em>b</em>) Catalina 
Esteban has a valid contract of lease, which must be enforced.</p>
<p>As to the first, it appears that in the criminal cake for falsification the 
defense was that the insertion or addition merely expressed a well-known 
practice of concessionaries, and that the municipal council had approved it. The 
judge did not need such defense, being of the opinion that the council had no 
power to approve the "amendment". Without in any way reviewing the criminal 
case, we can appreciate the argument of defense that such circumstances belie 
any criminal intent of the accused. Perhaps it is also plausible to contend on 
behalf of Ildefonsa Coronado that even if <em>there was</em> falsification by 
the insertion of additional provisions, such insertion did not avoid the 
<em>whole</em> contract; <em>only the additional stipulation</em> may be 
disregarded. Wherefore, the least that may be said on the first legal 
proposition is that it is a fair subject of debate that should be decided after 
the hearing of the case on the merits.</p>
<p>The second proposition is still more debatable. Catalina's contract expressly 
referred to the year 1951-1952. It is true she alleged that the Mayor had agreed 
to renew it for another year. But the Mayor has no authority to grant such 
extension; and she knows it, because notwithstanding such alleged renewal, she 
participated in the bidding, in which Ildefonsa turned out to be the highest 
bidder.</p>
<p>It may therefore be concluded that the issuance of the preliminary writ by 
the respondent judge rested upon two debatable legal propositions. And 
considering your doctrines,</p>
<p>"The writ of injunction is not, as a general rule, proper where its purposes 
is to take property out of the possession or control of one person and place the 
same in the hands of another, whose title has not been <em>clearly</em> 
established." (Asombra <em>vs</em>. Dorado-36 Phil., 883; Wagan <em>vs</em>. 
Sideco 60 Phil., 685 and many cases. See Moran, Rules of Court 1952 ed. Vol. 2 
p. 70)</p>
<p>"Since an injunction mandatory in nature usually tends to do more than to 
maintain the <em>status quo</em>, it is generally improper to issue such an 
injunction prior to the final hearing except in cases of extreme urgency or 
where the right is very clear" (Manila Electric Co. <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario 22 
Phil., 433;.Eusebio <em>vs</em>. Aguas 47 Phil., 567.)</p>
<p><em>Judgment</em>. We must declare that the issuance in the lower court of 
the mandatory injunction herein discussed was improper and constituted an abuse 
of discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is granted,, with costs against respondents Catalina 
Esteban and Pelagio Victorino. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition granted.</em></p></div>
