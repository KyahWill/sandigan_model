				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1299, May 31, 1949</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JACOB J. LOEWINSOHN, ACCUSED; GIL FARGAS AND CRISPIN BAIZAS, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Finding them guilty of contempt under section 3 (<i>d</i>) of 
Rule 64, the People's Court sentenced Gil Fargas to pay a fine of P100 and 
Crispin Baizas P200.
<p align="justify">In September, 1946, while treason case No. 4218 against Jacob 
J. Loewinsohn was pending trial, appellants went to the house of Carlos Planes, 
Jr., neighbor of the accused, and one of the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify">According to Remedios Conde de Planes, about the end of 
September, 1946, between twelve and one in the afternoon, Fargas and Baizas went 
to talk with her husband. Fargas requested her husband to withdraw his 
declaration against Loewinsohn. Baizas supported Fargas's request. Her husband 
refused because he had already sworn to a statement. When they left and bade 
goodbye to the witness, they told her that no matter how good a man may be he 
may become a criminal. She was not in the sala where the conversation took 
place, but in the dining room, where she could hear the conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">Carlos Planes, Jr., testified that one noontime, while he was 
eating, appellants arrived. They said that they went there for Mr. Loewinsohn 
who "is already a good man and that there is a good opportunity for him to get a 
job but the only thing that is preventing him is this case. They told me taht a 
lot of cases of this kind in the People's Court die a natural death for lack of 
evidence, and they told me that this case against Mr. Loewinsohn is as good as 
aready dismissed because, they said, only one witness remained in the case and I 
was the only one witness remaining, and they said that if I do not appear in 
court the case may be quashed, adding, we are all Christians and good Catholics, 
we ought to love one another especially that we were saved from the war, we 
ought to forget everything. Mr. Loewinsohn is now a good man but even a good man 
if you continue poking him may turn a criminal." The witness told them that "I 
have a statement and that I have to go through with it. They wanted me to 
retract, that is, not to appear in court anymore."</p>
<p align="justify">Fargas denied that he ever asked Planes not to testify for the 
government. He only asked him to tell the truth as a good Christian, adding that 
he could not believe that Loewinsohn would display a swastika in his house. 
Baizas corrobrated him.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no showing in this case that appellants attempted by 
unlawful means to induce Planes to testify contrary to his previous testimony or 
to induce him to testify falsely. Upon the evidence, it appears that Fargas, 
upon the fact known to him, requested Planes to withdraw a statement running 
counter to said fact, with the further request that, at any rate, Planes should 
testify to nothing but the truth. There is no evidence on record as to what the 
truth is regarding the display of the swastika. It is not necessary to question 
the honesty both of Planes and Fargas. The individual version of each may be 
correct without concluding that the version of the other is necessarily 
incorrect. They are not absolutely incompatible. Honestly convinced that 
Loewinsohn did not display the flag, because he did not see it displayed, and 
carried by the natural impulse of helping a friend, Fargas probably did request 
Planes to testify in accordance with his version of the facts, thereby only 
failing to perceive what a more analytical mind would have perceived, that 
Planes may also be correct in his version.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellants are acquitted.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, 
Tuason,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
