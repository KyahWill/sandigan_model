				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Charged with murder,  and convicted by the Court  of First Instance of Rizal  of the crime  of homicide,  petitioner Khaw Dy was sentenced,  as principal,  td  an indeterminate penalty ranging from  8  years  and  1 day of <em>prision  mayor</em> to  14 years, 8  months  and  1 day  of <em>reclusion  temporal</em> to indemnify   the  heirs of  Ang Go Pia,  in the sum  of P4,000.00  and, subsidiarily in the sum of P2,000.00, in the event of  insolvency of  Co  Chian, alias  Sonia, whereas the latter  was  sentenced,  as  an accomplice,  to an indeterminate penalty ranging frpm 2 years, 4 months and  1 day  of <em>prision correccional</em> to 8 years  and  1  day  of <em>prision mayor,</em> to  indemnify  the heirs of Ang Go  Pia in the  sum of P2,000.00 and, subsidiarily, in case of insolvency of Khaw Dy,  in the sum of P4,000.00, in  addition to each paying the costs proportionally.  On appeal,  the Court of  Appeals found both guilty  of homicide as  principals and  sentenced each  to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 8 years and 1 day of <em>prision  mayor</em> to 14  years,  8  months and  1  day  of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> to  indemnify jointly  and severally the heirs of Ang Go Pia  in  the sum of P6,000.00, without subsidiary  imprisonment  in case of insolvency,  and  to pay the proportional part of the costs.   The case is  now before  us on  petition  for review by  certiorari filed  by Khaw  Dy  and Co Chian.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that Ang  Go  Pia died on  August 25, 1955,  in consequence of  the following  stab  wounds inflicted upon him by Khaw Dy, in the public  market of Malabon, province of Rizal,  two  (2) days  before,  to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) Incised  wound,  11.5  cm., sutured, back,  left,  just medial to  the  posterior axillary  fold,  running downwards;</p>
  <p>"(2) Stab  wounds: vl.3  cm., sutured,  lateral aspect,  chest, left, cut, extremities sharp,  running  downwards and medially, directed slightly   upwards  and anteriorly,  non-penetrating,  involving  only the underlying tissue with an approximate depth of 2.5 cm.;</p>
  <p>"(3) 2.7 cm.,  sutured,  antere-lateral aspect, lower  chest,  left level  of 8th rib, 12.0 cm. from the anterior median  line, edges clean cut, medial  extremity sharp,  lateral  extremity  contused, running  medially and  almost horizontally, directed medially  inwards, slightly upwards, penetrating the  left thoracic cavity  by cutting  completely  the  cartilagenous  portion of the 8th rib,  then thru  and thru the left diaphragm  in  the abdominal  cavity,  involving  the pancreas;</p>
  <p>"(4) 2.4 cm.,  sutured lateral aspect, buttocks,  left, along the mid-axillary  line 7.5 cm. below the pelvic  brim, edges clean cut, extremities  sharp,  running  upwards  and   anteriorly,  directed medially, slightly upwards and  medially, involving the underlying tissues,  with an approximate depth of 7.0 cm."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appeal hinges  on  the circumstances  surrounding the occurrence.   Two  (2)  witnesses,  namely,  Domingo Santos  and  Teodoro   Estrella,  whose   presence  in  the market  was not  denied  by  the prosecution,  testified substantially as  follows: After a brief conversation with Ang Go Pia, appellant Co Chian, <em>alias</em> Sonia, who operated a  stall in said market, struck him  with a  balance, which  Ang  parried  with his arms.  As  Sonia  and Ang grappled  with   each other,  Khaw  Dy,  a relative  and employee of Sonia, darted  from her aforementioned stall and boxed  Ang, who  exchanged fist blows with  him. Soon  thereafter, Khaw  Dy  ran to said stall and then returned with an open knife,  whereupon  Ang took to his heels, lpursued  by the petitioners.  Upon reaching the fish sectioji of the  market,  the floor of which wds muddy, Ang slipped to a kneeling1 position.  Thereupon Sonia lield him by the hair, as Khaw Dy stabbed him on the back.   This  notwithstanding, Ang managed  to  get  up and tried to run, but  he  tripped on the  elevated  floor of the  adjoining  section  of the  market.  Once again, Sonia held him  by the hair and  Khaw  Dy stabbed him several times. At this juncture, witness Estrella wrested the knife from  Khaw  Dy.  As Sonia  tried to  grab it, Estrella  pushed her and  brought  the  weapon  to  the police station.</p>
<p>The  theory of the defense is this: In  the morning of the occurrence, Ang demanded payment  of P40.00, alleging that it  was the balance of the price of some  merchandise purchased by her from his brother.  Sonia denied being indebted in  said amount and stated that  the same represented  a discount given to  her by Ang's  brother. Visibly, irked, Ang replied that if she went with him to a  hotel,  her account  could  be considered settled.   Enraged  by this  proposition Sonia  got  her balance  and struck  Ang  with  it.  However,  Ang took hold  of  the balance, pulled it, thereby dragging  Sonia across a low table,  and then hit her hands,  thus compelling her to release  the  balance.  Then  Khaw Dy  approached  Ang and tried to pacify  him, but Ang struck him  with the balance  on the  forehead.  Immediately  thereafter, Ang attacked  Sonia with a knife, but  she parried the  thrust with  her right hand,  and  was  wounded) thereon.   As she stepped aside and  began to weep, Ang tried to stab Khaw Dy,  who seized  Ang's left hand which  held the weapon, and  in the struggle for its  possession,, Ang was wounded.  After  gaining possession  of the knife,  Khaw Dy stepped back, and,  noticing that Ang was  bleeding, he  (Khaw  Dy) laid  the instrument  upon a  table  and surrendered to the  police.</p>
<p>In  support of this  pretense, the defense introduced the testimony of Marcial Borja and Quintin Santos, in addition to that of petitioners herein, but the  Court of Appeals found said  testimony unworthy of credence,  and accepted  the  version  of the  prosecution, as the  Court of First Instance did.  Dealing  as it does with  the facts of the case,  particularly the veracity and weight of the testimonial  evidence  therein  introduced,  said finding made  by the  Court of Appeals is beyond our power to review.</p>
<p>Under  the   facts  thus proven,  both  petitioners  are clearly guilty of homicide. as  principals.  Their simultaneous act in pursuing  Ang, and the manner  in  which Sonia  cooperated with  Khaw   Dy,  not  only  when  he stabbed  Ang  for  the  first time, but,  also, when,  being thus  aware  of Khaw  Dy's  homicidal  intent,  she held Ang by  the  hair, after  his abortive attempt to escape, thus enabling Khaw Dy  to further inflict other injuries upon  him.  In  short,  petitioners' behaviour leaves  no room  for doubt on their unity of  action and  purpose, thus establishing  the existence  of conspiracy justifying the conclusion that both  are guilty as principals  (People vs. Timbol, G.R. No.  47471-47473, August 4, 1944; People vs. Macabuhay, 83 Phil., 464; 46 Off. Gaz., [11] 5469; People vs. Mahlong, 92 Phil., 883; and People  vs. Monadi, L-3370- 3371, September 27, 1955).   Considering,  however, that there had been  provocation on  the part of the  deceased, the  penalty  for  homicide  should  be  imposed  in  its minimum  period.</p>
<p>Modified as to the penalty,  which  is hereby reduced to a minimum of six (6) years  and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> and a maximum of (12)  years and one  (1) day of <em>reclusion  temporal,</em> the  decision  of  the  Court  of Appeals  is  affirmed  in all  other  respects,  with  costs against petitioners Khaw  Dy and Co Chian, alias Sonia. It is so ordered.</p>
