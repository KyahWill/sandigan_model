				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Alfonso  Bacsarpa, Venancio Lausa and Fernando  Macas were found guilty by the Court  of First Instance, of Agusan  of the crime  of  malversation of public funds punishable under paragraph 4 of Article 217 of the Revised Penal  Code  and  sentenced to  an indeterminate penalty of  not  less than six (6) years and one (1)  day of <em>prision  mayor</em> nor more than  twelve  (12)  years  and one  (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal,</em>  to  indemnify  the government in  the sum of  P6,123.88, to suffer perpetual special   disqualification  from  holding  office  of  public trust, to pay a fine  of P3,000 each,  and the corresponding  proportionate share  of the  costs. On  appeal, the Court of  Appeals   likewise found  them  guilty  of the aforementioned  crime but  modified  the decision and imposed  upon the appellants  an  indeterminate penalty  of not less than eight  (8)  years and one  (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>  nor more than  thirteen  (IS)   years,  nine  (9) months and eleven  (11) days of reclusion temporal and imposed a fine  of P8,997.47 and confirmed  the decision appealed from all other respects.</p>
<p>By way  of certiorari and only to  dispute the propriety of the  penalty  imposed by the  Court  pf Appeals, petitioners elevated the case to this Court on the ground  that the Court  of Appeals  erred in taking  into, consideration the aggregate amount  of P17,994.94  in the imposition  of penalty on all of them, instead of the  true amount each has  malversed.</p>
<p>The  pertinent portion of the finding  of  facts  in  the decision  appealed  from is  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  is not denied that on or about the month of  July, 1950, Alfonso  Bacsarpa was a 'collecting clerk' Venancio  Lausa a 'clerk messenger and market collector' and Fernando Macas a 'collector' in the office of Alfonso Esparagosa, municipal treasurer of Nasipit,  Agusan. Before the latter went to Butuan on July 10, 1950, he left Bacsarpa an  charge  of his office,  Lausa in charge of the post office and Macas in  charge of the  market collections, and  he instructed the first to notify him in  Butuan  should their collections be in  excess  of their P500 bond so that he could return  to Nasipit to take  possession of the amounts collected.</p>
  <p>"The evidence discloses conclusively that as of July 19 Lausa  had made a total collection of P71.06, Macas a total collection of P193.20 and Bacsarpa  a little  less than P 18,000.  Of  the  latter's collection f 17,418.29 came from  the Nasipit Lumber Co.  and was  received at  about  11:00 o'clock in  the morning of July 19.  It  consisted of P10,300 in Philippine National Bank checks, Pl,500 in postal money orders and P5,460  in cash.</p>
  <p>"The evidence further shows that in the afternoon of the same day Bacsarpa and  Macas sought the advice  of the municipal mayor regarding  the  safest way to keep  said  amounts  which,  according to  theni, were  deposited in a cabinet now in the record as  Exhibit A.   Bacsarpa claimed that the  cabinet could not be  kept inside the municipal  treasurer's safe because he  did not know the combination of  the latter.  It  would seem that, as a  result  of this conference, 4hey decided to place  the  cabinet aforementioned  under a table in the room occupied  by the  post  office and after that  had been done the municipal   mayor  left with instructions  to  the  sergeant  of police  to have  his policemen guard  the premises.  The three appellants also  left  after Lausa had  supposedly locked the  doors of  the post office and  of the treasurer's office,</p>
  <p>"At  about 6:30 in the morning of the following day Lausa  went to the building housing the offices mentioned heretofore and told policeman Panfilo Granada,  then on  duty,  that he  wanted  to enter  the treasurer's  office.  Upon approaching the  door thereof  Lausa complained to  said  policeman that its padlock had been  destroyed. Upon approaching the door of the post office he again complained to  the policeman  that said  door  could be opened  by merely  pushing  it. When  the  municipal mayor came later he found  that the  padlock Exhibit B, supposedly used by Lausa  to Iock the main  door of  the treasurer's office, had been destroyed with the lower end of the hook showing  signs  of  fresh  breakage and   also found  the   padlock Exhibit G, supposedly used by Lausa  to  lock the  door  of the post office, hanging on a wall.  Later on the municipal treasurer, Alfenso Esparagosa, and Antonio  Mordeno  of the office  of  the provincial auditor arrived  and after conducting an investigation of  the case they found  that Bacsarpa, Lausa and Macas were each  short of P17,730.68, P193.20 and P71.06, respectively. Subsequently,  however, the value of the PNB checks amounting to PI0,300 and of the postal money orders  amounting to P1,500 were recovered from  the said institutions, while the sum of P71.06 was reimbursed by Lausa.  .</p>
  <p>"It not being denied that on July 20, 1950 the municipal treasurer of Nasipit  and Antonio Mordeno of the office  of  the provincial auditor of  Agusan  actually found  appellants short in their respective  accounts, as stated heretofore, it is obvious that,  pursuant to the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 217 of the Revised Penal  Code, there is  enough prima fade evidence that they had put such  missing funds to their personal uses.  Consequently, it was their burden to destroy  the  <span style="font-style: italic;">prima  fade </span>case thus made against them by sufficient evidence (U.S. vs. Aeebedo, 18 Phil., 428."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant Lausa  contends that  he should  be declared guilty of  malversation  only  for the  sum  of P71.06 and punished under paragraph 1 of  Article  217, it appearing that he  only  malversed  P71.06  and  not  the entire  amount of P17,994.94.  A similar contention was raised by Macas whose collection not accounted for was only P193.20.  As to the petitioner  Bacsarpa,  it is argued that the  penalty imposed upon him  should  be  based on the  amount  of P6,930.68,  instead  of  the aggregate  amount  mentioned above, in view of the fact that the value of the Philippine National Bank checks  in  the amount of P10,300 and  the Postal Money Orders in the amount of P1,500 were  recovered.</p>
<p>It clearly appears from the decision appealed from that appellants herein  were  found guilty of the  malversation charged against them because they failed  to  account  for their respective collections when they were required so to do  by the municipal treasurer of Nasipit  and  one representative of the Auditor's Office who investigated  the respective accounts  of the  appellants.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals made no finding on the  conspiracy of  the  appellants to  commit the  crime at bar, if any; neither on the actual misappropriation  in equal shares  of the malversed amount mentioned in the information.  The only evidence on record against them is the <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence arising  from their failure to account for their respective collections which  they allegedly put in a box in all certainty in different envelopes or containers for said collections came from different sources.  Consequently, under the finding of facts by the Court of Appeals, it can hardly be held that each of the appellants has malversed the aggregate sum of P17,994.94, for each of them has the obligation to  account only  for  his individual collections and  not fdr the  collections of the others,  and therefore their respective responsibility should be narrowed to their individual collections which  each of them failed to account for.</p>
<p>As to the contention of appellant Bacsarpa to the effect that he should be sentenced under paragraph 3 because out of the P17,730.68, the sum of Pll,800 was recovered, we find it completely untenable, for the recovery of the amount malversed after the malversation was consummated does not give way to the reduction of the penalty provided for by law for the full amount embezzled.  It is undisputed that the collections—which this appellant failed to account for—amounted to P17,730.68; hence he was correctly convicted and sentenced under  paragraph 4 of the aforementioned Article 217  of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision,of the  Court of Appeals should   be  modified  with'  regard to appellants Lausa and Macas, who are hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from four (4) months and one (1)  day of <em>arresto mayor</em> to three (3) years, six  (6) months  and twenty-one (21) days of <em>prision correccional,</em> to pay a line of one-half (ife)  of the amount embezzled and to indemnify the, government  in  the  amount of P71.06  and P193.20, respectively.</p>
<p>With regard to appellant Bacsarpa, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed with respect to the principal penalty and modified with respect to  the indemnity  and fine, for this  appellant should be,  as he is hereby,  sentenced to indemnify the government the amount of P6,930.68 and to pay a fine equivalent to one-half (1/2) of P17,730.68.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  with the  modifications above  stated, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>

    <strong>RESOLUTION</strong>
</div>
<p align="right"><em> June 22, 1956</em></p>
<p>"In case L-8147  (Alfonso Bacsarpa, et al. vs. Court of Appeals), due to an oversight, the herein appellant Venancio Lausa has been incorrectly sentenced to indemnify the government the  amountNof P71.06 in the decision promulgated by this Court on May 18, 1956, he  having already reimbursed it.  Consequently, his. motion for reconsideration, dated June 6,. 1956, is well taken and therefore said decision  is  hereby amended eliminating therefrom  that portion sentencing him to  pay said  indemnity.  With regard to appellant Alfonso Bacsarpa's petition to the effect that he should be sentenced on the basis of the unrecovered amount and not on the  total amount malversed by him, the same is hereby denied, it being untenable for the reason stated in the decision  sought to be reconsidered."</p>
