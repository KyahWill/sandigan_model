				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; appeal stems&nbsp; from&nbsp; an action instituted&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Manila by&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; against the defendant seeking the refund of the sum of P57,551.10 representing certain compensating' taxes collected by the latter under section 190 of the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; plaintiff reduced the&nbsp; amount of its claim to P50,152.27 recognizing that&nbsp; its right&nbsp; to claim for the&nbsp; refund of P7,398.83 was barred by prescription in view of&nbsp; the lapse of two years from its payment to the filing of the suit.<br><br>Plaintiff's action is based upon its claim that said section 190&nbsp; of&nbsp; the i National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; is&nbsp; in effect a&nbsp; tax&nbsp; on&nbsp; imports and the&nbsp; same, can&nbsp; have&nbsp; no&nbsp; valid effect unless&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States in line with the provisions of section 1 (9)&nbsp; of the Ordinance&nbsp; appended to&nbsp; our.&nbsp; Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; since the requisite approval was proclaimed&nbsp; only on October&nbsp; 16, 1940, after the importation subject of the tax was made, plaintiff contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; collection&nbsp; of the tax is&nbsp; invalid and&nbsp; unconstitutional.<br><br>Defendant set&nbsp; up&nbsp; as main defense that the&nbsp; amount which plaintiff seeks&nbsp; to recover was collected as compensating tax under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 190 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which was in effect from July 1,&nbsp; 1939 to October&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1940, which section&nbsp; imposes,&nbsp; not a&nbsp; tax on imports, but rather a percentage tax on the; privilege of use, and that&nbsp; for&nbsp; such&nbsp; kind of&nbsp; tax the approval&nbsp; of the President of the United States is&nbsp; not necessary to make the&nbsp; law&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and effective.<br><br>The trial&nbsp; court sustained the&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the plaintiff holding that the tax imposed by section 190 of the National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code as&nbsp; originally&nbsp; enacted, is "essentially and inherently a tax on imports" and as such it requires&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval bf&nbsp; the President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; Consequently, it rendered judgment ordering&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; to&nbsp; refund&nbsp; ta&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P50.152.27.&nbsp; Hence this appeal.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; on July, 15,&nbsp; 1939, the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Commonwealth Government approved&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 466,&nbsp; otherwise known as&nbsp; the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; With the&nbsp; exception of&nbsp; section 187 thereof, the&nbsp; law was made&nbsp; effective&nbsp; as of July&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1939. 'Section 190 of said&nbsp; Act , provides&nbsp; for a&nbsp; compensating tax&nbsp; on commodities, goods,&nbsp; wares, or&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; purchased&nbsp; or received&nbsp; by any&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; resident&nbsp; from without&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; section, as originally&nbsp; enacted, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 190. <i> Compensating tax</i>.—-All persons purchasing or receiving from&nbsp; without the Philippines&nbsp; any&nbsp; commodities,&nbsp; goods, wares, or merchandise,&nbsp; excepting&nbsp; those&nbsp; subject to specific taxes under Title IV of&nbsp; this Code, shall pay on the total value thereof at the time they are Received by such&nbsp; persons, including freight, postage,&nbsp; insurance, commission,&nbsp; and all&nbsp; similar charges,&nbsp; a&nbsp; compensating tax equivalent to the percentage tax imposed under this Title on original transactions&nbsp; effected' by merchants, importers, or manufacturers, such tax to&nbsp; be paid upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; withdrawal or removal of said commodities, goods, wares, from&nbsp; the customhouse or the&nbsp; post&nbsp; office; <i>Provided, however,</i> that merchants, importers, and manufacturer's, who are subject to tax under&nbsp; sections 184,&nbsp; 185, 186,&nbsp; 187,&nbsp; and 189 of this Title&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; be&nbsp; required to pay the tax herein imposed where&nbsp; the articles purchased&nbsp; or received by&nbsp; them&nbsp; from without the Philippines&nbsp; are to&nbsp; be resold, bartered,&nbsp; or exchanged, or used in connection with their&nbsp; business."<br></blockquote>The foregoing provision was subsequently amended&nbsp; by section 6 of Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 503 which provides that&nbsp; said amendment&nbsp; "shall be&nbsp; effective&nbsp; only&nbsp; when&nbsp; the same&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have been&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the United States * * * and&nbsp;&nbsp; such approval shall have been made&nbsp; known&nbsp; by&nbsp; proclamation by&nbsp; the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines."&nbsp; Such approval&nbsp; was obtained and was embodied in a proclamation which was issued by the President of the Philippines on October 16,&nbsp; 1940.&nbsp; But before the approval and proclamation aforesaid, plaintiff bought and&nbsp; imported from outside the Philippines certain merchandise for use exclusively in connection with its mining business and defendant&nbsp; collected thereon the amount&nbsp; in question as compensating tax under section&nbsp; 190&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue Code. <br><br>The&nbsp; issue to be determined is&nbsp; whether&nbsp; said&nbsp; section 190, under&nbsp; which&nbsp; the tax in&nbsp; question&nbsp; was assessed, imposes an import tax and, therefore, did not acquire validity until after&nbsp; the&nbsp; President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines proclaimed on October&nbsp; 16, 1940 its approval by the President of the United&nbsp; States pursuant to paragraph 9, section 1,&nbsp; of the Ordinance appended to our Constitution.<br><br>The&nbsp; issue raised is not&nbsp; new.&nbsp; It was raised for the first time in International Business Machines Corporation of the&nbsp; Philippines vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, No. L-6732, Infra, p. 595, wherein this Court had occasion to express its view on the&nbsp; matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; In discussing the nature&nbsp; of the tax imposed by section 190 of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code,&nbsp; this Court said that the&nbsp; compensating tax imposed therein is not a tax on the importation of goods. "This is evident",&nbsp; said the Court, "from the proviso that imported merchandise which is to be disposed of in transactions&nbsp; subject of&nbsp; sales tax under sections 181, 185, 186, 187&nbsp; and 189 of the Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code, is expressly exempted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; compensating&nbsp; tax. This&nbsp;&nbsp; feature shows that&nbsp; it is not the act of importation that is taxed under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 190, but&nbsp; the use of imported&nbsp; goods not subjected to a&nbsp; sales tax: otherwise the&nbsp; compensating tax would have been levied&nbsp; on&nbsp; all imported goods regardless of any&nbsp; subsequent tax that might accrue.&nbsp; Moreover, the compensating tax&nbsp; accrues whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not the imported goods are subject to pay&nbsp; customs duties."<br><br>The above ruling finds support in the decision&nbsp; of the United States Supreme Court in Henneford <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Silas Mason Co. Inc., 300, U. S. 577,81 L. Ed., 814, 818-819, the pertinent portion of which we quote:<br><blockquote>"The tax is not&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; operations of interstate&nbsp; commerce,&nbsp; but upon the&nbsp; privilege&nbsp; of use after commerce is at an end. <br><br>"Things acquired or&nbsp; transported in interstate commerce&nbsp; may&nbsp; be subjected&nbsp; to&nbsp; a property tax,&nbsp; non-discriminatory in its&nbsp; operation, when they have become part&nbsp; of the common mass of property within the&nbsp; state&nbsp; of destination.&nbsp; Wiloil&nbsp; Corp;&nbsp; vs. Pennsylvania,&nbsp; 294&nbsp; U.
