				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF EULOGIO ONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. EULOGIO ONG, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon. Magno 
S. Gatmaitan, presiding, denying the petition for naturalization of Eulogio 
Ong.
<p>The grounds upon which the judgment is based are; that petitioner's witness 
Filomeno Barcelon is not sufficiently competent to testify as to the 
qualifications of the petitioner because he made contradictory statements as to 
the place of petitioner's residence, and, that the evidence submitted by 
petitioner as to his residence shows that he resided in Grace Park, Caloocan, 
Rizal instead of Gandara Street, Manila, for which reason the Court of First 
Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of his application for 
naturalization.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for us to state the facts proved by petitioner's 
evidences as to the place of his birth, his educational qualifications, his 
lawful admission into the Philippines as an alien, etc., because of the result 
of the application. We therefore limit ourselves to the issue raised in the 
appeal.</p>
<p>It is a fact that when witness Filomeno Barcelon was called to the witness 
stand on July 15, 1958 and gave testimony as to the petitioner's residence, he 
declared that petitioner lived in Gandara Street, Manila, up to the year 1956 
and thereafter transferred to Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal; that from 1956 he 
(petitioner) continued living in Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal, until July 15, 
1958 (t.s.n., Magtoto, 39, 44-45). However about one month after the hearing he 
was again called to the witness stand and on this occasion he was allowed to 
explain that the residence of petitioner testified to by him in his previous 
testimony, that the petitioner was residing in Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal, 
referred to the place of petitioner's business not his residence, his residence 
being at 917 Gandara Street, Manila. He explained this change that at the time 
He was being questioned he believed that the question referred to his place of 
business not his residence. It is claimed on behalf of petitioner-appellant that 
the above is a sufficient explanation of the previous statement of petitioner's 
witness.</p>
<p>We do not find the explanation by the witness to be satisfactory, primarily 
because the judge who heard him testify refused to believe his changed 
testimony. We note In addition that his residence certificate for 1958 showed 
that he was a resident of Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal (Exhibit "F-l" Income Tax 
Return). It is also a fact, of which we may take judicial notice, that Chinese 
businessmen rarely have residences different from that of their place of 
business. If the petitioner had a place of business in Grace Park, Caloocan, 
Rizal, it is natural that he should reside there especially if we take into 
account that he does not appear to be of such means that he could afford a place 
of residence distinct and separate from his place of business.</p>
<p>We have, however, an additional reason or ground for denying his application. 
He testified that he has a capital of P5,000.00 invested in a business known as 
the Eurasia Trading, the line of business of which is sale of electrical parts 
and spare parts for automobiles and diesel engines. That he had such capital is 
not proved except by his own testimony. But assuming his statement to be true, 
it would seem that petitioner is engaged in a business of retail which is 
prohibited to aliens under Republic Act No. 1180. We take judicial notice of the 
fact that spare parts of automobiles and other diesel engines are very expensive 
and the capital that petitioner has can not permit a wholesale business in such 
commodities. In other words we have reasonable grounds to believe that the 
business of the petitioner is one prohibited to aliens because it is the retail 
trade. This violation would disqualify him for naturalization. </p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations we affirm the decision of the Court below 
denying the petition for naturalization.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs against 
petitioner-appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
