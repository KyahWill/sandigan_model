				G.R. No. L-1206, October 30, 1947</h4>
				<H3>THE MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 44 of the Rules of Court 
interposed by the petitioner Manila Electric Company against the decision of 
July 15, 1946 of the Court of Industrial Relations, which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Although the practice of the company, according to the manifestations of 
counsel for said company, has been to grant one day vacation with pay to every 
workingman who had worked for seven consecutive days including Sundays, the 
Court considers justified the opposition presented by the workingmen to the 
effect that they need Sundays and holidays for the observance of their religion 
and for rest. The Court, therefore, orders the respondent company to pay 50% increase for overtime work done on ordinary days and 50 per cent increase 
for work done during Sundays and legal holidays irrespective of the number of 
days they work during the week."</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant contends that the said decision of the Court of Industrial 
Relations is against the provision of section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 444, which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No person, firm, or corporation, business establishment or place or center 
of labor shall compel an employee or laborer to work during Sundays and legal 
holidays, unless he is paid an additional sum of at least twenty-five per centum 
of his regular remuneration: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That this 
prohibition shall not apply to public utilities performing some public service 
such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water, or providing means of 
transportation or communication."</p></blockquote>
<p>After a careful consideration of the issue involved in this appeal, we are of 
the opinion and so hold that the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations 
is erroneous or contrary to the clear and express provision of the above quoted 
provisions. The power of the Court to settle industrial disputes between capital 
and labor, which include the fixing of wages of employees or laborers, granted 
by the general provisions of section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, has been 
restricted by the above quoted special provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 444, 
in the sense that public utilities supplying electricity, gas, power, water, or 
providing means of transportation or communication may compel their employees or 
laborers to work during, Sundays and legal holidays without paying them an 
additional compensation of not less than 25 per cent of their regular 
remuneration on said days.</p>
<p>Since the provisions of the above quoted section 4, are plain and unambiguous 
and convey a clear and definite meaning, there is no need of resorting to the 
rules of statutory interpretation or construction in order to determine the 
intention of the Legislature. Said section 1 consists of two parts: the first, 
which is the enactment clause, prohibits a person, firm or corporation, business 
establishment, or place or center of labor from compelling an employee or 
laborer to work during Sundays and legal holidays, unless the former pays the 
latter an additional sum of at least twenty five per centum of his regular 
remuneration; and the second part, which is an exception, exempts public 
utilities performing some public service, such as supplying gas, electricity, 
power, water or providing means of transportation or communication, from the 
prohibition established in the enactment clause. As the appellant is a public 
utility that supplies electricity and provides means of transportation to the 
public, it is evident that the appellant is exempt from the qualified 
prohibition established in the enactment clause, and may compel its employees or 
laborers to work during Sundays and legal holidays without paying them said 
extra compensation.</p>
<p>To hold that the exception or second part of section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 
444, only exempts public utilities mentioned therein from the prohibition to 
compel employees or laborers to work during Sundays and legal holidays, but not 
from the obligation to pay them an extra or additional compensation for 
compelling them to work during those days, is to make the exception meaningless 
or a superfluity, that is, an exception to a general rule that does not exist, 
because the prohibition in the enactment clause is not an absolute prohibition 
to compel a laborer or employee to work during Sundays and legal holidays. The 
prohibition to compel a laborer or employee to work during those days is 
qualified by the clause "unless he is paid an additional sum of at least twenty 
five per centum of his regular remuneration," which is inseparable from the 
prohibition which they qualify and of which they are a part and parcel. The 
second portion of section 1 is in reality an exception and not a <i>proviso</i> 
although it is introduced by the word "provided"; and it is elemental that an 
exception takes out of an enactment something which would otherwise be a part of 
the subject matter of it.</p>
<p>To construe Section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 444, as exempting public 
utilities, like the appellant, from the obligation to pay the additional 
remuneration required by said section 4 should they compel their employees or 
laborers to work on Sundays and legal holidays, would not make such exception a 
class legislation, violative of the constitutional guaranty of equal protection 
of the laws (Section 1 [1] Art. III of our Constitution). For it is a 
well-settled rule in constitutional law that a legislation which affects with 
equal force all persons of the same class and not those of another, is not a 
class legislation and does not infringe said constitutional guaranty of equal 
protection of the laws, if the division into classes is not arbitrary and is 
based on differences which are apparent and reasonable. (Magonn <i>vs</i>. 
Illinois Trust Savings Bank, 170 N. S., 283, 294; State <i>vs</i>. Garbroski, 
111 Iowa, 496; 56 L. R. A., 570.) And it is evident that the division made by 
section 4, of Commonwealth Act No. 444, of persons, firms, and corporations into 
two classes: one composed of public utilities performing some public service 
such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water or providing means of 
transportation; and another composed of persons, firms, and corporations which 
are not public utilities and do not perform said public services, is not 
arbitrary and is based on differences which are apparent and reasonable.</p>
<p>The division is not arbitrary, and the basis thereof is reasonable. Public 
utilities exempted from the prohibition set forth in the enactment clause of Section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 444, are required to perform a continuous 
service including Sundays and legal holidays to the public, since the public 
good so demands, and are not allowed to collect an extra charge for services 
performed on those days; while the others are not required to do so and are free 
to operate or not their shops, business, or industries on Sundays and legal 
holidays. If they operate and compel their laborer to work on those days it is 
but just and natural that they should pay an extra compensation to them, because 
it is to be presumed that they can make money or business by operating on those 
days even if they have to pay such extra remuneration. It would be unfair for 
the law to compel public utilities like the appellant to pay an additional or 
extra compensation to laborers whom they have to compel to work during Sundays 
and legal holidays, in order to perform a continuous service to the public. To 
require public utilities performing public service to do so, would be tantamount 
to penalize them for performing public service during said days in compliance 
with the requirement of the law and public interest.</p>
<p>The conclusion on which the dissenting opinion is based, which is also 
substantially the basis of the resolution of the lower court, is that "As to 
them [referring to public utilities like the petitioner] Section 4 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 444 may be considered as not having been enacted at all. * 
* * Therefore, when there is a labor dispute as in the present case, and the 
dispute is submitted to the Court of Industrial Relations for decision or 
settlement, the court is free to provide what it may deem just and more 
beneficial to the interested parties, and that freedom to settle and decide the 
case certainly includes the power to grant additional compensation to workers 
who work on Sundays and holidays. The general power granted by Sections 1, 4, 
and 13 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, are not affected in any way or sense by 
section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444."</p>
<p>This conclusion finds no support in law, reason or logic. It is a well 
settled rule of statutory construction adopted by courts of last resort in the 
States that if one statute enacts some thing in general terms, and afterwards 
another statute is passed on the same subject, which although expressed in 
affirmative language introduces special conditions or restrictions, the 
subsequent statute will usually be considered as repealing by implication the 
former regarding the matter covered by the subsequent act; and more specially so 
when the latter act is expressed in negative terms, as where for example it 
prohibits a certain thing from being done, or where it declares that a given act 
shall be performed in a certain manner and not otherwise. (<i>See</i> Black on 
Interpretation of Laws, 2d ed., p. 354, and Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 
3d ed., Vol. 1, Section 1922, and cases therein cited.)</p>
<p>In accordance with this rule, the provision of Commonwealth Act No. 103 which 
confers upon the Court of Industrial Relations power to settle dispute between 
employers and employees in general, including those relating to compulsion of 
laborers to work on Sundays and legal holidays and additional compensation for 
those working on those days, should be considered as impliedly repealed by 
section 4 of Act No. 444, which limits or restricts the minimum of the 
additional compensation and specifies the persons, firms or corporation who may 
be requered to pay said compensation. That is, that the Court of Industrial 
Relations may, under the provision of said section 4, order a person, firm or 
corporation or business establishment or place or center of labor who compel an 
employee or laborer to work on Sundays and legal holidays, to pay him an 
additional compensation of at least 25 per centum of his regular remuneration; 
but said court can not require public utilities performing public service 
mentioned therein to pay said extra compensation to laborers and employees 
required by them to work on Sundays and legal holidays, because the necessity of 
public service so requires.</p>
<p>It is evident that the principal purpose of the Legislature in enacting said 
section 4, is not only to restrict the general power of the Court of Industrial 
Relations granted by Act No. 103, to fix the minimum additional compensation 
which an employer may be required to pay a laborer compelled to work on those 
days, but principally to exempt public utilities affected with public interest, 
from the payment of such additional compensation. If it were the intention of 
the lawmakers in enacting Section 4 of Act No. 444 to fix the limit of the 
minimum of additional compensation for laborers working on those days, without 
exempting the public utilities, that is, leaving intact the general power of the 
court to require the said public utilities to pay said additional compensation, 
the law would have only provided, in substance, that all employers are 
prohibited from compelling their laborers to work on Sundays and legal holidays 
without paying them an additional compensation of not less than 50 per cent of 
their regular remuneration.</p>
<p>That the intention of the Legislature is to exempt the public utilities under 
consideration from the prohibition set forth in the enactment clause of Section 
4, Act No. 444, is supported by the provision of section 19 of Act No. 103. As 
amended this section provides "that <i>with the exception of employers engaged 
in the operation of public services or in the business coupled with a public 
interest</i>, employers will not be allowed to engage the services of strike 
breakers within fifteen days after the declaration of the strike;" which shows 
<i>a contrario sensu</i> that public utilities performing public services are 
permitted to engage the services of strike breakers within fifteen days, that 
is, immediately upon the declaration of the strike. The same public interest, 
the reason of the exception in the above quoted provision, underlies the 
exception provided in section 4, of Act No. 444.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ruling of the Court of Industrial Relations quoted in the 
first part of this decision appealed from, being contrary to law, is set aside. 
So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Paras, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</p>

<p>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>The petitioner complains against the following judgment of the Court of 
Industrial Relations with reference to respondent's demand for 100 per cent 
overtime pay on Sundays and holidays and 50 per cent increase in pay after eight 
hours work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although the practice of the Company, according to the manifestations of 
counsel for said company, has heen to grant one day vacation with pay to every 
workingman who had worked for seven consecutive days including Sundays, the 
Court considers justified the opposition presented by the workingmen to the 
effect that they need Sundays and holidays for the observance of their religion 
and for rest. The Court, therefore, orders the respondent company to pay 50 per 
cent increase for overtime work done on ordinary days and 50 per cent increase 
for work done during Sundays and legal holidays, irrespective of the number of 
days they work during the week."</p></blockquote>
<p>The power and jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations to render 
said judgment under the authority given by sections 1, 4, and 13 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 103, quoted below, cannot be disputed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. <i>The Judge: his appointment, qualifications, compensation, 
tenure</i>.—There is hereby created a Court of Industrial Relations, which shall 
have jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide, 
and settle any question, matter, controversy or dispute arising between, and/or 
affecting, employers and employees or laborers, and landlords and tenants or 
farm-laborers, and regulate the relation between them, subject to, and in 
accordance with, the provisions of this Act. * * *"</p>
<p>"SEC. 4. <i>Strikes and lockouts</i>.—The Court shall take cognizance for 
purposes of prevention, arbitration, decision and settlement, of any industrial 
or agricultural dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout, arising 
from differences as regards wages, shares or compensation, hours of labor or 
conditions of tenancy or employment, between employers and employees or laborers 
and between landlords and tenants or farm-laborers, provided that the number of 
employees, laborers or tenants or farm-laborers involved exceeds thirty, and 
such industrial or agricultural dispute is submitted to the Court by the 
Secretary of Labor, or by any or both of the parties to the controversy and 
certified by the Secretary of Labor as existing and proper to be dealt with by 
the Court foi the sake of public interest. In all such cases, the Secretary of 
Labor or the party or parties submitting the disputes, shall clearly and 
specifically state in writing the questions to be decided. Upon the submission 
of such a controversy or question by the Secretary of Labor, his intervention 
therein as authorized by law, shall cease.</p>
<p>"The Court shall, before hearing the dispute and in the course of such 
hearing, endeavor to reconcile the parties and induce them to settle the dispute 
by amicable agreement. If any agreement as to the whole or any part of the 
dispute is arrived at by the parties, a memorandum of its terms shall be made in 
writing, signed and acknowledged by the parties thereto before the Judge of the 
Court or any official acting in his behalf and authorized to administer oaths or 
acknowledgments, or, before a notary public. The memorandum shall be filed in 
the office of the Clerk of the Court, and, unless otherwise ordered by the 
Court, shall, as between the parties to the agreement, have the same effect as, 
and be deemed to be, a decision or award."</p>
<p>"SEC. 13. <i>Character of the award</i>.—In making an award, order or 
decision, under the provisions of section four of this Act, the Court shall not 
be restricted to the specific relief claimed or demands made by the parties to 
the industrial or agricultural dispute, but may include in the award, order or 
decision any matter or determination which may be deemed necessary or expedient 
for the purpose of settling the dispute or of preventing further industrial or 
agricultural disputes."</p></blockquote>
<p>The question raised by petitioner refers to the applicability to the 
controversy of section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444, which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No person, firm or corporation, business establishment or place or center of 
labor shall compel an employee or laborer to work during Sundays and legal 
holidays, unless he is paid an additional sum of at least twenty-five <i>per 
centum</i> of his regular remuneration: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That 
this prohibition shall not apply to public utilities performing some public 
service such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water, or providing means of 
transportation or communication."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner prayed that the part of the decision of the Court of Industrial 
Relations of July 15, 1946, relating to demand No. 4 of the respondent Labor 
Union, above quoted, and the order of the same court of October 15, 1946, 
overruling petitioner's motion to set aside said part and for a new trial, be 
vacated.</p>
<p>As petitioner invokes the authority of section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444, 
above quoted, the whole controversy in this case hinges upon the interpretation 
of said section.</p>
<p>No correct interpretation can be given unless the document in dispute is read 
correctly. Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444 appears to be composed of two 
parts: a general provision and an exception. The main provision is prohibitory 
in nature. It says that "no person, firm, or corporation, business establishment 
or place or center of labor shall compel employees or laborers to work during 
Sundays and legal holidays unless he is paid an additional sum of at least 
twenty-five <i>per centum</i> of the regular remuneration." The exception 
excludes from the prohibitory general provision public utilities performing 
public service such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water or providing 
means of transportation or communication.</p>
<p>It will be seen that section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444 divides the 
employers into two classes: 1. Those not engaged in public utilities, and 2. 
those engaged in public utilities. The first class cannot compel their employees 
or laborers to work on Sundays and holidays without giving them an additional 
salary or remuneration equivalent to not less than twenty-five <i>per centum</i> 
of the basic remuneration. There is no limit as to the time or circumstances 
under which the additional compensation is to be paid. Employers engaged in 
public utilities are excluded from the prohibition. This means simply that 
employers engaged in public utilities may or may not pay the additional 
compensation or any additional compensation for compelling their laborers to 
work on Sundays and holidays. The exception should not be interpreted as 
providing that employers engaged in public utilities cannot be compelled to pay 
additional compensation to workers required to work on Sundays and holidays. As 
to them, section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444 may be considered as not having 
been enacted at all. Exception or exemption from a negative or prohibitory legal 
provision is not a positive or affirmative provision commanding the excepted or 
exempted person to do what is enjoined in the general provision.</p>
<p>The general provision of said section does not work either way with respect 
to public utilities. Therefore, when there is a labor dispute as in the present 
case, and the dispute is submitted to the Court of Industrial Relations for 
decision or settlement, the court is free to provide what it may deem just and 
more beneficial to the interested parties, and that freedom to settle and decide 
the case certainly includes the power to grant additional compensation to 
workers who work on Sundays and holidays. The general power granted by Sections 
1, 4, and 13 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, above quoted, are not affected in any 
way or sense by section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444.</p>
<p>The right to collect an additional sum of at least twenty-five <i>per 
centum</i> of the basic remuneration is guaranteed to all workers and employees 
not engaged in public utilities and that right is enforceable not only in the 
Court of Industrial Relations but in any other competent court of justice. It 
must be remembered that the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations is 
limited to labor disputes in which a minimum number of laborers are involved. 
Under section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444, a single laborer may claim in a 
competent ordinary court of justice for the additional compensation provided 
therein in case he is compelled to work on Sundays and holidays.</p>
<p>Under the powers granted by Sections 1, 4, and 13 of Commonwealth Act No. 
103, the Court of Industrial Relations had and still has perfect power and 
authority to make the award with respect to demand No. 4 in the way expressed in 
the judgment quoted at the beginning of this opinion. In granting 50 per cent 
increase for work or service done on Sundays and legal holidays, the Court of 
Industrial Relations undoubtedly had taken into consideration the circumstances 
of the case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is a fact that Sundays and legal holidays are set aside by 
law as days of rest. The life, existence, and happiness of a person do not 
depend only on the satisfaction of his physical needs. There are moral, 
intellectual and spiritual needs as imperative as the physical ones. Ordinarily, 
Sundays and legal holidays are dedicated to reading and instruction so as to 
fill the mind with culture or some sort of advancement On those days the laborer 
enjoys longer hours in the company of his family. That gives him an opportunity 
to satisfy his moral needs. During Sundays and holidays more time is dedicated 
to worship and other religious services. That gives a laborer an opportunity to 
satisfy his spiritual needs. The deprivation of that opportunity to satisfy 
mental, moral, and spiritual needs should not be ignored, and should be properly 
compensated.</p>For all the foregoing, we are of opinion and so we vote, that 
the petition should be dismissed.</div>
