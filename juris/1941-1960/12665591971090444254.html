				G.R. No. L-7777, October 31, 1955</h4>
				<H3>M. E. GREY, DECEASED SUBSTITUTED BY RUTH GREY, AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF THE LATE M. E. GREY, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. INSULAR LUMBER COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case (Case No. 8185 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental) 
was originally filed by M. E. Grey against the Insular Lumber Company, referred 
to later as the Company, to collect a sum of money. Upon Grey's death, Special 
Proceedings No. 387 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental were 
instituted for the administration of his estate. Ruth Grey was appointed 
administratrix and in that capacity she substituted M. E. Grey as plaintiff. 
Eventually the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff which 
judgment on appeal was modified by the Supreme Court in G. R. No. L-535. In 
compliance with the final judgment the Company issued National City Bank of New 
York, Manila branch check No. 220481 for a total sum of P88,453.56 in the name 
of Ruth Grey, "in her capacity as administratrix of the Estate of M. E. Grey, 
deceased," and delivered the same to Atty. Carlos Hilado, counsel for 
plaintiff.
<p>On February 23, 1954, Atty. Hilado filed a motion with the trial court 
alleging that he had a contract with 3VL E. Grey for a contingent fee of 25 per 
cent of the amount of the judgment which 25 per cent is equivalent to 
P22,113.89, and desiring to collect this amount, he asked the court to order the 
payment to him of this contingent fee and order the defendant Company to cancel 
its check No. F-220481 and in lieu thereof, issue two checks, one for P66,340.17 
in the name of the administratrix and another check for P22,113.39 in his name. 
Movant further alleged in his motion that Atty. Jose A. Strachan, attorney of 
the estate of Grey, who was fully aware of the contract for the contingent fee 
was being notified by registered mail in his residence in Escalante, Negros 
Occidental. Atty. Hilado also said that administratrix Ruth Grey was living in 
the United States, and that he did not know "what disposition she would like to 
make regarding the aforesaid amount as well as the persons entitled to receive 
said amount in the settlement and distribution of the estate of the 
deceased."</p>
<p>The Company through its attorneys filed opposition to the motion on the 
ground that it had already complied with its obligation to pay the amount of the 
judgment debt to the administratrix and that if Atty. Hilado had any claim for 
attorney's fees, he could, if he so desired, file a proper petition in the 
probate proceedings. On March 8, 1954, Atty. Hilado replied to the opposition 
and on the same date filed an amended motion reproducing the contract with M. E. 
Grey for professional services, claiming that his attorney's fees were unpaid, 
reasonable and just, and asking that his attorney's lien be made of record, 
reiterating his prayer that the Company be directed to cancel its check and 
issue in lieu thereof two checks.</p>
<p>On March 16, 1954, the trial court granted the amended motion; ordered Atty. 
Hilado's lien recorded for all legal purposes, and ordered the Company to cancel 
"Check No. F-220481 and in its stead to issue two checks, viz., one check for 
the sum of ?66,340.17 in the name of 'Ruth Grey, in her capacity as 
administratrix of the estate of M. E. Grey, deceased'; and another check for the 
sum of P22,113.39 in the name of Atty. Carlos Hilado." Failing to secure a 
reconsideration of this, order the defendant Company appealed the said order 
direct to this Court.</p>
<p>It is rather strange that the defendant Company which apparently has no legal 
interest in the disposition or distribution of the amount of the judgment should 
oppose the motion of Atty. Hilado, going to the extent of appealing the order 
granting the same, while the attorney for the estate would appear to have said 
or done nothing, agreeing to the motion or opposing the same, assuming of 
course, that he received on time the notice said to have been mailed to him. 
However, it may well be that the defendant Company merely wanted to stand by its 
legal rights as a judgment debtor. We agree with it that after paying the total 
amount of the debt, in the form of a check received and apparently accepted by 
Atty. Hilado as counsel for the plaintiff, it had fully complied with its legal 
obligation. Had Atty. Hilado claimed and made of record his charging lien for 
his contingent fee before defandant Company had made the payment in a lump sum, 
it might yet be possible that the trial court could have legally ordered it to 
make the payment in two separate sums, one for the administratrix and another 
for the counsel, this, of course, assuming that the estate of Grey was agreeable 
to the collection of said contingent fee. However, as already stated, Atty. 
Hilado claimed and made of record his charging lien after the judgment debtor 
had duly complied with the judgment.</p>
<p>There is no question that the law protects a charging lien of Atty. Hilado 
and if and when duly established, would authorize its payment by the estate. But 
to do so, Atty. Hilado would first have to prove the contract for the contingent 
fee; and that it was, in his own words "unpaid, reasonable and just." It is at 
the same time obvious that the other party, the legal representative of the 
estate should be heard so that she may agree to the claim for the payment of the 
fee or oppose it on some legal ground. As said by this Court in the case of 
Ulanday <em>vs</em>. Manila Railroad Company, 45 Phil., 540:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. Contingent fees are not prohibited in the Philippines, and since 
impliedly sanctioned by law 'should be under supervision of the court in order 
that clients may be protected from unjust charges.' (Canons of Professional 
Ethics, No. 13.) Where it is shown that the contract for a contingent fee was 
obtained by any undue influence of the attorney over the client, or by any fraud 
or imposition, or that the compensation is so clearly excessive as to amount to 
extortion, the court will in a proper case protect the aggrieved party." (Taylor 
<em>vs</em>. Bemiss [1883], 110 U. S., 42.) </p></blockquote>
<p>If M. E. Grey were alive today there is no question that he would be given an 
opportunity to appear and say whether he agrees to the payment or whether he 
opposes the same on the ground that the contract for contingent fee was 
irregularly and improperly obtained from him, or that the amount stated therein 
was clearly excessive or that it had already been paid partly or fully. 
Otherwise, as said in the case of Dahlke <em>vs</em>. Vi√±a, 51 Phil., 707, 
should he fail to contest the claim for contingent fee he would be bound by the 
amount specified in the lien even though it was not just or it may have been 
paid. Grey being now dead, it is but just that the legal representative of his 
estate which would be paying said contingent fee if duly established should be 
heard. In the present case, administratrix Ruth Grey is residing in the United 
States. True, the attorney for the estate, Atty. Strachan, may have been duly 
notified of the filing of the claim and the recording of the attorney's lien but 
according to the very pleadings, the amended motion of Atty. Hilado was filed on 
March 8, 1954 and the order granting the same was issued on March 16, 1954, 
about eight days later. We do not know when the notice sent by Atty. Hilado from 
Bacolod City by registered mail was received by Atty. Strachan in Escalante, 
Negros Occidental; but even if he had received the same shortly after March 8, 
1954, he could have had no material time to communicate with administratrix Ruth 
Grey in the United States and received her answer, much less for said 
administratrix Ruth Grey to come to the Philippines if she so desired, appear 
before the trial court, study the petition for the payment of the contingent fee 
and declare her stand, whether she was agreeable to it or she opposed the 
same.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of this case. Upon the payment of the judgment debt 
in the sum of P88,453.56 though in the form of a check in the name of the 
administratrix, the said amount may be considered to have formed part of the 
funds of the estate and so to be in <em>custodia legis</em> notwithstanding the 
fact that the check was being held by Atty. Hilado, because the probate court 
has jurisdiction over the properties belonging to the estate though temporarily 
held by third parties. Any payment of attorney's fees by the estate will have to 
be approved by the probate court. In other words, in the payment of the 
contingent fees claimed in this case, the probate court has something to say, 
although should the propriety and validity of the proposed payment of said fees 
be duly established before the trial court, there would be no difficulty in 
securing the approval of the probate court.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order of the trial court of March 16,1954, 
granting the motion of Atty. Carlos Hilado is hereby set aside. Let this case be 
remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, especially to set the said 
motion for hearing, giving sufficient time for the notification of the 
administratrix Ruth Grey and for an opportunity on her part should she desire to 
do so to come to the Philippines to attend the hearing, after which, the trial 
court will rule on and decide the motion. No costs.</p>
