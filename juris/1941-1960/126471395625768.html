				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner, Philippine Refining Company, Inc., hereafter referred to as  the company, is a corporation established in accordance with the Philippines laws.  At the time of the outbreak of war in the Pacific and for sometime prior thereto, it operated a ^ refinery  in  the municipality  of Opon,  province  of Cebu,  where  over 30 respondents herein-—who, excluding the Judges of the Court of Industrial  Relations, are 328 in  number—were admittedly  its employees when  the Japanese forces invaded the  Philippines, in January, 1942.  On or about April  10, 1942, the Japanese took  over the  refinery until  it  was  destroyed sometime  in  September,  1944.  After  liberation, sixteen (16)  of the respondents actually worked for the company. On or about November 22, 1952, respondents, alleging that they  were "working or in some way or  another connected with"  the  company, filed  against the  same a petition, which  was docketed in the Court  of Industrial Relations as Case No. 774-V, praying that said company be ordered:</p>
<ol>
  <li>"To make a preliminary conference with the petitioner through counsel  with the intervention of this Honorable Court, to give way for an  amicable settlement.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"Failure to  arrive at an amicable settlement and after  the hearing and adjudication  of the merits of  the above mentioned allegations,  to further order  the company to grant what is alleged and prayed for as  herein  below stated: <br>

  <li>"That the  hearing be  made  in the municipality  of Opon, province   of  Cebu  where  most  of  the  employees  and laborers concerned are  residing,  or in  the  City of Cebu." </li>
</ol>
<p>Soon  after,  or  on  December  23,  1952, the  company filed  a motion to dismiss said case No.  774-V,  upon the ground  that the  Court of  Industrial Relations had  no jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof and that the  petition  therein failed to  state any cause  of action.   This motion was denied by an order of the then presiding Judge of  said Court,  Hon.  Arsenio Roldan, dated January 4, 1954, which was affirmed by the Court sitting in bane in a resolution, dated February 12, 1954, denying  a motion for reconsideration of the company dated January 11, 1954. On March  1, 1954, the company  gave notice of  its intention  to appeal  by certiorari  and  on March 8,  1954, it instituted  the present case—against the  petitioners  in case  No 774-V of the  Court of  Industrial Relations and the five (5)  judges thereof—with a pleading bearing the heading  "Petition for  Certiorari".  After setting  forth substantially  the  foregoing  facts,  the  company alleges herein:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>15.  "That  in promulgating the aforementioned  resolution,  Annex '10' which confirmed Judge Arsenio  C.  Roldan's order, Annex '5', to the effect  that the1 Court of Industrial  Relations had jurisdiction to take cognizance of this case instituted by prewar  employees of petitioner in its refinery  in Opon, Cebu, of whom only sixteen (16) are actually working for petitioner  at  the time of the filing of said case in the  Court  of Industrial Relations  and the rest of them  not having been re-employed after liberation for the  reason that petitioner  had  not  rehabilitated its  refinery in  Opon,  Cebu up to the present time, the respondent judges  had acted in excess of jurisdiction and  with grave  abuse of discretion  inasmuch as the said  order, Annex '5'  is contrary to the  stipulation of facts entered into  between the parties hereto at the  preliminary hearing of this  case at Cebu City, and  is an erroneous interpretation of section 1 and 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, which are the  provisions of law  under which the Court of  Industrial Relations can assume jurisdiction of an industrial dispute.</p>
  <p>16.  'That  there is no  appeal nor any  plain, speedy  or adequate remedy in the  ordinary course  of law from  the decision of  the Court  of Industrial  Relations  promulgated on  January 5, 1954 (Annex  '5'),  and  its   resolution affirming  said  decision  dated February 12, 1954  (Annex '10'), other than by this  petition  for the issuance  of a writ  of  certiorari."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prayer in said petition for certiorari is of the following tenor: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Wherefore, for and in view of all the foregoing considerations, your  petitioner  Philippine  Refining  Company,  Inc.  respectfully prays—</p>

<p>What is the nature of the proceedings before this Court? In applying for certiorari,  does the  company  seek from us a review of the order and the resolution of the Court of Industrial  Relations,  dated January 4 and February 12,  1954,  respectively in the exercise of  our  <em>appellate</em> jurisdiction, as  provided for in Rule  44 of the Rules of Court?</p>
<p>Seemingly, such was the purpose of the company when—in the  language of paragraph  (13)  of  its petition for certiorari—it  filed, with the Court of Industrial  Relations, on March 1, 1954, "notice of  its intention to  appeal  by certiorari."  Evidently, however, there had been a change of  plan by  the time  it  filed  the petition for  certiorari. The allegations  is paragraphs  15  and  16  thereof—to the effect that,  in  promulgating the  resolution of February 12, 1954 (affirming the order of Presiding Judge Roldan of January 4, 1954, the respondent judges  of the Court of Industrial Relations "had acted in excess  of,  jurisdiction and with  grave abusd of discretion", and that "there is  no appeal nor any plain, speedy or adequate  remedy in the ordinary  course of law" from said order  of  January 4, 1954, and from the aforementioned resolution, confirmatory thereof, dated'February 12, 1954—as well  as  the tenor of the prayer in the petition for certiorari and the verification at the foot thereof, clearly indicate that the company invokes our original jurisdiction, with a view to securing a declaration of nullity of the order and the resolution in question, by writ  of  certiorari, under the provisions of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>In either case, however, the petition is legally  untenable. Viewed as an appeal from the order and the  resolution of  January  4 and February 12,  1954, respectively, the petition cannot be entertained, for said order  and  resolution are interlocutory in nature,  involving, as they do, a mere denial of the motion to dismiss the petition of the main respondents  herein in case No 774-V  of  the Court of  Industrial Relations.  Said order  and resolution did not dispose,  in a definite  manner,  of  either  the  issue raised  by said motion to dismiss,  or the  merits of said petition of respondents herein.  The  company may  still answer this  petition,  and,  after due  hearing,  the  Court of Industrial Relations shall render a decision  or  award, passing upon the merits of said petition and of the answer thereto and  settling  the issue or issues  raised by the pleadings.  In disposing thereof, the Court  of  Industrial Relations might even reconsider the  view taken  in the order and the resolution complained of, in which event a review of either by this Court would become unnecessary. If no such reconsideration  were made in said decision or award, and the same were unfavorable to the company, the latter could then  appeal to this  Court by  certiorari, and, in the  course of the proceedings thereon, it could seek, not  only a reversal or modification of  said decision or award, but, also, a determination of the  soundness or propriety of the   order  and the resolution in question (Rule 41, section,  Rules  of Court).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Interlocutory  orders or judgments  are not appealable,  because, prior to the rendition of the final judgment, they are, at any time, subject to such corrections or amendments as the court may deem proper.  This does not mean, however, that they are not appealable at all.  Appeal may be taken therefrom bat after final judgment is rendered. * * *</p>
  <p>"An order or a judgment is deemed final which it finally disposes of the pending: action so that nothing more can  be done with it in "the trial court  In other words, a final order or judgment is that which gives  an end to the litigation.  And, consequently, when  the order or judgment does not dispose of the case completely but leaves something to be  done upon the merits, it is merely interlocutory. For instance, an order denying a motion of dismissal founded on lack of jurisdiction, an order denying a motion for annulment of a preliminary attachment, or denying a motion for default an order declaring the defendant in default an  order denying or granting preliminary  injunction or appointing a receiver, is  merely interlocutory, for, after such order is issued, there are still many things to be done for a  complete disposition of the case."  (Comments on the  Rules  of Court, by  Moran,  Vol.  I,  pp.  894-895)   (Italics-supplied).'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considered as an original  action to nullify said order and  resolution,  by writ of certiorari, under Rule 67 of the Rules  of  Court, for want  of jurisdiction  or grave abuse  of  discretion, the  case at bar, must,  likewise,  be dismissed,  it being conceded that  the Court of Industrial Relations had authority to entertain the company's  motion to  dismiss of December 23, 1952, and its motion for  re-consideration of January 11,  1964.   Consequently,  it had jurisdiction  to decide  said motions,  and the order and resolution  to this  effect  are  lawful and binding,  unless : and  until reversed or modified in  the proper  proceedings. Such legal inaccuracies or mistakes as may exist, if any— on which we do not express  any  opinion—in  the conclusions therein reached,  are errors which,  as above  stated, may be corrected  by  appeal,  at the  proper  time.  They do not affect the validity of said order and resolution.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * * 'jurisdiction should  be distinguished  from exercise of jurisdiction Jurisdiction  is the authority to hear and determine a  cause—the right to act in a case.  Since it is the  power to hear  and determine,  its  existence  does  not depend either  upon the regularity of the exercise  of  that power  or upon the rightfulness of the decision made.  The  authority to decide  a cause, if at  all, and  not the decision rendered  therein,  is what makes up jurisdiction.  Where there  is jurisdiction  over  the person and the  subject-matter, the decision on all other questions arising  in the  case,  is  but  an exercise of that jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>"The errors which the court may commit in the exercise of  such jurisdiction  are merely  errors  of judgment.  Here,  it  becomes necessary  to distinguish errors of  jurisdiction from  errors of judgment.  The first may be reviewed in a certiorari proceedings, the  second,  by appeal.  * * *  Thus, appeal and not certiorari  is the  proper remedy for correcting  an error which  a lower court may have committed in denying a motion to set aside a judgment, or for setting aside an order  of  dismissal."  (Comments on the Rules of Court, by moran, Vol. II, pp. 157, 158, 159).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is hereby dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.   It is so ordered.</p>
