				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 26, 1951, appellee Felicidad Castañeda filed a complaint against 
appellant Bruna Pestano in the Court of, First Instance of Nueva Ecija (Civil 
Case No. 720) to quiet her title to, and be declared absolute owner of, a parcel 
of land located in barrio Mallorca, San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija. It is alleged in 
the complaint that defendant-appellee Pestaño asserts an adverse interest over 
the land in question, and that through fraudulent misrepresentations, she 
entered the same, destroying bamboo groves and carting away ripe bamboos, to the 
damage and prejudice of plaintiff. 
<p>Summons was served upon the defendant Pestaño on March 11, 1951, but she 
failed to answer within the reglementary period. On May 2, 1951, plaintiff filed 
a motion to have defendant declared in default. The next day, May 3rd, the 
defendant filed an answer. Finding dedefendant's answer in the records, the 
court below, instead of declaring her in default as prayed for in plaintiff's 
motion of May 2nd, set the case for hearing on the question of the admissibility 
of defendant's answer which was filed out of time but before the filing of the 
petition for default. On May 5th, defendant filed a verified written motion 
giving reasons why her answer should be admitted. It is alleged therein that 
defendant failed to answer the complaint on time because she fell ill on the 
third day after summons, was served upon her and that her illness lasted for 45 
days, so that it was only on April 30, 1951 that she was able to get up and go 
to town to consult a lawyer about the case. Hearing was held on May 7, 1951, 
after which the parties filed memoranda and counter-memoranda on the issue of 
whether or not the answer should be admitted. Five months later, or on October 
3, 1951, the lower court entered an order denying the admission of defendant's 
answer, and declaring her in default for the reason that her answer was filed 
about 52 days after summons, that the motion for default was filed ahead of the 
answer itself, and that the failure of defendant to file her answer within the 
time provided by the Rules did not come within the purview of excusable neglect 
On October 10, 1951, plaintiff moved to have a date set for the reception of 
evidence in support of her case; hearing was set for October 12, 1951, and after 
plaintiff had presented her evidence, the court below, on January 7, 1952, 
rendered judgment finding her to be the lawful and absolute owner of the land in 
question and enjoining defendant not to molest or disturb her in her ownership 
and possession thereof. On February 12, 1952, defendant moved for the setting 
aside of the court's decision of January 7, 1952, and for a new trial. On March 
4, 1952, defendant filed a suppletory motion, attaching thereto an affidavit 
explaining why she had failed to file an answer to the complaint on time. On 
March 5 and 11, 1952, the court below issued two separate orders denying 
defendant's motion of February 12 and her suppletory motion of March 15, 1952. 
Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, but because all questions raised in 
her appeal are of law, the Court of Appeals forwarded the records to this 
court.</p>
<p>The basic issue is whether or not the lower court committed error in refusing 
to admit defendant's answer and in declaring her in default.</p>
<p>It appears from the records that defendant's failure to file her answer on 
time was due to illness which prevented her from consulting a lawyer about her 
case within the period fixed by law for answer. It also appears that as soon as 
she got well, she wasted no time in putting her case in the hands of counsel, 
who in turn filed an answer promptly enough. These circumstances, which 
plaintiff did not even try to contradict or show to be untrue, constitute 
accident or excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded 
against, and for which defendant-appellant can not be held blamable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If a party is prevented by sickness from preparing his case or attending the 
trial, and the circumstances are such that his personal attention and presence 
are necessary to the due protection of his rights, a judgment against him may be 
set aside on the ground of 'casualty' or 'excusable neglect". (34 C. J. sec. 
537, p. 316).</p></blockquote>
<p>Plaintiff-appellee, on the other hand, was not particularly diligent in the 
exercise of her rights. She moved to have defendant-appellant declared in 
default only on May 2, 1951, more than a month after the statutory period for 
the filing of the answer had expired; and as it turned out, defendant-appellant 
filed her answer the very, next day after plaintiff's motion for default. Hence, 
no prejudice could have been caused to plaintiff by the admission of defendant's 
answer, since the latter had not yet been declared in default and plaintiff had 
not yet presented her evidence on the merits. The lower court, therefore, in the 
exercise of its discretion, should have admitted defendant's answer instead of 
declaring her in default.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellee argues that as held in Duran vs. Arboleda, 20 Phil., 253, 
and Inchausti &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. De Leon, 24 Phil., 224, a defendant is in 
default by operation of law when he fails to answer within the time prescribed, 
and the plaintiff may proceed to prove his case without further notice. There is 
no question that the defendant who fails to answer on time is already in default 
and not entitled to any further notice of the proceedings; but the rule is 
settled that the courts have the discretion to admit or not to admit an answer 
filed out of time, depending on the circumstances of each case, to the end that 
justice may be done (Unson <em>vs</em>. Abrera, 14 Phil. 147; Bañares 
<em>vs</em>. Flordeliza, 51 Phil., 786).</p>
<p>There is still another reason why, in the interest of justice, 
defendant-appellant should have been given her day in court. It appears from the 
records that she has a good and valid defense to plaintiff's action, so that the 
lower court should have been liberal in admitting her answer. According to the 
evidence for the plaintiff, she and her brother Francisco Castañeda inherited 
the land in question from their deceased father sometime in 1943 (Rec. App., p. 
55); that they had partitioned said land verbally and had taken possession of 
their respective portions; and that the land now in question was the portion 
adjudicated to plaintiff in the oral partition. Defendant-appellant's defense to 
the complaint, upon the other hand, is based on a deed of sale of the same land 
dscribed in the complaint (Annex A of the answer, Rec. App., pp. 13-15) executed 
in her favor in May, 1946, by plaintiff's brother Francisco Castañeda. The 
transcript of plaintiff's testimonial evidence discloses that her brother 
Francisco expressly admitted having signed said deed, although he allegedly was 
merely intimidated into so doing by the defendant (t. s. n. pp. 15-16). However, 
Francisco Castañeda made this allegation of intimidation without fear of 
contradiction from the defendant-appellant, who was not in court during the 
trial because she had been declared in default. There is thus the probability 
that if defendant had been given her day in court and allowed to present 
evidence to substantiate her defense, she might have succeeded in proving that 
Francisco Castañeda signed the deed of sale in her favor freely and voluntarily. 
Considering that the oral partition between plaintiff and her brother was not 
binding on third persons, including therein defendant-appellant, the latter 
would, in virtue of the conveyance made to her by Francisco, be entitled to the 
ownership of an undivided half portion of the whole land. which corresponds to 
Francisco's share therein.</p>
<p>Considering that the late filing of appellant's answer was uncontrovertedly 
due to illness, constituting accident over which she had no control; that she 
appears to have a meritorious defense; and that the filing of her answer only 
one day after the motion to declare her in default did not deprive the plaintiff 
of any substantial right, nor is there evidence of intent to unduly delay the 
case, we hold that the lower court committed error in refusing to admit 
defendant-appellant's answer and in declaring her in default.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is set aside, and the lower court is 
ordered to admit defendant-appellant's answer and set the case for trial anew, 
after which another judgment should be rendered upon the evidence presented by 
both parties. Costs against the plaintiff-appellee.</p>

<p><em>Judgment set aside.</em></p></div>
