				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(<em>a</em>) Ordering the defendant Eliseo Barbosa to pay  to the Court, for the benefit of the plaintiff within a period of ninety (90) days from receipt by  the defendant hereof,  the  sum of P2,889.53, with interest at the rate of  12% per annum computed on  the  basis of the amounts of the instalments mentioned in the  mortgage and of the dates they respectively fell due, until fully paid;  the  sum of P200 by way of attorney's fees, plus costs; and (<em>b</em>)  Upon failure of the defendant to pay as aforesaid, ordering  the land described in. the complaint and subject of the mortgage to be sold at public auction in accordance with law in order  to realize the amount of the judgment debt and costs"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although originally forwarded to  the Court of Appeals, the same has certified  the record to this  Court in view of the fact that the issues raised in the appeal involve merely questions of law.</p>
<p>Plaintiff, Southern  Motors,  Inc.,  brought this  action against Eliseo  Barbosa, to foreclose a real estate mortgage, constituted by the latter in favor of the former, as security for the payment of  the sum of P2,889.53 due to said plaintiff from one Alfredo  Brillantes, who had failed  to  settle his obligation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the corresponding deed of mortgage.   Defendant Eliseo Barbosa filed  an answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and alleging, by way of "special and affirmative" defense:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the defendant herein has executed the  deed of mortgage Annex A for the only purpose  of guaranteeing—as surety and/or guarantor—the payment of the above mentioned debt of Mr. Alfredo Brillante&amp; in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>"That the plaintiff until now has no right  action against  the herein defendant on  the ground that said plaintiff, without motive whatsoever, did not  intent or intents to exhaust all recourses  to collect from the true debtor Mr.  Alfredo Brillantes the debt contracted by the latter in favor of  said plaintiff,  and did not resort nor intends to resort all the legal remedies against the true debtor Mr. Alfredo Brillantes, notwithstanding the fact that said Mr. Alfredo Brillantes is solvent and has many properties within  the Province of Iloilo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, plaintiff moved for summary judgment which a branch of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, presided over by Hon. Roman Ibanez, Judge, denied upon the ground that it "is premature" Plaintiff moved for a reconsideration of the order to this effect.  Soon later, he filed,  also, another motion  praying that the  case  be transferred to another branch  of said court, because that of Judge Ibanez would be busy trying cadastral cases, and had adopted the  "policy of  refraining  from entertaining  any  other civil  cases and  all  incidents related thereto, until after said  cadastral cases  shall have been  finally disposed of." With  the express authority  of Judge Ibanez, the  case was  referred  to the branch of said  court, presided  over by  Hon.  Querube  C. Makalintal,  Judge, for  action, upon said  motion for reconsideration.   Thereafter, Judge Makalintal rendered the aforementioned decision, from which the defendant has appealed.  He maintains,  in his brief, that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The trial court erred in hearing plaintiff-appellee's 'motion  for reconsideration' dated June 9, 1951, notwithstanding  the fact that defendant-appellant was not served with  a  copy thereof nor served with notice of the hearing thereof.</p>
  <p>2. "The trial court erred in rendering a judgment on the pleadings' in appellee's favor when no issue was  at all  submitted to it for resolution, to the prejudice of the substantial  rights of appellant. </p>
  <p>3. "The court a  quo  erred in  depriving defendant-appellant of his property rights without due process of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error is based upon  an erroneous predicate, for, contrary to defendant's assertion, his counsel in the lower court, Atty. Manuel F. Zamora through an employee of his office, by the name of Agripino Aguilar, was actually served on June 9,1951, with copy of plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, with notice to the effect that said motion would be submitted for the consideration and approval of the lower court, on Saturday, June 16, 1951, at 8:00 a.m., or soon thereafter as counsel may be heard.</p>
<p>The second assignment of  error is, likewise, untenable. It is not true that there was  no issue submitted for determination by the lower court when  it rendered the decision appealed from.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that each one of the allegations made in plaintiff's complaint were expressly admitted in defendant's answer, in which he merely  alleged, as "special and affirmative" defense,, that plaintiff is not entitled to  foreclose the mortgage constituted in its favor by the defendant, because the property  of Alfredo Brillantes,  the principal debtors, had not been exhausted as yet, and were not sought to be exhausted, for the satisfaction of plaintiff's credit.  Thus,  there  was an question of fact left for determination. The only issue set up by the pleadings was the sufficiency of said affirmative defense.  And such was the only point discussed by the defendant in  his opposition to plaintiff's  motion for  a summary judgment, referring, evidently, to a judgment on the pleadings.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of  the order of Judge Roman Ibanez refusing to render  said  judgment, upon the ground that it was  premature,  revived said issue of sufficiency of the aforementioned affirmative defense, apart from  calling for a  reexamination of the question posed by said order of Judge Ibañez, namely, whether it was proper,  under  the circumstances, to render a judgment on the pleadings.  In  other words,  said motion for reconsideration had £he effect of placing before then Judge Makalintal,  for resolution,  the  following issues, to  wit: (1)  whether a summary judgment or a  judgment on the pleadings  was in  order, considering, the allegations  of plaintiff's complaint and those of defendant's answer; and (2)  whether the' mortgage in question could be foreclosed although plaintiff had not exhausted, and  did not intend to exhaust, the properties of his  principal  debtor, Alfredo Brillantes.</p>
<p>The third  assignment of  error is  predicated  upon  the alleged lack of notice of the hearing of plaintiff's motion for  reconsideration.  As stated in our discussion of  th6 first assignment  of error, this, pretense is refuted by the record.  Moreover, it is obvious that defendant's affirmative defense is  devoid of merit  for:</p>
<p>1. The deed of mortgage executed by him specifically provides: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That if  said Mr.  Alfredo Brillantes or herein mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators and  assigns shall  well  and trolly perform the full obligations  above-stated  according  to the terms thereof, then  this mortgage shall  be null  and  void, otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect, in which event herein mortgagor authorizes and empowers herein mortgagee-company to tab any of the following actions to enforce said payment;  '</p>
  <p>"(<em>a</em>) Foreclose, judicially or extrajudicially, the chattel mortgage above referred to and/or also this mortgage, applying the proceeds of the purchase price at public sale of the real  property herein mortgaged to  any  deficiency or difference between   the purchase price of said chattel at public auction and  the amount of P2,889.53, together with  its  interest  hereby secured;  or</p>
  <p>"(<em>b</em>) Simply  foreclose  this  mortgage  judicially  in  accordance with the provisions of section 2, Rule 70, Rules of Court, or extra-judicially under the provisions of Act No.  3135 and  Act No.  4118, to satisfy the  full  amount of  P2,889.53, together with its interest of 12  per  cent per  annum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. The right  of  guarantors, under Article 2058 of the Civil Code  of the Philippines, to  demand exhaustion of the property  of the  principal debtor,  exists only when a pledge or a mortgage has not been given as special security for the payment of the principal obligation.  Guarantees, without  any  such  pledge or mortgage,  are governed by Title XV of  said  Code, whereas pledges  and  mortgages fall  under Title XVI of the same Code,  in which the following provisions,  among others, are found:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Art. 2087.  "It is also of the essence of these contracts that when the principal  obligation becomes due, the things in which the  pledge or mortgage  consists may be alienated for the payment to the creditor."</p>
  <p>Art. 2126.  "The mortgage directly and immediately  subjects the property upon which  it is imposed, whoever the  possessor may be, to the fulfillment  of the obligation for whose security it was constituted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. It has been held already (Saavedra vs. Price, 68  Phil., 688), that a mortgagor is not entitled  to the exhaustion of the  property of the principal  debtor.</p>
<p>4. Although an ordinary personal guarantor—not a mortgagor or pledgor—may demand the aforementioned exhaustion, the creditor may, prior thereto, secure a judgment against said guarantor, who shall be entitled, however, to a deferment of the execution of said judgment against him until after  the properties of the principal debtor shall have been exhausted to satisfy the obligation involved in the  case.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the  decision  appealed from  is hereby affirmed,  with costs  against  the  defendant-appellant.  It is so  ordered.</p>
