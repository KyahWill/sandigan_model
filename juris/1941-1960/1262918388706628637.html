				<H3>ROSARIO VALERA, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND, JUAN VALERA, PETITIONERS, VS. MARIANO TUASON, JR., JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF LAGAYAN, ABRA, MANUEL TULLAS ET AL., REPONDENTS AND APPELLEES. THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL, INTERVENOR AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Abra 
dismissing a petition for certiorari. 
<p>It results that a complaint for forcible entry was filed in the justice of 
the peace court of Lagayan over which Judge Federico Paredes presided. Finding 
himself disqualified, by reason of relationship to one of the parties, to try 
the case, Judge Paredes transferred it to the justice of the peace of La Paz, 
the nearest municipality to Lagayan. The latter justice of the peace, over the 
objection of the attorney for the defendants, proceeded with the trial, after 
which he gave judgment for the plaintiff and returned the record of the case 
with his decision to the justice of the peace of Lagayan. In the meantime, a new 
justice of the peace had been appointed for Lagayan— Mariano B. Tuason, one of 
the respondents in the petition for certiorari. After the case was received in 
the court of the justice of the peace of Lagayan, the defendants moved for a new 
trial impeaching the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace of La Paz. The new 
justice of the peace of Lagayan found the challenge well founded, declared the 
judgment null and void, and ordered the case reset for hearing before him. </p>
<p>The Lagayan justice's ground for unvalidating the decision of the justice of 
the peace of La Paz is that "the designation of another justice of the peace to 
hear, try and decide a given case, when the justice having jurisdiction to hear, 
try and decide the same disqualifies himself, is not in law given to the 
disqualiying justice but 'to the judge of the district' who 'shall designate the 
nearest justice of the peace.' (Section 211, Rev. Adm. Code)." He believes that 
the circular of the Secretary of Justice of January 17, 1940, in pursuance of 
which the case was transfered, is legally wrong. (The circular states that "when 
a justice of the peace is merely disqualified to try a certain case, he should 
transmit, without notifying the district judge, the record thereof to the 
justice of the peace of the nearest municipality in accordance with section 73 
of the Code of Civil Procedure".) </p>
<p>The annulment by the newly-appointed justice of the peace of Lagayan of the 
proceedings before the justice of the peace of La Paz and the latter's decision 
was sustained on appeal by Honorable Patricio Ceniza, Judge of the Court of 
First Instance, but on a different ground. Judge Ceniza does not agree that 
section 211 of the Revised Administrative Code has repealed section 73 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190.) He is of the opinion that it is the new 
Rules of Court which have abrogated the last-named section. </p>
<p>Section 73 of Act No. 190 as amended provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every case, whether civil or criminal, of disqualification of a justice of 
the peace upon any ground mentioned in section eight of this Act, the regular 
justice shall notify the auxilliary, who shall thereupon appear and try the 
cause, unless he shall be likewise disqualified or otherwise disabled, in which 
event the cause shall be transferred to the nearest justice of the peace of the 
province who is not disqualified. </p></blockquote>
<p>Section 211 of the Revised Administrative Code provides : </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Auxilliary justice—Qualifications and duties.</em>—The auxilliary justice 
of the peace shall have the same qualifications and be subject to the same 
restrictions as the regular justice, and shall perform the duties of said office 
during any vacancy therein or in case of the absence of the regular justice from 
the municipality, or of his disability or disqualification, or in case of his 
death or resignation until the appointment and qualification of his successor, 
or in any cause whose immediate trial the regular justice shall certify to be 
specially urgent and which he is unable to try by reason of actual engagement in 
another trial.</p>
<p>In case there is no auxilliary justice of the peace to perform the duties of 
the regular justice in the cases above mentioned, the judge of the district 
shall designate the nearest justice of the peace of the province to act as 
justice of the peace in such municipality, town, or place, in which case the 
justice of the peace so designated shall have jurisdiction and shall receive the 
total of his own salary and seventy-five per centum of the salary of the justice 
of the peace whom he may substitute. </p></blockquote>
<p>One of the well-established rules of statutory construction enjoins that 
endeavor should be made to harmonize the provisions of a law or of two laws so 
that each shall be effective. In order that one law may operate to repeal 
another law, the two laws must actually be inconsistent. The former must be so 
repugnant as to be irreconciliable with the latter act. (U.S. <em>vs</em>. 
Palacios, 33 Phil., 208.) Merely because a later enactment may relate to the 
same subject matter as that of an earlier statute is not of itself sufficient to 
cause an implied repeal of the latter, since the new law may be cumulative or a 
continuation of the old one. (Statutory Construction, Crawford, p. 634.) </p>
<p>The above-quoted provisions can stand together. By a fair and reasonable 
construction, section 73 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended, may be said 
to apply to disqualifications under section 8 of that Act, and section 211 of 
the Revised Administrative Code to disqualifications or disabilities not 
embraced in the Code of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p>From another angle the presumption against repeal is stronger. A special law 
is not regarded as having been amended or repealed by a general law unless the 
intent to repeal or alter is manifest. <em>Generalia specialibus non 
derogant</em>. And this is true although the terms of the general act are broad 
enough to include the matter in the special statute. (Manila Railroad Company 
<em>vs</em>. Rafferty, 40 Phil., 224.) At any rate, in the event harmony between 
provisions of this type in the same law or in two laws is impossible, the 
specific provision controls unless the statute, considered in its entirety, 
indicates a contrary intention upon the part of the legislature. Granting then 
that the two laws can not be reconciled, in so far as they are inconsistent with 
each other, section 73 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being a specific law, 
should prevail over, or be considered as an exception to, section 211 of the 
Administrative Code, which is a provision of general character. A general law is 
one which embraces a class of subjects or places and does not omit any subject 
or place naturally belonging to such class, while a special act is one which 
relates to particular persons or things of a class. (Statutory Construction, 
Crawford, p. 265.) </p>
<p>But the history of the two laws gives positive indication that they were 
designed to complement each other. This history reveals that the two enactments 
have different origins, one independent of the other, and have been intended to 
operate side by side. This intent is apparent from the fact that, in their 
respective process of evolution, they, at one time, in Act No. 1627, met and 
were lodged in adjoining sections—7 and 8—each maintaining a separate and 
independent identity; and while, later, section 7 of Act No. 1627 was amended by 
section 3 of Act No. 1741, section 8 was given a different direction by being 
amended by another law, section 1 of Act 1888. We further note that the final 
section of the Administrative Code expressly repealed section 7 of Act 1627 and 
the entire Act 1741 but made no reference whatever to section 73 of Act 190, 
section 8 of Act. 1627, or section 1 of Act 1888. The purpose to keep both laws 
in force and subsisting can find no clearer proof than this unless it be an 
express declaration of intention. </p>
<p>For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs, Judge Ceniza's opinion 
that the Rules of Court have replaced and absorbed section 73 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure is clearly erroneous. It may be said that there is less reason 
to hold that this section has been impliedly repealed by the Rules of Court than 
that it has been abrogated by section 211 of the Revised Administrative Code; 
for the authority of a judge to try a case is a matter of substantive law, not 
embraced by the purposes and scope of the Rules of Court, which concern 
"pleading, practice and procedure in all courts of the Philippines, and the 
admission to the practice of law therein." (Introductory section of the Rules of 
Court.) </p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is reversed with costs against the appellee.
