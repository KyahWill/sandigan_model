Manila in Special Proceedings? No. 9226, denying appellant's petition therein as 
hereafter discussed.
<p>Briefly, the facts and circumstances that brought about this present appeal 
may be narrated as follows:</p>
<p>Benigno Diaz executed a codicil on September 29, 1944, the pertinent 
provisions of which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"9.o-En caso de muerte de alguno o de todos los legatarios nom bradbs por mi, 
seran beneficiarios o sea pasaran los legados a favor solamente de los 
descendientes y ascendientes legitimos, pero no a los viudos conyuges.</p>
<p>10.o-Transcurridos diez o quince aiios despues de mi muerte todas mis 
propiedades, muebles o immiebles, derechos y acciones, cuando asi convenga a los 
legatarios y los precios sean ventajosos, pueden proceder a la venta de todos 
dando preferencia a los legatarios y de su importe total se deduciran mil pesos 
(fl,000) para los cuatro hijos de mi difunto hermano Fabian, todos los gastos y 
reservando una cantidad suficiente y bien calculada para sufragar los gastos 
para otros diez anos para las mandas y misas. El resto se distribuira a las 
siguientes personas que aun viven, o a sus descendientes legitimos;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Isabel M. de Santiago-cincuenta por ciento (50%) <br>Los hijos de Domingo 
Legarda-treinta por ciento (30%) <br>Filomena Diaz-diez por ciento (10%) 
<br>Nestor M. Santiago-diez por ciento (10%)."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On November 7, 1944, Benigno Diaz died; and the aforesaid codicil, together 
with the will, was admitted to probate in Special Proceedings No. 894 of the 
same Court of First Instance of Manila. The proceedings for the administration 
of the estate of Benigno Diaz were closed in 1950 and the estate was thereafter 
put under the administration of the appellee Bank of the Philippine Islands, as 
trustee for the benefit of the legatees.</p>
<p>Filomena Diaz died on February 8, 1954, leaving two legitimate children, 
Milagros Belen de Olaguera, married, [with seven (7) legitimate children, and 
Onesima D. Belen, single.</p>
<p>On March 19, 1958, Onesima D. Belen filed a petition in Special Proceedings 
No. 9226, contending that the amount that would have appertained to Filomena 
Diaz under the codicil should now be divided (equally) only between herself and 
Milagros Belen de Olaguera, as the surviving children of the said deceased, to 
the exclusion, in other words, of the seven (7) legitimate children of Milagros 
Belen de Olaguera. The court, in its order of May 23, 1958, denied, as we 
initially pointed out, Onesima's petition. More specifically, the court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After due consideration of the petition filed by Onesima D. Belen on March 
19, 1958, wherein it is prayed that the trustee Bank of the Philippine Islands 
be directed to deliver to her 'one-half of whatever share is due to the deceased 
Filomena Diaz as legatee in the will and codicil of the deceased testator 
Benigno Diaz y Heredia, subject of trusteeship in these proceedings,' this Court 
finds that said petition should be, as it is hereby, denied in view of the 
resolution of September 28, 1959, in which resolution the following was 
declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'That the share of Filomena Diaz in the residue of the proceeds of the sale 
of the properties covered in paragraph 10 of the codicil aforementioned does not 
and should not form part of her estate; it pertains to her legitimate 
descendants; and</p>
<p>'That the aforesaid share of Filomena Diaz should be distributed not only 
between her children, Milagros Belen de Olaguera and Onesima D. Belen, but also 
among her other legitimate descendants, if any, for descendientes include not 
only children but also grandchildren, etc., and in this connection, it is not 
amiss to observe that one may be a descendant and yet not be an heir, and vice 
versa, one may be an heir and yet not be a 
descendant."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>From this order Onesima D. Belen has appealed to this Court, insisting that 
(1) the Court below was in error in holding that its former resolution of 
September 16, 1955 bad been affirmed by our decision of February 28, 1958 in the 
case of Arguelles <em>vs</em>. Belen de Olaguera, G.R. No. L-10164 Feb. 28, 
1958; and (2) that the term <em>"sus descendientes legitimos"</em> as used in 
the codicil, should be interpreted to mean descendants nearest in degree to the 
original legatee Filomena Diaz. In the present case, they are her two daughters 
(Milagros and Onesima Belen), thereby excluding the seven grandchildren of said 
legatee.</p>
<p>As to her first point, the appellant is correct in her view that the trial 
court's interpretation of clause 10 of the codicil to the will of Benigno Diaz 
has not been affirmed in our previous decision (G. R. No. L-10164). Perusal of 
that judgment will show that this Court left the issue open at the time, 
contenting itself with pointing out tjiat the then appellant Administrator of 
the estate of Filomena Diaz was not the proper party to raise the particular 
issue.</p>
<p>As to the actual meaning of the provision-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"El resto se distribuira a las siguientes personas que aun viven, o a sus 
descendientes legitimos",</p></blockquote>
<p>it is undeniable that by this clause the testator ordained a simple 
substitution (<em>sustitucion vulgar</em>) with a plurality of substitutes for 
each legatee. This form of substitution is authorized by the first part of 
Article 860 of the Civil Code (Art. 778 of the Code of 1889):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two or more persons may be substituted for one; and one person for two or 
more heirs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue is now squarely btefore us: do the words "sus descendientes 
legitimos" refer conjointly to all living descendants (children and 
grandchildren) of the legatee, as a class; or.do they refer to the descendants 
nearest in degree?</p>
<p>Appellant Onesima Belen contends that the phrase should be taken to mean the 
relatives nearest in degree to Filomena Diaz; and that the legacy should be 
therefore divided equally between her and her sister Milagros Belen de Olaguera, 
to the exclusion of the latter's sons and daughters, grandchildren of the 
original legatee, Filomena Diaz. As authority in support of her thesis, 
appellant invokes Article 959 of the Civil Code of the Philippines (reproducing 
<em>ne varietur</em> Article 751 of the Code of 1889):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A distribution made in general terms in favor of the testator's relatives 
shall be understood as made in favor of those nearest in 
degree."</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument fails to note that this article is specifically limited in its 
application to the case where the beneficiaries are relatives <em>of the 
testator</em>, not those of the legatee. In such an event, the law assumes that 
the testator intended to refer to the rules of intestacy, in order to benefit 
the relatives closest to him, because, as Manresa observes,-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"la razon y la logica hacen fundadamente suponer que, al procurar este 
favorecer a sus parientes, habria de ajustarse mas a su intention el que gozasen 
sus bienes aquellas personas mas ligadas al mismo (testador) por los vineulos de 
la sangre y de la familia" (6 Manresa, Comm., 7th Ed., p. 72).</p></blockquote>
<p>But the <em>ratio legis</em> (that among a testator's relatives the closest 
are dearest) obviously does not apply where the beneficiaries are relatives of 
<em>another person</em> (the legatee) and not of the testator. There is no 
logical reason in this case to presume that the testator intended to refer to 
the rules of intestacy, for he precisely made a testament and provided 
substitutes for each legatee; nor can it be said that his affections would 
prefer the nearest relatives of the legatee to those more distant, since he 
envisages all of them in a group, and only as mere substitutes for a preferred 
beneficiary.</p>
<p>Should Article 959 (old Art. 751) be applied by analogy? There are various 
reasons against this. The most important one is that under this article, as 
recognized by the principal commentators on the Code of 1889, the nearest 
exclude all the farther relatives and the right of representation does not 
operate. Castan, in his monograph "El derecho de representacion y mecanismos 
juridicos afines en la sucesion testamentaria" (Reus, 1942), says on this 
question (pp. 13, 14, 15):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"En el subgrupo iberico de Europa y America predomina, aunque haya 
excepciones, como ya hemos visto, al criterio de que la representation, cuando 
menos en principio, no tiene cabida en la sucesion testamentaria. Asi, por 
ejemplo, lo establece la doctrina cientffica en Portugal y en la Argentina y lo 
ha sancionado la jurisprudencia en Cuba.</p>
<p>En igual sentido, en la doctrinji espanola es opinion general que el derecho 
de representacion, dentro del Codigo civil, no tiene lugar mas que en la 
sucesion intestada, y en la testamentaria en la parte referente a las legitimas. 
MUCius SCAevola juzga que la representacion, atraida por la herencia legitima, 
es repelida por la testada, y apunta, como razon de ello, la de que 'la primer a 
descansa en la ley de la sangre, en el parentesco con su consiguiente atributo 
de linea y grado, elementos propios c indispensables para la representaeion, en 
tanto que la segunda se basa exclusivamente en la voluntad del testador, 
elemento diverso, en el orden legal, al de la naturaleza o de la sangre'. Y el 
maestro de diego, con orientacion analoga, piensa que 'como el titulo de la 
sucesion testada es de origen voluntario y caracter personalisimo, es evidente 
que no hay terminos habiles para el derecho de representacion: los llamamientos 
son individuales y la premoriencia del instituido, como su incapacidad, 
aniquilan la institution'</p></blockquote>
<p>In the second place, the history of Article 751 (of the 1889 Code) shows that 
the right of representation was <em>deliberately</em> suppressed. Says Castan 
(op. cit., 24):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"En nuestra Patria opino gaecia goyena 'que debia tener lugar el derecho de 
representacion aun cuando el testador llame a los parientes mas cercanos", pues 
'en lo que no se contraria abiertamente la voluntad del testador, debe 
observarse el orden de la sucesion legitima, al que se presume que en todo lo 
demas quiso atemperarse'. Por ello, el art. 562 Proyecto de 1851 quedo redactado 
asi: "La disposition hecha simple y generalmente a favor de los parientes del 
testador, se entiende hecha en favor de los mas proximos en grado; pero habra 
lugar al derecho de representation con todos sus efectos, con arreglo al titulo 
siguiente'.</p>
<p>Con poco acierto, a nuestro juicio, los autores del vigente Codigo han 
suprhnido e?ta ultima salvedad del Proyecto del 51, y con ello han instaurado 
una norma rigida, distanciada de lo que exige la equidad y de lo que suelen 
establecer los Codigos extranjeros. Los com-mentaristas convienen en que la 
supresion ha sido intencionada, y por consiguiente el proposito del legislador 
es que en esta clase de llamamientos no se da el derecho de representaci6n. Dice 
Manresa que el art. 751 'tiene por favorecidos con tal institucion, no a los 
parientes de mejor derecho, sino a los mas proximos en grado y, por lo tanto, 
los de primer grado excluiran a los de segundo y, asi sucesivamente, toda vez 
que la proximidad del parentesco se aprecia en esta forma con arreglo al art. 
915'. La misma interpretacion dan al articulo de referencia NAVARRO AMANDI, 
MUCIUS SCAEVOLA, SANCHEZ ROMAN y VALVERDE."</p></blockquote>
<p>The result would be that by applying to the descendants of Filomena Diaz the 
"nearest relatives" rule of Article 959, the inheritance would be limited to her 
children, or anyone of them, excluding the grandchildren altogether. This could 
hardly be the intention of the testator who, in the selfsame clause 10 of his 
codicil (ante), speaks of "cuatro <em>hijos</em> de mi difunto hermano Fabian" 
and of "los hijos de Domingo Legarda," as well as of "descendientes legitimos" 
of the other legatees, to us indicating clearly that he understood well that 
<em>hijos</em> and <em>descendientes</em> are not synonymous terms. Observe 
that, in referring to the substitutes of Filomena Diaz, Nestor Santiago and 
Isabel M. de Santiago, the testator, does not even use the description "sus 
hijos 6 descendientes," but only "descendientes". </p>
<p>It is suggested that "descendientes legitimos" could mean the nearest 
descendant but with right of representation in favor of the more distant 
relatives. Unquestionably, the testator was at liberty to provide a series of 
successive substitutions in the order of proximity of relationship to the 
original legatee. And he, likewise, was free to ordain that the more distant 
descendants should enjoy the right of representation as in intestate succession. 
But to arrive at such conclusion, we must declare that the testator had: </p>
<p>(a) Rejected, or intended to reject, the right of accretion among co-heirs 
and co-legatees, as established for testamentary successions by Articles 1016 
(old Art. 982) and 1019, and intended to replace such accretion with 
representation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1016. In order that the right of accretion may take place in a 
testamentary succession, it shall be necessary:</p>
<p>(1) That two or more persons he called to the same inheritance, or to the 
same portion thereof, pro indiviso; and</p>
<p>(2) That one of the persons thus called die before the testator or renounce 
the inheritance, or be incapacitated to receive it.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Art. 1019. The heirs to whom th^ portion goes by the right of accretion take 
it in the same proportion that they inherit."</p></blockquote>
<p>(b) Refused, likewise, the rule of Article 846 (reproduced from Article 765 
of the Code of 1889) providing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Heirs instituted without designation of shares shall inherit- in equal 
parts",</p></blockquote>
<p>which would not obtain if the right of representation were to apply;</p>
<p>(c) Rejected finally the rule of Article 1022 (old Art. 986), that vacancies 
in the free part should be filled according to the rules of accretion, or 
substitution (not representation); and in default of these two, ultimately 
inherited by the testator's own heirs intestate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1022. In testamentary succession, when the right of accretion does not 
take place, the vacant portion of the instituted heirs, if no substitute has 
been designated, shall pass to the legal heirs of the testator, who shall 
receive it with the same charges and obligations."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that, the testator's intention being the cardinal rule of 
succession in the absence of compulsory (forced) heirs, he could have rendered 
inoperative all the articles mentioned, if he had so desired. But without any 
other supporting circumstances, we deem it extremely conjectural to hold that by 
the simple expression "6 a sus descendientes legitimos," the testator Benigno 
Diaz did intend to circumvent all the legal provisions heretofore quoted. It was 
incumbent upon appellant to prove such intention on the part of the testator; 
yet she has not done so.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that even under the Anglo-Saxon doctrine, the 
courts are divided on the question whe&amp;er a bequest to "relatives" or 
"issue," made in genera] terms, gives rise to a succession <em>per capita</em> 
or <em>per stirpes</em>. In Wyeth, et al., <em>vs</em>. Crane, 174 N.E. 871, the 
Supreme Court of Illinois said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The meaning of the word 'descendants', when used in a will or deed to 
designate a class to take property passing by the will or deed, has been 
frequently considered and decided by the courts of England and the United 
States. The established rule in England from an early date was that the word 
'descendants' or the word 'issue', unexplained by anything in the context of the 
instrument, means all persons descending lineally from another, to the remotest 
degree, and includes persons so descended, even though their parents are living, 
and that such descendants take per capita and not per stirpes."</p>
<p>"The courts of this country <em>are divided on the question of</em> whether 
in case of a gift or conveyance to 'descendants' or 'issue', children take 
concurrently with their parents. The so-called' English rule has been adhered to 
in New York, New Jersey, and Tennessee. * * * On the other hand, the courts of 
Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and South Carolina have held that, in case of 
a gift or conveyance to descendants or issue, unexplained by anything in the 
context of the instrument, children do not take concurrently with their 
parents."</p></blockquote>
<p>We conclude that in the absence of other indications of contrary intent, the 
proper rule to apply in the instant case is that the testator, by designating a 
class or group of legatees, intended all members thereof to succeed <em>per 
capita</em>, in consonance with article 846. So that the original legacy to 
Filomena Diaz should be equally divided among her surviving children and 
grandchildren.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs to the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Gutierrez 
David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed.</em></p></div>
