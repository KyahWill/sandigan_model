				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is a petition for&nbsp; certiorari and&nbsp; prohibition with preliminary injunction filed&nbsp; by Timoteo&nbsp; V. Cruz against Francisco G. H. Salva, in his capacity as City Fiscal of Pasay City,&nbsp; to restrain&nbsp; him&nbsp; from&nbsp; continuing with&nbsp; the preliminary investigation&nbsp; he&nbsp; was conducting in September, 1957&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; with the&nbsp; killing of&nbsp; Manuel Monroy which took place&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 15, 1953 in&nbsp; Pasay City.&nbsp; To better understand the present&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; its implications, the following facts&nbsp; gathered from the pleadings and&nbsp; the memoranda filed by&nbsp; the parties, may be stated. <br><br>Following the killing&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manuel Monroy&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1953 a number of persons were accused as involved and implicated in said crime.&nbsp; After&nbsp; a&nbsp; long trial, the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Pasay&nbsp; City&nbsp; found Oscar&nbsp; Castelo,&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; de Jesus, Hipolito Bonifacio, Bienvenido Mendoza, Francis Berdugo and&nbsp; others guilty of the crime of&nbsp; murder and sentenced them to death.&nbsp; They all appealed the&nbsp; sentence although without said appeal, in&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; imposition of the extreme penalty, the case would have to be reviewed automatically by this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oscar Castelo sought a new trial which was granted&nbsp; and upon&nbsp; retrial, he&nbsp; was again found guilty and his&nbsp; former conviction&nbsp; of sentence was affirmed and reiterated by the same trial&nbsp; court.<br><br>It seems that pending&nbsp; appeal, the late President&nbsp; Magsaysay ordered a reinvestigation of the case.&nbsp; The purpose of&nbsp; said&nbsp; reinvestigation&nbsp; does not&nbsp; appear in the&nbsp; record. Anyway, intelligence agents of the Philippine Constabulary and investigators of Malacañang conducted the investigation for the Chief Executive, questioned a number of people and obtained what would appear to be confession, pointing to persons, other than those convicted and sentenced by the trial court, as the real killers of Manuel Monroy. <br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for Oscar Castelo and&nbsp; his co-defendants wrote to respondent Fiscal Salva to conduct a reinvestigation of the case presumably on the basis of the affidavits and confessions obtained by those who had investigated the case at the instance of Malacañang.&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; Salva conferred with the Solicitor General as to what steps he should take. A conference was held with the Secretary of Justice who decided to have the&nbsp; results of the&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; by the Philippine Constabulary and Malacanang investigators made available to&nbsp; counsel for the appellants. <br><br>Taking advantage of this opportunity, counsel for the appellants&nbsp; filed a motion for new trial with this Tribunal supporting the same with the so-called affidavits and confessions of some of those persons investigated, such as the confessions of Sergio Eduardo y de Guzman, Oscar Caymo, Pablo&nbsp; Canlas, and&nbsp; written&nbsp; statements of several&nbsp; others. By resolution of this Tribunal, action on said motion for new trial&nbsp; was deferred until the case was&nbsp; studied&nbsp; and determined on the&nbsp; merits.&nbsp; In the meantime, the Chief, Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary, had sent to&nbsp; the Office of Fiscal Salva copies of the same affidavits and&nbsp; confessions&nbsp; and written statements, of which the motion for new trial was based, and respondent Salva proceeded to conduct&nbsp; a&nbsp; reinvestigation designating for said&nbsp; purpose a committee of three composed of himself as chairman and Assistant City Attorneys Herminio A. Avendanio and Ernesto A. Bernabe.<br><br>In connection with said preliminary investigation being conducted by the committee, petitioner Timoteo Cruz was subpoenaed by respondent to appear at his office on September 21, 1957, to testify: "upon&nbsp; oath&nbsp; before&nbsp; me&nbsp; in&nbsp; a certain criminal investigation to be conducted at that time and place by this office against you and Sergio Eduardo, et al., for murder."&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 19, 1957, petitioner Timoteo&nbsp; Cruz wrote&nbsp; to respondent Salva asking for the transfer&nbsp; of the preliminary investigation from September 21, due to the fact that his counsel, Atty. Crispin Baizas, would attend a&nbsp; hearing on that same day in Naga City. Acting upon said request for postponement,&nbsp; Fiscal Salva set the preliminary investigation&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 24.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that day, Atty. Baizas appeared for petitioner Cruz, questioned the jurisdiction of the committee, particularly respondent Salva, to conduct the preliminary investigation in view&nbsp; of the fact that the same case involving the killing of Manuel Monroy was pending appeal in this Court, and on the same day filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition.&nbsp; This Tribunal gave due course to the petition for certiorari and prohibition and upon the filing of a cash bond&nbsp; of&nbsp; P200.00 issued a&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction thereby stopping the preliminary investigation being conducted by respondent Salva. <br><br>The connection, if any, that petitioner Cruz had&nbsp; with the preliminary investigation being&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent Salva and his committee was that the affidavits and confessions&nbsp; sent to Salva by the Chief, Philippine Constabulary, and which were being investigated, implicated petitioner Cruz, even picturing him as the instigator and&nbsp; mastermind in the killing of&nbsp; Manuel Monroy.<br><br>The position taken by petitioner Cruz in this case is that inasmuch as the principal case of People vs, Oscar Castelo, et al., G. R. No. L-10794, is pending appeal and consideration before us,&nbsp; no court, much less a prosecuting attorney like&nbsp; respondent Salva, had any right or&nbsp; authority to conduct&nbsp; a preliminary investigation or&nbsp; reinvestigation of the case&nbsp; for that would be obstructing the administration of justice and interferring with the consideration on appeal of the main case wherein appellants had been found guilty and convicted and&nbsp; sentenced; neither had respondent authority to cite him to appear and testify at said investigation.<br><br>Respondent Salva, however,&nbsp; contends that if he subpoenaed&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Cruz at all, it&nbsp; was because of the latter's oral and personal request to allow&nbsp; him to appear at the investigation with his&nbsp; witnesses for&nbsp; his&nbsp; own protection, possibly, to controvert and rebut any evidence&nbsp; therein presented against&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Salva&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that were it&nbsp; not for this request&nbsp; and&nbsp; if, on the contrary, Timoteo Cruz had expressed any&nbsp; objection to being cited to appear in the investigation) he (Salva) would never have subpoenaed him. <br><br>Although petitioner&nbsp; Cruz now&nbsp; stoutly denies having made such request that he be allowed to appear at the investigation, we are inclined to agree with Fiscal Salva that such a request had been made.&nbsp; Inasmuch as&nbsp; he, Timoteo Cruz, was deeply implicated in the killing&nbsp; of Manuel Monroy by the affidavits and confessions of&nbsp; several&nbsp; persons who were being investigated by Salva and his committee, it was but natural&nbsp; that petitioner&nbsp; should have&nbsp; been interested, even desirous&nbsp; of being present at that investigation&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; could face&nbsp; and&nbsp; cross examine&nbsp; said witnesses and&nbsp; affiants&nbsp; when they testified in connection with&nbsp; their affidavits or confessions, either&nbsp;&nbsp; repudiating,. modifying&nbsp; or ratifying the same.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; in the communication, addressed to respondent Salva asking that the investigation, scheduled for September 21, 1957,&nbsp; be postponed because&nbsp; his attorney would&nbsp; be unable to attend, Timoteo&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; expressed no opposition to the subpoena, not even a hint that he was objecting to his being cited to appear at the investigation.<br><br>As to the right of respondent Salva to conduct the preliminary investigation which he and his committee began, ordinarily, when a criminal case in which a fiscal intervened though nominally, for&nbsp; according to respondent, two government attorneys had been&nbsp; designed&nbsp; by the Secretary of Justice to handle the prosecution in the trial of the case in the court below, is tried and decided and it is&nbsp; appealed to a higher court such as this Tribunal, the functions and actuations&nbsp; of said fiscal have terminated;&nbsp; usually, the appeal is handled for the government by the&nbsp; Office of the Solicitor General.&nbsp; Consequently, there would&nbsp; be no reason or occasion for said fiscal to&nbsp; conduct a reinvestigation to determine criminal responsibility for the crime&nbsp; involved in the appeal. <br><br>However,&nbsp; in the present case,&nbsp; respondent has, in our opinion, established a justification for his&nbsp; reinvestigation because according to&nbsp; him,&nbsp; in the original criminal&nbsp; case against&nbsp; Castelo,&nbsp; et al., one of the defendants named&nbsp; Salvador Realista y de Guzman was not included in&nbsp; the trial much less in&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; for the reason that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was arrested and was placed within the jurisdiction of the trial court only after the&nbsp; trial against the other&nbsp; accused&nbsp; had commenced, even after the prosecution had rested its&nbsp; case and the defense had&nbsp; begun to present its evidence.&nbsp; Naturally,&nbsp; Realista&nbsp; remained to stand trial.&nbsp; The trial court, according to respondent,&nbsp; at the instance of Realista,. had scheduled the hearing at an early date, that is&nbsp; in August, 1957.&nbsp; Respondent claims that before he would&nbsp; go to trial in the prosecution of Realista he&nbsp; had to chart&nbsp; his course and plan of action,&nbsp; whether to present the same evidence, oral and documentary, presented in the original cage and trial, or, in view of&nbsp; the new evidence&nbsp; consisting of the affidavits and&nbsp; confessions sent&nbsp; to him by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Constabulary,&nbsp; he should&nbsp; first assess and&nbsp; determine&nbsp; the value of said evidence by conducting an investigation and that should he be convinced&nbsp; that the persons&nbsp; criminally responsible for the&nbsp; killing of Manuel Monroy were other than those already tried&nbsp; and convicted, like Oscar Castelo and his co-accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; co-appellants, including Salvador Realista, then he might&nbsp; act accordingly and&nbsp; even recommend the dismissal of the case against&nbsp; Realista.<br><br>In this, we are inclined to agree with respondent Salva. For, as&nbsp; contended by&nbsp; him and as suggested by authorities, the duty&nbsp; and role&nbsp; of a prosecuting attorney is not only to&nbsp; prosecute and secure&nbsp; the conviction&nbsp; of the guilty&nbsp; but also to protect&nbsp; the&nbsp; innocent. <br><blockquote>"We cannot overemphasize the necessity of close scrutiny and investigation&nbsp; of prosecuting&nbsp; officers of all cases handled by them,s&nbsp; averse to any form of vacillation by such officers in the prosecution of public offenses, it is unquestionable that they may, in&nbsp; appropriate cases, in order to do&nbsp; justice and avoid in&nbsp; justice, <i>reinvestigate cases</i> in which&nbsp; they have&nbsp; already filed&nbsp; the corresponding informations.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the language of Justice&nbsp; Sutherland of the&nbsp; Supreme Court of the United&nbsp; States, the <i>prosecuting</i> officer&nbsp; "is&nbsp; the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy,&nbsp; but of a sovereignty whose obligation to&nbsp; govern impartially is as compelling&nbsp; as its&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; to govern at all;&nbsp; and&nbsp; whose interest,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; in&nbsp; a criminal&nbsp; prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very&nbsp; definite sense the&nbsp; servant of&nbsp; the law, the twofold aim of which is&nbsp; that <i>guilt shall not escape nor innocent suffer</i>.&nbsp; He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor — indeed, he should do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; But, while he may strike hard blows, he&nbsp; is not at&nbsp; liberty to strike foul ones.; It is as much his duty to&nbsp; refrain from improper&nbsp; methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as&nbsp; it is to&nbsp; use every legitimate means&nbsp; to bring about a just one."&nbsp; (69 United States Law Review, June, 1935, No. 6, p.&nbsp; 309, cited in the case of&nbsp; Suarez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Platon, 69 Phil., 556).<br></blockquote>With respect to&nbsp; the right&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Salva to cite petitioner to appear and testify before him at the scheduled preliminary investigation, under the law,&nbsp; petitioner had a right to be present at that investigation since as was already&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; he was more or&nbsp; less deeply&nbsp; involved and implicated in the killing of Monroy according to the affiants whose confessions,&nbsp; affidavits&nbsp; and&nbsp; testimonies&nbsp; respondent Salva&nbsp; was considering&nbsp; or was to consider at said preliminary&nbsp; investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he need not be present at said investigation because his presence there implies, and was more&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; rather than a&nbsp; duty or legal obligation. Consequently, even if, as&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Salva, petitioner expressed the desire to be given an opportunity to be present at the said&nbsp; investigation, if he later changed his mind&nbsp; and renounced&nbsp; his right, and even strenuously objected to being made to appear at said investigation, he could not be compelled to do so.<br><br>Now we come to the manner in which said investigation was conducted by the respondent.&nbsp; If, as contended by him, the purpose of&nbsp; said&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; was only&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquaint himself with and evaluate the evidence&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the affidavits and confessions of Sergio&nbsp; Eduardo, Cosme Camo and others by&nbsp; questioning&nbsp; them,&nbsp; then&nbsp; he,&nbsp; respondent, could well have conducted the investigation in his office, quietly, unobtrusively and without much&nbsp; fanfare, much less publicity. <br><br>However, according to the petitioner and not denied by the respondent, the investigation was conducted not in respondent's office but in the session hall of the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Pasay City evidently, to accommodate the&nbsp; big crowd&nbsp; that wanted to&nbsp; witness the proceeding,&nbsp; including members&nbsp; of the press.&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of microphones were installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reporters were everywhere and&nbsp; photographers were busy taking pictures.&nbsp; In other words, apparently with the permission of, if not the&nbsp; encouragement&nbsp; by&nbsp; the respondent, news photographers and newsmen had a field day.&nbsp; Not only this, but in the course of the investigation, as&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by the&nbsp; transcript of the stenographic&nbsp; notes taken&nbsp; during said investigation, on two&nbsp; occasions,&nbsp; the first, after&nbsp; Oscar&nbsp; Caymo had&nbsp; concluded&nbsp; his testimony, respondent Salva, addressing the newspapermen said, "Gentlemen of the press,&nbsp; if you&nbsp; want to ask questions I&nbsp; am willing to let you do so and the questions asked will be reproduced as my own"; and the second, after Jose Maratella y de Guzman had finished testifying and respondent Salva,&nbsp; addressing the&nbsp; newsmen, again said, "Gentlemen of the press is free to ask question to the witness if you want to.&nbsp; We are willing to adopt the questions&nbsp; as ours."&nbsp; Why respondent was willing to abdicate and renounce his right and prerogative&nbsp; to make and address the questions to&nbsp; the witnesses under&nbsp; investigation, in favor of the members of the press, is difficult for us to understand, unless&nbsp; he, respondent, wanted to curry favor with&nbsp; the&nbsp; press and publicize his investigation as much as possible.&nbsp; Fortunately, the gentlemen of the press to whom he accorded such unusual&nbsp; privilege&nbsp; and&nbsp; favor appeared&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; wisely and&nbsp; prudently declined&nbsp; the&nbsp; offer&nbsp; and did not ask questions, this according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; transcript now before&nbsp; us. <br><br>But, the newspapers certainly played up and gave wide publicity to what took place&nbsp; during the investigation, and this&nbsp; involved&nbsp; headlines and&nbsp; extensive recitals,&nbsp; narrations of and comments on the testimonies given by the witnesses as well as&nbsp; vivid descriptions of&nbsp; the incidents that took place during the investigation.&nbsp; It seemed as though the criminal responsibility for the killing of Manuel Monroy which had already been tried and finally determined&nbsp; by the lower court and which was&nbsp; under appeal and advisement by this Tribunal,&nbsp; was being retried and redetermined&nbsp; in the&nbsp; press,&nbsp; and&nbsp; all&nbsp; with the apparent&nbsp; placet and complaisance&nbsp; of respondent. <br><br>Frankly,&nbsp; the members of&nbsp; this Court were greatly disturbed and&nbsp; annoyed by such publicity and&nbsp; sensationalism, all of which may properly be laid at the door of respondent Salva.&nbsp; In this, he committed what we regard&nbsp; a&nbsp; grievous error and poor judgment for which we fail to find any excuse or satisfactory&nbsp; explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; His actuations in this regard went well beyond&nbsp; the bounds of prudence, discretion and&nbsp; good taste.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is bad&nbsp; enough to&nbsp; have such&nbsp; undue publicity when&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal case is being investigated by the authorities,&nbsp; even when it is being tried in&nbsp; court; but when said&nbsp; publicity&nbsp; and sensationalism&nbsp; is allowed, even encouraged, when the case&nbsp; is on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; and is pending consideration&nbsp; by this Tribunal, the whole thing becomes inexcusable, even abhorrent,&nbsp; and this Court, in the interest of justice, is&nbsp; constrained and called upon&nbsp; to put an end to it and&nbsp; a deterrent against its repetition by&nbsp; meting an appropriate disciplinary measure,&nbsp; even&nbsp; a&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; to the one liable.<br><br>Some of the members of the Court who appeared to feel more strongly than the others favored the imposition of a more or less severe penal sanction.&nbsp; After mature deliberation,&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; finally&nbsp; agreed that&nbsp; a&nbsp; public&nbsp; censure would, for the present, be&nbsp; sufficient. <br><br>In conclusion,&nbsp; we find and&nbsp; hold that respondent Salva was warranted&nbsp; in holding the preliminary&nbsp; investigation involved in this case, insofar as Salvador Realista is concerned, for which reason the writ of preliminary injunction issued stopping said preliminary investigation, is dissolved; that in view&nbsp; of petitioner's&nbsp; objection to appear and testify at the said investigation, respondent may not compel him to attend said investigation, for which reason, the subpoena issued by respondent against petitioner is hereby set aside.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the petition for certiorari and prohibition is granted&nbsp; in part and denied in part.&nbsp; Considering the&nbsp; conclusion arrived at by us, respondent Francisco G. H.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salva is&nbsp; hereby publicly reprehended and censured for the&nbsp; uncalled for&nbsp; and&nbsp; wide publicity and sensationalism that he had given to and allowed in connection with his investigation,&nbsp; which we consider and find to be contempt of&nbsp; court;&nbsp; and, furthermore,&nbsp; he is warned that a repetition of the same would meet with a more severe&nbsp; disciplinary action and penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
