				<H3>TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED RAYMUNDO MELLIZA Y ANGULO. LAUREANA GABIN, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT, VS. MARIA MELLIZA ET AL., OPPOSITORS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On January 19, 1944, Raymundo Melliza and Laureana Gabin 
entered into a written agreement whereby the former contracted the personal 
services of the latter to administer certain haciendas owned by Raymundo Melliza 
for a period of thirty years from said date, at the option of Laureana Gabin. As 
compensation for said personal services Melliza agreed to pay Gabin 350 cavans 
of palay every agricultural year. It was further stipulated that Laureana Gabin 
cannot be dismissed from the service without just and legal cause during the 
time she cared to serve within the said period of thirty years, and in case of 
dismissal she shall have the right to be indemnified for the rest of the period 
at the rate of 150 cavans of palay for each agricultural year.
<p align="justify">Raymundo Melliza died on December 11, 1945, and testamentary 
proceedings were thereafter instituted in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo 
for the administration and distribution of his estate.</p>
<p align="justify">Having been deprived by the executrix Remedios S. de Villanueva 
of the administration of the haciendas in question, Laureana Gabin presented to 
the probate court a claim against the estate of the deceased Raymundo Melliza 
for the payment to her by the executrix of 150 cavans of palay beginning the 
agricultural year 1945-1946 until the termination of the testamentary 
proceedings, and that thereafter the heir or heirs to whom the haciendas may be 
adjudicated be ordered to pay the claimant the same amount of palay every year 
until the expiration of thirty years from the agricultural year</p>
<p align="justify">The heirs of the deceased opposed said claim on the following 
grounds: (1) That, not being a claim for money, it is not a proper claim under 
section 5 of Rule 87; (2) that the agreement or contract on which it is based is 
one of agency which was terminated by the death of the principal; (3) that 
Raymundo Melliza could not, except by will, dispose of the administration of his 
properties after his death; and (4) that there was no consideration for the 
granting of such administration for 30 years with remuneration.</p>
<p align="justify">The probate court sustained the first ground of the opposition 
and denied the claim. Hence this appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">The question to determine is whether appellant's claim for 150 
cavans of palay a year for the remainder of the thirty-year period mentioned in 
the agreement Exhibit A is a proper claim which may be allowed in the 
testamentary proceedings under Rule 87. Section 1 of said rule provides that 
immediately after the granting of letters testamentary or of administration the 
court shall issue a notice requiring all persons having <i>money claims against 
the decedent</i> to file them in the office of the clerk of said court; and 
section 5 provides that all <i>claims for money against the decedent</i> arising 
from contract, express or implied, whether the same be due, not due, or 
contingent, all claims for funeral expenses and expenses of the last sickness of 
the decedent, and judgment for money against the decedent, must be filed within 
the time limited in the notice, "By money claims, is meant any claim for 'money, 
debt, or interest thereon,' according to section 21 of Rule 3 and section 1 of 
Rule 88. Not all money claims may, however, be presented, but only those which 
are proper against the decedent, that is, claims upon a liability contracted by 
the decedent before his death. Accordingly, claims arising after his death 
cannot thus be presented, except funeral expenses." (Moran on the Rules of 
Court, Volume 2, second edition, p. 347.)</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts and the law involved in this case, we find no 
valid reason to reverse the order appealed from.</p>
<p align="justify">In the first place, the claim in question arose after the death 
of the decedent. Assuming without deciding that the contract on which the claim 
is based is valid, the decedent appears to have complied with it up to the time 
of his death. It was the executrix who dismissed the claimant from the service 
as administratrix or manager of the haciendas of the deceased.</p>
<p align="justify">In the second place, the claim is not for money, debt, or 
interest thereon but for 150 cavans of palay a year for twenty-nine agricultural 
years (one agricultural year having elapsed before the death of Raymundo 
Melliza). Even if it wanted to, the probate court could not determine in advance 
the value of the palay in money because the price of palay varies from year to 
year.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the record that before presenting the claim in 
question the claimant filed a motion in the probate court praying that she be 
appointed coadministratrix of the estate of the deceased on the strength of the 
contract of service hereinabove mentioned. But Judge Blanco denied said motion 
without prejudice to the right of the claimant to present a claim in due form 
against the estate. Appellant now contends in her third assignment of error that 
said order of Judge Blanco not having been appealed from, "the lower court erred 
in not holding that the question of the presentation and admission of the 
claimant's claim has become <i>res judicata</i>." This assignment of error is 
without merit because the mere reservation by Judge Blanco to the claimant of 
her right to present the claim in question in lieu of her appointment as 
coadministratrix of the estate of the deceased did not preclude the court from 
denying said claim if, after hearing, it found the same to be improper or not 
allowable in these proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, without deciding whether or not the contract claimed 
upon is valid and binding against the heirs of the decedent, and without 
prejudice to any proper action that the appellant may bring upon said contract, 
we affirm the order appealed from, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">MORAN, C. J.:</p> I certify that Mr. Justice Bengzon voted to affirm the order 
appealed from.</div>
