				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an action for damages brought before the Court of First Instance of 
Baguio by plaintiffs against defendants on the ground of fraud in the 
preparation and execution of certain indemnity agreement. The complaint contains 
three causes of action: the first is for damages arising from an indemnity 
agreement which was declared null and void in Civil Case No. 279; the second is 
for damages arising from an alleged malicious suit instituted at the instigation 
of defendants (Case No. 293); and the third is for damages arising from 
attachment levied on plaintiffs' properties in Case No. 293.<p></p>
<p>Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds (1) that the 
complaint states no cause of action; and (2) that the alleged causes of action 
are already barred for failure of plaintiffs to set them up as a counterclaim in 
Case No. 279. The court found the motion well founded and dismissed the 
complaint. Plaintiffs appealed the case to the Court of Appeals but the case was 
certified to us on the ground that it involves only questions of law.</p>
<p>The present case is closely related to Civil Cases Nos. 279 and 293 
instituted in 1951 before the Court of First Instance of Baguio. Civil Case No. 
293 was an action instituted by the Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. for 
the collection of a sum of money based upon an indemnity agreement which Julio 
Guari√±o, Patricio Estioco and Lucina V. Siapno executed and delivered to said 
bonding company. It was originally instituted in the Municipal Court of Baguio 
on September 26, 1951, and the said court decided said case in favor of 
plaintiffs and against defendants. From said decision, the said defendants 
appealed to the Court of First Instance of Baguio. While said case was pending 
determination in the Municipal Court of Baguio, Civil Case No. 279 was 
instituted in the Court of First Instance of Baguio by two of the defendants in 
the former case, namely, Patricio Estioco and Lucina V. Siapno, against the Alto 
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. for the annulment of the indemnity agreement 
involved in the former case. These two cases were tried jointly and, on October 
7, 1952, decision was rendered wherein defendants Patricio Estioco and Lucina V. 
Siapno were absolved from the complaint and the indemnity agreement was 
declared, null and void. The case having been appealed to the Court of Appeals , 
the decision ms affirmed. A petition for review on certiorari was dismissed by 
the Supreme Court on November 10, 1954.</p>
<p>The present action is now an offshoot of the dismissal of Civil Case No. 293 
against Patricio Estioco and Lucina V. Siapno and the annulment of the indemnity 
agreement in Civil Case No. 279, and the action is levelled not against the Alto 
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. but against Sinai C. Hamada, who acted as its 
counsel in the two civil cases above-mentioned, Guillermo F. de Guzman, who 
acted as his co-counsel in the same cases, and Leoncio Esquejo, who as Deputy 
Sheriff of Baguio actively intervened in the procurement and execution of the 
indemnity agreement subject matter of litigation in said cases. They are made 
responsible for damages for their alleged illegal participation in the 
preparation of said agreement and in the attachment of plaintiffs' 
properties.</p>
<p>The question now to be determined is whether the lower court erred in 
dismissing the cases on the ground that the causes of action setforth therein 
are now barred for failure of plaintiffs to set them up as a counterclaim in 
Cases Nos. 279 and 293 which gave rise to the present action.</p>
<p>There is no merit in this appeal. The present action is for damages based on 
the ground that defendants took an active part in the illegal preparation and 
execution of the indemnity agreement which was declared null and void in Civil 
Case No. 279, and also because they had caused to have a writ of attachment 
levied on the properties of plaintiffs maliciously and without any justifiable 
motive. On the other hand, Civil Case No. 279 was instituted by plaintiffs 
against the Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. for the annulment of the 
indemnity agreement which is claimed to have been illegally executed. In the 
latter case, it must have been claimed and proven that said indemnity agreement 
was executed and prepared because of the active participation of Attys. Hamada 
and De Guzman who have taken advantage of the ignorance and good faith of 
plaintiffs for which reason the court declared said agreement null and void and 
without effect. The issues involved in the two cases are therefore connected and 
interrelated and could have been threshed out only in one case. It is for this 
reason that the court a quo said that "after a study of the same (it) holds that 
the actions for damages in all the causes of action are in the nature of a 
counterclaim necessarily connected with the main causes of action in Cases Nos. 
279 and 293. The failure to set them up in said cases bars their being brought 
up in a separate action." This finding is correct. To hold otherwise would be to 
pass on the same issues in two separate cases, a situation which our rules seek 
to avoid (Rule 10, Section 6).</p>
<p>It is true that in Civil Case No. 279 the only party defendant was the Alto 
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., whereas in the present action the parties 
defendants are the attorneys of said company, namely, Sinai C. Hamada and 
Guillermo F. de Guzman, but this situation could have been remedied had 
plaintiffs in the former case brought them in as parties defendants, as it was 
their duty to do, in order that judgment, if any, could be rendered against 
them. This is also allowed by our rules (Rule 3, Section 6). Their failure to do 
so constitute a bar to the present action.</p>
<p>The same thing may be said with regard to the third cause of action which 
arises from the alleged participation of defendants in the improper attachment 
of the properties of plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 293. If it is true, as 
claimed, that plaintiffs had suffered damages as a result of said illegal 
attachment, the duty of plaintiffs was to file their claim in the same case in 
order that the award, if proper, may be included in the final judgment. The 
claim must be filed before entry of the final judgment with due notice to the 
parties affected. This is necessary in order to avoid multiplicity of actions 
(Rule 59, section 20).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon mature consideration, vie have reached the conclusion that under the 
terms of section 20 of Rule 59, the application for damages and the notice to 
the sureties should be filed in the trial Court by the party damnified by the 
wrongful or improper attachment either 'before the trial1 or, the latest, 
'before entry of the final judgment', which means not later than the date when 
the judgment becomes final and executory (sec. 2, Rule 35). Only in this way 
could the award against the sureties be included in the final judgment' as 
required by the first part of sec. 20 of Rule 59. The rule plainly calls for 
only one judgment for damages against the attaching party and his sureties; 
which is explained by the fact that the attachment bond is a solidary 
obligation. Since a judicial bondsman has no right to demand the exhaustion of 
the property of the principal debtor (as expressly provided by Art. 2084 of the 
new Civil Code, and Art. 1856 of the old one), there is no justification for the 
entering of separate judgments against them. With a single judgment against 
principal and sureties, the prevailing party may choose, at his discretion, to 
enforce the award of damages against whosoever he considers in a better 
situation to pay it.</p>
<p>"It should be observed that the requirements of section 20 of Rule 59 appear 
designed to avoid multiplicity of suits. But to enable the defendant to secure a 
hearing and judgment against the sureties in the attachment "bond, even after 
the judgment for damages against the principal has become final, would result in 
as great a multiplicity of actions as would flow from enabling him to sue the 
principal and the sureties in separate proceedings." (Domingo del Rosario v. 
Gonzalo P. Nava, et al., G. R. No. L-5513, August 18, 1954)</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from, is affirmed, without pronouncement as to 
costs.</p>
