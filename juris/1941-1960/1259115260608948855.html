				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Attached to the complaint is the contract marked Annex "A" which was executed by the plaintiff and the defendant El Ahorro&nbsp; Insular on September 8,&nbsp; 1933.<br><br>In&nbsp; its answer&nbsp; the El Ahorro&nbsp; Insular&nbsp; admits&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiff obtained a loan from the defendant in the amount of P1,000 and that he executed a deed of mortgage over a house and lot belonging to him, which deed is Annex "A" of the plaintiff, but alleges that&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the express provisions of said contract&nbsp; of mortgage,&nbsp; Annex "A",&nbsp; plaintiff became a mortgagor-stockholder of the defendant El Ahorro Insular, and as such he has all the obligations of a mortgagor and at the same time of a stockholder; that the monthly&nbsp; installment of P16.10 paid by the plaintiff represents P11.10 monthly interest on the loan of Pl,000 and P5&nbsp; as quota&nbsp; or&nbsp; installment on 10 shares&nbsp; Series D of the defendant corporation,&nbsp; which 10 shares, at the time of the action, had an actual book value of only P529.46; that because of the enormous losses amounting to 94.7% suffered by the defendant corporation during the&nbsp; war, as a result of the payment by&nbsp; its&nbsp; debtors of pre-war obligations in Japanese military notes that were deposited in the&nbsp; banks and which were later on expressly declared null and void, and of&nbsp; no value, the value of plaintiff's&nbsp; shares after&nbsp; the liberation and as of the date of the opening of the defendant corporation&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 1,1947 is only P44.63;&nbsp; that because of the false allegations of&nbsp; plaintiff that the mortgage indebtedness amounting to Pl,000 had already been fully overpaid, defendant suffered moral damages in the amount of P20,000 and is entitled&nbsp; to attorney's fees amounting to Pl,000.&nbsp; Attached to&nbsp; the answer was a copy of the application&nbsp; for extrajudicial foreclosure&nbsp; of the mortgage.&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; of First Instance, after&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the parties, issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the extrajudicial sale on foreclosure, upon&nbsp; filing by the&nbsp; plaintiff of a bond of P1,000.<br><br>On August 6,1952, defendant filed a supplementary counterclaim alleging that by reason of the suspension of the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage, defendant&nbsp; has suffered damages in the amount of P155.90, representing the costs of publication and the sheriff's fees and a photostatic&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of a letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations of this supplemental counterclaim on the ground of lack of knowledge of the facts alleged therein.<br><br>On July 11, 1954, after trial, the Court of First Instance, Hon. Alejandro J.&nbsp; Panlilio presiding,&nbsp; rendered judgment finding that the personality of the&nbsp; plaintiff as mortgagor is distinct from his personality as subscriber to defendant's stock;&nbsp; that plaintiff without contradiction testified that he did not understand the Spanish language and said contract was never explained to him; and held that the defendant is under obligation to release and cancel the mortgage, and that, therefore, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement plaintiff did not become&nbsp; a stockholder; and therefore it ordered the cancellation of the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also enjoined the sheriff of Manila&nbsp; from enforcing the extrajudicial sale of foreclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant corporation appealed to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals, but in the latter court the judgment of the Court of First Instance was affirmed.&nbsp; So the case was prosecuted to this Court by a petition for&nbsp; certiorari.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendant El Ahorro Insular is&nbsp; a mutual building and loan association.&nbsp; Its nature and the form and manner in which it conducts its business is expressly outlined in the Corporation Law (now embodied in the General Banking Act), particularly sections&nbsp; 171, paragraph&nbsp; (1), 182, and 188, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 171. All corporations whose capital stock is&nbsp; required or is permitted to be paid in by the stockholders in regular, equal, periodical payments and whose purpose is to accumulate the savings of its stockholders, to repay to said stockholders their accumulated savings and profits&nbsp; upon surrender&nbsp; of&nbsp; their stock, to encourage&nbsp; industry, frugality, and home building among its&nbsp; stockholders, and to loan its&nbsp; funds and funds borrowed for the purpose to stockholders on the security of&nbsp; unencumbered real estate and the pledge of shares of capital stock owned by&nbsp; the stockholders as collateral&nbsp; security, shall be known as building and loan associations, and the words "mutual building and loan association shall" form&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; name of every such corporation&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *."<br><br>"SEC. 182. Every loan made by the association must be properly evidenced by&nbsp; a note&nbsp; or other instrument in&nbsp; writing and must be secured by a first mortgage&nbsp; or&nbsp; deed of trust&nbsp; on&nbsp; unencumbered real estate and also by&nbsp; the&nbsp; pledge to the association&nbsp; of shares of stock of the association the matured value of which shall at&nbsp; least&nbsp; equal the amount loaned *&nbsp; * *."<br><br>"SEC. 188. At least once a year the profits on all business transacted shall be determined by the&nbsp; board of directors and apportioned to all&nbsp; the shares in each series&nbsp; outstanding at the time of such apportionment on the basis of the actual&nbsp; value of&nbsp; such shares as distinguished from&nbsp; their&nbsp; withdrawal value, but in determining the profits which may be so apportioned, there shall be deducted from&nbsp; the gross earnings of the association the expenses and losses incurred&nbsp; in conducting its&nbsp; business and&nbsp; from&nbsp; the net earnings so&nbsp; obtained there shall be deducted a&nbsp; sum equal to&nbsp; five per centum of such net earnings which sum&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be credited to a reserve account.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; said percentage of net earnings shall be credited to the said reserve account until such time as&nbsp; the&nbsp; reserve&nbsp; equals five per centum of&nbsp; the total assets of the association, and the reserve shall be maintained at five per centum&nbsp; of the&nbsp; total assets,&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; available for meeting losses incurred by the association.&nbsp; The net earnings which&nbsp; remain after making the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; deductions shall&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; the&nbsp; profits of&nbsp; the&nbsp; association&nbsp; available&nbsp; for apportionment&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; shareholders.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; event&nbsp; of the liquidation of a&nbsp; building&nbsp; and loan association there&nbsp; shall escheat to the State any part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; reserve remaining after charging off all losses and defraying all&nbsp; expenses of&nbsp; liquidation.&nbsp; (As amended by&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 3610).<br></blockquote>It is in accordance&nbsp; with the above provisions of&nbsp; the Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; that the&nbsp; contract mortgage&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by plaintiff and the defendant&nbsp; with the following provisions:<br><blockquote>I—"LA SOCIEDAD" entrega en este acto al "accionista prestatario" y&nbsp;

<br><br>A parcel of land (Lot&nbsp; No. 17, Sub-Block No.&nbsp; 6 of the&nbsp; consoli dation and subdivision&nbsp; plan Pcs-133,&nbsp; being&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of Lot No. 5, described&nbsp; on&nbsp;

3&nbsp; * * * containing an&nbsp; area of 200 SQUARE METERS more or&nbsp;&nbsp; less.<br><br>Este inmueble consta en el certificado&nbsp; de transferencia&nbsp; db titulo No. 43302, Libro No. T-132, Pagina&nbsp; No. 42 de la Oficiana del Registrador de Titulos de&nbsp; la Ciudad de&nbsp; Manila, I. F.,<br></blockquote>The question that&nbsp; presents itself&nbsp; for&nbsp; resolution by us&nbsp; is, What is the consideration of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; under the&nbsp; contract Annex "A" executed by him&nbsp; and the&nbsp; defendant; is he&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mere borrower or mortgagor, or a stockholder-mortgagor&nbsp; at the same time?&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; resolution of&nbsp; this question&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary because if he&nbsp; were&nbsp; a mere&nbsp; mortgagor, then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiff may not be held responsible for the losses&nbsp; incurred&nbsp;&nbsp; by the&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract itself expressly&nbsp;&nbsp; states that the plaintiff is an <i>accionista prestatario</i> or&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stockholder-mortgagor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the Law and under the&nbsp; terms of the agreement Annex "A", plaintiff was&nbsp;&nbsp; to be credited with the dividends on his&nbsp; share every year&nbsp;&nbsp; and such&nbsp; dividends,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with&nbsp; the monthly payment&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; P5, are&nbsp; to&nbsp; accumulate&nbsp; until&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; reaches the&nbsp;&nbsp; par&nbsp; value of his&nbsp; share.&nbsp; The claim&nbsp; of the plaintiff that he was a mere mortgagor&nbsp; is refuted by the very&nbsp; contract&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he executed.&nbsp; If he did not understand the terms of the agreement it is his fault; besides, the nature&nbsp; of a building and loan association is fixed in the law and these provisions of law the plaintiff could not be excused from knowing.<br><br>Both the contract&nbsp; and the law expressly provide that the indebtedness shall be paid with&nbsp; the&nbsp; installments paid&nbsp; on the shares, together&nbsp; with the dividends, and that the loan given shall&nbsp; be paid only when the installments&nbsp; paid&nbsp; on said shares and the dividends thereon had reached their par value.&nbsp;&nbsp; So long, therefore, as the shares do not reach their par value the payment of the indebtedness cannot be considered as made, and whatever losses may be suffered must be borne by any stockholder in proportion to his subscription.&nbsp; The very nature of&nbsp; a mutual building and loan association presupposes that the stockholders, all of them,&nbsp; participate not&nbsp; only&nbsp; in the dividends but&nbsp; also&nbsp; in the losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; A building&nbsp; and&nbsp; loan&nbsp; association is not a bank that gives a loan, where the profits or losses of the bank are not shared by the debtor.&nbsp; Within a building and loan association such profits&nbsp; or losses are shared in by all stockholders, as it would&nbsp; be unjust and unfair for a stockholder to receive the&nbsp; dividends but be&nbsp; free from&nbsp; losses.<br><br>The agreement Annex "A", executed in accordance with the terms of the Corporation Law&nbsp; can not&nbsp; be held illegal and&nbsp; must be enforced&nbsp; against the plaintiff&nbsp; stockholdermortgagor according to its terms.&nbsp; There is nothing contrary to morals or public policy&nbsp; in the contract or in the law.&nbsp; Its purpose is to secure mutual help between members. There would be no mutuality unless all stockholders share in losses as well as&nbsp; in the profits.<br><br>For the foregoing&nbsp; considerations, the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals should be, as it is hereby, set aside and another entered, dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff, declaring that he has only paid&nbsp; on account of his share the sum of&nbsp; P507.75&nbsp; as&nbsp; of November, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; counterclaim of the defendant is also dismissed, except&nbsp; that for the sum of P155.90, which the plaintiff is hereby ordered to&nbsp; pay to the defendant El Ahorro&nbsp; Insular.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
