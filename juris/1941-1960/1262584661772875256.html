				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by the Commissioner of Customs from the&nbsp; decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, the dispositive portion of which&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote>"FOR&nbsp; THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATION, we&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the opinion that the forfeiture of the electric range in question under Section 1363 (g.) is illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, it is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; ordered that the said article be released to the herein petitioner upon payment of the corresponding&nbsp; customs duties,&nbsp; taxes or&nbsp; charges.&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs."<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; December 10,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL",&nbsp; a&nbsp; unit&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Navy was&nbsp; dispatched to Japan to transport contingents of the 14th BCT bound for&nbsp; Pusan,&nbsp; Korea,&nbsp; and&nbsp; carry&nbsp; Christmas&nbsp; gifts for&nbsp; our soldiers there.&nbsp; It seems that thereafter, it was used for transportation&nbsp; purposes in connection with the needs of our&nbsp; soldiers there and made&nbsp; trips&nbsp; between Korea&nbsp; and Japan, so that it&nbsp; did not return&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; until September 2, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; While in Japan, it loaded 180 cases containing&nbsp; various&nbsp; articles&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to customs&nbsp; duties. These articles&nbsp; have been&nbsp; classified into.three groups, to wit: "(1) those supposed to be for&nbsp; the Philippine Army Post Exchange, with an&nbsp; appraised&nbsp; value of $24,197.53, (2)&nbsp; those pertaining to the Philippine Navy Officers&nbsp; Base Commissary, Cavite,&nbsp; with an appraised value of $1,590.04, and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; those belonging to&nbsp; individuals,&nbsp; consisting of nine Philippine Army and Navy, officers&nbsp; and&nbsp; crew&nbsp; and two private persons, with an appraised value of $1,772.00."<br><br>The rest of the facts which&nbsp; are not&nbsp; in dispute, as well as the issues involved, particularly the legal&nbsp; ones, are&nbsp; well stated in the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals now before us on appeal.&nbsp; We&nbsp; are&nbsp; reproducing pertinent portions of said decision:<br><blockquote>"* * *. All these articles were declared forfeited by the Collector of Customs of Manila&nbsp; for violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Customs Law&nbsp; in a decision rendered on March 18, 1955.<br><br>"One of&nbsp; the cases containing an electric range 'GE' with four burners, brought by&nbsp; the EPS 'MISAMIS&nbsp; ORIENTAL'&nbsp; is consigned to petitioner herein.&nbsp; The&nbsp; said article was forfeited&nbsp; pursuant to Section 1363&nbsp; (g) of the Administrative Code as an unmanifested cargo.&nbsp; On appeal to the Commissioner of Customs,&nbsp; the dispositive portion of&nbsp; the decision of the Collector of Customs of Manila was affirmed&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">in&nbsp; toto</span>; hence this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>"Section&nbsp; 1363&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; of the Administrative&nbsp; Code, upon which the decree of forfeiture is based, reads as follows:<br><br>"Sec. 1363. <span style="font-style: italic;">Property subject to forfeiture under customs laws.</span>—&nbsp; Vessels,&nbsp; cargo, merchandise,&nbsp; and other objects&nbsp; and things shall, under the conditions hereinbelow specified,&nbsp; be&nbsp; subject to forfeiture:<br><br>'(g) Unmanifested merchandise found&nbsp; on any vessel, a manifest therefor being required.'<br><br>"The only question&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; decided is whether or not a manifest is required of the EPS 'MISAMIS ORIENTAL' and, if so, whether or not the aforesaid electric range is&nbsp; an unmanifested merchandise within&nbsp; the&nbsp; meaning of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1363&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; of the Administrative Code.<br><br>"The law provides that an&nbsp; 'unmanifested merchandise found on any&nbsp; vessel,&nbsp; a manifest therefor being required' is subject to forfeiture.&nbsp; This means that where a vessel is Inquired by law,&nbsp; or by regulations&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to law, to make&nbsp; and submit a&nbsp; manifest&nbsp; of its cargo to&nbsp; the customs&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; and it fails to do so, merchandise not manifested&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; forfeited. Is the EPS&nbsp; 'MISAMIS&nbsp; ORIENTAL'&nbsp; required under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Customs Law to make and&nbsp; submit&nbsp; to&nbsp; the customs authorities a manifest of&nbsp; its cargo?&nbsp; The Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs of Manila says it is, and he has been&nbsp; sustained by respondent&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs.<br><br>"It is argued&nbsp; that Sections&nbsp; 1221,&nbsp; 1225 and&nbsp; 1228&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Administrative Code require masters of Government vessels to submit cargo manifests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1221 provides:<br><br>'SEC.&nbsp; 1221. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ports&nbsp; open to&nbsp; vessels&nbsp; engaged in foreign trade —&nbsp; Duty of vessel&nbsp; to&nbsp; make entry.</span> — Vessels engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the foreign carrying trade shall touch at ports of entry only, except as otherwise&nbsp; specially allowed; and every&nbsp; such&nbsp; vessel arriving within a customs&nbsp; collection distinct of the Philippines&nbsp; from a foreign port shall&nbsp; make&nbsp; entry at the&nbsp; port&nbsp; of entry for such&nbsp; district and shall be subject to&nbsp; the authority of the collector of .customs of the port while within his&nbsp; jurisdiction.<br><br>'The master of any&nbsp; war vessel or vessel employed by any foreign government&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; required to&nbsp; report and&nbsp; enter&nbsp; on arrival in the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; unless engaged in the transportation&nbsp; of merchandise in&nbsp; the way of trade. <br><br>"The term&nbsp; 'report and enter'&nbsp; appearing in the last paragraph of Section&nbsp; 1221&nbsp; means,&nbsp; according to the Collector&nbsp; of Customs, 'the&nbsp; entrance&nbsp; of a&nbsp; vessel from a foreign port&nbsp; into&nbsp; a Philippine port&nbsp; of&nbsp; entry as&nbsp; contemplated&nbsp; in Section 1225' which reads in part:<br><br>'Sec.&nbsp; 1225.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Documents&nbsp; to be&nbsp; produced&nbsp; by&nbsp; master&nbsp; upon entry of vessel</span>— For the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of making&nbsp; entry of a vessel engaged in foreign trade, the master&nbsp; thereof shall present the following documents, duly certified by him, to the boarding officer of customs.<br><br>'(a) The&nbsp; original manifest&nbsp; of all cargo destined for the port, to be returned with&nbsp; boarding&nbsp; officer's&nbsp; indorsement.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br></div><br>"And Section 1228 provides:<br><br>'Sec. 1228<span style="font-style: italic;">. Manifest required of vessel from foreign por</span>t.— very vessel from a foreign port&nbsp; or place&nbsp; must have on board complete written or typewritten manifests of all her cargo.<br><br>'All of the cargo intended to be landed at&nbsp; a&nbsp; port in the Philippines must he described&nbsp; in separate manifests&nbsp; for each port of call&nbsp; therein.&nbsp; Each&nbsp; manifest shall include&nbsp; the port&nbsp; of departure and the port of delivery&nbsp; with the marks, numbers, quantity, and description of the&nbsp; packages and the names of the consignees thereof. Every&nbsp; vessel from&nbsp; a foreign port or&nbsp; place must have on board complete&nbsp; manifests of passengers,&nbsp; immigrants, and their baggage, in&nbsp; the prescribed form,&nbsp; setting forth&nbsp; their&nbsp; destination and all particulars required by the immigration laws; and every such vessel shall have prepared for presentation to the proper customs official upon&nbsp; arrival in&nbsp; ports of the Philippines&nbsp; a&nbsp; complete&nbsp; list of all ship's stores&nbsp; then on board.&nbsp; If the vessel does not carry cargo, passengers, or immigrants,&nbsp; there must&nbsp; still be a manifest showing that no&nbsp; cargo is&nbsp; carried&nbsp; from the port of departure to the port of&nbsp; destination in&nbsp; the Philippines.<br><br>'A cargo manifest shall in no case be changed or altered, except after entry of the vessel,&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of&nbsp; an amendment&nbsp; by the master, consignee, or agent thereof, under&nbsp; oath, and&nbsp; attached to the original manifest.'"<br></blockquote>One,&nbsp; if not&nbsp; the&nbsp; main,&nbsp; reason&nbsp; given&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals in&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that the RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL"&nbsp; was&nbsp; not required&nbsp; to present any&nbsp; manifest to the&nbsp; customs&nbsp; authorities upon its arrival in&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; was that Sections 1221, 1225 and 1228 of the Administrative Code&nbsp; aforequoted are found&nbsp; under&nbsp; Article&nbsp; VI&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Customs Law, the title of&nbsp; which reads:&nbsp; "Entrance of vessels in foreign trade"; that the said article lays down rules governing&nbsp; entry of vessels engaged in foreign trade; and that inasmuch as the&nbsp; navy vessel&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; was not engaged in foreign trade&nbsp; it was not&nbsp; required to&nbsp; submit the manifest&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1225.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; Tax Court&nbsp; took the&nbsp; view&nbsp; that under said&nbsp; Article&nbsp; VI&nbsp; of the Customs&nbsp; Law&nbsp; including the&nbsp; different&nbsp; sections&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Administrative&nbsp; Code&nbsp; under&nbsp; it,&nbsp; only vessels&nbsp; engaged in foreign trade are required to submit manifests upon entering&nbsp; any&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp;&nbsp; port.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Court&nbsp; apparently overlooked the reason behind the requirement of presenting&nbsp; a manifest and allowed&nbsp; itself to be swayed by the title&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law.&nbsp; Resort to the title&nbsp; of a statute as&nbsp; an aid&nbsp; in&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; thereof is&nbsp; an&nbsp; unsafe&nbsp; criterion, and is not entitled to much weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; (50 Am. Jur. 301). The&nbsp; title&nbsp; can&nbsp; be resorted to&nbsp; as an aid&nbsp; where there is doubt as to the&nbsp; meaning of the law or the&nbsp; intention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; legislature in&nbsp; enacting it, not&nbsp; otherwise.<br><br>The Tax&nbsp; Court&nbsp; also&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp; or&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to give due consideration&nbsp; to the provisions of Section&nbsp; 1228 which requires that&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">every vessel from a&nbsp; foreign port</span> or place must&nbsp; have&nbsp; on&nbsp; board&nbsp; complete written&nbsp; or&nbsp; typewritten manifests&nbsp; of&nbsp; all&nbsp; her&nbsp; cargoes.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; provision&nbsp; is&nbsp; quite comprehensive,&nbsp; if&nbsp; not all inclusive,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; exception perhaps of&nbsp; vessels&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; paragraph of Section 1221, namely, war vassels or vessels employed by&nbsp; any&nbsp; foreign government.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; presumably&nbsp; out&nbsp; of international&nbsp; practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our opinion&nbsp; all&nbsp; other vessels coming&nbsp; from&nbsp; foreign ports, whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in foreign&nbsp; trade, arriving or touching upon any port in the Philippines&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; provided with&nbsp; a manifest which must be presented to the customs authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for requiring&nbsp; a manifest is&nbsp; well stated in the brief for the Commissioner of Customs which we quote with favor:<br><blockquote>"Whether the&nbsp; vessel&nbsp; be engaged in foreign trade&nbsp; (Sections 1221 and&nbsp; 1225, Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code) or not (Section 1228), and even when&nbsp; the vessel&nbsp; belongs to the army or the&nbsp; navy (Section&nbsp; 1234),&nbsp; the&nbsp; universal&nbsp; requirement from a reading of all the foregoing provisions is&nbsp; that they be provided with a manifest. The reason is obvious,&nbsp; and must stem from marine experience.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; name of the document suggests, a manifest is obviously meant to place&nbsp; beyond doubt&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature&nbsp; of the&nbsp; load or of the cargo that&nbsp; a vessel carries.&nbsp; The&nbsp; manifest is therefore&nbsp; intended to be an indication, if not&nbsp; an open declaration, that the&nbsp; vessel is not engaged in&nbsp; smuggling&nbsp; or in surreptitious practices&nbsp; and activities. If the making of a manifest were to&nbsp; be&nbsp; a monopoly of vessels engaged in&nbsp; foreign trade,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; plain that other vessels would&nbsp; be understood as licensed&nbsp; to engage in undesirable marine activities, a consequence so absurd as to need no&nbsp; further explanation."<br></blockquote>The reason for requiring a manifest in the United States is also stated in the case of U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sischo, 262 U.S. 165:<br><blockquote>"The collection&nbsp; of duties&nbsp; is not the only purpose of a manifest, as is shown by the requirement of one for outward-bound cargoes and&nbsp; from&nbsp; vessels in the&nbsp; coasting&nbsp; trade bound for a&nbsp; port in another collection&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * A government&nbsp; wants to know, without being put to a search, what articles&nbsp; are brought into the country, and to make up its own mind not only what&nbsp; duties it will demand, but whether it will&nbsp; allow&nbsp; the goods to enter at all.&nbsp; It would seem&nbsp; strange&nbsp; if&nbsp; it&nbsp; should&nbsp; except&nbsp; from the&nbsp; manifest demanded those things about which it&nbsp; has the greatest need to be informed, —&nbsp; if in&nbsp; that one case it should take a chance&nbsp; of being able to find what&nbsp; it forbids&nbsp; to&nbsp; come&nbsp; in,&nbsp; without&nbsp; requiring the master to tell what he&nbsp; knows. It would&nbsp; seem doubly&nbsp; strange when, at the same&nbsp; time, it required&nbsp; any other person who had knowledge that the forbidden article&nbsp; was on&nbsp; the vessel&nbsp; to report&nbsp; the fact to the master."&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">19 USCA. p. 821</span>.<br></blockquote>Were we to&nbsp; confine the requirement about&nbsp; the preparation&nbsp; and presentation&nbsp; of a&nbsp; manifest&nbsp; to vessels engaged in&nbsp; foreign trade,&nbsp; what&nbsp; about&nbsp; private&nbsp;&nbsp; vessels,&nbsp;&nbsp; yachts, pleasure&nbsp; boats or cruisers or steamships on a world cruise for&nbsp; tourists,&nbsp; and&nbsp; ships&nbsp; chartered for&nbsp; a special&nbsp; mission or purpose, all&nbsp; of which though not engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; foreign trade, nevertheless could bring&nbsp; into&nbsp; the country not only dutiable goods, but also articles&nbsp; of prohibited importation. The customs laws could&nbsp; not have intended to&nbsp; exempt all these vessels from the requirement to present a manifest. Then we have Section 1234 of the Revised Administrative Code which we&nbsp; quote below:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1234.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Entry&nbsp; of transport or supply&nbsp; ships&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; Army or Navy</span>.— The master&nbsp; or other&nbsp; officer in charge of a transport&nbsp; or supply&nbsp; ship of the United States Army or&nbsp; Navy, arriving&nbsp; from a' foreign port at any&nbsp; port in the&nbsp; Philippines, shall,&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; making&nbsp; entry of&nbsp; his vessel, present a manifest in duplicate, containing the following&nbsp; information, duly certified by him to the boarding officer or collector of customs:<br>&nbsp;"(a) A&nbsp; list&nbsp; of&nbsp; all&nbsp; supplies&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States Government, for use of the&nbsp; Army, Navy, or&nbsp; Public Health Service, or of the Government&nbsp; of the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines.<br><br>"(b) A&nbsp; list of all property of officers and enlisted&nbsp; men aboard, or of civilians carried as passengers.<br>" (c) A&nbsp; list&nbsp; of all other goods,&nbsp; wares,&nbsp; merchandise, or effects on board.&nbsp; <br>"(d) A&nbsp; list of all passengers on board, other than enlisted men of the Army,&nbsp; Navy, or other department of&nbsp; service,&nbsp; giving the name, sex, age, occupation, status, or rank, last permanent residence, port of embarkation, and destination, of each such passenger. The number&nbsp; of enlisted men on&nbsp; board&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; stated, giving their designation, regiment,&nbsp; or&nbsp; department."<br></blockquote>In connection with&nbsp; this legal&nbsp; provision above quoted, the Commissioner of Customs in his decision&nbsp; appealed to the Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; said the&nbsp; following:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *. Even before&nbsp; our&nbsp; country&nbsp; attained its independence, and&nbsp; while the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; sovereignty&nbsp; was&nbsp; supreme&nbsp; over the Philippines, the master or other officers in charge of a transport or supply&nbsp; ship of the United States Army&nbsp; and Navy was required by law (Sec. 1234 of the Revised Administrative Code) to present to the boarding officer&nbsp; or the Collector of Customs, a duly certified manifest&nbsp; in duplicate,&nbsp; containing, among others,&nbsp; a&nbsp; list&nbsp; of all properties of&nbsp; officers&nbsp; and enlisted&nbsp; men, or of civilians carried&nbsp; as passengers, and a list&nbsp; of all other goods,&nbsp; wares, merchandise, or effects on&nbsp; board.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; sustain the proposition that vessels owned by the&nbsp; government are&nbsp; not within the pale of the&nbsp; customs laws and regulations is not only absurd but also fraught with&nbsp; serious implications, for&nbsp; the irony thereof is that such&nbsp; vessels&nbsp; may bring, unhampered, into this country dutiable and/or prohibited merchandise and&nbsp; goods, or, to state it bluntly, they may&nbsp; engage&nbsp; in&nbsp; the very activity which&nbsp; they are called upon to prevent and suppress."<br></blockquote>But the Court of Tax Appeals equally held that Section 1234 is&nbsp; not applicable&nbsp; to vessels of the&nbsp; Philippine Navy for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; said section applies only to ships of the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; Army or Navy,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; if&nbsp; our legislature had really wanted or intended to make its provisions applicable to&nbsp; our&nbsp; navy ships, it&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp; made the corresponding&nbsp; change or amendment&nbsp; of the section.&nbsp; We agree that&nbsp; it&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; done.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we believe that there was&nbsp; no necessity where as in&nbsp; the present case the&nbsp; application of said section to&nbsp; our&nbsp; navy ships is so clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; manifest, considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; for requiring a manifest from transport&nbsp; and&nbsp; supply ships of the&nbsp; army and navy of the United States are&nbsp; and&nbsp; with more reason applicable to our navy ships to&nbsp; carry out the policy of the government, and because we have complete control over them.<br><br>We therefore believe and hold that the RPS "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" was required to present a manifest upon its arrival in Manila on September 2,&nbsp; 1954.<br><br>The Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals, however, believed and found that even if a manifest were required of the RPS "MISAMIS&nbsp; ORIENTAL",&nbsp; still,&nbsp; one was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by one&nbsp; of its&nbsp; officers&nbsp; to customs&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; through&nbsp; one Mr.&nbsp; Casimiro&nbsp; de&nbsp; la Ysla on September&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; This, Ysla&nbsp; denied. And after&nbsp; carefully studying the evidence on record&nbsp; and considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; attending the case, we are inclined to agree with the Collector of Customs and the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs who&nbsp; upheld him that no such manifest required by law was submitted to the customs authorities upon the arrival of&nbsp; the RPS "MISAMIS&nbsp; ORIENTAL".<br><br>If a manifest had really been delivered to the customs authorities&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrival&nbsp; of the&nbsp; RPS "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; whatsoever&nbsp; for Ysla to deny&nbsp; receipt thereof;&nbsp; and there&nbsp; would have been&nbsp; no occasion or&nbsp; reason for the&nbsp; Acting Collector of Customs on September&nbsp; 17, 1954&nbsp; to&nbsp; write to the&nbsp; Chief of Staff of the Armed&nbsp;&nbsp; Forces&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; stating that according to his information "a copy of the ship's manifest covering said cargo&nbsp; had been secured by that office from the Commanding Officer of&nbsp; the&nbsp; vessel"&nbsp; and request that two copies thereof be furnished the Bureau of Customs. Why&nbsp; should&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs ask for&nbsp; copies&nbsp; of the manifest if as claimed by the&nbsp; navy authorities such manifest had already been delivered to them?<br><br>Again, it had always been the contention and the belief of the navy&nbsp; authorities that Philippine navy vessels were not required to prepare and deliver this manifest upon their&nbsp; arrival in the&nbsp; Philippines from foreign ports.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact&nbsp; there is evidence to the effect that on two&nbsp; different occasions prior to the arrival of RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" on&nbsp; September 2, 1954, Philippine&nbsp; navy&nbsp; vessels had&nbsp; arrived&nbsp; from&nbsp; abroad with&nbsp; merchandise presumably for personal&nbsp; use of officers&nbsp; and men of&nbsp; the Philippine navy and&nbsp; that no&nbsp; manifest&nbsp; had&nbsp; been presented covering said goods,&nbsp; which&nbsp; goods never&nbsp; went through&nbsp; customs. This belief and attitude of the Philippine navy authorities is reflected in the&nbsp; letter of Commodore&nbsp; Francisco, dated October 9, 1954,&nbsp; answering&nbsp; the letter&nbsp; of&nbsp; inquiry&nbsp; and request of the Acting Collector of Customs, dated September&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; wherein&nbsp; he said:<br><blockquote>"In this&nbsp; connection,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Command feels&nbsp; that&nbsp; the pertinent provisions of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code relative to vessels coming from foreign&nbsp; ports&nbsp; are not&nbsp; applicable to&nbsp; vessels of the Philippine Navy as&nbsp; the same are war vessels, exempted&nbsp; under Section 1221 of said&nbsp; code. If your office holds a contrary opinion, a clarification&nbsp; of this matter is requested."<br></blockquote>With this&nbsp; belief&nbsp; and attitude&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; navy authorities, it was&nbsp; not likely that a manifest of the goods carried&nbsp; by the&nbsp; RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL"&nbsp; was&nbsp; prepared on board while&nbsp; the boat was still in&nbsp; Japan, much less was a copy of the&nbsp; manifest if made, was&nbsp; delivered to customs authorities.<br><br>Furthermore, according to the Commissioner of Customs, we quote from his decision:<br><blockquote>"* * * The record shows that the officers of&nbsp; the RPS 'MISAMIS ORIENTAL' insistently pleaded for the&nbsp; exemption&nbsp; of&nbsp; their vessel from&nbsp; customs&nbsp; requirements&nbsp; regarding the presentation of cargo manifest, perhaps not realizing that laws must be equally enforced— among public officers&nbsp; and&nbsp; private citizens alike. Besides, to accord the vessel with such exceptional privilege may&nbsp; result&nbsp; in government vessels&nbsp; comprising public&nbsp; trust and duty&nbsp; and serving&nbsp; two incompatible masters— the government on one&nbsp; hand, and&nbsp; the tax-evader on the other.. Thus the&nbsp; Government is&nbsp; rendered helpless in such cases&nbsp; to prevent its being defrauded of lawful duties and taxes."<br></blockquote>If a manifest had already been prepared by the officers of&nbsp; the ship,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy thereof had&nbsp; been&nbsp; presented to&nbsp; the&nbsp; customs, why&nbsp; all this insistence&nbsp; and&nbsp; plea,&nbsp; that they be excused from and&nbsp; relieved of&nbsp; the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; of&nbsp; presenting a manifest when they were&nbsp; found to be without one?<br><br>Moreover, if said manifest had&nbsp; actually been delivered to&nbsp; customs&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; arrival of&nbsp; the RPS "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" in Manila, then&nbsp; in the&nbsp; regular course&nbsp; of things&nbsp; the&nbsp; customs&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; would have inspected the&nbsp; same, assessed customs&nbsp; duties on them if found dutiable, or&nbsp; released them if otherwise.&nbsp; And&nbsp; yet the&nbsp; only&nbsp; time&nbsp; when&nbsp; the customs&nbsp; authorities learned of the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the goods and merchandise on board the&nbsp; RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" was when according to the decision of&nbsp; the Collector of Customs a confidential information was received in the office&nbsp; of the Port Patrol Division of the Bureau&nbsp; regarding the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of commercial goods on board the RPS&nbsp; "MISAMIS ORIENTAL" and&nbsp; after interception&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Port&nbsp; Patrol&nbsp; Policeman Consorcio&nbsp; Javier&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; truckload&nbsp; of&nbsp; cases&nbsp; leaving the customs zone from the navy boat.&nbsp;&nbsp; We further quote from the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Collector of Customs:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * * To verify&nbsp; the truth of this information, Col.&nbsp; Manuel Turingan, then General Supervisor of the Security Division of the Bureau of Customs,&nbsp; and Atty.&nbsp; Salvador Mascardo, Chief of the Investigation&nbsp; Section of the Port&nbsp; Patrol&nbsp; Division, went&nbsp; to Pi^r 5 on&nbsp; September 6, 1954 where the Philippine Navy boat mentioned above was then&nbsp; docked.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; arrival thereat, they were met by the&nbsp; Commanding Officer of the above-named vessel, who, when asked, informed&nbsp; them that&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp; really commercial goods on board his ship.&nbsp; When the merchandise were brought to and examined at the customhouse, they were found to be&nbsp; not&nbsp; covered by the&nbsp; required cargo manifest, bills&nbsp; of lading, consular invoices, and&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank licenses&nbsp; and release certificates.&nbsp; Hence, the seizure."<br></blockquote>Besides, according to the regulations of the Bureau of Customs,&nbsp; as well as the practice of that office, when a vessel&nbsp; arrives&nbsp; from&nbsp; a&nbsp; foreign port,&nbsp; a customs&nbsp; boarding officer&nbsp; boards the ship&nbsp; and a&nbsp; copy or copies of the cargo manifests&nbsp; are delivered to him&nbsp; by the&nbsp; master&nbsp; of the vessel, and he makes&nbsp; a proper&nbsp; indorsement thereof&nbsp; including the&nbsp; date of delivery&nbsp; to him (boarding officer). And according to Section 1229 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; the master of the vessel shall&nbsp; immediately mail to the Auditor General a copy of the cargo manifest properly indorsed by the boarding officer.&nbsp; If as claimed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; navy authorities, the&nbsp; law about cargo manifests had been fully&nbsp; complied with and&nbsp; that&nbsp; a copy&nbsp; of said manifest was delivered to an officer of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Customs who had the&nbsp; duty of indorsing and dating the same and&nbsp; that&nbsp; a copy thereof had&nbsp; been mailed&nbsp; to the Auditor General,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; explained&nbsp; why said navy authorities failed to&nbsp; produce at the hearing&nbsp; their copy of&nbsp; said manifest duly&nbsp; indorsed by&nbsp; tile boarding officer; neither&nbsp; did they&nbsp; try&nbsp; to subpoena the Auditor General&nbsp; to produce the copy which should have&nbsp; been&nbsp; mailed to him. All these&nbsp; point&nbsp; to&nbsp; the conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; no&nbsp; such&nbsp; cargo manifest was ever delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; customs&nbsp; authorities upon the arrival&nbsp; of the RPS "MISAMIS ORIENTAL".<br><br>In conclusion, we hold that all vessels whether private or&nbsp; government owned,&nbsp; including ships of the Philippine navy, coming&nbsp; from a foreign&nbsp; port, with the possible exception&nbsp; of war vessels or vessels employed&nbsp; by&nbsp; any foreign government, not&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in the transportation of merchandise in the way of trade, as provided for in the second paragraph&nbsp; of Section 1221 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code, are required to prepare and present a&nbsp; manifest to the customs&nbsp; authorities upon arrival at any Philippine port. <br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing, the appealed decision&nbsp; of the Court of Tax Appeals&nbsp; as regards&nbsp; the forfeiture of the electric&nbsp; range in question&nbsp; is set aside, and the decision of the&nbsp; Commissioner of&nbsp; Customs affirming that of the Collector of Customs, as regards the same article is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
