				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Benito Ramos and Consolacion Jaime were jointly charged with murder in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. After a separate trial, Benito Ramos was found guilty as charged, and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Isaac Pariñas in the sum of P2,000.00, with legal accessories, and to pay the costs. Benito Ramos did not appeal. After a separate trial, Consolacion Jaime was found guilty of murder, as principal by inducement, and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Isaac Pariñas in the sum of P3,000.00, with legal accessories, and to pay one-half of the costs.&nbsp; The court credited her with one-half of her preventive imprisonment. From this judgment Consolacion Jaime as appealed. <br><br>For several years the appellant Consolacion Jaime, 27 years old, lived in barrio Bantug, Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, as the common-law wife of Isaac Pariñas, 52 years old, with whom she has several children, the appellant had an unpleasant life with Isaac Pariñas because the latter was cruel and often maltreated her, as a result of which, sometime in December, 1948, she readily consented to become the paramour of her co-accused, Benito Ramos, married and twenty-two years old. A few weeks before May 3, 1949, the appellant eloped with Benito Ramos but, upon advice of police sergeant Delo, the appellant returned to Isaac Pariñas, who, however, remained cruel to the appellant. Urged by the cruelty of Isaac Pariñas, the appellant induced Benito Ramos to kill Isaac Pariñas. Accordingly, in the afternoon of May 2, 1949, Benito Ramos asked Cesario Eugenio, a civilian guard, to tell Tomas Estabillo, corporal of the civilian guards, not to let Isaac Pariñas perform guard duty that evening, because Benito Ramos would talk to him (Isaac Pariñas). Isaac Pariñas in fact did not report for guard duty. Around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of May 2, 1949, Benito Ramos went to the house of Isaac Pariñas and took the latter to the field. When Benito Ramos called for Isaac Pariñas, the appellant pretended to be asleep. Upon reaching the field, Isaac Pariñas asked Benito Ramos why the latter appeared angry, but Benito Ramos in turn asked Isaac Pariñas why he was not guarding, after which Benito Ramos, facing Isaac Pariñas, hit the latter with his garand rifle. Isaac Pariñas fell to the ground, and was struck four times on the face and on the head by Benito Ramos. Feeling that Isaac Pariñas was already dead, Benito Ramos left for the headquarters of the civilian guards.&nbsp; <br><br>About 10:00 o'clock in the same evening, fomas Estabillo heard the appellant crying in the house of her neighbor Remigio Somera. Inquiring about the matter, Tomas Estabillo was informed by the appellant of the alleged fact that Isaac Pariñas was taken away by several unknown persons. At about 3:30 in the morning of May 3, 1949, the chief of police of Muñoz, after receiving a report of the alleged kidnapping of Isaac Pariñas, ordered a police patrol, headed by police sergeant Gomez, to investigate, This patrol returned at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning, bringing with them Isaac Pariñas in an unconscious state, with wounds on his head and blood coming out of his mouth, nose and ears. Isaac Pariñas died in the provincial hospital at about 4:30 in the morning of May 4, 1949.&nbsp; "The autopsy showed that Isaac Pariñas received the following injuries:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="5%"><div align="LEFT">(1)</div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Lacerated wound about one inch long at the external canthus of right eye; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(2)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Two lacerated wounds about one and one-half inches parallel to each other one-half inch apart at the chin;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(3) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Lacerated wound at the angle of the mouth at the right side:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(4)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Marked ecchymosis of the right upper and lower eyelid and both sides of the neck just below the ear;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(5)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Signs of blood stains coming out from both ears;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(6) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Avulsion of four upper teeth at right side; one canine, one incisor and the two right pre-molars;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(7) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Blood stains coming out from nostrils; Fracture, lower jaw, right side. (Solicitor General's Brief, pp. 4-5.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>According to the examining physician, these injuries were caused by a blunt instrument; that the blood clot in the head, the epidural hemorrhage and extensive pial hemorrhage were fatal; and that the deceased died from severe cerebral concussions due to the pial and epidural hemorrhage as well as the jaw fracture. <br><br>Informed of the request made earlier in the day by Benito Ramos not to let Isaac Pariñas perform any guard duty, the chief of police caused Benito Ramos to be investigated by police sergeant Gomez who took down his confession, Exhibit C-Jaime. This confession was sworn to and signed before the justice of the peace of Muñoz who translated it from Tagalog to Ilocano, the dialect of Benito Ramos. The chief of police also caused Consolacion Jaime to be investigated by police sergeant Delo who prepared her affidavit, Exhibit B-Jaime. This affidavit was sworn to and signed before the justice of the peace of Muñoz who translated it to Ilocano, the dialect of Consolacion Jaime.<br><br>Appellant's conviction is based mainly on the confession of Benito Ramos, in conjunction with her own affidavit. The important question refers to the admissibility of the confession of Benito Ramos against the appellant in her separate trial, it being contended that the confession of Ramos is hearsay.&nbsp; It appears, however, that the appellant presented Benito Ramos as a defense witness and questioned him on his confession, with the result that said confession became admissible not only to impeach the exculpatory testimony of Benito Ramos but also to show the concerted plan of the appellant and her co-accused to kill Isaac Pariñas.&nbsp; The observation that the appellant had no opportunity to cross-examine its author, disappeared when she herself took the initiative to present Benito Ramos in her trial and to question him with reference to his confession, with a view to repudiating the same.&nbsp; In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Manalo and Atienza, 46 Phil. 572, 577, this Court made the following applicable pronouncement: <br><blockquote>"During the trial of this case Manalo was called as a witness and gave testimony tending to exonerate the defendant.&nbsp; It is true that Manalo's confession was not competent evidence against defendant, but it is also true that after Manalo was called as a witness for the defendant, his confession would then be competent for the purpose of contradicting his testimony." </blockquote>Any attempt on the part of the appellant to repudiate her confession and that of Benito Ramos is futile, in view of the testimony of the justice of the peace of Muñoz to the effect that the appellant and Benito Ramos signed their respective confessions and swore to them before the justice of the peace, after the latter had translated the same into Ilocano, and after they had admitted that said confessions were correct and true. The justice of the peace, besides being a public officer, is disinterested and has not been shown to have had any motive to incriminate the appellant.&nbsp; The confession of Benito Ramos reads as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="5%">"Q.</td> <td valign="TOP" width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Do you know anything about the disappearance of Isaac Pariñas and the accident he met, if so please relate.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">"A. </td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir, I know something.

As suggested by the Solicitor General, the appellant is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction, being an illiterate person who cannot read or write, offset however by the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity.&nbsp; The penalty prescribed by law should therefore be imposed in its medium period, or <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, imposed by the trial court.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is affirmed, with one-half of the costs against the appellant. So ordered.<br><br><i>Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, </i> and <i>Labrador, JJ., </i>concur</div>
