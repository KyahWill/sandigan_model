				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a judgment of conviction for murder.
  <p>    On May 8, 1956, Major Osmundo C. Ramos (retired) died as a 
consequence of several stab wounds inflicted upon him by the accused 
Fedilino Guillano on the same day. Prosecuted and tried for murder, 
Guillano alleged self-defense. The Davao court of first instance found 
him guilty as charged, and gave him life imprisonment. He was also 
required to pay P6,000.00 to the heirs of the deceased, plus costs.</p>
  <p>    Ramos was manager of oriental Farming Corporation, a 
large-scale farming company in Davao. In 1952, said entity filed with 
the Bureau of Lands its Sales Application  covering 580 hectares of 
public land in Padada, Davao. The application was approved, and the 
corporation took possession. But some persons, claiming priority of 
occupation, contested the right of the corporation in an opposition 
submitted to the Bureau of Lands. Such opposition however was, after 
investigation, dismissed by the order of the Director of said Bureau 
dated November 21, 1953.</p>
  <p>    The oppositors filed a motion to reconsider. This time they 
were joined, for the first time, by Fedilino Guillano. Acting on the 
motion, a special land investigator conducted a new inquiry, which 
resulted in a second dismissal of the oppositors' protest. On appeal, 
the Secretary of Agriculture affirmed the action of the Bureau of Lands.</p>
  <p>    Meanwhile, during the pendency of the appeal, some of the 
claimants including Fedilino Guillano, armed with bolos, invaded the 
portion occupied by the corporation, destroyed cassava plants growing 
therein and did other damage to the extent of P2,000.00. This gave 
ground to a civil complaint for forcible entry and detainer and also to a
 criminal complaint for malicious mischief before the justice of the 
peace court of Padada, Davao, at the instance of Ramos.</p>
  <p>    Originally scheduled for April 20, 1956, the hearing of the two
 cases was postponed to May 7 and then May 8, 1956. On that last date, 
as stated, Guillano stabbed Ramos to death in the municipal building of 
Padada at nine in the morning.</p>
  <p>    According to the witnesses for the prosecution, principally 
Gualberto Gorre, Ramos was walking towards the toilet when Fedilino 
Guillano following him from behind, suddenly grabbed his left shoulder 
and plunged a dagger into his (Ramos') back. Instantly turning around, 
Ramos faced his assailant, wrestled with him, only to fall on his back. 
Straddling his fallen victim, Guillano continued stabbing the latter in 
various parts of the body (abdomen and breast) until the arrival of 
three policemen who disarmed him and separated him from Ramos.</p>
  <p>    One of the policemen helped Ramos to stand up. A witness noted —
 and so testified — that Ramos' revolver was still in its closed holster
 on his right hip.</p>
  <p>    As indicated, the defendant asserted self-defense. This was his
 account: When I met Major Ramos that morning, I asked why he had 
included me in the cases (malicious mischief and ejectment) since I had 
no fault. "You just wait, because we have trial now," he answered. I 
told him it was not possible for me to leave the land because I got my 
living from it. This angered the Major, who pushed me and said "what do 
you mean by it is not possible?" Immediately thereafter Ramos, with his 
right hand attempted to pull his revolver; but I seized and held his 
hand with my left, then drew my dagger and stabbed him first on the 
right breast and then on the left part of his stomach. We wrestled; he 
fell on his back and I straddled him. In this position, Ramos turned on 
his right side and with the left hand, tried to pull his revolver which 
was then under his back. Seeing the movement, I tried to stabbed his 
left biceps to prevent his  using the gun, but he suddenly moved his 
left shoulder further towards the right thereby exposing his back, which
 was wounded instead.</p>
  <p>    The trial judge did not believe the defendant's story. If it 
were true, His honor said, that Ramos pushed defendant and drew his gun,
 he would have had plenty of time to use it, having been a Major in the 
Constabulary. And yet everybody says that the gun was found inside its 
holster.</p>
  <p>    Again, noting the position of the stab wound in Ramos' back, 
His Honor reasoned out that it could not have been inflicted in the way 
the accused described — the wound extended from the shoulder blade down.</p>
  <p>    We think this estimate of the situation accords with plain 
common sense. It is very unlikely that a retired Constabulary officer, 
bigger than the accused, well-built (210 pounds) and armed with a 
revolver could so easily be downed, unless he had been caught unawares 
and given a crippling blow at the outset (as declared by the prosecution
 witnesses). And the position of the wound in the left interscapular 
area directed downward could not have been caused in the manner 
described by the accused. On the other hand, its place and aspect 
tallied with the story in court of the witness Gualberto Gorre of the 
prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dr. de la 
Fuente who examined the corpse confirms this view in his testimony and 
certificate.</p>
  <p>    Besides, on the same day of the killing, Guillano was arrested 
and examined at the police headquarters. The questions and his answers 
are transcribed on Exh. C, which this accused subscribed voluntarily 
before the justice of the peace of Padada. Therein appear statements 
like these:</p>

murder he committed.</p>
  <p>    Treachery, of course, qualified the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> We do not think the accused could be given 
the benefit of mitigating circumstance of obfuscation caused by the 
complaints against him by Ramos. The latter was acting within his rights

many days before.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
