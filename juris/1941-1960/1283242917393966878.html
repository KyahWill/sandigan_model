</style><div align="justify">This is a naturalization case. Te Chao Ling, alias Dinga, applies for 
Filipino citizenship. All the legal formalities as to publication of the 
application having been accomplished, it was set for hearing. After hearing, the 
Court found that he has all the qualifications except that he does not speak and 
write English or Spanish, as required by section 2, paragraph 5, of Com. Act No. 
473, as amended by Com. Act No. 535, and denied the application. He appeals.
<p>The appellant admits that he does not speak and write the English language 
but understands a little of that language and that he does not speak Spanish but 
understands a little of it.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> This 
admission jibes with his previous statement in an investigation conducted by the 
National Bureau of Investigation presented by the oppositor as Exhibit 1. It 
appears on page 3 thereof that he understands a little English but he cannot 
speak and write it.</p>
<p>In an application for naturalization it is incumbent upon the applicant to 
show by competent proof that he possesses all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications as provided by law. Upon the evidence presented, it cannot be 
asserted that he has complied with the language requirement.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>The judgment dismissing the application is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
