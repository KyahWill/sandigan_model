				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 15, 1954, appellant Juan Dimson was charged in the Justice of&nbsp; the Peace Court of Calauan, Laguna with the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; light&nbsp; threats&nbsp; (Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 113). After trial judgment was rendered by&nbsp; the&nbsp; court on June 2, 1954 finding Dimson guilty as&nbsp; charged, and sentencing him to pay a fine of P50&nbsp; and costs.&nbsp; On the same date, the court sent a notice to&nbsp; Dimson that&nbsp; judgment would be promulgated on June 19, 1954.&nbsp; The notice was returned unserved, because Dimson could not be found in the place of&nbsp; his residence in Barrio&nbsp; Dayap.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; June 26, 1954, the court again issued another&nbsp; notice to&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimson to appear for promulgation&nbsp; of judgment&nbsp; on July 10,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; This notice&nbsp; was also returned unserved because&nbsp; Dimson was still absent from his residence.&nbsp; Wherefore, on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 17, 1954, the judge sent by&nbsp; registered mail a&nbsp; copy of the decision to Dimson's attorneys as well as the provincial fiscal at Sta. Cruz, Laguna,&nbsp; duly received&nbsp; by&nbsp; them on July 20, 1954&nbsp; and July 19, 1954 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on October 6, 1954, the judge, issued a notice&nbsp; to&nbsp; Dimson's bondsmen to produce&nbsp; the accused in&nbsp; court on October 23, 1954 "for the promulgation&nbsp; of the judgment".&nbsp; The bondsmen notified&nbsp; Dimson to appear in court as required, but instead of appearing personally on the date&nbsp; set,&nbsp; Dimson filed, through his lawyers, an "Omnibus Motion" asking for the dismissal&nbsp; of the case because the&nbsp; delay in the promulgation of the decision&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; violated&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of the accused to a speedy trial.&nbsp; The judge denied the motion&nbsp; on October 30,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; holding that judgment had already been promulgated on July 20,&nbsp; 1954 when copy of the decision was received by the&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; lawyers, and that the same had&nbsp; already became final and executory; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same day, the judge&nbsp; sent&nbsp; another notice to the bondsmen to produce the person of the accused in&nbsp; court for the execution of the sentence.&nbsp; On November 29,&nbsp; 1954, the accused, through counsel, filed a petition&nbsp; for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary&nbsp; injunction before the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Laguna, complaining&nbsp; about the actuations of the respondent justice of the peace, and asking&nbsp; that&nbsp; all proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 113&nbsp; be annulled.&nbsp; In answer, the respondent judge explained that the cause of the delay in the promulgation of his sentence was the continued absence of the accused from the&nbsp; place of his known residence; that the service of a copy of the decision to the defendant's lawyers was sufficient promulgation of the&nbsp; judgment;&nbsp; that&nbsp; as&nbsp; said lawyers did not perfect an appeal&nbsp; on time, the judgment had become final and executory; and that the notice to bondsmen to produce the body&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused on October&nbsp; 23, 1954&nbsp; was mistakenly worded for "promulgation of judgment"&nbsp; when it should&nbsp; have been a notice to produce the accused for the execution of the judgment.<p>The Court of First Instance found that service of a copy of the decision to&nbsp; the defendant's lawyers was not equivalent to promulgation, but that the delay in the promulgation of the judgment did not render the proceedings void but&nbsp; only&nbsp; made&nbsp; the decision ineffective; that said&nbsp; delay was due to the fact that the accused could not be found in the place of his known residence; and ordered that the decision of the inferior court be promulgated in accordance with law.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this judgment,&nbsp; defendant Juan C. Dimson appealed to this court.</p><p>The appeal has&nbsp; no&nbsp; merit.</p><p>Appellant mainly complains about the alleged unreasonable delay in the promulgation of the sentence against him in criminal case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 113.&nbsp;&nbsp; The records show, however, that whatever delay there was m the promulgation of said sentence was due&nbsp; to no fault of the respondent justice of the peace, but to&nbsp; appellant's continued absence from his residence, where respondent&nbsp; judge sought twice to notify him of the judgment but failed because he&nbsp; could not&nbsp; be found therein.&nbsp; When notice of&nbsp; the judgment could not be served on, appellant, the judge, however, sent copy of the decision to his&nbsp; attorneys and&nbsp; notified&nbsp; his bondsmen&nbsp; to produce him in court&nbsp; for the promulgation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; The sentence then could&nbsp; have been promulgated at this later&nbsp; date, but appellant, instead of appearing personally on the day set for the&nbsp; reading&nbsp; of his sentence,&nbsp; filed, through his&nbsp; lawyers,&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; asking for the dismissal of his case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The delay in the promulgation of the sentence of the inferior court was therefore&nbsp; caused by appellant's own acts, first,&nbsp; his continued absence from his&nbsp; place&nbsp; of residence, and second, his filing a motion to dismiss the case against him instead of&nbsp; appearing for the promulgation of the judgment.</p><p>The only error that can be attributed to the respondent justice of the peace&nbsp; was his&nbsp; having held,&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; denying appellant's motion to dismiss, that judgment had already been promulgated when notice of the decision was received by his lawyers on July 20, 1954.&nbsp; Under section 6,&nbsp; Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, judgment for a light offense as the one at bar is promulgated by&nbsp; reading the sentence in the presence of the defendant or his attorney or representative.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reading of the sentence&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused or his attorney in open court is motivated by the necessity of fixing the start of the period for&nbsp; appeal; it is only in verdicts&nbsp; of acquittal that notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the decision to the accused is deemed sufficient promulgation,&nbsp; for then,&nbsp; no appeal is necessary and the judgment becomes final and executory immediately after promulgation (Cea <em>vs.</em> Cinco, 50 Off. Gaz. No. 11, 5254).</p><p>Appellant also claims that the delay in the promulgation of his sentence&nbsp; for more than&nbsp; ninety days deprived the justice of the peace court of jurisdiction to act further in his case.&nbsp; This argument is untenable, not only because, as already stated,&nbsp; whatever delay in&nbsp; the&nbsp; promulgation of the judgment in criminal case No. 113 was due to appellant's own acts, but also for the reason&nbsp; that the 90-day period fixed&nbsp; by the law is for the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; cases&nbsp; or proceedings pending before the trial courts, and has&nbsp; no application to cases already decided and disposed of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, failure to comply with the injunction for judges to decide their cases within 90 days from submission merely deprives them&nbsp; of&nbsp; their right to collect their salaries or to apply&nbsp; for leave&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 5, Judiciary&nbsp; Act of 1948; section&nbsp; 129,&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code) but does not deprive them of jurisdiction to&nbsp; act in the causes pending before them.</p><p>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; costs against appellant Juan Dimson.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras C,&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,, </em>and<em> Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
