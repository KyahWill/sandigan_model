				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for mandamus to compel the respondent judge to 
give due course to the appeal in Civil Case No. 5141 of the Court of 
First Instance of Quezon Province, the pertinent data are these:
  <ol><li>   On May 14, 1951 said court issued an order dismissing the 
aforesaid litigation  due to the failure of herein petitioner (plaintiff
 in the case) and of his counsel to appear at the trial which had 
properly been set on that same day. <br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  Copies of the order of dismissal were transmitted by 
registered mail to the parties' counsel.  The copy for plaintiff's 
attorney was received at the Manila post-office on the 17th of May and 
on the 18th the postmaster notified him thereof.  He got the registered 
matter on the 24th of May, 1951.<br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  Thereafter he prepared and signed a motion for reconsideration
 dated June 22, 1951.  He mailed the original by special delivery on 
June 22, 1951 and it was received in Lucena, Quezon Province by the 
Clerk of Court on June 26, 1951. <br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  As a precaution, a signed copy of the same motion for 
reconsideration was dispatched by registered mail on June 23, 1951 with a
 letter to the Clerk informing that the original had been forwarded the 
day before. <br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  On September 7, 1951, the plaintiff presented a motion "ad 
cautelam" asking that he be given an additional period of fifteen days 
within which to submit his notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on 
appeal, should his motion for reconsideration be overruled. <br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  On November 29, 1951 the court denied the motions for 
reconsideration and for additional time.  Of such denial the plaintiff 
received notice on December 7, 1951.<br>
      <br>
    </li><li>  On December 11, 1951 the notice of appeal, appeal bond and 
record on appeal were presented to the court.  But the appeal was 
disallowed in August 1952.  Hence this petition in September 1952.</li></ol>
  <p>    The resulting question for decision is whether the appeal had 
been seasonably perfected.</p>
  <p>    There is much to respondents' contention that the motion for 
reconsideration dated June 22, 1951 was belatedly presented, because the
 plaintiff having legally received notice of the order of dismissal on 
May 23, 1951 pursuant to Rule 27 sec. 8, the thirty-day period <i>expired
 on June 23, 1951,</i> and the motion for reconsideration was actually 
before the court <i>only on June 26, 1951</i> when it was <i>received</i>
 in the office of the Clerk.  (J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. v. Francisco, G. 
R. No. L-4672, Aug. 17, 1951).</p>
  <p>    Supposing, however, that the motion for reconsideration may be 
considered filed on June 23, 1951, when a copy was sent by registered 
mail<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, still the notice and 
record of appeal were tardy, because although plaintiff received notice 
of the denial of such motion for reconsideration only <em>on December 7,
 1951</em>, i. e., two days <em>late</em>, at least.  It is true that on
 December 8, 1951 he moved for extension of the period, but his motion 
was turned down, and it had no effect of suspending the statutory period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore the respondent judge was justified in disallowing the
 appeal, and mandamus is not available to the would-be-appellant.</p>
  <p>    It may be stated here that the matter of equitable relief has 
been explored, but the members of the court are not favorably impressed.</p>
  <p>    The petition is denied, with costs against petitioner.</p>
    <i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Bautista Angelo</i>,
 and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.<br> 
    <i>Feria, Pablo,</i> and <i>Jugo, JJ.,</i> took no part. <br>

  <hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"> 
  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>It might be argued that 
the copy was not the motion, for the court probably could not act on it 
without waiting for the original.<br>
