				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 24, 1947, Lope Sarreal filed a complaint (amended on 
April 10, 1947, to include Harry Lyons) seeking a money judgment against 
petitioners on three causes of action in the total of P1,256,229.30.
<p align="justify">On May 27, 1947, Sarreal filed a motion for the production and 
inspection of the following documents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I. Books or Papers of Material Distributors (Phil.) Inc.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. Cash Receipts Journal</p>

<p align="justify">"4. All letters exchanged between Material Distributors (Phil.) 
Inc., Material Distributors, Inc. of Witchita, Kansas, ond Harry Lyons, between 
October 9, 1946 and March 31, 1947.</p>

<p align="justify">"3. Cash Receipts Journal.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. Cash Payments Journal."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On June 4, 1947, Sarreal filed a supplemental motion for the 
production and inspection of the originals of Annexes A and B of the 
complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">On June 12, 1947, petitioners filed a memorandum and opposition 
to Sarreal's above mentioned original and supplemental motions on the ground 
that he failed to show good cause and that the motions were evidently filed for 
the purpose of fishing evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">In July 16, 1947, respondent judge, granting both motions, 
required petitioners to produce the documents and annexes in question on July 
24, 1947.<br><br>On account of the absence in the Philippines of Harry Lyons, 
petitioners moved, reserving whatever rights they have under the Rules of Court, 
to postpone the inspection of the documents and annexes in question and 
accordingly respondent judge postponed it to August 15, 1947.</p>
<p align="justify">On August 13, 1947, petitioners moved for the reconsideration 
of the order of July 16, on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<i>a</i>) Article 46 of the Code of Commerce which prohibits 
the delivery, communication and general examination of the correspondence of 
merchants, a substantial right, as well as the petitioners' right to the 
inviolability of their correspondence as guaranteed by the Constitution would be 
violated by the order requiring the production of the following documents:</p>
<p align="justify">"BOOKS AND PAPERS OF DEFENDANT HARRY LYONS</p>
<p align="justify">"(1) Letters exchanged between Harry Lyons and Material 
Distributors, Inc., of Witchita, Kansas, between September 14, 1946 and March 
24, 1947;</p>
<p align="justify">"(2) Cablegrams exchanged between, Harry Lyons and Material 
Distributors, Inc., of Witchita, Kansas, between September 14, 1946 and March 
24, 1947.</p>
<p align="justify">"BOOKS AND PAPERS OF MATERIAL DISTRIBUTORS (PHIL.) INC.</p>
<p align="justify">"(4-5) All letters and cablegrams exchanged between Material 
Distributors (Phil.), Inc., Material Distributors, Inc., of Witchita, Kansas, 
and Harry Lyons between October 9, 1946 and March 31, 1947.</p>
<p align="justify">"(b)That the production for plaintiff's inspection of all the 
foregoing documents above enumerated, as well as of the following documents, 
would constitute a "fishing expedition," not allowed by Rule 21 of the Rules of 
Court, since their materiality or probable materiality is not shown by the 
pleadings of the parties except by movant's bare allegations which are disputed 
by your petitioners:</p>
<p align="justify">"BOOKS AND PAPERS OF MATERIAL DISTRIBUTORS (PHIL.) INC.</p>
<p align="justify">"1-2. Cash Receipts Journal and Cash Payments Journal.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. All Individual Ledgers, specially of the following persons 
or entities.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>b</i>) Philippine Refinery.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) Felipe Buencamino.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>d</i>) Luzon Stevedoring.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>e</i>) Standard Oil Company of New York.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>f</i>) Philippine Exchange Co., Inc.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>g</i>) Manila Laundry Company.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) That plaintiff is not entitled to the production 
and inspection of the originals of Annexes A and B because his only purpose, as 
stated in his supplemental motion, Exhibit D, was to find out if a case of 
falsification has been made, that the, issue between the parties in this regard 
is material only to your petitioners' affirmative defense, and that if 
plaintiff's purpose was as stated in said supplemental motion, then your 
petitioners claimed their privilege against self-incrimination. That this latter 
privilege was also claimed insofar as the production and inspection of the other 
documents were concerned by your petitioners in view of cousel for respondent 
Lope Sarreal's charge to the Honorable City Fiscal for the City of Manila that 
your petitioners were violating our Corporation Law."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On September 27, 1947, respondent judge denied the motion for 
reconsideration.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners impugn the validity of the orders of July 16 and 
September 27, 1947, as were issued by the respondent judge in excess of his 
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of his discretion, and prayed for the annulment 
or modification of the order of July 16, 1947.</p>
<p align="justify">Respondent Sarreal advance the following reasons to show that 
the orders complained of were not issued in excess of the trial court's 
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<i>a</i>) The motions of the respondent Lope Sarreal of May 
27, 1947 and June 4, 1947 contain allegations of the ultimate fact that the 
"books and papers mentioned in said motions constitute or contain evidence 
material to the matters involved in the case and are in the possession, custody 
or control of the petitioners herein, and allegation to this effect is adequate 
showing of good cause for the production and inspection of the documents 
mentioned therein, being an allegation in the very words used in Form 11 of the 
Appendix Forms of our Rules of Court, and therefore a sufficient complaince with 
said Rule (Go Tianco vs. Judge Diaz, et al., G. R. L-7, January 22, 1946, 
reported in the June 1946 issue of the Official Gazette).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>b</i>) Article 46 of the Code of Commerce invoked by the 
petitioners does not apply to cases of production and inspection of books and 
papers belonging to a party to the action in which such production and 
inspection are sought (Decision of Supreme Court of Spain of March 30, 1894). At 
any rate, said Article of the Code of Commerce lias been impliedly repealed by 
Act No. 190, pertinent portions of which are now embodied in our Rules of Court 
(3 Op. of Atty. Gen. 380).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) Neither would, the inspection of books and papers 
of the petitioners amount to a violation of the inviolability of correspondence 
under Sec. 1, No. 5, Article III of the Constitution of the Philippines, 
considering that the inspection of said books and papers are sought through 
proper order of the trial court, and the Constitutional provision invoked by the 
petitioners precisely allows inspection of communication and correspondence 
<i>upon lawful order of the court</i>. Moreover, this provision of our 
Constitution creates no new right, being merely a re-enforcement of the 
Constitutional prohibition against <i>unreasonable</i> searches and seizures 
(Sinco, Philippine Government and Political Law, 4th Edition, p. 632), and when 
the inspection of such books and papers was allowed 'upon lawful order of the 
court' made through the respondent Judge, such inspection cannot be considered 
as <i>unreasonable</i> altho such books and papers are private in character 
(First National Bank vs. Hughes, 6 Fed., C 737, 741, appeal dismissed for want 
of jurisdiction in 106 U. S., 523, 27 Law ed., 268, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep., 489; 
Johnson Steel Street-Rail Co. vs. North Branch Steel Co., 48 Fed., 191; Victor 
G. Beede Co. vs. Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Co., 98 Fed., 175, affirmed in 52 
L.R.A., 734, 45 C.C.A., 354, 106 Fed., 396, where this question was not 
involved; Burnham vs. Morrissey, 14 Gray, 226, 74 Am. Dec., 676; United States 
vs. Terminal R. Assoc., 148 Fed., 486; Re Dunn, 9 Mo. App., 255; Elder vs. 
Bogardus, 1 Edm. Sel. Cas., 110; Boston &amp; M.R. Co. vs. State [N. H.], 77 
Atl. 996; Hopkinson vs. Burghley, L. R. 2ch., 447; Groker-Wheeler Co. vs. 
Bullock [C. C.], 134 Fed., 241; Re Bolster, 110 Pac., 547).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>d</i>) The inspection of said documents is not for the 
purpose of "fishing evidence" but with a view to enabling the respondent Lope 
Sarreal to designate with particularity in the <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> to be 
obtained in connection with the trial of the case on its merits the specific 
books and papers containing the entry of receipts and payments made by the 
petitioners, such books and papers, being material to the case in view, among 
others, of the allegations in the amended complaint that the defendants, the 
petitioners herein, had been remitting all or the greater volume of the proceeds 
from the sales of equipments and materials of the defendants in Civil Case No. 
2059 outside the jurisdiction of the trial court and had been disposing of their 
properties with the intention of defrauding their creditors. At any rate, 
"fishing expedition" is allowed and is precisely contemplated in Rule 21 of our 
Rules of Court as a weapon of discovery (XXVI Am. Bar. Ass. Jur. No. 1, Jan. 
1940, 48; Golden vs. Arcadia Mutual Casualty Company, D. C. I11., 1942, 2 F. R. 
D. 26; Leach vs. Griff Bros. Coop. Corp., D. C. Miss., 1942, 3 F. R. D. 444; 
Civil Aeronautics Board of Aeronautic Authority vs. Canadian Colonial Airways, 
D. C., 1941, 41 F. S. 1006; Quemus Theatre Co. vs. Warner Bros. Pictures, D. C. 
N. J., 1940, 35 F. S., 949; United Mercantile Agency v. Silver Fleet Motor 
Express, D.C. Ky., 1941, 1 F. R. D., 709; Walling vs. Richmon Screw Anchor 
Company, D. C. N. Y., 1943, 4 F. R. D., 265; Monarch Liquor Corp. vs. Schenley 
Distillers Corp., D. C. N. Y., 1941, 2 F. R. D., 51; Walsh vs. Comm. Mutual Life 
insurance Company of Hartford, Conn. [1939], 26 F. Supp., 556; Olson 
Transportation Company vs. Socony Vacuum Oil Company, 7 F. R. D., 234).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>e</i>) The originals of Annexes A and B are relevant not 
only to the case of the defendants but also to that of the plaintiff in Civil 
Case No. 2059 here involved, in view of the issue of fact raised by the 
pleadings of the parties as to whether the originals of Annexes A and B have 
been falsified by the insertion therein of the names of Gil J. Puyat and Raymond 
Lehmann <i>after</i> said Annexes were signed by respondent Lope Sarreal and 
delivered to the petitioner Harry Lyons, in view of which respondent Lope 
Sarreal is entitled to the production and inspection thereof under the 
provisions of Rule 21 of our Rules of Court.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>f</i>) Even if ocular inspection of said Annexes A and B 
may reveal falsification thereof by the petitioners amounting to a violation of 
the applicable provisions of our Revised Penal Code, the petitioners cannot 
exempt themselves from the production of said exhibits for <i>mere 
inspection</i> and copying, inasmuch as the Constitutional prohibition against 
self-incrimination has been extended in specific cases <i>only</i> to the 
production of documents as <i>evidence</i>, and <i>only</i> when the person 
producing them is made to take the witness stand and identify them under oath, 
and not to the production of such documents for <i>mere inspection</i> (Comm. 
vs. Southern Express Co., 1914, 160 Ky., 1, 169 SW., 517, annotated cases 1916A, 
373, L. R. A., 1915B, 913; U. S. vs. Hughes, 12 Blatchff, 553); the reason being 
that the Constitutional prohibition is one against compelling a person to be a 
'witness against himself', and this has been held to mean <i>testimonial 
compulsion</i> or extraction of admission from the <i>person's own lips</i> (4 
Wigmore, 865, 2263; Wilson vs. U. S., 55 Law. ed., 776, citing cases). </p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>g</i>) Moreover, the corporate records sought to be 
inspected are not covered by the Constitutional prohibition against 
self-incrimination, even though such documents may contain evidence tending to 
subject any or all of the officers of a corporation to a criminal indictment 
(Wilson vs. U. S. 221 U. S., 36I, 51 Law ed., 771; Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. vs. 
Walling, 327 U. S., 186, 90 Law. ed., 614, 627-629; U. S. vs. Bauch &amp; Lamp 
Optical Co., 321 U. S., 707, 88 Law ed., 1024, 1037 [1944]; U.S. vs. White, 88 
Law. ed., 1547).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>h</i>) Production and inspection of documents have been 
allowed and sustained in decided cases, under Orders which were broader than 
those here assailed, for the production and inspection of all books of accounts, 
all memoranda and and records, stock book, ledger, journal, cash book, bank 
book, bank deposit slip, check book, voucher, contract, income tax return, 
booking record and correspondence (U.S. v. Duodera, 1 F. R. S., 466, U. S. D. C. 
June 16, 1939; Orange Country Theater Corp. vs. League, 1 F. R. S., 448).</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>i</i>) The respondent Judge, before issuing the Orders 
complained of, gave the parties full opportunity, not only to discuss the 
question involved by repeated oral arguments but also by written memoranda, and 
in the exercise of his discretion issued the Orders complained of only after 
full consideration of all the questions of fact and law 
involved."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The production and inspection of documents and books here in 
question call for the interpretation and application of section 1 of Rule 21, 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SECTION 1. <i>Motion for production or inspection; 
order</i>.—Upon motion of any party showing good cause therefor and upon notice 
to all other parties, the court in which an action is pending may (<i>a</i>) 
order any party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or 
photographing, by or on behalf of the moving party, of any designated documents, 
papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects or tangible things, not 
privileged, which constitute or contain evidence material to any matter involved 
in the action and which are in his possession, custody or control; or (<i>b</i>) 
order any party to permit entry upon designated land or other property in his 
possession or control for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, surveying, or 
photographing the property or any designated relevant object or operation 
thereon. The order shall specify the time, place and manner of making the 
inspection and taking copies and photographs, and may prescribe such terms and 
conditions as are just." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Petitioners contend that in filing his original and 
supplemental motions, Sarreal has failed to show good cause for the issuance of 
the requested order. It appears, however, in the original motion of May 27, 
1947, that the books and papers therein mentioned "constitute or contain the 
evidence material to the matters involved in the above entitled case." </p>
<p align="justify">In the supplemental motion of June 4, 1947, it is alleged that 
there is direct conflict between the allegations of the complaint and amended 
complaint and those of the answer and amended answer as to whether or not the 
names of Gil J. Puyat and Raymond W. Lehmann appear in any part of the originals 
of Annexes A and B of the complaint, and plaintiff Sarreal wanted the production 
and inspection of said originals to show that they did not contain the names of 
Gil J. Puyat and Raymond W. Lehmann, and that if said names should appear now 
typed in said Annexes A and B, said additional names must have been typed by 
direction of Harry Lyons without the knowledge or consent of Sarreal and after 
said originals were delivered by Harry Lyons and filed by the latter and that 
the changes so introduced are a forgery. </p>
<p align="justify">With these allegations in the original and supplemental motions 
Sarreal has fulfilled the requirement of showing good cause for the production 
and inspection of the books and documents in question under Rule 21.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners contend that the order of the trial judge violated 
petitioners' constitutional right against self-incrimination.</p>
<p align="justify">We have considered carefully the reasons advanced by 
petitioners in their pleadings and memoranda in support of this allegation and 
we found nothing in them to show how, without the inspection of Annexes A and B 
of the complaint, petitioners may incriminate themselves. We have, therefore, to 
dismiss such contention.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners contend that the orders complained of trampled upon 
petitioners' right to the inviolability of the correspondence and communication 
as guaranteed by the following provisions of the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(3) The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not 
be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, to be 
determined by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the 
complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the 
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. (Sec. 1, Art. III, 
Constitution of the Philippines.)</p>
<p align="justify">"(5) The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be 
inviolable except upon lawful order of the court or when public safety and order 
require otherwise." (Sec. 1, Art. III, Constitution of the 
Philippines.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The orders in question, issued in virtue of the provisions of 
Rule 21, pertain to a civil procedure that cannot be identified or confused with 
the unreasonable searches prohibited by the Constitution. But in the erroneous 
hypothesies that the production and inspection of books and documents in 
question is tantamount to a search warrant, the procedure outlined by Rule 21 
and followed by respondent judge place them outside the realm of the prohibited 
unreasonable searches. There is no question that, upon the pleadings in the 
case, Sarreal has an interest in the books and documents in question, that they 
are material and important to the issues between him and petitioners, that 
justice will be better served if all the facts pertinent to the controversy are 
placed before the trial court.</p>
<p align="justify">The constitutional guarantee of privacy of communication and 
correspondence will not be violated, because the trial court has power and 
jurisdiction to issue the order for the production and inspection of the books 
and documents in question in virtue of the constitutional guarantee making an 
express exception in favor of the disclosure of communication and correspondence 
upon lawful order of a court of justice.</p>
<p align="justify">After a careful consideration of the legal questions raised by 
petitioners, this Court has arrived at the conclusion that the trial judge, in 
issuing the order of July 16, 1947, has not exceeded his jurisdiction or acted 
with grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition denied with costs against petitioners.</p>
