				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The soul is transfixed in horror by the extreme wantonness and brutality of 
the murders involved in this case. Two helpless women and three innocent 
children were attacked while asleep and butchered for a most trivial motive in 
their dwelling in the sitio of Sacub, barrio of Sinayawan, municipality of Sta. 
Cruz, province of Davao, on the night of November 10, 1947. The victims were 
Cuya Baga Lim, 35; her children Emilia Lim, 9, and Eli Lim, 8; her maidservant 
Constancia Bagaan, 30; and the latter's daughter, Candelaria Bagaan 7. 
<p>The nearest neighbor of the victims was the accused Dialang, a non-Christian 
belonging to a tribe called Calagan, whose house was only about 30 meters 
distant from theirs, iihen he was investigated by the constabulary as to what he 
knew of the horrible occurrence he made a statement to this effect: That about 
five o'clock in the afternoon of November 10, 1947, he went to the river near 
his house to fetch water and there saw and heard Unte Tagacaolo, Cania Galagan, 
Faustino Tagacaolo, Muda Tagacaolo, Cildo Galagan, and Makinista Calagan 
conversing and plotting to kill the Chinese widow named Cuya who owned a store 
near his house; that Unte proposed to kill Cuya because she had much money, she 
having just sold some corn; that Faustino seconded the proposition because she 
sold her wares at an exorbitant price; that he (Dialang) tried to dissuade them 
from their evil purpose, even telling then that Cuya was the only one who owned 
a store near then, and that he left them still planning to kill her; that during 
the night of November 10, prayers were being said in the house of Cuya which 
ended about ten o'clock; that not long after that Cania Calagan and four others 
came to his house and called for Muda Tagacaolo, who was already in his 
(Dialang's) house waiting; that Muda joined them and while downstairs they all 
agreed to continue their plan but waited for some time because it was still 
early; that he (Dialang) was afraid and tried his best to advise them not to 
commit the crime, but Faustino warned him to keep quiet or else they would also 
kill him; that about twelve o'clock they left and went directly to the store; 
that Cania was armed with a home-made shotgun; Cildo, with an ax, and the others 
with bolos; that while they were walking towards the store of Cuya he (Dialang) 
followed them and hid himself among the bananas in front of the store; that 
Cildo Calagan called the Chinese woman on pretext to buy some dried fish; that 
when the store was opened Gildo entered first, Unte next, and then Faustino and 
Makinista followed; that Cania Calagan guarded the main door of the store while 
Muda guarded the kitchen door; that immediately he heard a woman cry inside and 
then heard a shot; that a crying child was able to escape outside through the 
kitchen but was pursued and killed by Muda; that because he was very much afraid 
he returned to his house and waited till morning, when he reported the case to 
Mr. Pio Acot, president of the parents-teachers association of Sacub. (Exhibit 
B.)</p>
<p>Upon being apprehended Muda, another non-Christian belonging to a tribe 
called Tagacaolo, admitted his participation in the crime, saying that he was 
called by Cania and Faustino and that he went with them because he was afraid 
they might kill him; that his companions were Faustino, Cildo, Cania, Unte, and Makinista; that during the attack one girl was able to escape through the 
kitchen but that he was able to catch and kill her; that Cania found some money 
and gave him some amount near the school-house of Sacub and after that they all 
returned to their respective homes; and that the following morning he escaped to 
Mandulog where he was apprehended bj soldiers. (Exhibit C.)</p>
<p>The constabulary filed a complaint for robbery with multiple homicide against 
Dialang and all the persons implicated by him in his statement. </p>
<p>When the case was called before the justice of the peace of Sta. Cruz for 
preliminary investigation, the accused Cildo and Muda pleaded guilty and swore 
to written statements before the justice of the peace to the effect that Dialang 
was their ringleader and that they (Cildo and Muda) were induced by him to 
participate in the commission of the crime. They made no mention of the accused 
Unte, Cania, Faustina, and Makinista, and the constabulary said it had no 
proof against them. The complaint was then and there amended by excluding the 
said accused and including only Cildo, Muda, and Dialang.</p>
<p>After the preliminary investigation Dialang, who pleaded not guilty, admitted 
before Policeman Felicisimo Bolado of Sta. Cruz in a conversation they had at 
the municipal jail that he (Dialang) was there confined because he had killed 
Cuya Lim, Eli, and Candelaria. The policeman reported that conversation later to 
the chief of police, Tamoteo Aguilar, who took Dialang's statement by 
question-and-answer in writing and later brought Dialang before the justice of 
the peace where Dialang swore to and thumbmarked his said statement Exhibit E 
after the justice of the peace had explained to him its contents and asked him 
whether they were true.</p>
<p>After the trial of the case in the Court of First Instance Judge Enrique A. 
Fernandez found the accused Dialang and Muda guilty of five separate crimes of 
murder (acquitting them of robbery for lack of sufficient evidence) and 
sentenced each of them to life imprisonment for each of the five murders with an 
indemnity of P2,000 in each case. The accused Cildo was found guilty as an 
accomplice of each of the five murders and was sentenced in each case to suffer 
an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of <i>prision correccional</i> 
as minimum to 10 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum, with the 
appropriate indemnity in each case. From that sentence the three accused have 
appealed.</p>
<p>The main proofs against the accused are their respective confessions before 
the justice of the peace of Sta. Cruzâ€”Exhibits E (by Dialang), F (by Cildo) and 
G (by Muda); and the only question before us is whether said confessions were 
made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the facts therein narrated.</p>
<p>The accused Dialang, 58, is married to a sister of the accused Muda, 40, and 
is the grandfather of the accused Cildo, 17.</p>
<p>Timoteo Acot, one of the neighbors of the victims, testified that about 6:30 
in the morning of November 11, 1947, Dialang came to his house and told him that 
Cuya had been robbed and that there was plenty of blood and many died. This 
witness testified: "I asked him, 'Why is it that you did not find out what 
happened before you came here?' He said he was afraid. I told him to go to the 
barrio lieutenant, but he refused on account of the distance. He insisted that I 
should go with hin to find out what happened and because of that I went with 
him. We went to the place of the incident, to the house of Cuya Daga Lim. On 
our way we met the rural policeman and I told him to report to the barrio 
lieutenant."</p>
<p>Juan Armilla, sergeant of the constabulary, testified in substance as 
follows: About one o'clock in the afternoon of November 12, 1947, I was assigned 
to investigate the killing at Sacub, Sta. Cruz, Davao. I went to the place where 
the dead persons were. The nearest neighbor is Dialang. I asked him whether he 
heard any cry or shout of persons that night inasmuch as he is near the place, 
lie said that he did not hear. I asked him whether some persons happened to 
sleep in his house and he said Muda slept there on the 10th of November. I asked 
him where Muda was and he said he was no longer there. I took him around to the 
neighbors of his house. On November 13 Dialang admitted that Makinista, Cildo, 
and Cania Calagan were the ones who killed the Chinese. I got these men and 
brought them to Malalag. I delivered them to Captain Castillo and the latter and 
another sergeant investigated them. I arrested Muda in Bocalil on November 18. 
On the way to Malalag I investigated him and he admitted that he was the 
companion of Dialang in killing those persons. I brought him to Malalag and 
turned him over to the company commander and he was investigated by Sergeant 
Fabiania. </p>
<p>David Fabiania, sergeant of the constabulary, testified that he investigated 
the accused Dialang and wrote his statement Exhibit B which he (Dialang) later 
thumbmarked before the justice of the peace; that he also took the statement of 
Muda (Exhibit C) and that the latter affixed his thumbmark to it before the 
justice of the peace of Sta. Cruz, who asked Muda if the contents were true 
after it was translated to Muda in the Cebuano Visayan dialect. He further 
testified in substance as follows: On November 24, 1947, Muda was brought to the 
justice of the peace of Sta. Cruz for preliminary trial. After the trial I had a 
conversation with him. He told me that the bolo he used in the commission of the 
crime was thrown by him into the river. Because he was already delivered to the 
jailer at ota. Cruz, I requested permission to bring Muda with me to recover the 
bolo. lie also said that there was a khaki pant which he took from the house of 
Cuya Daga Lim and which he also threw away. I brought him to the place where he 
said he threw the khaki pant and the bolo. When we arrived at the place I asked 
him to look for the bolo and khaki pants. He could not find them because during 
those days it was rainy season and the river had overflowed its banks.</p>
<p>Felicisimo Bolado, patrolman of Sta. Cruz, Davao, testified in substance as 
follows: On November 24, I was sergeant of the guard and I inspected the 
municipal jail and found Cania, Cildo, and Dialang there. I asked them what 
crime they were charged with and Dialang answered that he had killed Cuya Lim, 
Eli, and Candelaria and that his companion was Muda, who killed Emilia and 
Constancia. I asked him why he killed them and he said that at nine o'clock in 
the morning Cuya tried to collect from him his indebtedness of P7 and that he 
was not able to pay his indebtedness and Cuya got angry and scolded him, calling 
him a shameless Calagan and slapped him on his left cheek and he showed to me 
one of his teeth which was moving due to the slapping. During that conversation 
Cildo and Cania were present. At that time Muda was with the MPC. The chief of 
pollco was absent. When he arrived on November 26 I reported to him the 
confession given to me by Dialang. He sent for Dialang and asked him whether he 
was the one who killed at Sacub and Dialang answered yes. The chief of police 
took his affidavit in Visayan. After the affidavit was finished Biclang was 
brought before the justice of the peace with the affidavit which is Exhibit E. 
The justice of the peace read the affidavit and asked Dialang whether the 
contents are true and he answered they are true.</p>
<p>Timoteo Aguilar, chief of police of Sta. Cruz, testified in substance as 
follows: On the morning of November 24, 1947, I investigated Muda and Cildo. 
They were brought out of the jail to my office preparatory to the preliminary 
investigation which was set on that day and in my investigation they admitted 
before me that they committed the crime charged. After I was convinced that what 
they told me was true I typed their statements. After typing their statements I 
took them to the justice of the peace to have their oaths taken. Exhibit F is 
the statement of Cildo and Exhiibit G is the statement of Muda. The justice of 
the peace read and explained to the accused the contents of Exhibits F and G and 
after reading and explaining to them they were asked if the contents were true 
and the accused Cildo and Muda said yes. After the preliminary investigation 
Sergeant Fabiania asked permission from me to bring with him Muda in order to 
show to Sergeant Fabiania the river or place where Muda had thrown the west 
point cloth and the bolo. I was informed later that they "were not able to 
recover those things because on the previous days the river overflowed its banks 
and probably those things were carried away by the flood. On November 26, when I 
reported to the office, Patrolman Bolado approached me and told me that Dialang 
had confessed to him and admitted to have participated in the killing of Cuya 
Lim and companions at Dacub. Immediately I ordered the guard to bring Dialang to 
me. When Dialang was before me I confronted him with the report made by Bolado 
and Dialang readily admitted that the conversation lie had with Bolado was true. 
On November 27 I took him before the justice of the peace with his statement 
Exhibit E. The justice of the peace ordered patrolman Bolado to read and 
translate the affidavit to Dialang.</p>
<p>Artemio Cometa, justice of the peace of Sta. Cruz, testified for the 
prosecution and vouched for the authenticity and voluntariness of the different 
confessions made by the accused and thumbmarked and sworn to by each of them 
before him, assuring the court that each of the accused thumbmarked his 
confession before him after the contents were translated and explained to him in 
the Visayan dialect and after each had affirmed before him (the J. P.) that they 
were true.</p>
<p>We shall disregard the first statements made by the accused Dialang and Muda 
to the constabulary, Exhibits B and C, as inaccurate and consider only their 
statements, Exhibits E, F, and G, taken subsequently by the chief of police of 
Sta. Cruz.</p>
<p>Exhibits E and E-1, translated into English as Exhibits E-2 and E-3, read as 
follows:</p>
<p>"I, Dialang Calagan, of legal age, married and a resident of Sacub, Padada, 
Sta. Cruz, Davao, after having been duly sworn according to law, depose and 
say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. In the evening of November 10, 1947, what happened in Sacub, Sta. Cruz, 
Davao?â€”A. Cuya, Tanciang, two children of Cuya (Emilia and Eli) and one child of 
Tanciang, Candelaria, were killed.</p>
<p>"Q. Who killed them?â€”A. I killed Cuya, Eli and Candelaria, and Muda killed 
Tanciang and Emilia.</p>
<p>"Q. why did you kill those persons?â€”A. I killed them because I was 
slanderously scolded by Cuya and her children. I was put to shame and I could no 
longer endure.</p>
<p>"Q. You said that you were put to shame; what then happened between you and 
Cuya?â€”A. I was indebted to Cuya in the amount of P7. She tried to collect from 
me my debt on Sunday at about 9:00 A.M. I told her to please wait for a while as 
I was going to harvest yet my corn. But she slanderously reprimanded me and put 
me to shame. She called me a Calagan without manners. Her children helped also 
in defaming me. And I was slapped by Cuya on my left face.</p>
<p>"Q. When did you think or decide to kill Cuya?â€”A. Muda arrived at my house at 
12:00 noon, Monday, November. 10, 1947. In the afternoon I decided to kill Cuya 
because Muda was already there who could help me.</p>
<p>"Q From the time you decided to kill Cuya please state what you actually did 
until you consummated your plot.â€”A. At about 5:00 P.M., Monday, I told Muda of 
my plan to kill Cuya. I told him the reasons ana because he is my brother-in-law 
he sympathized with me and he acceded. I tola also Muda that I will call for 
Cildo to accompany us. In the evening, after the prayer (novena) in the house of 
Cuya, I went to the house where Cildo lived and woke him up without the 
knowledge of his housemates. I told Cildo of my plan while on the way to my 
house. At the outset Cildo did not like to consent, but I forced him, he being 
my grandson and I promised him that he will just stay outside. Aaien we arrived 
at our house I woke up Muda so that we can leave without the knowledge of my 
wife and children. At about 12:00 midnight we left for the house of Cuya. I then 
opened the back door of the kitchen and entered followed by Muda while Oildo 
stayed outside, "when we entered we already drew our bolos from the scabbard. We 
saw Cuya and companions sleeping as there was a light from the lamp. I 
immediately stabbed and slashed Cuya until she died and then I killed lili and 
Candelaria. lluda killed first Tanciang and because Emilia ran outside I ordered 
Muda to follow her and he killed Emilia. When they were dead already I got one 
khaki pant. When Muda reentered the house after killing Emilia, we left passing 
thru the main door. The short west point khaki pant was taken by me from a 
hanger inside the store. When we went out I gave the pant to Muda and then we 
returned to our house while Cildo went to ths house where he was living. Early 
the next morning Muda returned to the mountains.</p>
<p>"Q. Why did you not also kill the two other children of Cuya?â€”A. We did not 
kill them because they could not yet talk and as such they could not report.</p>
<p>"Q. Why did you kill Tanciang and her daughter when they are not your 
enemies?â€”A. We killed them because they will report what we have done.</p>
<p>"Q.. In your affidavit which you have sworn to before the Justice of the 
Peace, Sta. Cruz, Davao, on November lo, 1947, you stated that Cania, Faustino, 
Makinista, Unte, Cildo and Muda were the ones who killed Cuya and companions, 
and now you stated again that the ones who killed are Muda, Cildo and you, which 
is now true?â€”A. The truth is Muda and myself while Cildo accompanied us only 
and he stayed outside of the house.</p>
<p>"Q. Why did you report Cania, Makinista, Faustino and Unte when in fact they 
are innocent?â€”A. I reported them because I was afraid of the MPC and so that it 
will not be known that I was the one who killed.</p>
<p>"Q. What else did you get from the store of Cuya?â€”A. Nothing else except the 
west point pant. We were not able to get the money because we were in a hurry to 
get out due to fear of being discovered.</p>
<p>"Q. When you were investigated by the authorities in Sacub why did you not 
tell the truth?â€”A. At the beginning I did not tell the truth as I was afraid 
that I will be killed by the MPC, but later when there were no more MPC I told 
the truth to a policeman of Sta. Cruz.</p>
<p>"Q. Do you have anything more to say?â€”A. No more. </p>
<p>"Q. Do you swear to the truth of the foregoing statement and that it is your 
own free and voluntary declaration without force, threat or intimidation nor any 
promise of reward of any kind?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p></blockquote>

<p>As against the foregoing evidence for the prosecution, the evidence for the 
defense consists merely in the denial by each of the accused of any knowledge of 
the contents of their respective confessions.</p>
<p>Dialang testified that the contents of his confessions Exhibits B and E are 
not true. He said: "I did not know what I was signing, whether it was good or 
not. When they prepared Exhibits B and B-1 I was sleeping. I did not know where 
they prepared it. I learned of this in the following morning." This witness, 
however, cannot be believed because his testimony shows that he had no regard 
for the truth. We quote a portion of his testimony on direct examination as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. Did you, Cildo and Muda ever go to the house of Cuya on the night of 
November 10, 1947?â€”A. No, sir, I was sick, I was wearing a patadyong. I stated 
those statements because they threatened me with the revolver, they pointed to 
me the revolver.</p>
<p>"Q. Did they not explain to you the contents of Exhibits E and E-1?â€”A. No, 
sir.</p>
<p>"Q. In exhibits E and E-1 it appears that you appeared before the justice of 
the peace; is it true that you appeared before the justice of the peace in 
connection with exhibits 2 and E-1?â€”A. No, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. Please tell the truth, because I myself I am convinced that you appeared 
before the justice of the peace. Did you really not appear before the justice of 
the peace in connection with exhibits E and E-1?â€”A. No, sir."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus Dialang denied under oath having appeared before the justice of the 
peace to sign Exhibit E, although his own attorney believed, and it had been 
clearly established, that he did appear. As between his testimony and that of 
the justice of the peace, the chief of police, and Patrolman Bolado, we find 
that the trial court did not err in rejecting the former and in accepting the 
latter.</p>
<p>The testimony of Teopisto Capul, provincial warden of the City of Davao, as a 
witness for the defense, to the effect that on December 2, 1947, the accused 
Dialang was sent to the public hospital because he complained that one of his 
ribs was dislocated, has no decisive weight because such complaint of the 
accused was not verified either by the warden himself or by a doctor of the 
hospital. It was a mere self-serving statement of the accused, and the accused 
himself did not testify during the trial that one of his ribs was damaged due to 
any maltreatment inflicted by an officer of the law to extract a confession from 
him. Besides, the testimony of the provincial warden that Dialang could not walk 
alone and had to be held by other prisoners was contradicted by the next witness 
for the defense, Generoso Evangelico, who testified that he was the one who 
received Dialang in the provincial jail on November 29 and that Dialang could 
walk alone, although with difficulty. Dialang in his testimony repeatedly 
asserted that he suffered from a boil.</p>
<p>The accused Cildo, also a Calagan, who pleaded guilty before the justice of 
the peace, according to the record and according to the latter's testimony, 
denied that he entered that plea. He said that he was maltreated by the soldiers 
in the house of Dialang. On cross-examination he testified in part as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. And during that preliminary investigation of the case the justice of the 
peace asked you whether you were guilty of the murder of Cuya, and you answered 
the justice of the peace that you were guilty?â€”A. I stated I was not guilty.</p>
<p>"Q. Just tell the truth, is it not true that you said yes, there were many 
people there?â€”A. I stated I was not guilty.</p>
<p>"Q. And during the time that the justice of the peace was asking you, your 
other coaccused were there, hearing your confession, is that not true?â€”A. I did 
not say that I was guilty.</p>
<p>"Q. And during that investigation or preliminary investigation of your case 
the justice of the peace showed you a paper and asked you to thirnbmark that 
paper, is that right?â€”A. I was made to sign certain caper but I did not know 
what it was.</p>
<p>"Q. But it was the justice of the peace who asked you to thumbmark on that 
paper, is that right?â€”A. He said to sign it because it is for our own good.</p>
<p>"Q. And when you put your thurabmark on said paper, all your coaccused were 
present, is that true?â€”A. They were there and they saw.</p>
<p>"Q. They also heard your conversation with the justice of the peace relative 
to that paper on which you were placing your thumbmark?â€”A. Maybe they heard, 
because they were there.</p>
<p>"Q. And after you narked that paper, the justice of the peace called your 
coaccused Muda and had a talk with him, is that true?â€”A. Me was asked.</p>
<p>"Q. And the justice of the peace showed Muda some paper and asked Muda to 
thumbmark that paper, is that true?â€”A. Muda was forced to sign.</p>
<p>"Q. Who forced him?â€”A. The justice of the peace.</p>
<p>"Q. What did the justice of the peace say in having Mud a sign that paper?â€”A. 
He said to sign it because it is for his own good."</p></blockquote>
<p>The accused Muda, who lived in Bocalil, about two days' walk from Sacub, 
admitted that on the night of November 10, 1947, he was in Sacub, to ask his 
sister, the wife of Dialang, to help him harvest his palay, but that she could 
not go with him because her husband Dialang was sick with a boil. He testified 
that he was forced to thumbmark his concfession, Exhibits G and G-1. From the 
testimony of this accused it also appears that he has little or no regard for 
the truth. We quote from his testimony on cross-examination as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. You remember that during the preliminary investigation the justice of the 
peace had a talk with you right in his court, is that right?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. The justice of the peace spoke to you about the killing of Cuya and 
members of her family, is that right?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. And during that preliminary investigation the justice of the peace showed 
to you some document which you thumbmarked later on, is that right?â€”A. Yes, 
sir.</p>
<p>"Q.. And during your conversation with the justice of the peace and during 
the time that you were talking with him about the killing of Cuya Lira and some 
members of her family there were plenty of people who were inside the Court 
room, is it not?â€”A. Many people.</p>
<p>"Q. And during your conversation with the justice of the peace your coaccused 
Dialang and Cildo were present and hearing that conversation, is that right?â€”A. 
They were not.</p>
<p>"Q. They were not there?â€”A. They were there but they did not hear our 
conversation, myself and the justice of the peace.</p>
<p>"Q. And during that occasion the justice of the peace also had a talk with 
Cildo, is it not?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. And their conversation was about the killing of Cuya Lim and some members 
of her family, is it not?â€”A. No, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. But you have just told us that they had conversation. Tell the truth.â€”A. 
No, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. What were they talking about?â€”A. They were not talking anything.</p>
<p>"Q. Is it not true that during that occasion Cildo also thumbmarked some 
paper?â€”A. No, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. Are you sure of that?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. I want to call your attention that Cildo has testified here and stated 
that he had thumbmarked certain paper in your presence at the office of the 
justice of the peace. Tell the truth now.â€”A. There was none.</p>
<p>"Q. But Cildo was present during that occasion?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. And so also was Dialang?â€”A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>"Q. So it is not true then that the two were not present?â€”A. They were 
there."</p></blockquote>
<p>We do not accept confessions readily and without due care and caution because 
we are aware that some officers of the law resort to the illegal and. 
reprehensible tactics of extorting confessions thru violence and intimidation 
(People <em>vs</em>. Tipay, G.R. Mo. 49014, March 31, 1944<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup>). But in the present case we believe with 
the trial judge that the confessions of the accused were voluntary and true. The 
fact that the four individuals who were at first implicated by Dialang and Kuda 
and who were also arrested and included in the original complaint were not 
forced to sign any confession or statement, tends to show that the constabulary 
and the local police acted properly in handling this case.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General recommends affirmance and we find his recommendation in 
order. The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Pablo,

<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">
<br><br>PARAS, <em>J</em>., dissenting: 
<p>I vote to reverse the appealed judgment and to acquit the appellants.</p>
<p>Appellants' conviction is based exclusively on appellants' alleged 
confessions. Not a single eyewitness, and not even a scintilla of circumstancial 
evidence, was presented by the prosecution.</p>
<p>On November 18, 1947, appellant Dialang signed an affidavit (Exhibit B) in 
which he imputed the killing of Cuya Daga Lim, Constancia Bagaan, Candelaria 
Bagaan, Eli Lim and Emilia Lim to Unte Tagacaolo, Cania Calagan, Faustino 
Tagacaolo, Muda Tagacaolo, Cildo Calagan and Makinista Calagan, the motive being 
robbery. This resulted in the filing in the justice of the peace court of Santa 
Cruz on November 18, 1947, of the corresponding complaint against these 
individuals.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1947, appellant Cildo signed an affidavit (Exhibit F) in 
which ho stated that appellants Dialang and huda were the authors of the crime, 
that he accompanied said appellants to the house of Cuya at midnight of November 
10, because he was forced to do so by Dialang; that the motive for the crime was 
robbery.</p>
<p>On the same date, November 24, 1947, appellant Muda signed an affidavit, 
(Exhibit G) in which he stated that he and appellants Dialang and Cildo were the 
authors of the killing in question, the motive being robbery. These later 
affidavits caused the filing in the justice of the peace court of Santa Crus on 
November 24, 1947, of an amended complaint naming as defendants only appellants 
Dialang, Muda and Cildo.</p>
<p>On November 27, 1947, appellant Dialang signed another affidavit (Exhibit E) 
in which he admitted that he killed Cuya, Eli and Gandelaria, while Muda killed 
Constancia and Emilia; that the crime was committed because Dialang was 
slanderously reprimanded by Cuya and her children; that appellant Cildo was 
present during the commission of the crine but only remained outside of Cuya's 
house.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1947, appellant Muda signed another affidavit (Exhibit C) in 
which he admitted that he, Faustino, Cilco and Cania were the authors of the 
killing of Cuya and members of her family, no motive for the crime being 
given.</p>
<p>The charge against the herein appellants was robbery with multiple homicide. 
Under the appealed judgment, the crime is only murder, appellants Dialang and 
Muda being the principals, and appellant Cildo (17 years old) an accomplice.</p>
<p>The alleged confessions of appellants cannot be the safe basis for 
conviction, in view of their rather irreconcilable conflict. It is noteworthy 
that in the first confession of appellant Dialang, he incriminated persons other 
than the herein appellants. In the later affidavit of appellant Muda, Dialang 
was not incriminated. In the first affidavit of appellant Dialang, as well as in 
the first affidavit of appellant Muda, Cildo is accused as a principal. In the 
first affidavit of Dialang, the motive for the crime is given as robbery, and 
this is the same motive given in almost all the other affidavits, except the 
affidavit of appellant Dialang dated November 27, 1947, in which the motive 
given is the reprimand of Dialang by Cuya and her children. Any conviction based 
on such conflicting affidavits will be shaky and unreliable. If one confession 
may be believed, any of the other confessions may also be believed. As the 
motive for the crime preponderantly indicated in the. confessions is robbery, 
and as the trial court itself ruled that there is no evidence on record showing 
that anything was robbed from Cuya's house, the said confessions have to be 
discredited for being false in at least one vital aspect. Indeed, there is 
evidence on record to the effect that the things in the store of Cuya were found 
to be intact and in orderly arrangements soon after the commission of the 
crime.</p>
<p>When we add to the foregoing considerations the fact that the alleged 
confessions are flatly repudiated by the herein appellants, on the ground that 
they were secured thru maltreatment, we have more than a reasonable doubt as to 
the guilt of appellants. This allegation of maltreatment finds corroboration in 
the following testimony of the provincial warden of Davsot</p>
<p>"Court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. When were the prisoners received?â€”A. November 29th.</p>
<p>"Q. Actually from whom did Dialang ask permission to go to the public 
hospital?â€”A. I usually go inside the jail and find who are the prisoners who are 
sick and he told me that he is sick.</p>
<p>"Q. Do you remember when was the first time he told you that he was sick?â€”A. 
Yes, sir, December 2.</p>
<p>"Q. Did he tell you what kind of sickness he was suffering?â€”A. He told me 
that one of his ribs is dislocated.</p>
<p>"Q. Did he tell you the cause of that dislocation?â€”A. I asked him and he told 
me that it was buttstroke by the MPC during the investigation in connection with 
the murder at Sta. Cruz.</p>
<p>"Q. On December 4, 5, 10, 13 and January 12 he was suffering the same 
sickness?â€”A. He did not complain any more, but that is our practice every 
morning we opened the gate of the jail and send prisoners who wanted to go to 
the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>"Q. You do not ask them what kind of sickness the prisoners has. He might be 
only pretending to be sick so that he could not go out and work?â€”A. That is our 
practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be best to find out.</p>
<p>"Q. Who is attending the prisoners of the hospital, do you know?â€”A. If the 
sickness is serious the physician, but if not, only the attendants.</p>
<p>"Q. He did not complain to you that he has boil?â€”A.He did not, Your 
Honor.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Es todo.</p>
<p>"Attorney Mangune: Re-direct.</p>
<p>"Q. During the time that you had the accused Dialang under your custody and 
during the time that you sent him to the hospital, did you notice that he was 
only pretending to be sick?â€”A. I don't think so, because whenever he walked he 
is being held by other prisoners. That was about a week when he arrived, after 
his arrival. He could not stand very well."</p></blockquote>
<p>Another circumstance that militates against the guilt at least of appellant 
Dialang, is the fact that he was the one who reported the incident in question 
to the witness for the prosecution, Timoteo Acot.</p></div>
