				G.R. No. L-4155, December 17, 1952</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF FERNANDO, FRANCISCA, RAFAEL, AND MARIA CANDELARIA, ALL SURNAMED BAUTISTA, MINORS. FELISA PANGILINAN VDA. DE BAUTISTA, GUARDIAN. UNITED STATES VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE, VS. ADELA BUSTOS, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Special proceedings No. 7688 of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila is the proceeding for the guardianship of the minors Fernando, Francisca, 
Rafael, and Maria Candelaria, all surnamed Bautista, instituted in said court on 
March 17, 1949. The People's Bank and Trust Company is the guardian appointed by 
the court of their properties, and Felisa Pangilinan Vda. de Bautista, the 
mother of the minors, of their persons. Letters of guardianship were issued to 
the above-mentioned bank on April 27, 1949; the record does not disclose when 
the corresponding letters were issued to the minors' mother.
<p align="justify">On December 13, 1949, the minors' mother signed a document 
entitled "Deed of Loan" (Annex A), wherein she declares having borrowed and 
received from Adela Bustos, for the support of her minor children, rice, 
clothing, and money from May 3, 1945, to January 1, 1949, by way of loan, with a 
total value of P6,525, which "will be paid in full in favor of Miss Bustos * * * 
as soon as the claim for pension in favor of the above-named six children shall 
have been approved and received." On February 28, 1950, Adela Bustos filed a 
claim in the special proceedings for the total sum of 16,525 on the basis of the 
above-described "Deed of Loan," alleging that the expenses for the maintenance 
and education of the wards during the period from May 3, 1945, to January 1, 
1949, were shouldered and advanced by the claimant, as evidenced by said "Deed 
of Loan." Opposition to this claim was filed by the U. S. Veterans 
Administration. Without any evidence having been offered or submitted, the court 
disallowed the claim, and against this disallowance an appeal has been taken 
directly to this court. </p>
<p align="justify">The gist of claimant's appeal is that the minors' mother was 
the <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> guardian of the minors properties, and may, therefore, validly 
encumber the same for "necessaries" furnished said minors for their support, and 
that equity and justice demand that as the minors benefited from the loan, 
technicalities should be brushed aside and the claim paid. </p>
<p align="justify">Neither the arguments of claimant-appellant nor the authorities 
cited by her in support thereof can apply to the facts of the case at bar. The 
minors mother was their natural guardian, entitled to their custody and care and 
responsible for their education, but such guardianship did not extend to their 
properties. (Section 553, Code of Civil Procedure; Palet vs. Aldecoa &amp; Co., 
15 Phil., 232; Gayondato vs. Treasurer of the Philippine Islands, 49 Phil., 
236.) She was not a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> guardian; her acts were made as mother of the 
children, not as a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> guardian. It is further to be noted that the claim 
is predicated exclusively on the "Deed of Loan," which was executed even after 
the judicial guardian of the minors' properties had already been appointed and 
after she had also been appointed judicial guardian of their persons, for 
supposed expenses prior to the institution of the guardianship proceedings. No 
evidence was offered to prove that the necessaries mentioned in the deed of loan 
were actually given and were actually used or spent for the minors. The deed of 
loan itself is not sufficient to prove the above facts or competent as against 
the minors. </p>
<p align="justify">Assuming, <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span>, that the mother and her natural children 
secured loans from claimant-appellant with which to purchase the food, clothing, 
and necessaries of her minor wards or to provide them with education, she 
certainly has no power nor authority to encumber the property of the wards to 
guaranty the loan thus secured, or to bind for the payment of the loan the 
pensions that the minors may be entitled to receive thereafter. Only a judicial 
guardian of the ward's property may validly do so, and even then only with the 
court's prior approval secured in accordance with the proceedings set forth by 
the rules. (Rule 96, Rules of Court.) The execution of the "Deed of Loan" in the 
case at bar is, therefore, clearly beyond the scope of a natural guardian's 
power or authority.</p>
<p align="justify">The authorities cited are beside the issue. They refer to 
contracts for the purchase of necessaries entered into by judicial guardians, 
not by natural guardians, or to allowances paid to them (judicial guardians) for 
necessaries supplied or purchased for the ward. These questions, entirely 
different and distinct from the issue involved in the case at bar, we are not 
asked to decide. Assuming, without deciding, that the minors herein should be 
made to pay for the necessaries furnished them before their pension was 
approved, and that justice supports claimant's demand because she furnished such 
necessaries, the appropriate remedy to enforce their liability is not through 
the written promise that their natural guardian made.</p>
<p align="justify">The appeal must be, as it hereby is, dismissed, with costs 
against the claimant-appellant.</p><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo,</span>
