				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO ILUSTRE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of
 Davao, finding the appellant Pedro Ilustre guilty of treason and 
sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay a fine of 
P10,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, plus 
the costs.
  <p>    The appellant, soon after the occupation of Davao by the 
Japanese invaders, was appointed chief of police and head of the 
volunteer guards of the municipality of Mati, Davao, by the Deputy 
Governor, â€” a position which he held until April, 1943, when he was made
 liason officer of the Japanese military authorities of Mati and a 
member of the pacification committee of said municipality.</p>
  <p>    In the early part of August, 1942, the appellant reported to 
the Japanese commander of Mati that Dr. Angel Vizconde, Silvestre Lim, 
Pablo Quilab and Francisco Angsingco did not surrender their firearms 
and were supporting the guerrillas.  These four persons were accordingly
 arrested on or about August 10, 1942.  When Dr. Vizconde, Quilab, Lim 
and Angsingco were brought as prisoners by a motor boat to the wharf of 
Mati, the appellant, who was then on hand with four Japanese soldiers 
and a Japanese interpreter named Funacho, caused their hands to be tied 
behind their backs and later to be brought to the warehouse of Mrs. Marundan which was being then used as a garrison.  In the morning of 
August 11, 1942, the appellant went to the office of Tomas K. Rodriguez,
 appellant's brother-in-law and mayor of Mati during the occupation, 
accompanied by Japanese interpreter Funacho, and called justice of the 
peace Arsenio Acurantes and municipal treasurer Catalino Tuvilla for a 
conference, at which the mayor's secretary, Conrado Serrano, and a 
visitor named Primitivo Papa were also present.  Asked by Funacho about 
the conduct and behavior of Dr. Vizconde and the other three prisoners, 
the municipal officials answered that said prisoners were good people 
and law abiding-citizens.  Whereupon the appellant was enraged and said:
 "You people are cowards, you are not telling the truth.  You know that 
these people are bad people.  If you are not telling the truth I will 
take the rest of this case."  The appellant further exclaimed: "Had my 
son died due to the delay in the treatment given by Dr. Vizconde I would
 have shot him." Thereafter the appellant and Funacho left.</p>
  <p>    At about 11:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day, August 
11, 1942, five Japanese soldiers and the appellant came in a truck to 
the garrison.  With hands tied behind their backs, Dr. Angel Vizconde 
and Pablo Quilab, with three others, were brought out, loaded on the 
truck, and taken away by the appellant and his Japanese companions.  Not
 long afterwards, the truck returned to the garrison with the appellant 
and the Japanese soldiers, but without the five prisoners.  Dr. Vizconde
 and Quilab were subsequently never heard from or seen alive.  Silvestre
 Lim and Francisco Angsingco, who had also been arrested, were released 
in the morning of August 11, 1942.  These facts were testified to in 
substance by Tomas K. Rodriguez, Conrado Serrano, Primitivo Papa, Floro 
Morales, Felicisimo Cordeta, Braulio Nersa, Alberto Ravelo and Catalino 
Tuvilla.</p>
  <p>    Felicisimo Cordeta and Teodoro Salazar, testifying for the 
prosecution, stated that sometime in October, 1942, while out on patrol 
in barrio Tagabakid, municipality of Mati, Davao, the appellant ordered 
two Moro volunteer guards to burn the house of Augusto Samperi, on 
suspicion that the latter was helping the guerrillas in the mountains.</p>
  <p>    On or about January 3, 1943, George Calitas, a farmer of Mati, 
and his son-in-law Eleuterio Balente were arrested in the barrio of 
Limot, Mati, by the appellant who was then accompanied by ten of his 
policemen and some volunteer guards, then all armed.  Calitas and 
Balente were investigated by the appellant for helping the guerillas and
 were kept in the municipal jail for eighteen days, after which they 
were released by the appellant, Calitas having given the appellant a 
bribe of fifty pesos.  These facts are borne out by the testimony of 
Teodoro Salazar, George Calitas, Gorgonio Mosende and Andres Siarot.</p>
  <p>    On July 29, 1943, Faustino Bustillo, a volunteer guard under 
the appellant, was arrested with Alberto Ravelo by chief of police Duay 
of Manay.  Bustillo and Ravelo were tied together by Japanese soldiers 
upon orders of the Japanese commander of Mati to whom they were brought.
  Taken to the seashore of Mati, Bustillo and Ravelo saw the appellant 
who struck Bustillo many times with a club, while Ravelo was tortured by
 the Japanese.  The two were thereafter subjected to watercure by the 
Japanese and ordered to lie down, whereupon logs were placed over their 
bodies and on each end of the logs the Japanese soldiers see-sawed.  
During the second day of their detention in the municipal jail, Bustillo
 and Ravelo were brought out with their hands tied together and paraded 
around the municipality of Mati by the appellant and two Japanese 
soldiers.  They were, however, released on August 7, 1943, on 
recommendation of the pacification committee.  This count is established
 by the testimony of Felicisimo Cordeta, Braulio Nersa and the two 
victims Faustino Bustillo and Alberto Ravelo.</p>
  <p>    Appellant's defense consists mainly of denials which, after our
 review of the evidence, may not prevail over the positive testimony of 
the witnesses for the prosecution.  The proof of appellant's guilt is 
indeed overwhelming, specially because the witnesses for the Government 
have not been shown to be biased.  In fact, Tomas K. Rodriguez is 
appellant's brother-in-law, Catalino Tuvilla is appellant's <i>compadre,</i>
 and Felicisimo Cordeta, Braulio Nersa, Teodoro Salazar, Andres Siarot, 
and Faustino Bustillo were appellant's former subordinates during the 
occupation while he was chief of police of Mati.  If, as alleged by the 
appellant, he was instrumental in the release of Faustino Bustillo and 
Alberto Ravelo, it is surprising and unnatural that the two would 
testify falsely against him.</p>
  <p>    The appealed decision, being in accordance with the facts and 
the law, is hereby affirmed, and it is so ordered with costs against the
 appellant.</p>
  <p>    <i>Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
