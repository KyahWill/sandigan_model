				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,  PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO GARCIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Found guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentenced by the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija to suffer the penalty&nbsp; of reclusion perpetua with the&nbsp; accessories of the law, to&nbsp; indemnify the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased in the amount of P5,000 and to pay the sum of P89, the value of the palay stolen,&nbsp; and the costs, Francisco Garcia appealed from the decision contending that the lower court erred:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; in holding that the&nbsp; defendant failed to nullify by&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; duress,&nbsp; force and&nbsp; intimidation&nbsp; the confession Exhibit&nbsp; "D"; (2) in&nbsp; admitting in&nbsp; evidence said confession Exhibit "D"; (3) in finding the accused guilty, beyond reasonable&nbsp; doubt, of the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; robbery with homicide as defined and&nbsp; punished under Article 294, paragraph 1,&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code; and&nbsp; (4) in not absolving the accused on the ground of reasonable doubt. <br><br>The evidence on record conclusively shows that on Jauary 20, 1954, Mamerto Valino and his daughter Pascuala Valino went to barrio Sapang-Buhay to thresh their palay and after threshing it, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, Mamerto Valino placed&nbsp; 13 cavanes of the threshed palay in a bull cart and left the place bound for his home in Pagas.&nbsp; On his way home, upon reaching the Diversion Road, within&nbsp; the&nbsp; city of Cabanatuan, province of Nueva Ecija, he was held up and attacked by a person who left him in&nbsp; an unconscious state and ran away with the bull cart and the IB sacks of&nbsp; palay.&nbsp; Early in the morning&nbsp; of January 21, at about six o'clock, Sgt. Hernando of the P. C. headquarters in Nueva Ecija, received&nbsp; a report that&nbsp; on said road a person was lying dead in a pool of blood.&nbsp; He relayed&nbsp; it to his Commander and the latter&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; him to get some companions and go to the scene of the crime&nbsp; to investigate&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; Sgt.&nbsp; Hernando arrived&nbsp; at the place, he&nbsp; found Mamerto Valino lying&nbsp; on&nbsp; the road but still breathing and, about 15 meters away, he found a blood-stained piece of wood&nbsp; (Exhibit "A") which he picked up.&nbsp; Valino was immediately&nbsp; taken to&nbsp; the Nueva&nbsp; Ecija Provincial Hospital where, despite&nbsp; medical attention,&nbsp; he died at about&nbsp; 5:30 in the afternoon of that day.&nbsp; The cause of his death, according to Dr. Lorenzo J.&nbsp; Santarina who examined the body&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased, was "extensive and severe contusions&nbsp; of the face&nbsp; (eyes, lips and temporal region), nape and&nbsp; base of the left lateral&nbsp; aspect&nbsp; of the neck; Multiple lacerated wounds,&nbsp; forehead, face and occipital region; Avulsion&nbsp; of one upper lateral incisor."&nbsp; From the autopsy performed on the deceased, Dr. Santarina also found that&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; suffered: <br><blockquote>"(1) Fracture, linear, frontal bone, left, extending:&nbsp; to the left orbital plate; temporal-parietal bone, left. <br>(2) Intracraneal hemorrhage, extensive. <br>(3) Avulsion of one upper&nbsp; lateral incisor."</blockquote>The evidence likewise shows that in the evening of June 21, the 13 sacks of palay were&nbsp; sold&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; ricemill&nbsp; of Cheung Kiat Tuy by a person whom ha did not recognize; that Cheung Kiat Tuy paid for the 13 sacks P89 which were received&nbsp; by the seller; that the latter left the cart and&nbsp; the empty&nbsp; sacks at the store,&nbsp; saying that he was going to the market and would come back for them, but did not&nbsp; show up again;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that, early the following morning, Cheung Kiat Tuy discovered some bloodstains&nbsp; on the empty sacks and immediately reported the matter&nbsp; to the police, surrendering&nbsp; said sacks at the same time. <br><br>On January 21, 1954, at eight&nbsp; o'clock, Paacuala Valino&nbsp; went to see her father in&nbsp; the hospital and&nbsp; found him already unable to talk.&nbsp; At about eleven of the&nbsp; same morning, she saw the appellant approach the bed of her father, accompanied by somebody whom she did not know, and then appellant asked his companion: Mabuhay pa KAYA? (Will he survive?), a question which showed great concern over the condition of Mamerto Valino,&nbsp; for which reason suspicion fell on him. He was then arrested by the police of Cabanatuan City for questioning in the afternoon&nbsp; of January 22, 1954, but was released that&nbsp; same afternoon for no&nbsp; evidence was found&nbsp; against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 9:30 in the evening of the same day, he was again arrested and brought&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constabulary&nbsp; headquarters&nbsp; for further questioning.&nbsp; He at first professed ignorance of the killing, but nearing midnight he indicated to Sgt. Arturo Salvador that the man who killed Valino was one Manolito&nbsp; Santiago. He was then&nbsp; subjected to further investigation and his statement, Exhibit "G"&nbsp; was typewritten, wherein he declared that at about 6:30 in the evening of January 20,1954, Manolito Santiago and one companion held up Valino and robbed&nbsp; him of&nbsp; his bull cart and palay which&nbsp; Manolito Santiago and companion took away.&nbsp; Then Sgt.&nbsp; Salvador sent for Manolito and confronted him with the appellant. Manolito denied any participation in the robbery and stated that he was being pointed to by Francisco&nbsp; Garcia because the latter had a grudge against him on account of a certain lady both&nbsp; were&nbsp; courting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manolito was then released and appellant&nbsp; retained&nbsp; in the&nbsp; barracks.&nbsp; Early&nbsp; at&nbsp; dawn&nbsp; of January 23,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; Garcia&nbsp; called&nbsp; Sgt.&nbsp; Salvador&nbsp; and&nbsp; told him that he was,ready to confess the truth.&nbsp; His statement. Exhibit "D"&nbsp; was then taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"Ako&nbsp; si FRANCISCO&nbsp; E..&nbsp; GARCIA, alias "Kiko", may 21 taong gulang,&nbsp; binata, magsasaka at naninirahan sa&nbsp; Diversion&nbsp; dito sa lun- sod ng Cabanatuan, matapos na makapanumpa ng ayon&nbsp; sa batas&nbsp; ay malaya&nbsp; at kusang'-loob na nagsalaysay ng&nbsp; mga&nbsp; sumusunod: <br>&nbsp;<br>"Na, nuong magiika 5:00 ng hapon,&nbsp; (araw ng Miyercoles) ika 20 ng Enero, 1954, ako&nbsp; ay umalis sa&nbsp; aming bahay&nbsp; sa Diversion, at ako ay nagtungo sa&nbsp; may Out-Post ng&nbsp; Pulis sa panulnkan ng Highway Road&nbsp; at&nbsp; kaisadang bago na patungong Papaya.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Na, nang dumating ako sa n&amp;sabing panulukan&nbsp; ng&nbsp; daan ay nakakuha ako ng&nbsp; kaputol na kahoy&nbsp; (kamatsili),&nbsp; at yaon&nbsp; ay aking tinungkod-tungkod ko habang altofy naglalakad sa bagong kaisadang patimgoiig Papaya. <br>&nbsp;<br>"Na, nang dumidilim na, sa&nbsp; aking; paglalakad ay&nbsp; nakasalubong ako ng&nbsp; nagkakariton&nbsp; sa&nbsp; makalampas ng tubig humigit kumulang ay may&nbsp; layong&nbsp; mga apat na unat&nbsp; auga sa highway.&nbsp; Ang nasabing. nagkakariton ay&nbsp; isang matandang&nbsp; lalaking nagiisa lamang. <br>&nbsp;<br>"Na, ang&nbsp; sadyang layunin ko mion ay lumabaa sa bukid, nguni't ng makita kong nagiisa&nbsp; zing matandang' lalaki ay naisipan kong: harangin iyon,&nbsp; kaya't&nbsp; sa&nbsp; sandaling makalampas ng kauiiti sa akin "ang nasabing karitoii&nbsp; at&nbsp; maagapay sa akin ang&nbsp; matandang lalaki, ang ginawa ko&nbsp; ay hinampas ko ng aking dalang kahoy at siya ay tinamaan sa batok, Ang matandang lalaki y&nbsp; nahulog&nbsp; sa&nbsp; karifcoli.&nbsp; Ang ginawa ay pinangko ko siya&nbsp; at&nbsp; aking dinala sa bukid sa may gawing kanan kung mang-gagaling rito.&nbsp; Nang mailayo&nbsp; ng humigit kumulang sa mga daiawangpung&nbsp;&nbsp; (20)&nbsp; unat&nbsp; sa&nbsp; kalsada sa aking palagay,&nbsp; ay&nbsp; muli ko siyang pinalo&nbsp; sa mukba ng may sampung ttlit. <br>&nbsp;<br>"Na nang inaakala&nbsp; kong&nbsp; mamatay na ang nasabing matanda, ang ginawa ko&nbsp; ay iniwan ko&nbsp; na siya at sinakyan ko ang&nbsp; kariton.

Marania of the P.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; and that he&nbsp; had signed it to avoid being killed.&nbsp; He also&nbsp; testified that at&nbsp; the time the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar was&nbsp; perpetrated,&nbsp; he was at the store&nbsp; of Laura Martin in the Diversion Road where he&nbsp; was&nbsp; eating halo-halo&nbsp; and conversing with one Pedro, and that he remained, in that store up to ten o'clock in&nbsp; the evening. <br><br>The question therefore revolves&nbsp; about the proper valueand weight of the aforequoted&nbsp; confession marked Exhibit "D".&nbsp; It was&nbsp; evaluated by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; judge,&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; and exhaustively,&nbsp; and we make our own such evaluation which is expounded in the following portion of the&nbsp; decision: <br><blockquote>"Explaining the circumstances surrounding the taking and signing of the statement marked Exhibit "D", he&nbsp; declared that he was picked Tip&nbsp; by the police of Cabanatuan&nbsp; at about 4:30 in the afternoon of January 22, 1954, far&nbsp; investigation, but&nbsp; he was later released when they could not&nbsp; find&nbsp; any evidence against&nbsp; him. However, he was; picked up again by Sgt. Marania of the P. C. at about&nbsp; 9:30 that evening of the same day.&nbsp; After Ms arrival at the P. C. headquarters,. Sgt. Marania sailed for one&nbsp; Salvador, who asked him why he was accused of having comrn itted the robbery&nbsp; at the extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; A. Mabini street.&nbsp; He said he knew nothing&nbsp; about&nbsp; it.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was then taken&nbsp; by two&nbsp; soldiers outside&nbsp; the; barracks&nbsp; near&nbsp; the kitchen and maltreated by them.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was&nbsp; hoxed&nbsp; on the&nbsp; stomach many times and ho lost&nbsp; consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; then forced him to&nbsp; admit his guilt and&nbsp; when he refused they continued maltreating him.&nbsp; After that&nbsp; he was asked again if he would admit it, but he again refused.&nbsp; Sgt.. Torres brought him some&nbsp; papers on January 23,&nbsp; 1954, at&nbsp; about 5:00 p. m.&nbsp;&nbsp; This appears to be&nbsp; Exhibit "D" which he&nbsp; was asked to sign.&nbsp; He asked him to read&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; to&nbsp; him,&nbsp; but he refused* so he&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; sign it and they maltreated him&nbsp; again. He lost consciousness and when&nbsp; he came&nbsp; to, he was asked to sign it&nbsp; otherwise he&nbsp; would&nbsp; die,&nbsp; Again he refused.&nbsp; They then pointed their guns&nbsp; on&nbsp; his back and asked him again to sign in order that&nbsp; he would&nbsp; be&nbsp; released, which he did.&nbsp;&nbsp; After signing the said&nbsp; statement&nbsp; they stopped maltreating him.<br><br>He was then warned by the soldiers to maintain&nbsp; what he had&nbsp; signed, otherwise&nbsp; he would&nbsp; he killed. He was then&nbsp; brought in a jeep to the&nbsp; City Hall before Special&nbsp; Counsel Filomeno J. Soto,&nbsp; who read to him his statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked&nbsp; if he&nbsp; admitted the truth&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same, he answered&nbsp; in the affirmative, because of the warning given him by the P. C. Soldiers. From there he went back to the&nbsp; Philippine Constabulary headquarters where&nbsp; ho stayed&nbsp; for five&nbsp; days.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; was&nbsp; later examined&nbsp; by Dr, Ronqirillo, City&nbsp; Health Officer,&nbsp; for physical injuries. <br><br>The&nbsp; whole&nbsp; case, therefore, revolves around&nbsp; the&nbsp; admissibility&nbsp; of the sworn statement signed by the defendant and marked&nbsp; Exhibit "D" in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; The defendant claims&nbsp; that the same was extorted from him by means&nbsp; of&nbsp; force, violence and&nbsp; intimidation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the presumption&nbsp; of&nbsp; law is in favor&nbsp; of the spontaneity and voluntariness of the&nbsp; statement given by the defendant, it&nbsp; becomes incumbent upon him&nbsp; to destroy&nbsp; the said presumption.&nbsp; There is no evidence of a higher quality than a confession.&nbsp; It represents the&nbsp; outward&nbsp; manifestation of the guilty conscience of a man.&nbsp; Unless, therefore, the confession&nbsp; is nullified by&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; duress,&nbsp; which is&nbsp; denied&nbsp; by the investigators,&nbsp; the same is admissible as&nbsp; an evidence of guilt&nbsp; of a high quality.&nbsp; This, the Court believes, the defendant failed to do. He offered nothing tangible to support&nbsp; his&nbsp; claim.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true that Dr. Ronquillo declared that he found a tender portion' in the abdomen of the defendant&nbsp; about the size of a santol fruit, yet it had no visible sign of&nbsp; reddening or bulging. " It&nbsp; is&nbsp; very strange, however,<br><br>&nbsp;that if&nbsp; what the defendant described is&nbsp; true, the physician should have&nbsp; found not&nbsp; only one&nbsp; but&nbsp; several&nbsp; contusions&nbsp; and traces&nbsp; of violence of a more serious&nbsp; nature,&nbsp; since according to him he had been so severely beaten&nbsp; that he&nbsp; even lost consciousness.<br>&nbsp;<br>With respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the sworn&nbsp; statement signed by&nbsp; the defendant, it must&nbsp; be noted that he executed another statement marked Exhibit "G" in this case when he was first investigated by the P. C. agents. In this statement he was imputing the commission of this&nbsp; crime&nbsp; to&nbsp; another person&nbsp; by the&nbsp; name of&nbsp; Manolito&nbsp; Santiago.&nbsp; When&nbsp; this party was contacted, it turned out that there&nbsp; was a grudge between them&nbsp; and&nbsp; so&nbsp; the&nbsp; imputation made by the defendant was not given any significance.&nbsp; He&nbsp; cannot claim that he was given fist blows and other&nbsp; forms of maltreatment&nbsp; when he executed Exhibit "G".&nbsp; He denies having executed the same&nbsp; voluntarily, but his denial becomes absurd&nbsp; when&nbsp; we consider that&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigators did not even know the&nbsp; party&nbsp; whom the defendant was&nbsp; accusing&nbsp; to be the true author of the crime.&nbsp; And Exhibit "G" is not even a&nbsp; confession on his part. It is clear, therefore,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendant had&nbsp; been&nbsp; trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; fool or mislead the investigators in order to divert their attention away from him. <br>&nbsp;<br>On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand, when&nbsp; he was before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Counsel, he&nbsp; was&nbsp; asked&nbsp; if he had&nbsp; been&nbsp; influenced in&nbsp; any way to&nbsp; sign the statement, his&nbsp; answer was in&nbsp; the&nbsp; negative,&nbsp; When asked if he signed the same voluntarily, he said&nbsp; "Yes".&nbsp; He had the best opportunity in his&nbsp; life to denounce those who had used third degree in making him sign a confession, which is not true, but he missed&nbsp; this opportunity by&nbsp; saying nothing&nbsp; but,&nbsp; instead,&nbsp; affirming the&nbsp; truth of . the&nbsp; contents&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said exhibit.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; hs&nbsp; was&nbsp; visited&nbsp; by his uncle,&nbsp; a&nbsp; very responsible public official, being&nbsp; the principal of the Central Luzon&nbsp; School of Arts and.Trade, shortly after&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; signed the statement before the P. C. investigators, which according to him was done through violence and intimidation, but he never told his&nbsp; uncle&nbsp; about it.&nbsp; When&nbsp; asked why he&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to do so, he said he was&nbsp; afraid&nbsp; and yet he stated that he&nbsp; told him later after he had already&nbsp; sworn&nbsp; to&nbsp; the statement before the Special&nbsp; Counsel&nbsp; while still under the custody of&nbsp; the soldiers, which appears to be .an&nbsp; afterthought.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moreover, there is evidence&nbsp; that on the afternoon when&nbsp; the deceased was&nbsp; still&nbsp; confined&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; hospital&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; looked inside&nbsp; and asked someone this question: "Mabuhay pa kaya?" This question is very significant&nbsp; in the sense&nbsp; that—not being a relative of the deceased&nbsp; nor even&nbsp; a friend, the&nbsp; defendant wondered if the patient was going to survive. Why should he be interested in the' survival of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; patient?&nbsp; He has no explanation&nbsp; to offer for this remark, but only a&nbsp; mere denial,&nbsp; which the Court cannot accept as valid. The effect of this attempt of the defendant to explain the circumstances surrounding the taking of his statement is only to show that he has failed altogether to destroy the validity of the said statement. </blockquote>As to the defense of alibi offered by the appellant, suffice it to say that it cannot be entertained in view of his con- fession Exhibit "D", which&nbsp; is corroborated by the testi- mony of Cheung Kiat Tuy <i>alias</i> Tecson with regard to the , sale of the palay in question at his store and the fact that the seller of said palay left the empty sacks and the cart with bloodstains in&nbsp; that&nbsp; store. Wherefore, finding no error in the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed <i>in toto</i>,&nbsp; with costs against the appellant. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.
