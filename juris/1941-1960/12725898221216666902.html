				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of 
First Instance of Pangasinan in civil case No. 0516, holding that the donations 
made by Alberto G. Bautista in favor of Marcelina and Candida surnamed Sabiniano 
and Alfredo de Guzman are invalid for lack of acceptance on the part of said 
donees who were minors but valid in favor of Atanacio Lomibao who was of age at 
the time he accepted the donation in his favor, ordering the defendants 
Marcelina Sabiniano, Candida Sabiniano and Alfredo de Guzman to surrender to the 
plaintiffs, who are the lawful heirs of the deceased Alberto G. Bautista, the 
parcels of land in their possession by virtue of the deed of conditional 
donation, without special pronouncement as to costs. The other two defendants, 
Epifanio Sabiniano and Leonora Cansino, were joined, because the first is the 
father of the minor defendants Marcelina and Candida Sabiniano, who accepted the 
donation in their behalf, and the second is the mother of the minor Alfredo de 
Guzman who accepted the donation in his behalf. The appeal was filed by Epifanio 
Sabiniano in behalf of his minor children Marcelina and Candida Sabiniano. 
Leonora Cansino did not appeal and the plaintiffs also did not appeal from that 
part of the judgment which held valid the donation in favor of Atanacio Lomibao 
who was of age at the time he accepted the donation.
<p align="justify">The deed of donation reads as follows:</p>
<p align="center"></p><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">DEED OF CONDITIONAL DONATION</div><p></p>
<p align="justify">KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS:</p>
<p align="justify">That I, ALBERTO G. BAUTISTA, Filipino, of legal age, widower 
and a resident of the barrio of Buenlag, Binmaley, Pangasinan, Philippines, for 
and in consideration of my love and affection, and services rendered by 
Marcelina Sabiniano, 18 years old, and Candida Sabiniano, 13 years old, both 
single, daughters of Epifanio Sabiniano and Maxima Sabiniano (deceased), said 
Marcelina Sabiniano and Candida Sabiniano are represented for and in their 
behalf by their stated father, Epifanio Sabiniano in this regard, who is also a

Lomibao, Filipino, of legal age, married to Corazon Decena and a resident of the 
same place; and Alfredo de Guzman, Filipino, 2 1/2 years old, single and a resident 
of the barrio of Nagpalangan, Binmaley, Pangasinan, Philippines, represented for 
and in his behalf by his mother Leonora Cansino, wife of Andres de Guzman 
(deceased) Filipina, of legal age, widow and a resident of the same place, of

<p align="justify">1. That meantime I am still living, these properties donated 
are all yet at my disposal as well as the products therein derived, and whatever 
properties or property left undisposed by me during my lifetime will be the ones 
to be received by the donees if any;</p>
<p align="justify">2. That in case of my illness, I have still the perfect right to

for my sustenance and medical treatment, and whatever left, if any, of these 
properties will be the one to be received by the herein donees;</p>
<p align="justify">3. That in case of my unexpected death, the herein donees will

<p align="justify">That we, Epifanio Sabiniano, acting for and in behalf of my 
daughters, Marcelina Sabiniano and Candida Sabiniano, who are minors, Atanacio

ray son Alfredo de Guzman who is minor, do hereby by these presents accept the 
donations given by the donor, and hereby further extend our gratitude due to the 
generosity of the donor.</p>
<p align="justify">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we hereto set our hands this 7th day of 
September, 1948, in Binmaley, Pangasinan, Philippines.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">(Here follows the acknowledgment before the Notary Public.)</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">The trial court found that the donation is conditional and 
onerous, because the donor "continued to be the owner of the properties donated 
in spite of the donation" and "because the donees were made to pay under their 
personal responsibility all the debts of the donor incurred by him during his 
lifetime or illness, and to finance his funeral services upon his death," and 
held that it is null and void as to Marcelina and Candida surnamed Sabiniano and 
Alfredo de Guzman, who were minors and were not duly represented by their legal 
representatives upon the acceptance of the donation.</p>
<p align="justify">It is contended that the donation is pure and even if it be 
onerous or conditional the same is valid because the acceptance was made by 
their parents.</p>
<p align="justify">The view we take of the terms of the deed entitled "Conditional 
Donation" under consideration and analysis renders it unnecessary to dissert on 
the nature, character and effects of a pure act of generosity or a simple 
donation, of remuneratory or compensatory and of conditional or onerous 
donations—a charge, gravamen or obligation imposed upon the donee less in value 
than that of the property donated—as well as of those with a term or subject to 
suspensive or resolutory condition—there being a clear distinction between 
disposition and execution. The conveyance to the donees by way of donation of 
the properties described in the deed did not actually take effect on the date of 
the execution of the deed and of the acceptance thereof for the reason hereafter 
to be stated. It is also unnecessary to express opinion on whether the 
acceptance made in the deed is lawful and valid, for the reason that the owner 
reserved during his lifetime the right to dispose of the properties purportedly 
donated and to benefit from the products thereof. Except in the instances 
expressly provided by law, such as the subsequent birth of children of the 
donor, failure by the donee to comply with the conditions imposed, ingratitude 
of the donee and reduction of the donation in the event of inofficiousness 
thereof, a donation is irrevocable. If the donor reserves the right to revoke it 
or if he reserves the right to dispose of all the properties purportedly 
donated, there is no donation. If the disposition or conveyance or transfer 
takes effect upon the donor's death and becomes irrevocable only upon his death, 
it is not an <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span> but a <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span> donation. The disposition of the 
properties in favor of the appellants not having been done in accord with the 
provisions of section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended, there was 
no lawful and valid transmission thereof to them.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no merit in the contention that when the plaintiffs 
moved for the dismissal of their complaint the trial court should have 
dismissed it, because the motion to dismiss was made upon certain technical 
grounds which need not be restated and because after answer the dis missal of 
the complaint lies within the discretion of the trial court.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the foregoing grounds the judgment appealed from rendered 
against the appellants Marcelina and Candida surnamed Sabiniano, represented by 
Epifanio Sabiniano, their guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span>, is affirmed. No costs shall be 
taxed.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span>

In the opinion of this Court the latter clause annulled the former. And the case decided by the Supreme Court of Spain on 28 January 1898 cited to support the Court's rule involved or dealt with a donation or dowry of 80,000 <span style="font-style: italic;">reales</span> made in a marriage settlement, given out of the donor's pure generosity and to recipient's deserts and not in consideration of death or peril, though the delivery of the amount donated was deferred after the donor's death.<br><br>If the donor reserves the right to dispose of all and not some of the property purportedly donated he in effect reserves the right to revoke it, because if it be held to be a donation and therefore title thereto passed to the donee, the donor could no longer dispose of it. To enable him to dispose of it he must reacquire the title to the property by conveyance to him by the donee. If the donor can dispose of it without need of reacquiring from the donee title thereto because title did not pass to the latter the reservation of the right to dispose of all the properties donated is in effect a reservation of a right to revoke the purported donation totally or partially.<br><br>Manresa's comment quoted by the appellants in the printed motion does not bolster up their contention, for it says:<br><blockquote> Aunque el que se reserva el derecho de disponer de una cosa sin subordinar la reserva a condicion alguna, <i>en realidad se reserva el dominio sobre ella</i>, * * * la donacion produce efectos en vida del donante, transmitiendose, al menos, <i>un derecho de usufructo o un dominio revocable</i>; * * * (Italics supplied; p. 15, appellants' motion for reconsideration.)<br></blockquote>In the instant case the donor not only reserved in two paragraphs the dominio sobre ella but the <i>derecho de usufructo</i> as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Motion for reconsideration is denied.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <font color="#ff0000">[1]</font>Cariño vs. Abaya, 40 Off.
