				<H3>MARIANO  SAMPORSANTO, PETITIONER,  VS.  PUBLIC  SERVICE COMMISSION,  RESPONDENT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Submitted for final&nbsp; decision, this case appears to be in adequately&nbsp; presentedâ€”thru the appellant's fault.<br><br>He&nbsp; petitioned for the review of the Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission's order denying his application for permit to&nbsp; operate a&nbsp; line&nbsp; of motor&nbsp; vehicles&nbsp; for&nbsp; passenger&nbsp; service.&nbsp; He named said Commission as&nbsp; the only respondent, and served on the latter his petition and his memorandum.&nbsp; The latter, being merely&nbsp; a nominal party, not required&nbsp; to defend its actuations,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> filed no answer nor reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; To uphold&nbsp; such order was the task of the party or parties who had opposed appellant's application for permit.&nbsp; And, it was appellant's duty to implead such parties&nbsp; as respondents here.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font><br><br>Naming no&nbsp; respondent except the Commission,&nbsp; appellant stated in his petition that his application was uncontested. So&nbsp; this petition for review&nbsp; was heard without opposition after the Commission had expressed its lack&nbsp; of interest in the subject matter. However upon examination of the record for&nbsp; purposes of decision, we found that several transportation operators&nbsp; had&nbsp; objected in&nbsp; writing to the petitioner's application, to&nbsp; wit:&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; Heras, Vicente Heras, Cam Transit Co., Inc.,&nbsp; Quirino Manalo and others.<br><br>They stated that&nbsp; the services "presently&nbsp; rendered"&nbsp; by them on the line solicited by&nbsp; applicant were sufficient to take care of the "present volume" of traffic; that applicant's plan would cause ruinous competition etc.&nbsp; etc.<br><br>And at&nbsp; the first&nbsp; hearing of November 2,6, 1954&nbsp; they were represented by their respective attorneys.&nbsp; It is true that when the case&nbsp; was again called for hearing on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1955, none&nbsp; of them&nbsp; appeared, and&nbsp; petitioner. presented evidence&nbsp; without contradiction before the Commission's&nbsp; referee; but&nbsp; such failure&nbsp; does&nbsp; not mean&nbsp; withdrawal of their previously expressed objections.&nbsp; No statement exists in the record construable in any sense as withdrawal.&nbsp; And although they have not thereafter asked for opportunity to introduce evidence to support their opposition, it is reasonable to&nbsp; infer that they refrained from further occupying the Commission's attention because they were satisfied with&nbsp; the order&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the application, for the reason among others, of applicant's failure to prosecute&nbsp; for about four years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Commission's order of dismissal says in&nbsp; part:<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of all the foregoing,&nbsp; and&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to the agreement of the Commissioners, dated&nbsp; October 29, 1952, the recommendation of the&nbsp; National Traffic Commission and the directive of the President of the Philippines, dated October 81, 1952, not to entertain applications of&nbsp; existing&nbsp; operators for increase of equipment or trips in Manila in which category this application falls, the said application is hereby DENIED."<br></blockquote>The appellant should have&nbsp; impleaded these oppositors as respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this failure, in line with the&nbsp; ruling in Toledo Transportation case <i>supra,</i> we&nbsp; have to dismiss this petition for review.<br><br>We do not give appellant another chance to amend as was done in the Toledo case,&nbsp; <i>supra,</i> what with the resultant&nbsp; delay and the cogent reasons advanced&nbsp; in the appealed order.<br><br>Petition&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; review&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissed,&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angela,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B, L., Endencia</i> and&nbsp; <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><sup><font color="#FF0000">[1]</font></sup> Although it may defend, if it so chooses.<br><br><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> Toledo Transportation Co. <i>vs.</i> Posadas, 57 Pfiil. 692.<br></div>
