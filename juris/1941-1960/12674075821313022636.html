				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">Petition for certiorari against&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon.&nbsp; Edilberto Barot, presiding&nbsp; enjoining petitioners&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU)&nbsp; and Majestic and&nbsp; Republic Theaters&nbsp; Employees Association, their&nbsp; members, representatives, agents, and all other persons assisting or acting for them,&nbsp; to immediately&nbsp; cease and desist from picketing respondent's&nbsp; (herein) premises and preventing said respondent from&nbsp; the&nbsp; lawful and peaceful&nbsp; possession and&nbsp; use of said premises, and from molesting, interfering or preventing persons&nbsp; who desire to enter the Republic and&nbsp; the Majestic Theaters, and from committing any act of violence or intimidation against the respondent company and&nbsp; said persons. The incidents giving rise to&nbsp; the above orders are as follows:<p>Before March 31, 1955, L. C. Eugenio &amp; Co., Inc., owner of the Republic and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Majestic&nbsp; theaters,&nbsp; leased&nbsp; the theaters to the Republic Theater Enterprises, Inc., and the Majestic Theater, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; two&nbsp; corporations operated the said theaters.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; February 16,&nbsp; 1955, these two corporations entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement with the PAFLU,&nbsp; some of the members of which were employees of the&nbsp; Republic Theater Enterprises and&nbsp; the Majestic Theater,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; This agreement was to&nbsp; expire on December 31, 1956, renewable&nbsp; for&nbsp; another&nbsp; period of&nbsp; two years,&nbsp; if neither party rescinds the contract.&nbsp; On March 31, 1955, L. C. Eugenio sold the Republic and the Majestic theaters to the Goodwill Trading Co., Inc. for the sum of P950,000,&nbsp; of which P301,545.25 was paid at the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; execution of the sale.&nbsp; On April 25, 1955, the former owner terminated the&nbsp; lease of the two theaters in favor of the&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Theater&nbsp; Enterprises&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Majestic Theater, Inc., and on April 26, 1955, the Godwill Trading leased the said theaters to Rema, Inc., respondent in these proceedings.&nbsp; As a result of the contract of sale and the termination of the lease&nbsp; of the theaters by the Republic Theater&nbsp; Enterprises and the Majestic Theater, Inc., the respondent Rema, began to operate the two theaters,&nbsp; employing persons other than these employed therein by the Republic Theater Enterprises&nbsp; and the Majestic Theater, Inc.&nbsp; The unions to which the employees&nbsp; belong started picketing the said theaters, claiming that they could not be&nbsp; deprived of their right under the collective bargaining agreement of February 16, 1955, and alleging further that the contract of&nbsp; sale with the Goodwill Trading was&nbsp; a fictitious sale.&nbsp; Thereupon Rema, instituted civil case&nbsp; No. 26169 in the Court of First Instance of. Manila&nbsp; against the said labor unions for declaratory&nbsp; relief&nbsp; with preliminary injunction.&nbsp; The respondent judge set&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for preliminary injunction&nbsp; for hearing,&nbsp; and at this hearing Rema&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; evidence consisting of affidavits&nbsp; A, A-l, B, B-l, C, C-l, D, D-l&nbsp; and E.&nbsp; These affidavits show that members of the respondent union were committing acts of violence on persons desiring to&nbsp; enter the theaters and were threatening&nbsp; customers of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; theaters.&nbsp; The respondent union and association were permitted is submit counter-affidavits,&nbsp; but they&nbsp; did not&nbsp; do&nbsp; so,&nbsp; and&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the expiration of the period granted them the court issued the order subject of&nbsp; the present petition for certiorari.</p><p>The&nbsp; ground upon which the present petition&nbsp; is based is that the controversy between the&nbsp; union&nbsp; of the employees formerly working in&nbsp; the two theaters and the new operator of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; theaters,&nbsp; the respondent Rema,&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; labor dispute, and that the respondent court, therefore, did&nbsp; not have jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same or to issue injunction in ,the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge held&nbsp; that there was no relation&nbsp; of&nbsp; employee and&nbsp; employer between&nbsp; the petitioning union&nbsp; and&nbsp; the respondent Rema.&nbsp; This issue has already been passed upon&nbsp; in the case of PAFLU, et al., <em>vs</em>. Tan&nbsp; and Rema,&nbsp; supra, p. 854.&nbsp;&nbsp; We held&nbsp; in that case, which .involves the same parties and the same facts and circumstances as the one at&nbsp; bar, that a labor dispute exists.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it was&nbsp; held that&nbsp; The disputants need not stand in relation&nbsp; of&nbsp; employer and employee for case&nbsp; to involve a 'labor dispute' within&nbsp; Norris-La&nbsp; Guardia&nbsp; Act regulating&nbsp; issuance of restraining&nbsp; order or injunction in cases involving labor disputes" (Green, et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Obergfell, et al., 121 F&nbsp; 2d.,&nbsp; 46).&nbsp; While, under our own Industrial&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; the term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms,&nbsp; tenure,&nbsp; or&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; employment, 'regardless of whether the&nbsp; disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee [Section 2, (<em>j</em>), Republic Act 872.]&nbsp; In our opinion, considering the equities involved, the relation of&nbsp; petitioners to respondent comes within the purview of this definition."</p></blockquote><p>But we also&nbsp; held therein that the Court of Industrial Relations has&nbsp; no jurisdiction&nbsp; to take&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of cases involving&nbsp; labor&nbsp; disputes since the approval of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 875, except when the dispute relates&nbsp; to certain specific cases like the&nbsp; following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) When the labor dispute affects an industry which is indispensable to the national interest and is so certified by&nbsp; the President to the industrial court (Section 10, Republic Act 875J; (2) when the controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law&nbsp; (Republic Act 602);&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; when&nbsp; it involves hours of employment under the Eight-Hour&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Law (Commonwealth Act 444); and (4) when it involves&nbsp; an unfair labor practice [Section&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; (<em>a</em>),&nbsp; Republic&nbsp;&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 875]. *&nbsp; * *."&nbsp; (p.&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; Decision&nbsp; in PAFLU, et al., <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Tan, et aL L-9115.)&nbsp;&nbsp; '</p></blockquote><p>It follows, therefore,&nbsp; that the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila&nbsp; had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the action instituted by the&nbsp; Rema,&nbsp; Inc., against the labor union&nbsp; and associations,&nbsp; petitioners herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the question remaining to be decided is whether or not the respondent court of&nbsp; first instance abused&nbsp; its&nbsp; discretion in granting&nbsp; the preliminary injunction.</p><p>Republic Act No. 875&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; provides for the procedure to be&nbsp; followed by courts&nbsp; in the consideration of petitions&nbsp; for&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; against&nbsp; picketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 9, paragraph d, expressly provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"(<em>d</em>)&nbsp; No court of the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case&nbsp; involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as herein defined, except after hearing the testimony of&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; in open court&nbsp; (with&nbsp; opportunity for cross-examination)&nbsp; in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of a&nbsp; complaint made under oath,&nbsp; and testimony in opposition&nbsp; thereto, if offered, and except after finding of fact by the Court, to the effect: </p><blockquote>"(1) That unlawful&nbsp; acts have been&nbsp; threatened and will be committed unless&nbsp; restrained, or have been committed and" will be continued unless restrained, but no injunction or temporary restraining order&nbsp; shall be issued on&nbsp; account of&nbsp; any&nbsp; threat or unlawful act&nbsp; excepting&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; person&nbsp; or&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; association,&nbsp; or&nbsp; organization&nbsp; making&nbsp; the threat or committing the unlawful act&nbsp; or&nbsp; actually authorizing&nbsp; or&nbsp; ratifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; same after actual knowledge thereof;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>"(2) That substantial and irreparable injury&nbsp; to complainant's property will follow;</p>"(3) That as to each&nbsp; item of relief granted greater injury will&nbsp; be inflicted upon complainant by the denial&nbsp; of relief than will&nbsp; be inflicted upon defendants by&nbsp; the&nbsp; granting&nbsp; of relief;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>"(4) That complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and</p>"(5)" That&nbsp; the public officers charged&nbsp; with the&nbsp; duty to protect complainant's property are&nbsp; unable or unwilling to furnish adequate&nbsp; protection.&nbsp; </blockquote><p>"Such hearing shall&nbsp; be held after&nbsp; due and personal notice thereof has been given,&nbsp; in such&nbsp; manner as&nbsp; the Court shall direct,&nbsp; to all known persons against whom&nbsp; relief is sought, and also to the chief of those public officials of the province or city&nbsp; within which the unlawful acts have been threatened&nbsp; or committed charged with the duty to protect complainant's property:&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."</p></blockquote><p>Judged&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-quoted&nbsp; provision, the&nbsp; order&nbsp; complained of is subject to the following objections: (1) there was no hearing of&nbsp; the testimonies&nbsp; of witnesses&nbsp; in&nbsp; open court;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; there is no&nbsp; finding of fact by the court&nbsp; that unlawful acts have&nbsp; been threatened and will be. committed nor that complainant has&nbsp; no adequate remedy at law, and that public&nbsp; officers&nbsp; charged with the duty&nbsp; to protect complainant's&nbsp; property are&nbsp;&nbsp; unable or&nbsp; unwitting to&nbsp; furnish adequate protection.</p><p>The order also prohibits the petitioning union and associations "from picketing plaintiff's premises."&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a denial of a fundamental right granted employees of labor unions, which the courts may not validly prohibit.&nbsp;&nbsp; What may be enjoined is the use of violence or the&nbsp; act&nbsp; of unlawful picketing, such as the commission of acts of violence or intimidation against employees or those who want to see the shows not lawful picketing.</p><p>It is evident, therefore, that while the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the petition, it had&nbsp; transcended&nbsp; the powers (called jurisdiction&nbsp; in the Act) because it enjoined the petitioners from picketing, a legitimate labor right, and because the procedure expressly outlined in the law&nbsp; for the issuance of an injunction was not strictly followed.</p><p>Wherefore, the writ prayed for is hereby&nbsp; granted, and the order complained of annulled.&nbsp; Without costs.</p><p><em>Padilla, Montemeyor, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Endencia,</em> and<em> Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><em>Concepcion, J.</em>, with whom <em>Paras, CJ., </em>concurs:</p><p>I concur in the result, for the reasons, and&nbsp; subject to the qualifications, set forth&nbsp; in the concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr.&nbsp; Justice Reyes (J. B. L.) in PAFLU <em>vs</em>. Tan and Rema Incorporated,&nbsp; (supra,&nbsp; p. 854).</p></div>
