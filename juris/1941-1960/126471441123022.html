				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur dated February 5, 1951, dismissing the petition for relief from judgment filed by the defendants-appellants on February 9, 1949, in Civil Case No. 3502 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur.  Said case dates back to the year 1938 when on January 15th of that year  plaintiffs-appellees  filed a complaint later  amended on March 3, 1938, for damages and injunction to recover the sum of P4,000 representing the value of approximately 10,000 maguey plants allegedly destroyed by defendants, on a large parcel of land belonging to plaintiffs which defendant entered, and  the  additional sum of P400  for other damages and expenses.  Defendants-appellants represented by Atty. Lazaro Abigania answering the complaint alleged that they may not be sued in their private capacities but rather as  representatives  of  the municipal  council  of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, because with the exception of defendant Andres F. Cordero, they were all members of a special committee  appointed by Municipal  Mayor Andres F. Cordero to investigate a proposed road connecting the barrios of Banglayan and Cadoog of said  municipality,  pursuant to a  municipal  resolution, and  that the property alleged to have been illegally  entered by them was  actually part of the road being investigated.  About two years  later or rather on August 2, 1940, the municipality of Narvacan commenced condemnation  proceedings,  docketed as  Civil Case  No. 3849, to expropriate  said land of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a pre-trial held on February 4, 1943, the trial court ordered that the case be tried jointly with Case  No. 3849 for expropriation.  On October 5,  1943, the present case was calendared for trial on November 9, 1943 and Atty. Abigania was duly notified  of this hearing.  On the day  of the trial,  however, Atty. Abigania  failed to appear and the trial court  allowed plaintiffs to present their evidence  in  his absence,  but continued the hearing to the next day in order  to give defendants' counsel  an opportunity to present his evidence and to explain  why he  should  not  be punished for contempt.   The next day Atty. Abigania appeared  and presumably failing to give a satisfactory explanation  for his non-appearance  in court the day before, he was fined P5.  The trial was postponed for November  15,  1943.  On that day Atty. Abigania informed the court that despite his telegrams and letters to the defendants they failed to come.  He asked to be allowed to withdraw as their counsel, alleging among other things that he had already delivered the papers of the case to one Atty. Serrano.  In view of the court's denial of his petition for withdrawal, Atty. Abigania presented some documents as  exhibits for the defendants  after which the case was submitted  for decision.   On November 19, 1943,  the  trial court rendered judgment in  favor of  plaintiffs,  ordering defendants  to  pay  to  them  the sum  of  P4,100 with interest from the  filing  of the complaint  and declaring permanent the writ  of preliminary injunction previously issued, with  costs.  Atty. Abigania received copy  of the decision on December 15, 1943, but according  to defendants he failed  to  notify  them of the same.</p>
<p>On October 18,  1948, plaintiffs filed a motion for execution of the  judgment and on  December  27, 1948, the corresponding writ of  execution  was issued,  and it was served on  Andres F, Cordero, one of the  defendants, on January 15, 1949.  The writ was returned by the Sheriff on  February 25,  1949 with  a notation that defendants had no property,  real or  personal, subject to execution.</p>
<p>On February 29, 1949, that is, more  than  five years after Atty. Abigania had received copy of the decision on December 15, 1943, defendants-appellants filed a petition for relief from judgment.  The trial court ordered plaintiffs to answer  said petition.  Instead of answering, plaintiffs filed a motion that the petition be striken from the records on  the  ground of  prescription.  After hearing, the trial court issued an order or resolution dismissing the petition on the ground of laches and negligence.  As already said, defendants are  appealing from  that resolution.   It may not be out of place  to  go,  though not  deeply,  into the merits of the case as may be gathered from  the reasons given  by the  trial court in awarding damages in the sum of P4,100 to  the plaintiffs in its  decision  of November 19, 1943.  It  would  appear  that the defendants actually cut down  10,000 maguey plants  on the land of plaintiffs, but that judging from  the exhibits presented  by  their counsel Atty. Abigania at the hearing, they tried to justify the trespass  on the  land and  the destruction of  maguey plants by  the. condemnation proceedings instituted by the municipality  of Narvacan.  But as observed by  the trial court, that expropriation case  was instituted two  years and seven months  after  the trespass and the destruction committed by the defendant, so that the acts of defendants were not warranted.</p>
<p>As to the merits of the petition for relief filed in 1949, and the propriety or justification of the resolution of the court denying the same, no lengthy discussion is necessary. It is  sufficient to reproduce the  following observations of Judge Hilario in his resolution  denying  the  petition for relief:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Es  bastante inconcebible  que  un litigante no hubiere indagado por su propia cuenta y  por espacio de unos 5 anos el estado de su asunto, no recibiendo ya informacion de su abogado sobre el  mismo. Por lo menos, durante dicho tiempo hubiera buscado  a su abogado para cerciorarse de la causa del silencio de este.  La solicitud no alega  explicaciones sobre la omision  de los demandados  de hacer las ordinarias indagaciones.</p>
  <p>"Es  tambien  inconcebible que un abogado de  gran  prestigio profesional como  el  Sr. D. Lazaro  Abigania, que ha  perdido  bajo las circunstancias  mencionadas en el parrafo 2 de la solicitud la causa  de sus clientes, sabiendo  que  en la decision  se  condenaba a estos al  pago de la  suma de P4,100 con  sus  intereses  legates desde  la presentacion de la  demanda hasta su complete  pago, no hubiera hecho ningun esfuerso durante cualquiera de los anos 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947 y 1948  por  notificar  semejante  fallo  a sus clientes y solicitar  el  reraedio  correspondiente.  De haber sido  realmente negllgente durante dichos 5 anos,  su negligencia no puede ser considerada excusable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counsel for the appellants claims that the trial court erred in not declaring the decision rendered against defendants on November 19, 1943, null and void for the reason that they were unreasonably and  arbitrarily  denied their day  in court, and in not holding that said decision was entered  against  them  due  to  the honest  mistake and excusable negligence  of their attorney of record, Atty. Abigania.  The  reason  given by said  attorney  for  not appearing on the day of the trial on November 9,  1943 was that he had  asked the Clerk of court for postponement because he thought the case would be heard  jointly with the condemnation case of course, that was no reason for not appearing on the day set. for hearing because it was for the court and not for him to decide whether postponement was  to be granted.  Then,  when he appeared the following day he asked  to be relieved as counsel for the defendants on the ground that he had  already  delivered the  papers  of the case to  Atty.  Serrano.   His petition was denied  by  the court.  His  clients,  the defendants herein, never agreed  in  court to his withdrawal  as their counsel,  and Atty. Serrano never  filed his appearance for them and in substitution of Atty. Abigania.   We do not forget the conditions  obtaining during the Japanese occupation, but it is of public knowledge that in 1943,  and during the greater part of 1944, the courts were open and functioning, and mail  and other means  of communication were available,  though  perhaps not  daily, especially in northern Luzon and there  was no reason for Atty. Abigania to fail to notify his  clients, the defendants, of the decision  rendered against them,  and  as observed by the trial court  there was no  reason  for  these same defendants to  fail to make inquiries  from their  counsel  and from the court  as to  what  had become  of the case filed against  them.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the  order or resolution appealed from is  hereby  affirmed,  with costs.</p>
<p>In view of the manifestation of Atty.  Pablo C.  Sanidad, counsel  for defendants-appellants in their  appeal, that defendants-appellants  Cordero, Velasco, Peralta and  Ginez are  now dead,  their  legal  representatives shall be substituted in their place in  accordance with Rule  3, section 17, of  the Rules of  Court.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C. J., Bengzon,  Padilla,  Reyes,  A.,  Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,  Reyes, J. B. L.,</em>  and<em> Endencia, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
