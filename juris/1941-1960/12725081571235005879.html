				<H3>PAULINO DUMAGUIN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. A. I. REYNOLDS, E. J. HARRISON AND BIG WEDGE MINING COMPANY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For purposes of this decision, the following facts may be said 
to he agreed upon by the parties or to he without dispute. Because the plaintiff 
Paulino M. Dumaguin would appear to be the central figure in this case, we shall 
begin by making reference to his background and his status at the time he 
entered into the transactions and executed the deeds of conveyance whose 
legality is now the subject of the present petition.
<p align="justify">Paulino M. Dumaguin was a teacher in the public elementary 
schools for a year and a half, and from 1916 to 1918 was the Manager of the Head 
Waters Mining Company in Baguio. As Manager of said mining company Paulino 
acquired some knowledge of mining. On or before May 21, 1929, he was a 
supervising line-man of the Bureau of Posts. On that date (May 21, 1929) he was 
admitted to the Insular Psychopathic Hospital at San Felipe Neri (now the 
National Psychopathic Hospital), Mandaluyong, Rizal, said to be suffering from 
"paranoia". On October 15, 1929, Dr. Toribio Joson, assistant alienist of said 
Hospital, submitted the following memorandum: </p>
<p align="center">"MEMORANDUM </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"To: the Alienist in Charge Insular Psychopathic Hospital, San 
Felipe Neri, Rizal.</p>
<p align="justify">"Subject: Paulino M. Dumaguin—Male, married, 33 years old, 
Ex-Supervising Lineman of the Bureau of Posts, admitted to the hospital at 11:25 
am., on May 21, 1929.</p>
<p align="justify">"1. The patient is well behaved, oriented in all spheres, 
coherent in his speech and has no more illusion or hallucinations; but is having 
a delusion that one of the patients in the hospital is trying to chloroform him. 
He consequently keeps away from the said patient.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. He is also not sure that his former officemates whom he 
erroneously believed chloroformed him before, would not chloroform him anymore 
when he goes home.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. This type of insanity which Paulino M. Dumaguin is 
suffering from is therefore that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Paranoia, which runs a very chronic course 
of usually a life time, but which may show improvement as the patient grows 
older</span>". (See Exhibits 42, folio 195; Italics ours) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">After Paulino's discharge from the hospital on or about 
November 11, 1929, in order to enable his wife to withdraw his retirement 
gratuity from the Government, on September 16, 1930, she filed guardianship 
proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur. Said court relying 
presumably on the report of Dr. Joson above quoted, granted the petition and 
appointed her as Paulino's guardian. </p>
<p align="justify">On February 2, 1931, Paulino and his guardian in a joint motion 
before the Court of Camarines Sur among others alleged that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"4. Que en la actualidad, el citado Paulino M. Dumaguin, ya 
esta restablecido, por Io que se le ha permitido dejar el Hospital y ahora vive 
con su familia en esta localidad, que es su residencia. </p>
<p align="justify">"5. Que el mencionado Paulino M. Dumaguin ha recibido un cheque 
del Gobierno por la cantidad de P412.38, como parte de su pension. </p>
<p align="justify">"6. Que los comparecientes necesitan el importe de dicho cheque 
para atender a su subsistencia, pues se hallan en la actualidad faltos de todo 
necesario."</p></blockquote>and asked that they be authorized to cash said check and use its 
proceeds for their support: 
<p align="justify">""POR TANTO, suplican al Juzgado que se les autorice a cambiar 
el referido cheque, y disponer de su producto para su 
manutencion."</p>
<p align="justify">In 1934, the guardianship proceedings were closed. </p>
<p align="justify">In and before the year 1930, defendants A. I. Reynolds and E. 
J. Harrison as gold prospectors had located some mineral claims in the Itogon 
District, subprovince of Benguet, Mountain Province, known as the "ANACONDA 
GROUP". They employed Fructuoso Dumaguin, brother of plaintiff Paulino, in their 
work as prospectors.</p>
<p align="justify">At the beginning of 1931, Fructuoso Dumaguin was thus working 
for said defendants Reynolds and Harrison relocating some of their mining claims 
previously located and locating new ones, for which work he was paid P5.00 a 
day. About the same time his brother Paulino M. Dumaguin, plaintiff herein, 
leaving his home in Camarines Sur went up to Baguio in search of work. To help 
him, Fructuoso got him employed by the defendants and the two brothers worked 
together in the mining business for the defendants. </p>
<p align="justify">The theory of the plaintiff is that he was employed only to 
relocate defendants' mining claims in the Anaconda Group while the defense 
claims that like his brother Fructuoso, Paulino was employed not only to 
relocate mining claims within the Anaconda, Group but also to stake and locate 
new mining claims for them. For said work Paulino was also paid by the day by 
defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">During the months of May, June and July of that year 1931 the 
two brothers Pructuoso and Paulino staked and located ten mining claims or 
fractions thereof named Victoria, Greta, Triangle, Lolita, Prank, Paul, Leo, 
Loreto, Arthur and G. Ubalde, all said claims or fractions being later 
registered in the name of Paulino M. Dumaguin as locator in the office of the 
Mining Recorder. By virtue of an instrument (Exhibit A) entitled "Deed of 
Transfer" dated September 10, 1931, Paulino M. Dumaguin conveyed and transferred 
to defendants A. I. Reynolds and E. J. Harrison nine of the ten mineral claims 
just mentioned, and in another instrument (Exhibit E) on the same date September 
10, 1931, Paulino transferred and conveyed to defendant Reynolds the remaining 
claim Victoria. </p>
<p align="justify">Later, Reynolds as vendee of the mining claim Victoria by 
virtue of a deed of sale (Exhibit C) dated November 2, 1931 sold and transferred 
said claim to the defendant Big Wedge Mining Co. In another deed of sale 
(Exhibit D) dated June 2, 1933, Reynolds and Harrison sold and transferred to 
the same defendant Big Wedge Mining Co. the claims Frank, Paul, Leo, Loreto and 
Arthur. In still another deed of sale (Exhibit J), Reynolds and Harrison sold 
and transferred to the same Big Wedge Mining Co. the Greta, Lolita and Triangle 
fractions or mineral claim. As a result, all the ten mineral claims or fractions 
transferred by Paulino to Reynolds and Harrison, with the exception of the claim 
G. Ubalde were in turn sold and transferred to the Big Wedge Mining Co. What was 
done with this last claim or fraction G. Ubalde, does not appear on the record, 
but it must still remain in the name of Reynolds and Harrison.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff Dumaguin initiated this case in the Court of First 
Instance of Baguio by filing his original complaint on November 5, 1934, later 
amending it on July 26, 1939 and finally reamending it on June 4, 1940. Under 
his reamended complaint which contains three causes of action, he alleges that 
when he executed the deeds of transfer (Exhibits A and B) he was under 
guardianship and did not possess the mental capacity to contract and so asked 
the court that the said two deeds be declared null and void. He also alleged 
that those two deeds being void, Reynolds and Harrison had no title to transmit 
to the Big Wedge Mining Co., by virtue of the deeds of sale, Exhibits C and D 
(plaintiff evidently overlooked the deed, Exhibit J), and therefore those two 
deeds of sale (Exhibits C and D) should also be declared null and void, and that 
he (Paulino) should be declared the owner of the ten mining claims or fractions 
in question. Finally, he claimed that the Big Wedge Mining Co., had illegally 
taken, possession of the ten mining claims and profitably worked or operated 
them and so he asked that said company be ordered to render an accounting of its 
operations and the profits made therefrom, and that the defendants should be 
ordered jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff such profits, as may have 
been derived by the Big Wedge Mining Co. as shown by its accounts. </p>
<p align="justify">Defendants Reynolds and Harrison filed their original answers 
on January 30, 1935 and April 12, 1935, respectively, both superseded by their 
amended answers on January 22, 1936. Defendant Big Wedge Mining Co., filed its 
answer on January 30, 1935, which was amended on January 18, 1936 and later 
reamended on February 5, 1940. Reynolds and Harrison claimed in their answers 
that plaintiff Paulino and his brother Fructuoso had been expressly employed by 
them to locate and stake mineral claims, and that said two brothers staked and 
located the ten mineral claims in question for them (defendants), and that there 
was an understanding between the two brothers and the two defendants that said 
mineral claims so located would eventually be transferred to them. In its turn 
defendant Big Wedge Mining Co., followed the theory of Reynolds and Harrison 
about Paulino having been employed by them and having made the location of the 
mineral claims in question for their employers, said that the company was not 
aware of the alleged mental incapacity of plaintiff at the time that he executed 
the deeds of transfer in favor of Reynolds and Harrison, and that even if 
plaintiff was under guardianship at the time, yet he confirmed and ratified the 
deeds of transfer by his acts and letters after his release from guardianship, 
and that said company bought the said mineral claims in good faith and for 
valuable consideration from the registered owners. </p>
<p align="justify">Hearing was held on July 31, 1940. The evidence submitted was 
mainly documentary. Only three witnesses took the witness stand. Atty. Alberto 
Jamir was presented by the Big Wedge Mining Co. to identify a copy of a decision 
rendered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Defendant Reynolds testified 
for the defense. For the plaintiff, only Fructuoso Dumaguin testified for his 
brother. Why Paulino, the plaintiff, did not take the witness stand, if not to 
support the allegations of his complaint, at least to refute the evidence for 
the defense particularly that which tended to show that he was employed by 
defendants Reynolds and Harrison to stake and locate mineral claims for them 
with the understanding that he would later transfer said claims to his 
employers, is not known to this court. After trial, Judge Jose R. Carlos before 
whom the hearing was held, rendered judgment on January 16, 1941, dismissing the 
complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">Paulino Dumaguin appealed from that decision. His Record on 
Appeal was approved on April 16, 1941. Appellant's brief was filed on November 
3, 1941 and the brief for the Big Wedge Mining Co. was filed or rather is dated 
December 31, 1941. It is not known whether defendants Reynolds and Harrison ever 
filed a brief. The fact is that the record of the case was lost or destroyed 
during the war and only copies of the record on appeal and the briefs were 
salvaged. As to the oral and documentary evidence which was lost, only those 
portions of the transcript and documents reproduced and appearing in the briefs 
are now available. But the parties have agreed to the correctness of these 
portions so quoted in the briefs.</p>
<p align="justify">After the reconstitution of the case, the Court of Appeals 
which had taken charge of the appeal found that the amount involved was beyond 
its jurisdiction and so certified the case to us. Neither Reynolds nor Harrison 
has appeared before the Court of Appeals or before this court. Appellant's 
attorney represented that Harrison's counsel could not appear in the appeal due 
to lack of authority, not having heard from his client since liberation and 
being of the belief that his client is dead. There was also information to the 
effect that defendant Reynolds had been killed during the early part of the 
occupation by the Japanese. So, only the Big Wedge Mining Co., is opposing the 
present appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">The decisive and pivotal question here is whether plaintiff 
Paulino M. Dumaguin and his brother Fructuoso acting on their account staked and 
located these mining claims or fractions in dispute for Paulino, or whether they 
acting as employees and agents of defendants Reynolds and Harrison, staked and 
located said claims for and in behalf of their employers. We agree with the 
trial court that the great preponderance of evidence is to the effect that these 
claims were located for Reynolds and Harrison by Paulino and Fructuoso as 
employees, and that the latter were purposely employed and paid for this work. 
All the expenses incident to the staking and location of said claims and the 
registration of the corresponding declarations of location were paid by Reynolds 
and Harrison. It is true that in one part of his testimony, Fructuoso claimed 
that he and his brother were employed merely to relocate the mining claims of 
defendants within the Anaconda Group but later on, he admitted in his testimony 
and also in his affidavit (Exhibit 1) which was prepared before these 
proceedings were initiated in court that he and his brother Paulino working 
together were paid by the defendants Reynolds and Harrison to locate new mining 
claims outside the Anaconda Group; that as a matter of fact, Paulino engaged in 
this work at the beginning, but because he (Fructuoso) found that Paulino 
physically was not equal to the arduous work of climbing up and down mountains 
to stake and locate claims, he was placed in charge of the payroll of the 
defendants and detailed to do paper work which, it is presumed, included the 
registration of the declarations of location of the mining claims in the office 
of the Mining Recorder, in his name. Fructuoso also admitted that there was an 
understanding before and pending the staking and location of said mining claims 
that they would eventually be transferred to their real owners, Reynolds and 
Harrison.</p>
<p align="justify">In consonance with this correct theory that these mining claims 
were located for defendants Reynolds and Harrison,as counsel for appellee well 
observes, Exhibit A and E are both entitled "Deed of Transfer". This conveys the 
idea that Paulino was merely transferring to the real owners property which 
technically and in name were registered as his own. Otherwise, if he really 
owned these mining claims, the two deeds (Exhibits A and B) would have been more 
appropriately entitled "Deed of Sale" and the body of said instruments should 
have stated that he was selling the mining claims. On the other hand, we have 
the instruments (Exhibits C and D) wherein Reynolds and Harrison sold said 
mining claims or fractions to the Big Wedge Mining Co., and the documents were 
each entitled "Deed of Sale". </p>
<p align="justify">It would really be unfair, even against public policy to allow 
a person employed to stake and locate mining claims for his employer to make 
locations on his own account and for his own benefit tho done outside hours of 
work or employment, because there is an obvious incompatibility and conflict of 
interests between those of the employer on the one hand and those of the 
employee on the other, unless there is a clear and express agreement to the 
contrary. Judge Carlos in his well-considered decision correctly states the 
fiduciary relation between Paulino and his employers Reynolds and Harrison and 
the sound and correct rule and public policy on this matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The fiduciary relation between the plaintiff and the 
defendants A. I. Reynolds and E.J. Harrison is very clear from the evidence. 
Fructuoso M. Dumaguin has clearly stated that his brother, Paulino M. Dumaguin, 
was working under him while he was locating the claims in question for A. I. 
Reynolds and E. J. Harrison. There can be no doubt that these claims in question 
were among those which these defendants wanted staked because, according to 
Fructuoso M. Dumaguin himself, they all adjoin the Anaconda Group, which ground 
he was specifically instructed to stake for the said defendants. The plaintiif 
herein, therefore, learned of the existence, especially of the fractional 
mineral claims, because he was with the party who staked the rest of the claims 
in that locality. To permit the plaintiff herein to assert his claim of 
ownership over these claims in question would be tantamount to allowing him to 
violate and infringe all the sound and age-old rules which govern principal and 
agent. There can be no doubt that this relation existed because Fructuoso M. 
Dumaguin, the sole witness for the plaintiff, stated categorically in his 
affidavit Exhibit 'I' that all the claims subject of this litigation, except the 
G. Ubalde mineral claim, had been located and staked by him for A. I. Reynolds 
and E. J. Harrisson, though the same were recorded in the name of his brother 
Paulino. It is quite evident, therefore, that even if no transfers were made or 
Exhibit 'A' and B' did not exist, these two defendants would still be entitled 
to an assignment of the said claims. The evidence of the fiduciary relation 
between the plaintiff and the defendants A. I. Reynolds and E. J. Harrison was 
given by none other than Fructuoso M. Dumaguin, the brother the only witness of 
the plaintiff in this case. </p>
<p align="justify">"Any act of an agent, the object or tendency of which is to 
commit a fraud or breach of the agency, should be discouraged. In the first 
place, such acts are condemned by public policy. They are against the morals; 
therefore, they should never be tolerated. An agent or trustee, or anybody who 
acts in a fiduciary capacity, should never be permitted to capitalize on his 
fiduciary position to mulct or take advantage of his principal or employer. </p>
<p align="justify">"It has been the practice of miners to employ others to stake 
mining claims for them. This is usually done after the prospectors have assured 
themselves that a mine exists in a certain locality. The man who places the 
stake could easily leave fractional mineral claims in between the claims without 
reporting the existence of these fractions to his principal. Later he could 
stake and claim them. If this is permitted to happen, bona fide miners can 
easily be held tip by the very man whom they have employed to stake their mining 
claims. If the mining industry shall be protected and the exploitation of the 
natural resources of this country encouraged, such practice should not be 
tolerated. The wrong or the damage that can be done is unlimited. If agents or 
employees or laborers are permitted to conceal or withhold certain mining claims 
or fractions thereof in between the mining claims ordered staked by their 
employer who gave them specific instructions to stake the entire ground in a 
certain locality, the effect will practically be the condonation and 
legalization of a holdup. For this reason, Mechem on Agency, Sec. 1224, said the 
following:</p>
<p align="justify">'The well-settled and salutary principle that person who 
undertakes to act for another shall not, be in the same matter, act for himself, 
results also in the other rule, that all profits made and advantage gained by 
the agent in the execution of the agency belong to the principal. And it matters 
not whether such profit or advantage be the result of the performance or of the 
violation of the duty of the agent if it be the fruit of the agency. If his duty 
be strictly performed, the resulting profit accrues to the principal as the 
legitimate consequence of the relation; if profit accrues from his violation of 
duty while executing the agency, that likewise belongs to the principal, not 
only because the principal has to assume the responsibility of the transaction, 
but also because the agent cannot be permitted to derive advantage from his own 
default.</p>
<p align="justify">'It is only by rigid adherence to this rule that all temptation 
can be removed from one acting in a fiduciary capacity, to abuse his trust or 
seek his own advantage in the position which it affords him.' "</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">In view of our conclusion and holding that these mining claims 
were staked and located for the benefit of defendants Reynolds and Harrison, the 
other points and questions involved in the appeal exhaustively, in detail and 
with a wealth of authorities, discussed by counsel for both appellant and 
appellee with ability and skill, become incidental and not of much if any 
relevancy whatsoever, although we may discuss one or two of them not so much to 
strengthen our decision but rather to render more clear our views. </p>
<p align="justify">Appellant contends that the deeds of transfer (Exhibits A and 
B) should be annulled for lack of mental capacity because at the time of their 
execution he was under guardianship for insanity. It is contended that altho in 
a case of execution of a will by a testator who was under guardianship for 
mental derangement, the presumption of insanity is only <span style="font-style: italic;">juris tantum</span>, subject to 
rebuttal, nevertheless, mental incapacity as regards contracts, particularly 
those transferring property, under similar circumstances, involves a conclusive 
presumption which cannot be rebutted by evidence. We have studied the arguments 
and authorities adduced by both counsel on this point and we are inclined to 
agree with counsel for appellee that the better rule is that even in the 
execution of contracts, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the 
presumption of insanity and mental incapacity is only <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> and may be 
rebutted by evidence; and that a person under guardianship for insanity may 
still enter into a valid contract and even convey property, provided it is 
proven that at the time of entering into said contract, he was not insane or 
that his mental defect if mentally deranged did not interfere with or affect his 
capacity to appreciate the meaning and significance of the transaction entered 
into by him. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 66. <span style="font-style: italic;">Generally</span>.—Of course, not every substandard 
mentality or even every mental infirmity has the effect of rendering the 
afflicted person disabled for the purpose of entering into contract and making 
conveyances. * * * A reasonable test, suggested by several courts for the 
purpose of determining whether an infirmity operates to render a person 
incapable of binding himself absolutely by contract, is whether his mind has 
been so affected as to render him incapable of understanding the nature and 
consequences of his acts, or, more exactly, whether Ms mental powers have become 
so far affected as to make him unable to understand the character of the 
transaction in question. * * * Some authorities take the view that a grantor may 
be competent to execute a deed notwithstanding his disability to transact 
business generally, provided he understands the nature of what he is doing and 
recollects the property of which he is making a disposition and to "whom he is 
conveying it. Other authorities, however, take the position that to sustain a 
deed, the grantor must have the ability to transact ordinary business. In any 
event, if it appears that the grantor in a deed was incapable of comprehending 
that the effect of the instrument, when made, executed, and delivered, would be 
to divest him of title to the land covered by the instrument, it is not binding 
upon him. * * *." (28 Am. Jur. Insane, etc., Sec. 66, pp. 701-702.)</p>
<p align="justify">"* * * Even partial insanity will not render a contract 
voidable unless it exists in connection with or is referable to the subject 
matter of the contract. Similarly, a delusion if unconnected with the 
transaction in question, is not sufficient to affect the validity of a contract 
consummated by the person thus affected. Monomania or a mental fixation or 
abnormality respecting a matter disconnected with the act of conveying property 
will not affect the validity of the conveyance. * * *" (Ibid., p. 
703.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There are many cases of persons mentally deranged who although 
they have been having obsessions and delusions for many years regarding certain 
subjects and situations, still are mentally sound in other respects. There are 
others who though insane, have their lucid intervals when in all respects they 
are perfectly sane and mentally sound. </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Paulino M. Dumaguin, according to the doctor who 
observed and examined him, and who made his report on October 15, 1929, and that 
was more than two years before Exhibits A and B were executed, he (Paulino) 
while in the hospital was "well behaved, oriented in all spheres, coherent in 
his speech and has no more illusion or hallucinations; but is having a delusion 
that one of the patients in the hospital is trying to chloroform him. He 
consequently keeps away from said patient," and that he was "not sure that his 
former officemates whom he erroneously believed chloroformed him before would 
not chloroform him anymore when he goes home." This was in 1929. The same year 
Paulino was discharged from the hospital presumably because his condition had 
improved, and on February 2, 1931, Paulino and his wife in a motion assured the 
court of Camarines Sur that Paulino was already re-established (ya esta 
restablecido). Several months later he went to Baguio looking for work. It is to 
be presumed that he was then no longer insane. It is equally to be presumed that 
his brother Fructuoso would not have recommended him for employment by 
defendants Keynolds and Harrison and actually let him work for them, at the 
beginning climbing up and down mountains to stake and locate claims for his 
employers; and if Paulino was then insane, it was not likely that Reynolds and 
Harrison would employ him to do the work of staking and locating claims to say 
nothing of taking charge of the payroll of their employees, and registering with 
the Mining Recorder the declarations of location of mining claims. There is 
every reason to believe as we do and hold that at least from about the beginning 
of the year 1931 when Paulino began working for his em-ployers Reynolds and 
Harrison, and when he executed Exhibits A and B, he had the mental capacity to 
transact ordinary business and, was mentally capable of validly entering into a 
contract even conveying property to another. But even assuming that at the time 
of executing Exhibits A and B, Paulino were still mentally incapacitated, still, 
because of his moral and legal obligation to transfer said claims to his 
employers, he could through his guardian have been compelled by the court to 
execute said transfer, or after the termination of his guardianship obliged 
personally to execute said transfer to his employers. He acted as a trustee for 
his employers and the law will not allow him to invoke insanity or mental 
incapacity to violate his trust. </p>
<p align="justify">In relation with this alleged incapacity of Paulino, it is 
interesting to note that when he and his lawyers filed his first complaint in 
1934, that is, about three years after executing Exhibits A and B, they snid 
nothing about being mentally incapacited in 1931. They did not ask for the 
annulment of the deeds of transfer (Exhibits A. and B) on the ground of lack of 
mental capacity. They assumed and took it for granted and led others to believe 
that said deeds of transfer were valid. They only asked for the payment of 
damages. It was not until five years later in the year 1939 when they filed the 
first amended complaint that they raised this question of mental incapacity. It 
took him and his lawyers almost five years to discover and claim that he 
(Paulino) was not mentally capable to enter into a contract when he executed 
exhibits A and B. In view of all this, we may well and logically presume that 
all the time that Paulino was employed by Reynolds and Harrison to locate and 
register mining claims for them, and at the time that he executed Exhibits A 
and B and for several years thereafter when he continued in their employ, 
neither Fructuoso, Paulino's brother nor defendants Reynolds and Harrison had 
any reason to suspect, much less, to believe that Paulino was other than a sane, 
responsible, and mentally capable individual, able to take care not only of 
himself and his interest but also of the interests of his employers. Neither did 
the other employees of Reynolds and Harrison to whom Paulino paid wages on 
pay-days, he being in charge of the payroll, and the Mining Recorder before whom 
he executed proper and valid affidavits of locations for purposes of 
registration, note any mental incapacity on the part of Paulino. All this goes 
to reinforce the finding that Paulino was mentally sane and capable in 1931.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for appellant next contends that Exhibits A and B 
should be declared void for lack of consideration. Said two deeds each mentions 
P1.00 and other valuable consideration, the receipt whereof was acknowledged, to 
be the consideration. We believe that that consideration is sufficient, this 
aside from the provision of law (article 1277 of the Civil Code), that 
consideration in a contract will be presumed and that it is licit, unless the 
debtor prove the contrary which Paulino in this case failed to establish. 
Furthermore, according to Reynolds, in consideration of the transfer of these 
mining claims, he had later paid Paulino between P3,000 and P5,000. This was not 
refuted by Paulino. Moreover, under the view we take of the mining claims having 
been located for the benefit of defendants Reynolds and Harrison, by Paulino in 
his capacity as their employee, paid for that purpose, no consideration for the 
conveyances was even necessary. He was merely fulfilling an obligation and 
complying with a trust.</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion we find and hold that Exhibits A and B were valid 
conveyances executed by one who was mentally capable. Consequently, Reynolds and 
Harrison had a valid title to convey as they did convey to defendant Big Wedge 
Mining Co., in Exhibits C, D, and J. </p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, finding no reversible error in the 
decision appealed from the same is hereby affirmed, with costs. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span> and
