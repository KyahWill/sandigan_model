				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from a judgment of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; denying' a petition of petitioner-appellant for the issuance of a writ of mandamus against respondent-appellee,&nbsp; in his capacity as Director of the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Private Schools, to compel him to furnish petitioner-appellant with true copies&nbsp; of the transcript of records&nbsp; of four students&nbsp; of the defunct Mindanao Academy, Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental. Petitioner-appellant acquired the Mindanao Academy&nbsp; on May 10, 1954.&nbsp; On December 19, 1956, he sent a letter to the respondent-appellee&nbsp; requesting that he be&nbsp; furnished true copies&nbsp; of the records of each of four students.&nbsp; In answer respondent suggested that said records be&nbsp; secured from the former owners of the academy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of&nbsp; this denial petitioner insisted&nbsp; upon his request, explaining that the records of the former school were in a disordered&nbsp; topsy-turvey&nbsp; condition,&nbsp; threatening&nbsp; to&nbsp; file charges&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondent if&nbsp; he fails to furnish the records requested within 96 hours, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This second letter was coursed through&nbsp; the Secretary of&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Education. The respondent did not&nbsp; heed the demand and threat, explaining that it is not the policy of his Bureau to issue copies of its records to schools, unless the&nbsp; latter have suffered&nbsp; a calamity that has caused loss of its records; that his&nbsp; office, upon&nbsp; orders of the Secretary,&nbsp; is checking records of public school teachers who are claiming adjustment of their salaries, and the issuance of copies might nullify the work&nbsp; of investigation; and that until his office has&nbsp; completed the investigation of the&nbsp; records&nbsp; in&nbsp; question and&nbsp; is&nbsp; convinced that they are&nbsp; authentic, no true copies could&nbsp; be used.<br><br>Thereupon, petitioner brought the action in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila.&nbsp; This&nbsp; court&nbsp; denied the petition on&nbsp; three grounds: (1)&nbsp; that no appeal has been made by petitioner-appellant&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Secretary of Education,&nbsp; which is a&nbsp; more speedy&nbsp; and adequate remedy; (2) that there is no specific legal duty on the part of respondent to issue the&nbsp; copies demanded;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) no evidence was submitted that&nbsp; the records&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; can not be obtained.<br><br>We hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below&nbsp; correctly&nbsp; denied the petition for failure of petitioner-appellant&nbsp; to exhaust the administrative remedy, most&nbsp; speedy&nbsp; and adequate, of appealing the refusal of the respondent-appellant&nbsp; to his immediate superior, the Secretary of Education, in accordance&nbsp; with the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies&nbsp; enunciated by this Court in a&nbsp; great number of cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lamb <i>vs.</i> Phipps, 22 Phil., 456; Miguel <i>vs.</i> Vda. de Reyes, 93 Phil., 542;&nbsp; Wee Poco <i>vs.</i> Posadas, 64 Phil., 640; Lucas <i>vs.</i> Durian, G.&nbsp; R. No. 1-7886, September 23, 1957; Harry Lyons, Inc., <i>vs.</i> U.S.A.,&nbsp; 104 Phil., 594).<br><br>&nbsp;The applicability of the principle above mentioned becomes imperative&nbsp; if&nbsp; we&nbsp; take&nbsp; into&nbsp; account&nbsp; that the petitioner-appellant had been expressly advised by letter of respondent-appellee that the Secretary of Education had&nbsp; given instructions for the checking of the records of public school teachers who are claiming&nbsp; adjustment of their salaries in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 842, which instructions might fail of enforcement if records of teachers in respondent's office are&nbsp; divulged. (Petitioner-appellant's brief, pp.&nbsp; 7-8).&nbsp; Under these&nbsp; circumstances, it is evident that the remedy most appropriate and&nbsp; speedy available to petitioner was an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Secretary of Education in whose discretion the enforcement or non-enforcement of the instructions being carried out&nbsp; by respondent-appellee clearly&nbsp; lies.&nbsp; In&nbsp; passing, it may be illuminating to recall the fact, of which we may take judicial notice, that upon enactment&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 842, which standardized the salaries&nbsp; of public school teachers according to their degrees, a mad scramble&nbsp; for degrees ensued among teachers, giving rise to the&nbsp; indiscriminate issuance of diplomas by private schools, which in turn&nbsp; resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; "diploma mill" scandals then subject of investigation.<br><br>Without considering the&nbsp; other&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; given by&nbsp; the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> for denying the petition, we&nbsp; hold that under the&nbsp; particular&nbsp; circumstances of the&nbsp; present case&nbsp; said denial&nbsp; is&nbsp; fully justified.&nbsp; Coursing of the communication or request through the Secretary of Education can&nbsp; not be considered&nbsp; as an&nbsp; appeal to&nbsp; this official.<br><br>The decision subject of appeal&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; petitioner-appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L., Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
