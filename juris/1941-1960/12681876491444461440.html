				G.R. No. L-7775, December 19, 1955</h4>
				<H3>CARLOS AMAR, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE SEGUNDO C. MOSCOSO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, AND THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL FOR THE PROVINCE OF DAVAO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Carlos Amar claims that his conviction and the penalty imposed upon him for 
evasion of service of sentence in criminal case No. 1999 of the Court of 
First Instance of Davao was void because when he escaped from prison on 15 
December 1952 he was not yet convicted by final judgment for frustrated murder 
in criminal case No. 4355 of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, the judgment 
of conviction for such crime having been rendered in February 1951 and appealed 
to the Court of Appeals; that on 30 October 1951 while his appeal was pending he 
was transferred to the Davao Penal Colony from where he escaped on 15 December 
1952 but was captured six days later; and that the Court of First Instance of 
Davao committed grave abuse of discretion and exceeded its jurisdiction in 
convicting him for evasion of service of sentence in criminal case No. 1999 
referred to, he not having been convicted by final judgment in criminal case No. 
4355 also referred to, as provided for in art. 157 of the Revised Penal Code. 
For that reason he prays that a writ of <em>certiorari</em> issue commanding the 
respondent court to forward the record of criminal case. No. 1999 for review and 
after hearing to declare void and annul the judgment rendered therein.
<p>The Solicitor General in behalf of the respondents denies that the defendant, 
now petitioner, was found guilty of frustrated murder in criminal'case No. 4355 
of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, the truth being that he was charged 
with frustrated murder and found guilty of frustrated homicide and,such verdict 
and sentence became final on 9 March 1954 when the Court of Appeals upon motion 
of the appellant, now petitioner, dismissed the appeal. He avers that the Court 
of First Instance of Davao convicted the defendant, now petitioner, in criminal 
case No. 1999, of evasion of service of sentence and imposed upon him the 
penalty of 2 years, 4 months and 1 day of <em>prision correccional</em>, the 
accessories of the law, and to pay the costs, not knowing that the defendant, 
now petitioner, was a detention prisoner and not a convict when he escaped from 
prison, because upon arraignment he entered a plea of guilty to the crime of 
evasion of service of sentence charged against him in the information, and the 
Court was not aware of the fact that at the time of his. escape he was just a 
detention prisoner; and that not having been apprised of the fact that the 
defendant, now petitioner, was a detention prisoner and in view of his plea of 
guilty, the respondent court properly and lawfully entered the judgment 
complained of. He contends that the extraordinary remedy of <em>certiorari</em> 
is not proper and available, because to correct an erroneous judgment rendered 
by a competent court an appeal is the remedy; that the Court of First Instance 
of Davao had jurisdiction to try the defendant, now petitioner, for the crime 
charged in the information; and that the judgment of conviction rendered in 
criminal case No. 1999 for evasion of service of sentence having become final 
this Court has no jurisdiction to review, modify, reverse or set it aside. Upon 
those averments he prays that the petition be dismissed, with costs.</p>
<p>The reply of the petitioner to the answer of the respondents does not deny 
the fact that he entered a plea of guilty to the information filed against him 
for evasion of service of sentence in criminal case No. 1999 of the Court of 
First Instance of Davao. He, however, claims that he entered the plea without 
the aid of counsel and not knowing the legal implications and consequences 
thereof. He further claims that his failure to appeal from the judgment of 
conviction was lack of sufficient knowledge and information of the step he was 
to take.</p>
<p>As the reply of the petitioner in effect admits that he entered a plea of 
guilty to the information filed against him for evasion of service of sentence, 
this Court is powerless to review by a writ of <em>certiorari</em> the judgment 
complained of rendered upon that plea, it having been rendered by a competent 
court and being now final and executory. The petitioner's claim that he did not 
have the assistance of counsel cannot prevail, over the presumption that the 
proceedings had been regular and in accordance (with the provisions of the Rules 
of Court, to wit: that he was afforded the assistance of counsel and that he was 
informed by the Court that it was his right to have an attorney before 
arraignment and was asked if he desired the aid of one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
