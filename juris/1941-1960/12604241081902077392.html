				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Manila Jockey Club, Inc.&nbsp; is the owner of the San, Lazaro Hippodrome which is used principally for holding horse races either by the club itself or by the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office or other&nbsp; charitable institutions authorized by law to hold horse races.&nbsp; During the fiscal years 1951&nbsp; and 1952,&nbsp; the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office held&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; races for charitable, relief&nbsp; and&nbsp; civic purposes in said hippodrome for the use of which the Club was paid in the form of rentals the sums of P107,185.02 and P122,855.47 respectively, which&nbsp; were included in&nbsp; its total&nbsp; income declared&nbsp; in its return for said years.&nbsp; The Collector of Internal Revenue collected on the first rental the amount of P30,011.S0 which was paid in two installments and on the second the amount of P29,881.17 which was also&nbsp; paid&nbsp; in two installments&nbsp; as income taxes,&nbsp; and upon&nbsp; advice of. its counsel, the Club filed a claim for refund of&nbsp; said amounts with the&nbsp; Collector claiming&nbsp; that they were&nbsp; illegally paid and, when the refund was&nbsp; denied, it filed an action&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the total sum of P59.692.97 against the Collector alleging&nbsp; that the&nbsp; same&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; wrongfully&nbsp; collected. The case&nbsp; was pending trial&nbsp; when Republic Act No. 1125 creating the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals was approved on June 16, 1954.&nbsp; Pursuant to section 22 of said Act,&nbsp; the court transmitted the case to the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals in an order dated August 18, 1954.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing, the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals&nbsp; rendered a decision holding that the rentals received by the Club from the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office for the use of its premises were exempt from income tax under section 5 of Republic Act No. 79 and, as a consequence, it ordered the Collector of Internal Revenue to refund to the Club the amount of P59,692.97.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; this decision, the Collector of Internal Revenue brought the case on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to this Court.<br><br>It is not&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; that on&nbsp; the days&nbsp; the San&nbsp; Lazaro Hippodrome was leased and used by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office to hold benefit races for charitable and civic&nbsp; purposes, said&nbsp; Office&nbsp; employed&nbsp; its own&nbsp; employees, tellers and other&nbsp; personnel in the race track.&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not employ the personnel of the club but merely used its track, apparatus&nbsp; and other&nbsp; paraphernalia&nbsp; necessary for horse racing.&nbsp; And for such use, the&nbsp; Club was paid for each day a flat rental and not on percentage basis.&nbsp; It may therefore be&nbsp; said&nbsp; that during&nbsp; those&nbsp; days it was the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office that held the races and not the Club itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of these facts can it be said that the rentals paid by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office to the Club for the use of its facilities on those days are exempt from income tax under section 3 of Republic Act No. 79?&nbsp; This&nbsp; would require an analysis of the provisions of said Act to determine its real import.<br><br>Because&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; importance,&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 79&nbsp; is hereunder reproduced in full.<br><blockquote>"AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE&nbsp; HOLDING&nbsp; BY THE PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKE OFFICE OF HORSE RACES, WITH BETTING,&nbsp; ON&nbsp; SATURDAY&nbsp; AFTERNOONS, FOR CHARITABLE, BELIEF AND CIVIC PURPOSES.<br><br><i>"Be it enacted by the&nbsp; Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled: </i><br><br>"Section 1. The provisions of existing laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board&nbsp; of Directors&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office&nbsp; is authorized to hold&nbsp; horse races, with betting, on such Saturday afternoons as it may determine&nbsp; for charitable, relief and civic purposes.&nbsp; Only native horses shall be allowed to run in any of these races. <br><br>"Sec. 2. All proceeds derived from these races,&nbsp; after deducting the prizes customarily set aside for horses winning first,&nbsp; second, and third places and their jockeys; the prizes for the owners of the winning horses;&nbsp; and the necessary administration expenses not |to exceed ten&nbsp; per centum of the gross receipts, shall he apportioned and distributed by the Board of Directors of the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office&nbsp; to disabled&nbsp; veterans,&nbsp; war widows and&nbsp; orphans and to&nbsp; charitable, relief and civic organizations in such&nbsp; amounts and under such rules and regulations as may be approved, by the President of the Philippines. &nbsp;<br><br>"Sec. 3. The racing club holding these races shall be exempt from the payment of&nbsp; any&nbsp; municipal or national tax. <br><br>"Sec. 4. The term 'horses' when used in&nbsp; this Act&nbsp; shall be understood&nbsp; to refer to stallions and mares.<br><br>"Ssc. 5. This Act shall take&nbsp; effect upon its approval.<br><br>"Approved, October 21, 1946."<br></blockquote>Note that the title of the Act says "An Act to authorize the <i>Holding by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake</i> Office of&nbsp; Horse Races,&nbsp; with&nbsp; Betting, on Saturday Afternoons, for&nbsp; Charitable, Relief&nbsp; and Civic&nbsp; Purposes."&nbsp; Note&nbsp; also that, under section 1, the Board of&nbsp; Directors&nbsp; is&nbsp; the one authorized to hold the races for the&nbsp; purposes above-mentioned and,&nbsp; under section 2, it is provided that the administration expenses for running the&nbsp; races,&nbsp; including&nbsp; the prizes to be paid to the winners, shall not exceed 10 per cent&nbsp; of the gross receipts that may be collected, which shall be deducted from said gross receipts before turning them over to the beneficiaries named in the law.&nbsp; And, in section 3, there appears&nbsp; the&nbsp; following proviso: "The racing club holding these races shall be exempt from the payment of any&nbsp; municipal or national&nbsp; tax."&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is under the&nbsp; proviso that the&nbsp; Club&nbsp; claims&nbsp; exemption&nbsp; from&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of income tax&nbsp; on the rentals in question.<br><br>From the above&nbsp; analysis of the law, it can&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; be inferred that what is contemplated is the&nbsp; holding of horse races, not merely under its auspices,&nbsp; but by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office itself, even if for that purpose it has to&nbsp; lease or make use of race tracks&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to private racing clubs.&nbsp; The purpose of the law undoubtedly is to give to&nbsp; said Office&nbsp; full control&nbsp; of the&nbsp; horse races considering that they&nbsp; involve.the handling of funds. And evidently this is also the interpretation entertained by the officials of said Office, when, instead of employing the personnel of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Jockey&nbsp; Club,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; employed its own personnel and assumed&nbsp; full control of the races.&nbsp; It is because&nbsp; of this view of the law that we believe that the provisions&nbsp; of section 3 should be interpreted&nbsp; as conveying the meaning that the one holding the races is not the racing club but the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office and that the exemption therein provided only&nbsp; refers to those taxes, municipal or national, that the law requires to be. paid&nbsp; in connection with said&nbsp; races.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; said&nbsp; section should be read to mean "the racing&nbsp; club where the races are held"&nbsp; in order that it may be consistent with the purpose of the law.<br><br>It may be contended that if&nbsp; that law should&nbsp; be interpreted to&nbsp; mean that&nbsp; it merely contemplates the holding of races by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, the proviso regarding the exemption from the payment of tax would be a surplusage or meaningless because, under section 6 of Act&nbsp; No. 4130,&nbsp; said Office is already exempt from paying any tax on the proceeds that it may derive, from said races. While apparently there&nbsp; is some force in this argument, it is&nbsp; not so when we consider that owners&nbsp; or operators of race trades are required by other laws to pay certain specific taxes&nbsp; for <span style="font-style: italic;">each day on which races are run on said tracks regardless of whether they are held by the club or by other entities.</span>&nbsp; And such proviso was evidently inserted in order to place the races held on said tracks&nbsp; by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office out of the operation of said laws. <br><br>We refer to Republic. Act No. 309 which&nbsp; regulates the horse&nbsp; racing&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines and section&nbsp; 193 of the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code, as&nbsp; amended by Republic Act No. 588.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, under section 26 of Republic Act No. 309,&nbsp; any person, race track, racing club, or other entities holding or conducting a horse race shall be required to pay a city or municipal license fee&nbsp; of P600 for each day of racing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And under section 193 of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code, as&nbsp; amended, any owner of <span style="font-style: italic;">race tracks</span>&nbsp; is required&nbsp; to pay a fixed tax of P500 for each, day on which races are run on said, tracks. It should be noted that said provisions require the&nbsp; payment of said <span style="font-style: italic;">taxes</span>&nbsp; from the owner of any race&nbsp; track&nbsp; for <span style="font-style: italic;">each day</span> of horse racing regardless of whether&nbsp; said horse&nbsp; racing is held by the owner himself or&nbsp; by any&nbsp; other person&nbsp; or entity, it is therefore imperative that such exemption be&nbsp; expressly provided for in&nbsp; order, to exempt&nbsp; the owner of the race track of such taxes if the same is to be used by a charitable institution like the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office, The foregoing lead us to the conclusion that the exemption&nbsp; clause provided for in section&nbsp; 3&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 79 merely intends&nbsp; to&nbsp; exempt the&nbsp; racing&nbsp; club&nbsp; in&nbsp; whose premises or tracks the races are&nbsp; held by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweepstake&nbsp; Office from the payment of the taxes we have&nbsp; above adverted to because they are the only ones that&nbsp; have any connection with the races held by said Office. It cannot certainly refer to any income tax that may be imposed on the rentals that may be paid for the use of those tracks and&nbsp; other paraphernalia.&nbsp; That is an income that the racing club&nbsp; has to account&nbsp; for income tax purposes because it is an income that the club earned because of the use of its tracks&nbsp; by the Philippine&nbsp; Charity Sweepstake Office. It is an income that, strictly speaking, did not coma from the horse races held by said&nbsp; club but it came to it as rentals paid&nbsp; for the use of&nbsp; its property.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the tax paid&nbsp; for such&nbsp; income cannot therefore&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as one connected with those races&nbsp; within the purview of the exemption clause.<br><br>Our attention&nbsp; was called to the&nbsp; fact that, if the racing club&nbsp; were to pay income tax on the&nbsp; rentals that may be paid&nbsp; to it for the use of its tracks by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office or were to. be denied the benefit of the exemption clause under&nbsp; consideration, the beneficiaries of the bounty would be the ones prejudiced because the racing club might be obliged to&nbsp; shift the burden to the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office in the form of additional rentals or&nbsp; by increasing&nbsp; their amount so as to compensate, the club for the tax that it should otherwise pay to the Government. Such fear can hardly be entertained not only because there are several racing clubs in the City of Manila which may be availed of by the Philippine Charity Sweepstake Office but also because&nbsp; the&nbsp; law itself limits the administration&nbsp; expenses that&nbsp; said Office may&nbsp; incur&nbsp; in connection with the authorized horse races for the purposes intended.&nbsp; And even if&nbsp; this contingency may eventually occur, this would not warrant the adoption of an interpretation which would be contrary to the clear&nbsp; import and intendment of the&nbsp; law.<br><br>Another factor that should&nbsp; be borne in mind in connection with the&nbsp; interpretation of the exemption&nbsp; clause under consideration is that by its. very nature&nbsp; the law that&nbsp; exempts one from tax must&nbsp; be clearly expressed because the exemption cannot be&nbsp; created&nbsp; by&nbsp; implication. Thus, it was held that "Exemption from taxation are highly disfavored in law; and he who claims an exemption must be able to justify his claim by the clearest grant of organic&nbsp; or&nbsp; statute law.&nbsp;&nbsp; An exemption from the common burden cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; permitted to exist upon vague implication."&nbsp; (Asiatic Petroleum Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Llanes, 49 Phil., 466; See also House <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Posadas, 58 Phil., 338.)&nbsp; In the present" ease, there is&nbsp; no clear showing that the exemption clause under consideration exempts the racing club from its duty to pay income tax.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed.&nbsp; The case is dismissed with costs against respondent.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
