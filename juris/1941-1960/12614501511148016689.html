				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE JOSE P. VELUZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MISAMIS ORIENTAL, AND MARIA BACUT, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to annul the order of the respondent judge, 
Honorable Jose P. Veluz, quashing the writ of execution and the sheriff's sale 
in Criminal Case No. 1044 of the court of first instance of Misamis 
Oriental.
<p>The records show that, prosecuted for illegal possession of opium, Maria 
Bacut was sentenced to suffer three months of <em>arresto mayor</em> and to pay 
a fine of P1,000 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. She entered 
jail on April 2, 1951 and was released on July 13, 1951 after having served the 
principal penalty plus subsidiary imprisonment for the fine (with good conduct 
allowance).</p>
<p>On November 5, 1951, pursuant to an alias writ of execution on account of the 
fine, the Sheriff levied upon, and sold at public auction, a piece of land 
declared for taxation in the name of Maria Bacut. The highest bidder turned out 
to be the Republic of the Philippines; and on that date the corresponding 
certificate of conveyance was duly notarized.</p>
<p>However, on April 16, 1952 Maria Bacut filed a motion wherein, asserting full 
service of her subsidiary imprisonment and her consequent release from liability 
for the fine, she prayed for annulment of the proceedings in connection with the 
execution. She alleged, furthermore, that the property no longer belonged to 
her, inasmuch as she had sold it to Erlinda Bacor in January 1951.</p>
<p>The motion was opposed by the prosecution; but on December 23, 1953 the 
respondent judge granted it, ordering the annulment of all proceedings in the 
execution and sale of the property, on the ground that they were not authorized 
by law—Maria Bacut having actually served the subsidiary imprisonment.</p>
<p>After failing in a motion to reconsider, the prosecution submitted the 
instant petition, contending that the respondent judge had no jurisdiction to 
annul the proceedings, for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>Maria Bacut could not lawfully serve subsidiary imprisonment, because she 
had property; 
</li><li>Maria Bacut could not properly file the motion on behalf of the interested 
party, Erlinda Bacor; 
</li><li>Anyway, the motion was untimely, having been submitted after the lapse of 
the period prescribed in sec. 15 Rule 89. </li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The first reason is based on the supposition that on April 1951, when Bacut 
entered jail, she had this particular piece of property. However, the 
supposition proved to be unfounded, because <em>a few months before she had 
disposed of it</em> in favor of Erlinda Bacor.</p>
<p>The second reason is also untenable, because Maria Bacut had an interest in 
the annulment of the proceedings, considering her possible liability for 
eviction if the property she had conveyed to Erlinda should finally be taken 
away from the latter's possession.</p>
<p>Again, the third ground of the petition is unmeritorious, because section 15, 
Rule 39, applies to a third party—not to Maria Bacut who was the accused 
herself.</p>
<p>It must be observed in this connection that by express provision of the 
Revised Penal Code service of subsidiary imprisonment for the fine relieves the 
convict "from pecuniary liability as to the fine" (Art. 39 Rev. Penal Code). 
There might be something to petitioner's contention that "a convict who is not 
insolvent could not evade the fine by serving the subsidiary imprisonment"; but 
the point need not be discussed now, because the record does not show that Maria 
Bacut <em>was not</em> insolvent when she underwent subsidiary imprisonment.</p>
<p>In connection with petitioner's contention that the court had no jurisdiction 
to act on Maria Bacut's motion, the governing principles are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court issuing the execution retains a certain amount of control 
thereover even after the writ leaves its hands, but such control is limited and 
regulated by fairly definite rules of law and is not unrestricted. The court may 
quash the writ of execution when it appears: (<em>a</em>) that it has been 
improvidently issued, or (<em>b</em>) that it is defective in substance, or 
(<em>c</em>) that it has been issued against the wrong party, or (<em>d</em>) 
that the judgment debt has been paid, or (<em>e</em>) that the writ has been 
issued without authority; etc." (Quoting Dimayuga <em>vs</em>. Raymundo, 42 Off. 
Gaz., (No. 9), p. 2121.) (Moran Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 Ed. Vol. I 
p. 811-812)</p></blockquote>
<p>And if there is any further doubt about the authority of the Court to 
consider Maria Bacut's motion of April 16, attention may be directed to section 
43, Rule 39 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 43. <em>When admission of satisfaction, or entry of satisfaction 
without admission, ordered</em>.—Whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact, 
otherwise than upon an execution, the judgment creditor or Ins attorney must 
execute and acknowledge, or indorse, an admission of the satisfaction as 
provided in the last preceding section, and after notice and upon motion the 
court may order either the judgment creditor or attorney so to do, or may order 
the entry of satisfaction to be made without it."</p></blockquote>
<p>The aforesaid motion, falls within the scope of this section besides asking 
for annulment of the proceedings it prayed for a declaration that the accused 
was "relieved from the fine of P1,000 having paid the same by subsidiary 
imprisonment".</p>
<p>Wherefore, no excess of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion having been 
shown, the petition for certiorari is hereby denied. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition denied.</em></p></div>
