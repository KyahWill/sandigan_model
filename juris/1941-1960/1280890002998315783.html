				<H3>ASIA STEEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND ISMAEL CARBAJOSA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition to review the order of the Workmen's Compensation Commission 
approving the award of its referee in favor of the laborer Ismael Carbajosa, 
against his employer Asia Steel Corporation.
<p>It appears that on April 16, 1951, while working in said Corporation's steel 
factory in Grace Park, Manila, Carbajosa tapped the belt of a running machine to 
tighten it, but his hand was caught accidentally by the belt, he stumbled down 
and his two feet were so seriously injured, they had to be amputated at the 
Chinese General Hospital where he was rushed immediately after the mishap. 
Hospitalization were paid by the corporation. </p>
<p>Thereafter Carbajosa claimed for compensation. The referee, having found that 
he was employed as apprentice, and that the accident arose out of employment, 
required the Asia Steel Corporation to indemnify in the total sum of two 
thousand two hundred forty six pesos and forty centavos (P2,246.40) and to pay 
the costs.</p>
<p>The instant petition for review rests on two major propositions: (1) Ismael 
Carbajosa was not an employee or laborer and (2) the accident was "occasioned by" 
his "own fault and negligence".</p>
<p>This second issue, however, was not tendered in the Corporation's motion to 
dismiss, Annex B, filed with Workmen's Compensation Commission, and neither the 
referee nor the Commission made findings on such question of negligence. Anyway 
it is no excuse for the employer: it merely reduces the compensation. (Art. 1711 
New Civil Code.) Nevertheless, on close examination the contention turn out to 
be founded on the reasoning that <u>being a stranger</u> in the premises -not an 
employee- Carbajosa had no right, and therefore was careless, to touch the 
machines of the factory. (p. 27 Record.)</p>
<p>Hence this revision may be limited to the simple question whether the 
petitioner had given employment to Carbajosa.</p>
<p>According to the Commission,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x the claimant, a native of Negros Occidental, came to Manila on March 
31, 1951, to look for a job. On April 5, 1951, he met an aquaintance, Pablo 
Sesia, whose aid sought in the matter of securing employment. Sesia, who was 
employed in the Asia Steel Corporation as a mechanic, promised to take Carbajosa 
to his employer.</p>
<p>Upon previous arrangement with Sesia, therefore, Carbajosa went to 
respondent's nail factory at Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal, on April 9, 1951. 
Sesia introduced the claimant to Mr. Kim, in charge of the factory. During the 
interview, Kim told the claimant that he, (Kim) would take up the matter with 
the manager, and Carbajosa would know the manager's decision as soon as he (the 
claimant) returned. The next morning, the claimant came back to the factory and 
was told by Kim to begin working as an apprentice. It was further agreed that 
claimant's wage would be determined upon the arrival of materials which the 
manager ordered from Japan. The claimant assumed work on the same day, doing odd 
jobs under the direction of Sesia.</p>
<p>It also appears that Kim lived in the factory. Pablo Sesia was also lodging 
in the factory and permission was secured from Kim in order that the claimant 
might live in the factory with Sesia.</p>
<p>On April 16, 1951, hardly a week since the claimant began working in the 
factory, while he was tightening the belt of one of the machines, his hand was 
caught by the running belt. The force of the moving belt caused claimant to lose 
his balance. He was dragged to the other end of the machine. His feet were 
smashed by the iron shaft and he was pinned under the machine itself."x x 
x</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the laws we are bound to accept these findings; and must disregard 
petitioner's arguments disputing them<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>. 
But this does not necessarily dispose of the matter, because ther remains the 
legal proposition extensively discussed by counsel for petitioner that Kim's 
acts could not bind the corporation, since only the President, Yu Kong Tiong, 
was authorized by its by-laws to hire employees for the manufacturing 
establishment.</p>
<p>The Commission found that Yu Kong Tiong was the president of the corporation 
and Sy Te the manager; but Yu Kong Tiong was permitted actually to manage its 
affairs, (it being a "family" corporation) by remote control from his office in 
Manila thru Kim who was "in charge" of the factory in Caloocan. It also declared 
that Kim was allowed by Yu Kong Tiong to employ Carbajosa as apprentice. (p. 52 
Record.)</p>
<p>From such circumstances, the conclusion flows inevitably that Carbajosa was, 
at the time of the occurence, an employee of the petitioning corporation.</p>
<p>Of course it is undeniable that as president and manager Yu Kong Tiong could 
legally employ, by himself, manual laborers to work in the factory<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>. And there is nothing to prevent him from 
employing Carbajosa, thru his agent Kim, as the latter did. In fact it may even 
be held that in default of proof establishing Yu Kong Tiong's assent to the 
employment, inasmuch as Kim the person actually in charge of the factory 
represented to Carbajosa that he was authorized by the manager to engage his 
(Carbajosa's) services, there was apparent authority of Kim, sufficiently ample 
to create the relationship of employer and employee for the purposes of the 
Workmen's Compensation Law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It may be stated as a general rule that anagent, who with authority express, 
implied, apparent or actual, employs help for the benefit of his principal's 
business, therby creates the relationship of employer and employee between such 
help and his principal." (Schneider, Workmen's Compensation (Permanent Ed.) Vol. 
I p. 617, citing many cases.)</p>
<p>"It has been held: that where a driver, employed to solicit sales of beer and 
make delivery, was permitted to employ helpers, a helper who was injured while 
in the performance of his duty was entitled to compensation from brewery; that 
an expert, hired by a factory owner to supervise the installation of machinery, 
who hired assistants, paid by the owner, one of such assistants being injured 
while so engaged was entitled to compensation from the factory owner; that 
workmen hired by an agent of the company, which took over the logging work of an 
independent contractor, became the employees of the company." (Schneider, op. 
cit. p. 619.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, the existence of employer-employee relationship is the 
jurisdictional foundation without which an indemnity is unauthorized. Schneider 
p. 569-570.) It is often difficult of determination, because purposely made so 
by employers bent on evading liability under the Compensation Acts. Hence, if 
the object of the law is to be accomplished with a liberal construction<span class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span>, the creation of the relationship should not 
be adjudged strictly in accordance with technical legal rules, but rather 
according to the actualities and realities of industrial or business practice. A 
laborer is told to work for the establishment by the person-in-charge, who in 
turn represented he had consulted with the manager. If the by-laws of the 
corporation had provided that no laborer may be hired unless with the written 
consent of the board of directors, would it be consonant with justice to deny 
such laborer compensation for injuries, upon the ground of lack of written 
authority? If so, a loophole has thereby been created in the Workmen's 
Compensation Law. That is perhaps the reason why apparent authority has been 
considered enough, what with the principles of estoppel lending persuasive 
support. (Schneider op. cit. Vol. I p. 623.)</p>
<p>A parallel situation arose in Flores et al. v. La Compañia Maritima, 32 O. 
Gaz. No. 21 pp. 406-407. The heirs of Graciano Paninsoro demanded compensation 
because he died by reason of injuries received while working on the ship "Albay" 
belonging to and operated by the Compañia Maritima, a corporation. The facts 
were;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"About the last week of the month of October, 1929, the defendant's boat, 
Albay, dropped anchor in the port of Cebu where the captain thereof, through a 
contractor or agent, recruited laborers who were to board the ship for the 
purpose of unloading her cargo upon arrival at the next port of call, Davao, and 
loading cargo for various ports of call on her return trip. Among those laborers 
was the appellant Eusebia Flores' husband, Graciano Paninsoro, who was earning a 
daily wage of P1.50 including subsistence."</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant contended on appeal that Paninsoro was not its employee. This 
Court held,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is not a least shadow of a doubt that the deceased was a laborer in 
the legal sense. He had been recruited by order of the captain of the ship and 
he was engage in a task of unloading the ship's cargo at the time of the 
accident. There can be no dispute that this kind of work is included in the 
business in which the appellee is engaged. That the deceased had been recruited 
or engaged by a contractor is of no moment because the latter, for purposes of 
the law, was in turn, represented the appellee." (Flores et al. v. La Compañia 
Maritima, 32 O. Gaz. No. 21 pp. 406-407.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be observed in the above litigation that neither the board of 
directors nor the President nor the manager of the defendant corporation had 
hired the laborer Paninsoro. It was the captain of the ship, thru an agent, that 
employed him. Now then, in this case as the person-in-charge of the factory 
(Kim) hired Carbajosa, the contract of employment should be upheld.</p>
<p>There is further circumstance, implying ratification of the employment, that 
the acting manager of the corporation Atty. Mercado directed the payment by the 
corporation of Carbajosa's hospital expenses, amounting to P2,000.00. Mercado's 
explanation that he did it out of pity, was not, and could not be accepted since 
the Asia Steel Corporation is not a charitable institution.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, and the petitioner not having questioned the amount 
of compensation, the order of the Commission, should be , as it is hereby, 
affirmed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
