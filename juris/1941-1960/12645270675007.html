				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On April 3, 1945, Dolores de Ugarte filed a complaint for ejectment in the Municipal  Court of Manila against Anita de los  Reyes,  The municipal  court held  for Dolores  de Ugarte and ordered Anita de los Reyes to vacate the premises in  question,  designated as  336-B  Cataluna  Street. From this order, Reyes appealed to  the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>
<p>On July 10,  1945, at the trial in the Court of First Instance of Manila, the parties through their respective attorneys, submitted a compromise-agreement for  approval. In substance, the pertinent portion of the agreement provides that defendant Reyes could occupy the premises until September 15,  1945, at the same rate of  rental,  <em>i. e.</em>, P30 per month, binding herself to vacate the premises on that date.  Judgment was rendered in accordance with the compromise, but written notice  thereof was  not  served  upon the parties.</p>
<p>On September  18, 1945, Ugarte filed a motion asking for a writ of execution, which was granted. On September 19, and  subsequent dates, defendant Reyes filed  a motion to quash the writ of execution and a motion  for relief on the ground  of fraud or misrepresentation. The court denied the motion to quash the writ, and Reyes filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.   The motion  for relief was  likewise denied.  Hence, this  petition for certiorari praying  for the annulment of the writ of execution upon the ground that it was issued without jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Petitioner  alleges that no formal notice has ever  been served upon her  of the judgment rendered approving the compromise.  Requirement as to notice was, however, substantially complied with when petitioner  acquired knowledge of the writ of execution containing a literal copy of the judgment, so much  so that she later filed  a motion to quash and a motion for relief. A judgment on compromise is  not  appealable and is immediately executory  unless a motion is filed to set aside the compromise on  the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, in which event an appeal may be taken from  the order denying the motion,  and that is petitioner's remedy in this case and not certiorari in this Court.   Petition is dismissed, without costs.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.,</strong></p>
<p>On April  3, 1945, Dolores de Ugarte filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila to eject Anita de los Reyes from an <em>accesoria</em> located at No. 336-B  Cataluna, Sampaloc,  Manila.  Said  court rendered decision ordering defendant  to  vacate the  premises and to pay the monthly rent of P30 from April 1, 1945.  Defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>
<p>On July 10, 1945, at the hearing of the case, on the basis of an  agreement submitted by both parties, decision was rendered allowing Anita de los  Reyes to  remain in the premises only until September 15, 1945.   She agreed to vacate the <em>accesoria</em> on or before said date. It was also agreed that  plaintiff may withdraw from the  court the amounts deposited by defendant  as  rents, that  defendant shall continue paying the monthly rent of  P30 until September 15, 1945, and that she will pay the costs.   The decision  was verbally rendered by Judge De  la Rosa in open court,  and was noted down by the official stenographer, including the text of the agreement which forms part of the decision.  This was later transcribed and on July 11, 1945, the decision, as transcribed, was signed by Judge De la Rosa.   On the same  day a copy was  secured by  the attorney for plaintiff  in order to enable her to withdraw the rents deposited in court.</p>
<p>No notice or copy of the decision as signed by respondent judge was served on  the defendant or her  attorney.</p>
<p>Upon <em>ex parte</em> application of plaintiff, a writ for the execution  of the decision was issued on September 18, 1945. Upon learning of the issuance of said  writ of execution, defendant filed on September 19 a motion to quash said writ of execution on the ground that she was not notified of the  decision rendered in the case  and that, upon notification  of said decision,  she intended  to pray that said decision be vacated on the ground that the stipulation upon which it is based was obtained from the defendant by fraud or false representation on the part of the plaintiff's  agent.</p>
<p>On September 27, defendant filed a motion for new trial, on the grounds of  fraud, mistake and surprise, supported by an affidavit signed by defendant, wherein she stated that when she entered into the agreement upon which the decision was based she at the same time had an understanding with the administrator or agent of the plaintiff to the effect that she could continue occupying the property "by paying a reasonable increase in the rental," which was never specified or agreed upon.  Defendant alleged also that she consented to the stipulation because of the assurance of the administrator that  she could continue occupying the premises after September  15, by  paying an unspecified  increased rental.</p>
<p>On October 2, the motion to quash the writ of execution was denied.   On October  3,  defendant filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied on October 4.  The motion for new trial was  denied on  October 8, upon the ground that the judgment rendered in the case became final and executory.</p>
<p>Plaintiff contends that the fact that defendant  was not notified of the  decision as signed by the judge does not operate to nullify  the  writ of  execution.  Among others, her attorney cites  the following authority:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the absence of  statute, a judgment or decree entered by  the consent of  the parties can not be reviewed by appeal  or by error proceedings. The consent however must extend to the entire judgment."  (Nashville, C. M. St. L. E. Co.<em> vs.</em> United States, 113 U. S., 261; Adler<em> vs.</em> Van Kirk Land &amp; Construction Co., 114 Ala., 551; 62 Am. St. Rep., 135; 21  S. 0., 490;  Show <em>vs.</em> Apelke, 110 Conn., 208.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plaintiff denies the existence of the understanding which defendant  alleges  she had with plaintiff's agent to  allow the defendant to remain  in the premises after September 15 by paying a  reasonable increase in the rental.</p>
<p>On the hypothesis that the plaintiff's administrator could bind plaintiff by said  understanding, which, defendant alleges, induced her to  enter into the stipulation submitted in open  court and later incorporated in  the decision rendered, hypothesis that appears to  be unacceptable  in the absence  of express authority granted  by the plaintiff, on the basis of the facts stated in the pleadings and  by attorneys of both parties in their oral argument during the hearing before us, we are not inclined to accept that such understanding really took place.</p>
<p>We can not see why defendant did not secure some evidence of the understanding to assure its enforcement knowing, as she did, that a decision was to be rendered and in fact, was rendered,  stating  September 15 as a dead line for her to remain in the  premises.</p>
<p>It was alleged that  defendant conveyed to her attorney the information about said understanding and that,  at the time the stipulation  was submitted by both parties  to the court, defendant tried to make of record said understanding,  but plaintiff's  attorney opposed.   It was admitted, nevertheless, by defendant's attorneys that no stenographic notes were taken about said  incident.  The  narrated circumstances  lead  us  to conclude  that, in fact, no definite understanding took place.  It is possible that the administrator had given defendant some hope or a possible understanding by which defendant may remain in the premises if the  parties should  agree  on a reasonable increase of rent, but the fact that that reasonable increase was never specified  proves conclusively that the alleged understanding never passed beyond the form of mere negotiations.</p>
<p>Now the question we have to consider is whether the court below had  authority to issue the writ of execution on September 18, before defendant was notified of the decision as signed by the judge, or received any copy thereof. It is a  fact that the decision was orally rendered in open court on  July 10, in the presence of the defendant and her attorney, and since then both  had full knowledge of said decision.</p>
<p>But  it is  also a fact that said decision, as transcribed, was  signed  by the  judge only  on July 11, and as signed was  never served on the defendant.</p>
<p>In accordance  with section  1  of Judicial Rule  35, all judgments  "shall be in writing  personally and  directly prepared by the  judge, and signed by him."  From this provision it appears that what was dictated in open court on July 10  did not contain the essential requirements of a judgment  and that the real judgment was rendered only on July 11.</p>
<p>It seems evident  that, on the basis of legal technicality, defendant can allege that she was never notified of the judgment until September 18,  when the writ of execution was  issued, and that her  knowledge of the decision dictated on July 10 must not be counted against her  as  a notification, as no judgment was yet rendered in accordance with court rules of which notice is to be served.</p>
<p>Against  the legal  technicality  invoked  by defendant, there is the  undeniable fact that on July 10 the  decision was  orally rendered.</p>
<p>That she  knew fully what the  decision was.</p>
<p>That she could not expect that a different decision could be rendered, when said decision was rendered on the basis of a stipulation submitted by both  parties and,  in  fact, just to approve  and  make effective said stipulation  as agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the  Rules  of Court in allowing some time within which any party may file a motion for reconsideration, for new  trial, or  appeal, before  a judgment may become executory?</p>
<p>It  is to give him an  opportunity to seek redress from any error in all or any pronouncement in the decision that may  aggrieve  him.  In  the present case,  defendant had opportunity since July 10 to seek said redress.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the judicial rules in  requiring that all judgments shall be in writing personally and directly prepared  by the  judge,  and signed by him?  To eliminate uncertainty as to the contents of  said judgment. In the present case the defendant could not allege any uncertainty in the decision  rendered, because it was rendered to approve a stipulation  which she herself submitted, with the plaintiff, to the court.  Even before  the decision was orally rendered,  she was fully  aware  of the  decision to be rendered, as the decision was a mere approval of the stipulation agreed upon between  her and  the plaintiff and submitted to the  court before the same rendered it.</p>
<p>Defendant stated in her motion to quash the writ of execution that it  was her purpose, "after  notice of said decision" to petition the  court "to vacate  the judgment on the ground that the stipulation upon which it is based was obtained from the defendant  by fraud or false representation."  Why did she not  make  said petition right then and  there on July  10, when the decision  was  rendered orally in open  court?</p>
<p>When did she happen  to know that  she was.the victim of fraud or false representation?  If we  accept  what defendant  states in her affidavit  signed  on September 27, such discovery took place  "about the  first  days" of September, when she saw the administrator  and offered him to pay a rental of T70 a month and,  on  his refusal, she offered  to increase the rent to PI 00 monthly, but he still refused "and no longer wanted to abide by our agreement." Why did  she not file the announced petition since  then? Why did she wait until  September 27  to file her motion for new trial  on  the grounds of fraud, mistake  and surprise?  Why did she  not file said motion before the  writ of execution was  issued on September  18?  Why did she wait more than a week after she  was notified of said  writ of execution before  filing her motion for new trial?  We tried in vain  to  look for  defendant's  answers to these questions.</p>
<p>It was never explained why the court failed to serve copy of the decision as signed on July 11 or to notify the defendant  thereof, but it  seems  to us  evident that such notification, under the circumstances of this1 case, has the nature of an empty formality, when the parties were notified in open court on July  10 of the  decision rendered. Under these circumstances, we  are of  opinion that the purposes of notification were duly accomplished since  July 10, although it took place one day before the decision as transcribed was signed by  the judge.</p>
<p>Since then the defendant  had full opportunity to require the administrator to fulfill the alleged understanding and to  negotiate with him as1 to the reasonable increase of rent that must be agreed upon in order that defendant may be allowed to remain  in the premises  after September 15.   The failure of defendant to make the negotiations and to  see the administrator for nearly two months has never been explained.</p>
<p>The facts  in this  case  show  that  defendant does not appear  before  us  with hands completely untarnished. We are of opinion that,  under the circumstances of the present case, defendant was1 notified of the decision or judgment since July  10, and since  then she must  have started  to  count the period within which she  must seek redress by motion for new trial or reconsideration  or by appeal,  or other  remedy provided  by  law, against  said .decision.</p>
<p>We come to this conclusion  taking into  consideration the spirit of the Ru'es1 of Court  as shown in section 2 of Rule 1 where it is provided that the rules "shall be liberally  construed in order to promote their object  and to  assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."</p>
<p>At any rate, even putting aside the notification  made in open court on July 10,  at the time when the decision was rendered in open court, approving the agreement submitted by the parties, the letter of the Rules of Court was complied with on September 18 when petitioner was notified of the writ of execution containing the text of the decision rendered on July 10, and,  at least,  since then, the decision must be  considered as final and  unappealable, because a decision  rendered just to approve and make  effective a stipulation or an agreement  of the parties becomes<em> ipso facto</em> final and unappealable upon  notification to the parties. The reason of this doctrine is obvious.  When both parties enter into an agreement to end a pending litigation and request  that  decision be  rendered approving  said agreement, it is only natural  to presume that such action constitutes an implicit, as undeniable as asi express, waiver of the right  to appeal against the decision.  For a party to reserve, under the circumstances, the right to appeal against said  decision, is to adopt an attitude of bad  faith which courts  cannot countenance.  If the agreement was entered into with good faith and with honesty, there  is no reason why a party to such agreement should reserve to himself the right to impugn said agreement by appealing against a decision approving  the  same.</p>
<p>We are of  opinion therefore that the petition is without merit and must be denied.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.,</strong></p>
<p>Under the theory of the majority, the petitioner was notified of the decision of the respondent Court of First Instance of Manila on September 18 or 19, 1945, when she "acquired knowledge of the writ of execution containing1 a literal copy of the judgment."  Immediately thereafter, or on September 19, 1945, the petitioner filed a motion to quash the writ of execution.  On September 27, 1945, she filed a motion to set aside the decision and for a new  trial based on the grounds of fraud, mistake and surprise.  The motion to quash was denied on October 2, 1945, whereupon, on the following day, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied on October 4, 1945.  The motion for new trial was  in turn denied on October 8, 1945.</p>
<p>At the time the present petition for certiorari was filed in this Court, the petitioner's motion for new trial was still pending before the  respondent court and the respondent sheriff of Manila was threatening  or about to enforce the writ of execution.  In view whereof,  I am of the opinion that appeal could not afford  a plain, speedy or adequate remedy.   As  a matter  of fact, the petitioner has prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction which, however, was not acted upon by this Court.  There was really a need for some preventive measure incident only to a certiorari proceeding.   The judgment was not yet executory because the  period  for appealing, if not from the judgment of compromise, at  least (as recognized  by the majority) from the refusal of the  respondent court to set it aside and to quash the execution, had not yet expired. </p>
<p>I therefore vote to grant the petition  for certiorari in the first place or, otherwise to allow the petitioner to perfect  an appeal without the  regular period which has been suspended by the institution of this proceeding.   The petitioner  has not  attempted  to  substitute  the remedy for another which has been lost by inaction or abandonment, but merely availed herself of a procedure by which, before the lapse of the period for appealing, she sought to correct an alleged abuse of discretion or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the respondent  court; and pending resolution on her petition, it cannot fairly be said that she was under any obligation to push her appeal through.</p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, J.,</strong> concurring:</p>
<p>I concur in the foregoing dissenting  opinion.<br>
