				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Guillermo&nbsp; Cresencia&nbsp; from the judgment of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila in its civil&nbsp; case No. 19890, sentencing appellant,&nbsp; jointly and severally&nbsp; with&nbsp; his co-defendant&nbsp; Brigido Avorque, to pay plaintiffs&nbsp; Emerencia M.&nbsp; Vda. de Medina&nbsp; and her minor children damages in the total amount of P56,000, P5,000 attorneys' fees, and&nbsp; costs.<p>It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1953, passenger&nbsp; jeepney bearing plate No. TPU-2232 (Manila),&nbsp; driven by&nbsp; Brigido Avorque,&nbsp;&nbsp; smashed&nbsp; into&nbsp; a&nbsp; Meralco post on Azcarraga Street, resulting in the death of&nbsp; Vicente Medina, one of its passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp; A criminal case for homicide through&nbsp; reckless imprudence was filed against Avorque (criminal case No. 22775&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila), to which lie pleaded guilty on September 9, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heirs of the deceased,&nbsp; however, reserved their&nbsp; right to file a separate action&nbsp; fbr&nbsp; damages,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1953, brought&nbsp; suit&nbsp; against&nbsp; the driver&nbsp; Brigido Avorque and appellant Guillermo Cresencia, the registered owner and operator of the jeepney in question.&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; Brigido Avorque did not file any&nbsp; answer; while&nbsp; defendant Cresencia&nbsp; answered,&nbsp; disclaiming liability on the ground that he had sold the jeepney in question on October 14, 1950 to one Maria A. Cudiamat; that the jeepney&nbsp; had been repeatedly&nbsp; sold by&nbsp; one buyer&nbsp; after&nbsp; another,&nbsp; until&nbsp; the vehicle was purchased&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; by&nbsp; Rosario Avorque, the absolute&nbsp; owner thereof at the time of the accident.&nbsp; In view&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cresencia's answer, plaintiffs filed leave, and&nbsp; was allowed, to amend their complaint&nbsp; making Rosario Avorque a co-defendant; and the&nbsp; latter,&nbsp; by way of answer,&nbsp; admitted having purchased the&nbsp; aforesaid jeepney on May 31, 1953, but alleged in defense that she was never the public&nbsp; utility operator thereof.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case then proceeded to trial,&nbsp; during which, after the plaintiffs had presented their evidence,&nbsp; defendants Guillermo&nbsp; Cresencia and Rosario Avorque made manifestations admitting' that the former was still the registered operator of the&nbsp; jeepney in question in the&nbsp; records of&nbsp; the Motor&nbsp; Vehicles&nbsp; Office and the Public Service&nbsp; Commission, while the latter was the owner&nbsp; thereof at the time of the accident; and submitted the&nbsp; case for the decision on the&nbsp; question&nbsp; of who, as between the two, should be held liable to plaintiffs&nbsp; for damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court, by&nbsp; Judge Jose Zulueta, held that as far as the public&nbsp; is concerned, defendant&nbsp; Cresencia, in the eyes of the law, continued to be&nbsp; the legal owner of&nbsp; the jeepney&nbsp; in question;&nbsp; and&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; judgment against him, jointly and severally with the driver&nbsp; Brigido Avorque, for P6,000 compensatory damages, P30,000 moral damages, P10,000 exemplary&nbsp; damages,&nbsp; P10,000 nominal damages, P5,000 attorneys fees, and costs, while defendant Rosario Avorque was absolved from liability.&nbsp; From this judgment, defendant Cresencia appealed.</p><p>We have already held&nbsp; in the case of Montoya <em>vs.</em> Ignacio, 94&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 182&nbsp; (December 29, 1953), which the court below cited, that&nbsp; the law (section 20 [g], C. A. No.&nbsp; 146 as amended)&nbsp; requires the approval of the Public Service Commission in order that a franchise,&nbsp; or any&nbsp; privilege pertaining thereto, may be&nbsp; sold&nbsp; or leased without&nbsp; infringing the certificate issued to the grantee; and&nbsp; that if property covered by the&nbsp; franchise is transferred or leased without this requisite approval, the&nbsp; transfer is not binding against the public or the Service Commission;&nbsp; and in contemplation&nbsp; of&nbsp; law, the grantee of record continues to be responsible under the franchise in relation to the Commission and to the public. There we gave the reason for this rule&nbsp; to be as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * Since&nbsp; a franchise is personal&nbsp; in nature any transfer or lease thereof should&nbsp; be notified to the Public Service Commission so that the latter may&nbsp; take proper&nbsp; safeguards to protect the interest of the public In fact, the law requires that, before&nbsp; the approval is granted,&nbsp; there should be&nbsp; a public&nbsp; hearing, with notice to all interested parties, in order that&nbsp; the Commission&nbsp; may determine if there are good&nbsp; and&nbsp; reasonable grounds justifying the transfer or lease of the property&nbsp; covered by the franchise,&nbsp; or if the sale or lease is detrimental&nbsp; to public interest.&nbsp; * * *"</p></blockquote><p>The above ruling was&nbsp; later reiterated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; cases of Timbol <em>vs.</em> Osias,&nbsp; L-7547, April&nbsp; 30, 1955 and Roque&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Malibay Transit Inc., L-8561, November 18, 1955.</p><p>As the sale&nbsp; of the jeepney here in question was admittedly without the approval of the Public Service Commission,&nbsp; appellant herein,&nbsp; Guillermo&nbsp; Cresencia,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is&nbsp; the registered owner and operator thereof, continued&nbsp; to be liable to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission and the&nbsp; public&nbsp; for&nbsp; the consequences incident to its operation.&nbsp; Wherefore, the lower court did not&nbsp; err in holding him, and not the buyer&nbsp; Rosario Avorque, responsible for the damages sustained by plaintiff by reason of the death of Vicente Medina resulting from the reckless negligence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; jeepney's&nbsp; driver, Brigido Avorque.</p><p>Appellant also argues that the basis of plaintiffs' action being the employer's subsidiary liability under the Revised Penal Code for damages arising from his, employee's criminal acts, it is defendant Rosario Avorque&nbsp; who&nbsp; should answer subsidiarily for&nbsp; the&nbsp; damages sustained by plaintiffs, since she admits that&nbsp; she, and not appellant, is&nbsp; the employer of the negligent driver&nbsp; Brigido&nbsp; Avorque.&nbsp; The argument is untenable/because plaintiffs' action for damages&nbsp; is independent of&nbsp; the criminal case&nbsp; filed&nbsp; against Brigido Avorque, and based, not&nbsp; on&nbsp; the employer's subsidiary liability under the Revised Penal Code, but on a breach of the&nbsp; carrier's contractual obligation to carry&nbsp; his passengers safely to their destination (<em>culpa contractual</em>). And it is also for this&nbsp; reason that there is no need of first proving the insolvency&nbsp; of the&nbsp; driver Brigido Avorque before damages can be recovered from the carrier, for in c<span style="font-style: italic;">ulpa contractual</span>, the liability of the carrier&nbsp; is not merely subsidiary&nbsp; or&nbsp; secondary, but direct and immediate (Articles 1755, 1756,&nbsp; and 1759, New Civil&nbsp; Code).</p><p>The propriety&nbsp; of the&nbsp; damages&nbsp; awarded has not been questioned.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is patent&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; record that the&nbsp; award of P10,000 by way of <em>nominal </em>damages is untenable as a matter of law, since nominal damages&nbsp; can not co-exist with&nbsp; compensatory damages.&nbsp; The purpose of nominal&nbsp; damages is to vindicate or recognize a right that has&nbsp; been violated,&nbsp; in order to preclude further contest thereon;&nbsp; "and not&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of indemnifying&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; for any loss suffered&nbsp; by him"&nbsp; (Articles&nbsp; 2221, 2223, new Civil Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the&nbsp; court below has already awarded compensatory&nbsp; and&nbsp; exemplary damages&nbsp; that&nbsp; are in themselves&nbsp; a judicial recognition that plaintiff's right was violated,&nbsp; the award of nominal damages is&nbsp; unnecessary and improper."&nbsp; Anyway, ten&nbsp; thousand pesos can not, in common sense, be&nbsp; deemed "nominal".</p><p>With the modification that the award of P10,000 nominal damages" be eliminated, the decision appealed from id affirmed. Costs against appellant. So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A,, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</em> and<em> Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
