				<H3>IN RE: PETITION OF UY YU ALIAS IGNACIO UY SECHUN, TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. UY YU ALIAS IGNACIO UY SECHUN, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Republic of the Philippines through the Solicitor General is 
appealing from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Cagayan, 
granting the petition for naturalization of Uy Yu <i>alias</i> IGNACIO 
UY SECHUN on the strength of the evidence presented by the applicant, 
the Republic having adduced none is support of its opposition to the 
application.  The only basis for the appeal is that the minor child of 
the applicant named ELPIDIO is attending the SAMANTABHADRA INSTITUTE, a 
Chinese school located in Juan Luna, Manila and there is no proof that 
said school has been duly recognized by the Government and that it is 
teaching Philippine Government, History and Civics.
  <p>    Examining the record we find that the applicant in his 
testimony assured the court that before he enrolled his son Elpidio in 
said school he made the necessary investigation and was assured that 
said school was recognized by the Government, and so we agree with the 
trial court's finding about said government recognition.  The Solicitor 
General, however, further insists that mere recognition by the 
Government of a private school is no proof that the subjects of 
Philippine Government, History and Civics are taught in said recognized 
school.  We are of the opinion that under the present law,  one of the 
requirements of government recognition of a private school is that said 
school has the minimum standard requirement of instruction required by 
the Government, including the teaching of such subjects as Philippine 
Government, History and Civics.  Furthermore, to give us further 
assurance of the correctness of this opinion, at least in the present 
case, at our instance, the office of the Director of Private School went
 over the record of the Samantabhadra Institute, and in his certificate 
dated December 4, 1953, the Director states that Philippine Government, 
History and Civics are prescribed as part of the curriculum of the 
Institute.</p>
  <p>    In view of the foregoing, and finding the decision appealed 
from to be in conformity with the law and the evidence, the same is 
hereby affirmed.  No costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Reyes, Jugo, 
Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
