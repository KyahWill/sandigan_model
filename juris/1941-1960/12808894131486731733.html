				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On February 24, 1941, Epifania Vda. de Guanzon and defendant Tan Kue entered 
into a written contract of lease of the former's property located at Nos. 1008 
and 1010 Lavezares, Binondo, Manila, at a monthly rental of P130. effective 
March 15, 1941, up to March 15, 1946.</p>
<p>Tan Kue abandoned the property in December, 1944, because he evacuated with 
his family to Batangas, failing' to pay the monthly rentals from January, 
1945.</p>
<p>Finding defendants Ang Ban and Ang Chung occupying, without any legal ground 
at all, the premises abandoned by defendant Tan Kue, the original complaint was 
filed on April 28, 1945, for the ejectment of said two defendants. By amendments 
in the pleadings, Tan Kue was later included among the defendants in this 
case.</p>
<p>Alleging that he returned to Manila in March, 1945, and resided with his 
family at 1522-24 Oroquieta, Manila, where he is keeping a business, Tan Kue, 
testified that, he failed to offer plaintiff the rents in arrears because he was 
very busy. Horacio A. Guanzon testified that Ang Ban and Ang Chung transferred 
to the premises in question because their house was burnt; that he required them 
to move out of the premises; that on May 4, 1945, Tan Kue.asked him for another 
lease upon the premises, with the promise to sue Ang Ban and Ang Chung, but Tan 
Kue did not offer . payment of the rents due for the first months of 1945. Ang 
Ban alleged that he was left in the premises by Tan Kue to take care of the 
latter's belongings, and that Ang Chung is a mere host from the province.</p>
<p>Judge Mariano L. de la Rosa of the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered 
a decision, declaring terminated the lease contract between Epifania Vda. de 
Guanzon and Tan Kue and ordering defendants to move out of the premises and to 
pay jointly and severally the sum of P130 per month from January, 1945, until 
the property is vacated, and the costs.</p>
<p>Appealing from the decision, defendants point out two errors allegedly 
committed by the lower court: (1) that it did not dismiss the complaint 
notwithstanding plaintiffs' failure to serve the notice required by section 2 of 
Rule 72 of the Rules of Court; and (2) that it did not declare that Tan Kue's 
failure to pay the rents was due to <em>force majeure</em>.</p>
<p>Section 2 of Rule 72 is not applicable in the present case.</p>
<p>Defendant Tan Kue can not invoke it because he was and is not sued for 
ejectment in accordance with Rule 72. In the amended complaint of May 21, 1945, 
Tan Kue is sued only for a sum of money, consisting of unpaid rents, liquidated 
damages, attorney's fees, and costs.</p>
<p>Defendants Ang Ban and Ang Chung can not also invoke section 2 of Rule 72, 
because,they are not tenants of plaintiffs, but are mere intruders.</p>
<p>Whether Tan Kue's failure to pay the rents was due to <em>force majeure</em> 
or not is immaterial for purposes of determining his obligation of paying the 
rents due at the time this case was decided in the lower court. Whether he was 
justified or not in not paying said rents in due time is irrelevant to the 
question of whether he is duty bound to pay said rents. That obligation is not 
denied by any one. If there was any reason or justification for delay in the 
payment of said rents before, now there is none any more. It appearing from 
defendants' own evidence that Tan Kue had something to do for his co-defendants' 
unjustifiably occupying the premises, he is equally responsible for the rents 
until Ang Ban and Ancr Chung shall have completely vacated the 
property.</p>Rents due up to March 10, 1945, subject to moratorium (Executive 
Order No. 32 and Presidential Proclamation No. 6), the lower court's decision is 
affirmed with the sole modification that it is unnecessary to order the 
ejectment, of defendant Tan Kue, it appearing that he has already ceased to 
occupy the premises since December, 1944, and his lease contract having been 
terminated in accordance with the facts of this case and the terms of the 
contract itself, with the costs against appellants. Paras, Pablo, and Bilado, 
JJ., concur. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result. Ang Ban and Ang Chung occupied illegally the premises 
at 1008-1010 Calle Lavezares, Manila. They had no contractual relation with the 
plaintiffs. The claim that Ang Ban was the caretaker of the lessee. Tan Kue, 
cannot be believed. The alleged relation of agent and principal was an 
afterthought. Ang Ban's house at Calle Juan Luna was burned and he together with 
Ang Chung moved into the premises at Calle Lavezares when he found that they 
were empty.<br>Tan Kue, the lessee of the premises by virtue of a 5-year lease 
contract (Exhibit A), is no longer entitled to hold the premises leased by 
him.</p>
<p>Article 1569 of the Civil Code provides that "The lessor may dispossess the 
lessee by suit for any of the following causes: * * * 2. Default in^the payment 
of the rent agreed upon; 3. Breach of any of the conditions stipulated in the 
contract;"</p>
<p>Section 2, Rule 72, provides that "No landlord * * * shall bring such action 
against a tenant for failure to pay rent due or to comply with the conditions of 
his lease, unless the tenant shall have failed to pay such rent or comply with 
such conditions for a period of * * * five days in the case of building, after 
demand therefor, made upon him personally, or by serving written notice of such 
demand upon the person found on the premises, or by posting such notice on the 
premises if no persons be found thereon.</p>
<p>Although no demand for payment of the rentals due and for restitution of the 
leased premises had been made upon the lessee personally, it may however be 
inferred from the evidence, that the written notice of demand (Exhibit B) served 
upon one of the persons found on the premises was handed to the lessee on or 
before May 4, 1945. On the 9th, the lessee filed a motion to intervene. On the 
21st, an amended complaint was filed joining: the lessee with the original 
defendants. On the last mentioned date the statutory notice, as provided for in 
section 2, Rule 72, was complied with.</p>
<p>The claim that failure to pay the rentals was due to <em>force majeure</em> 
is without merit. Tan Kue's failure to pay the rentals was inexcusable after the 
liberation of Manila and his return to the City in March 1945 to engage, as he 
did, in the profitable business of baking bread.</p>
<p>The obligation of Tan Kue to pay the rentals from January 1945 until the 
premises shall have been vacated complete by his co-defendants springs from his 
contract to pay the rentals until the premises shall have been vacated and their 
possession returned to the lessors.</p>
