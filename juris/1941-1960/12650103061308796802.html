				<H3>HORTENSIA ZIALCITA-YUSECO ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND JOAQUIN P. YUSECO, JR., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. WILLIAM SIMMONS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, ACTING C.J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Action for damages resulting from plaintiff's allegedly illegal separation 
from the service of the National City Bank of New York.
<p>In June, 1952 Hortensia Zialcita was employed by the National City Bank of 
New York, a foreign banking corporation doing business in the Philippines, under 
a contract of employment, signed by her, including the following clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I understand that I am being hired as a single female employee. In the event 
of my marriage you may terminate this employment in which case I shall be 
entitled to no other benefits except my salary through the last day on which I 
worked."</p></blockquote>
<p>Because she intended to marry soon, and pursuant to the above stipulation, 
plaintiff filed on July 7, 1952, her written resignation—which was 
accepted—effective August 15, 1952. On July 13, 1952 she married her 
co-plaintiff; and on August 18, 1952 she commenced, in the Manila court of first 
instance, this suit against William Simmons, the general manager of the National 
City Bank of New York asserting that said defendant "urged by his distorted 
notion of a new policy" in the said bank "as manager thereof, forced the herein 
plaintiff to sign" the above letter of resignation "in implementation of the 
aforementioned immoral and illegal agreement in the contract of employment." She 
demanded that said defendant be ordered to pay her damages totalling 
P15,000.</p>
<p>For answer the defendant averred that: (<em>a</em>) plaintiff signed the 
contract voluntarily, (<em>b</em>) the above condition of employment was valid, 
and (<em>c</em>) before marriage plaintiff resigned her position; and asserting 
she had no cause of action against him; he asked for damages.</p>
<p>The case was heard; and on March 31, 1953 the Honorable Alejandro Panlilio, 
Judge, entered judgment absolving the defendant for the reason that the 
plaintiff had signed the contract voluntarily and clause in question was a valid 
condition of employment not repugnant to public policy. His Honor furthermore 
opined that plaintiff had no cause of action "taking into consideration the 
undeniable fact that said plaintiff was not employed by the defendant William 
Simmons, but by the National City Bank of New York, of which said defendant 
happened to be the general manager. If at all, that is, if by reason of the 
termination of her employment contract with the bank, plaintiff Hortensia 
Zialcita had any cause of action, the action should have been directed, not 
against the defendant herein, William H. Simmons, but against the National City 
Bank of New York."</p>
<p>The, plaintiff appealed, contending in her brief that the lower court erred 
in declaring she had no cause to complain against defendant, and in sustaining 
the validity of the aforesaid condition of her employment. She argues that the 
defense of failure to state a cause of action was not raised by the defendant in 
his answer, nor in a motion to dismiss; and under the Rules such defense was 
waived and was unavailable, when appellee for the first time pleaded it in his 
memorandum.</p>
<p>This argument is without merit, because in the defendant's answer he 
specifically alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That plaintiff has no cause of action against defendant; that the action 
instituted by her against defendant (is) unwarranted; * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, then, does plaintiff have the right to compel the manager of the 
National City Bank to pay damages by reason of her separation? She does not 
rebut the court's reasoning that defendant merely acted as agent of the Bank, 
and that her remedy, if any, is to sue such Bank. Indeed such reasoning is in 
line with well-known principles of agency. According to the complaint itself, in 
requiring her to sign, the contract, defendant acted <em>as manager </em>of the 
Bank, and in requiring her to comply with the contract and in accepting her 
resignation he also acted <em>as manager</em> of the Bank. There is no 
allegation that he exceeded his power as manager or that his actuation was 
repudiated by his principal, the Bank. Consequently any claim for damages 
supposedly resulting from his acts <em>as manager</em> should be directed 
against his principal, the Bank—not against him personally.</p>
<p>"The agent who acts as such is not <em>personally liable</em> to the party 
with whom he contracts, unless he expressly binds himself or exceeds the limits 
of his authority * * *," "The principal must comply with all the obligations 
which the agent may have contracted within the scope of his authority." (Arts. 
1897 and 1910 New Civil Code.)</p>
<p>Of course it is not necessary to cite authorities to conclude that the 
defendant <em>as manager</em> had authority to contract plaintiff's services for 
the corporation and to accept or require her resignation. (See Guevarra, Phil. 
Corporation Law pp. 54-55 and Nepomuceno <em>vs</em>. Parlatone 40 Off. Gaz. 
119.)</p>
<p>In Macias <em>vs</em>. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., 43 Phil. 155 action to 
enforce a fire policy was filed against the insurer's <em>agent</em> that had 
issued the policy in the name of the insurer. Applying the doctrine of the 
principal's responsibility, the courts dismissed the action.</p>
<p>In this view of the litigation, we find it unnecessary to decide the issue 
extensively discussed in the briefs, whether the employment clause is in 
restraint of marriage, and/or contravenes public policy. That issue would be a 
proper subject for debate in a proceeding against the Bank, the true employer of 
plaintiff. To consider the point now, would be unfair to said Bank, which is not 
presently before the Court to defend its side of the debate.</p>
<p>The judgment absolving defendant is affirmed with costs.</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
