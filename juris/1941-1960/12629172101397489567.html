				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In  November  1951, Carmen  R.  Castillo was appointed correspondence clerk in the office of the Provincial Fiscal of Bohol by the  Governor of that province.  She  rendered service,  as  such until June 12, 1954,  when  she  stopped working by reason  of the Provincial  Board's Resolutions Nos.  161 and 300  abolishing  her  position effective  June 9, 1954.            <br><br>She protested to the  corresponding  authorities;  and having obtained no  relief, she instituted the instant  proceeding to compel reinstatement, payment of back salaries, damages and attorney's fees.  Her action rested on the propositions  that  her separation was unlawful  in view of her civil  service eligibility and status,  and that the Secretary of Finance  had  disapproved the  resolutions. She also relied on the  Constitutional provision that  "No officer or employee in the civil service shall be  removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law." <br><br>The respondents defended the legality of their actuation, argued that  the constitutional  inhibition did not  refer  to abolition of government positions and that  the Secretary of Finance merely "suggested" the petitioner's retention in the provincial payroll. <br><br>A hearing  was had, and memoranda were submitted by both sides. Thereafter, the Honorable Hipolito Alo, Judge, citing pertinent decisions of this Court reached  the  conclusion that  the Board had legal power to  abolish the position with the resultant consequences and dismissed the action. <br><br>Castillo took the matter to the Court of Appeals; but such  Court,  finding  her assignments  of  error  to involve purely questions of law, certified the record to this Supreme Court in accordance with the Judiciary Act of  1948. <br><br>Essentially, two  issues arise from the above  state  of affairs:  (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  whether the  Board  did validly  abolish the petitioner's position,  and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  whether such abolition,  if valid, produced her lawful separation from the provincial service. <br><br>It  is not  disputed that  the position  of clerk in the Fiscal's Office occupied by petitioner  was created by the Provincial  Board in  virtue of its  power expressly given by Section 2081 of the Revised Administrative  Code  to "fix the  number of  assistants, deputies,  clerks and other employees for the various branches of the provincial  government" and to fix their salaries.  There is  no statute expressly  empowering the Board to abolish the offices or positions it has created; however, it is a well-established principle in the law of public administration that the power to establish an office includes the authority to abolish it—unless there are constitutional or statutory rules expressly or impliedly providing otherwise.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>   And the abolition of the office terminates the right of the incumbent to exercise the rights and duties thereof.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> <br><br>Petitioner contends  that the resolution  did not  become effective because  it  was  disapproved by the Department of Finance  in its indorsement of December 28,  1954  in connection with the Board's Resolution No. 161. <br><blockquote>"The position of correspondence clerk in the office of the Provincial Fiscal which is proposed  to he abolished  on the ground that the position  is unnecessary as stated  in the  budget analysis  of  the Provincial  Treasurer should  be continued, it  appearing  that  the position  involved is  not actually vacant and that the incumbent thereof is a civil service eligible. * * *."</blockquote>But we have held in Rodriguez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Montemayor<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup> October 1954, that under the statutes and rules  then prevailing the Secretary of Finance had no power to disapprove resolutions  of  provincial boards  abolishing  positions  in  the provincial service created by  them.  In the  light  of said decision, the indorsement above quoted must be considered as a mere  suggestion for  the retention  in the local plantilla  of  petitioner's item—a  recommendation which said Board chose  not to follow for  reasons of its own. <br><br>Of course, the legal situation changed with the passage of Republic  Act No. 1063 on June 12, 1954, directing that abolitions of positions  (in the provincial service)  shall not take effect  except upon approval  by the  Secretary  of Finance. Congress thereby amplified the powers of said Department Head, and/or enunciated  a  new  legislative policy.  However, technically and logically said  Act could not and  did not apply to  the herein Resolutions of respondent Board passed and effective before its enactment. <br><br>Petitioner's ouster was  due  to  personal reasons,  says her counsel "she being suspected by the Provincial Governor as the leader of the 37 other low-salaried government employees who sent a petition to the President of the Philippines asking that their salaries be increased in accordance with  the scale set forth  in the Minimum Wage  Law of Bohol." <br><br>The Governor is not the Board.  And  the act of initiating such a reasonable petition for increase of salaries could not have caused any resentment on the part of provinciar government officials. <br><br>From  all  the foregoing  circumstances,  it  follows thai the  elimination  of petitioner's position was  valid  and effective on June 9, 1954,  and that thereafter, she had no position  to occupy, no salary to receive.  She was out of the service—as no law protected her tenure. The ouster was due to  the needs of  public service says the Board. There was no such need,  claims  appellant,  it  was  done in  bad faith.   Such issue  obviously involves the advisability or the necessity  of the measures, which is not within the province of the courts  to decide. <br><br>In this  connection, it is true  we once mentioned in Brillo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Enage, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, "good faith" as a test to  be applied whenever  the  abolition  of an  office  becomes the  subject of  judicial investigation.  But that litigation referred to the elimination of positions in the judiciary;  and  the constitutional protection  of the judges' tenure<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</span></sup> came  into play.  The general  observations quoted therein  should be circumscribed  to  the  particular situation which  elicited them. <br><br>There is, of course,  the fundamental protection  afforded to  civil  service  employees  against removal  "except for cause as provided by law";  but it  does  not govern in this case, because there has been no removal of petitioner  but an abolition of her position, which was within the power of the provincial board, in the same way that Congress  has the  power  to abolish offices created  by it  or  by  its authority. <br><br>In Manalang <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Quitoriano <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</span></sup> Luis Manalang was prior to June 20, 1952, Director of the Placement Bureau.  On that date, Republic Act No. 761 abolished the  Bureau and his office.  When he sued to retain his office or to assume the equivalent post of Commissioner of the National Employment Service which succeeded to the Placement Bureau, he  invoked  the  constitutional mandate that  "no  officer * * * in the Civil Service shall be removed * * *  except for cause as provided by law."  This Court had to deny him  relief,  seeing no  violation of said mandate,  since "there has  been neither  a removal nor a suspension  of petitioner Manalang but  an abolition of his former office of Director of the Placement Bureau,  which  admittedly is within the power  of  Congress  to undertake by  legislation." <br><br>In Rodriguez  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Montemayor,  50 Off. Gaz., 4820, this Court perceived  no legal objection to Resolution  No. 55 of the Provincial Board  of  Pangasinan abolishing  three positions of special counsel in the office  of the provincial fiscal6 despite the consequent ouster of  the three incumbents. Arid  in Dominguez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Pascual,  101 Phil.,  31,  the authority of the  provincial board  to suppress positions in the provincial roster occupied by  civil  service eligibles, was  again recognized. <br><br>Wherefore, the judgment of the court below dismissing the action should be and  is hereby affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.  So ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
