				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case&nbsp; was brought to this Court upon a writ of certiorari&nbsp; against a judgment of the Court of Appeals. .&nbsp; In the judgment Paz Fernandez and Guadalupe Darjuan, defendants, are absolved from the claims of Ngo Seng and Go Pin, plaintiffs, and of Norberto Quisumbing, intervenor, and the latter is sentenced to pay Ngo Seng and Go Pin P15,867.50 and Paz Fernandez, P5,069.15.&nbsp; The facts found by the Court of Appeals necessary to an understanding of the issues involved in this case are as follows:<br><br>Paz Fernandez and Guadalupe Darjuan were proprietors and operators in the year 1947 of a carpentry shop for the construction of bus bodies.&nbsp; As they needed funds with which to buy materials and to pay wages of the laborers, Rafael Fernandez, friend of Paz Fernandez,&nbsp; secured the help of his friend, Norberto Quisumbing.&nbsp; Quisumbing in turn sought&nbsp; the help of his own friends Ngo Seng and . Go Pin.&nbsp; Both Quisumbing at first, and Ngo Seng and Go Pin later, furnished funds to Paz Fernandez. Mortgages were executed to cover the sums taken first from Quisumbing and later from Ngo Seng and Go Pin.&nbsp; Quisumbing , was also authorized by a power of attorney executed by the proprietors of the shop to purchase the&nbsp; materials and pay the laborers and to collect the accounts due said proprietors.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Paz Fernandez,&nbsp; and Darjuan&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to pay the mortgage indebtedness to Ngo Seng and Go Pin, the latter brought the action to recover the mortgage debt of P28.600 and Quisumbing intervened, demanding accounting of the sums&nbsp; received by Fernandez&nbsp; and Darjuan in payment&nbsp; of busses constructed and his share in&nbsp; the profits. Fernandez and Darjuan&nbsp; alleged that&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum actually borrowed from&nbsp; Ngo Seng&nbsp; and Go Pin was f20,000,&nbsp; and that this was not received by them but by Quiaumbing, and by&nbsp; way of&nbsp; counterclaim demanded the payment of P10,000 as losses and damages and P33,634.19 as overpayment and usurious interest.paid in the&nbsp; mortgage loans.<br><br>The relationship between the parties is divided into three periods.&nbsp; During the first period, Quisumbing spent P20,700 and&nbsp; collected&nbsp; P9,245.80,&nbsp; so there remained a balance of P11,454.20 Jn his favor.&nbsp; 'During the second&nbsp; period and according to the&nbsp; receipts, Quisumbing received on account of the mortgage&nbsp; from Ngo Seng and Go Pin only P20,000 and&nbsp; kept&nbsp; for himself P8.600.&nbsp; But the sums appearing in the receipts included an interest of 45 per cent, so that the actual sum&nbsp; received by Quisumbing&nbsp; and&nbsp; invested by him in the business was&nbsp; only P15,867.50. During the second period, P20.240 was collected by&nbsp; Quisumbing, according to him, so the losses for the two periods would be P7.O81.Y0, thus:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="3%">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">First period&nbsp; (Loss)....................................................................</td> <td width="17%">P11.454.20</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Second period (Expenses) .......................................................</td> <td><u>15,867.50</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="7%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="73%">Total ......................................................................</td> <td>P27.321.70</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Less: Collection ......................................................................</td> <td><u>P20.240.00</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Loss .....................................................................</td> <td>P7,081.00</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The above losses would be true if all the&nbsp; statements of account were given credit.&nbsp;&nbsp; But of the statements,&nbsp; three are&nbsp; not signed and do not bear the conformity&nbsp; of Paz Fernandez. These are statements&nbsp; K, L&nbsp; and M.&nbsp; These statements contain the following amounts as supposed expenses:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Exhibit K .................................................................</td> <td width="16%">P7,493.56</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Exhibit L .................................................................</td> <td>3,668.71</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Exhibit M ................................................................</td> <td><u>2,562.73</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="74%">Total .........................................................</td> <td>P13.724.99</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>As said statements&nbsp; were not signed by&nbsp; Paz Fernandez and no evidence&nbsp; was introduced to prove these&nbsp; expenses, the same&nbsp; could not be charged by Quisumbing against the business.<br><br>The sums actually collected by Quisumbing for the account&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; business amounted to&nbsp; P37.460, not P20.240, as claimed by him.&nbsp; If from this amount the losses during the&nbsp; first&nbsp; period, amounting to P11,454.20&nbsp; and the&nbsp; sums received from Ngo Seng and Go&nbsp; Pin during the second period, amounting to P15.867.50, or a total of P27.321.30, are to be deducted (from the above collections&nbsp; of P37.460), the profit&nbsp; would be P10,138.30.<br><br>Quisumbing should, therefore, pay to&nbsp; Ngo Seng and Go Pin the sum of P15.887.50,&nbsp; with interest at&nbsp; the rate of 12 per cent from the filing of the complaint, and pay to Paz Fernandez,&nbsp; P5.069.15,&nbsp; representing&nbsp; one-half&nbsp; of the profit&nbsp; of P10.138.30, with interest from the filing of the counterclaim against Quisumbing on March 29,&nbsp; 1948. The&nbsp; above is&nbsp; the judgment of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals against which an appeal has been brought by&nbsp; way of certiorari.<br><br>The&nbsp; most important issue raised&nbsp; in&nbsp; the appeal is the failure of the respondent Court of&nbsp; Appeals to take into account the report of a certified public accountant, Exhibit O,&nbsp; in which it appears that the balance of collections for which Quisumbing is responsible is P63.69, thus:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr> <td colspan="5"><div align="center">"STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td> <td width="13%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4">"Collections on finished jobs ...........................................................</td> <td><div align="right">P44.400.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4">Advances from M.U.B ...................................................................</td> <td><div align="right"><u>7,500.00</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="7%">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Total&nbsp; collections ........................</td> <td><div align="right">P51.900.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4">"Deduct:</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Materials used .................................................................</td> <td width="14%"><div align="right">P16.317.70</div></td> <td><div align="right">...............</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Wages paid laborers ........................................................</td> <td><div align="right"><u>17,863.61</u></div></td> <td><div align="right"><u>34,171.31</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"> Net collections .................................................................</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td><div align="right">P17,728.69</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3">"Deduct:</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Money received by Mrs. Paa Fernandez ............................</td> <td><div align="right">P20,215.00</div></td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Less amount received by Mr. Quisumbing ..........................</td> <td><div align="right"><u>2,550.00</u> </div></td> <td><div align="right"><u>17,665.00</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Balance of collections .........................................................</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td><div align="right">P63.69"</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Petitioners—first contend that as the said report Exhibit O was not objected to by the respondent Paz Fernandez, the same&nbsp; should be&nbsp; admitted even though the referee did&nbsp; not attach the exhibits supporting said report.&nbsp; In answer the respondents argue that the question now raised&nbsp; in&nbsp; this Court was not brought to the Court of Appeals for consideration ; that a court has the right to reject the report of a commissioner if the same is&nbsp; at variance with the substantial preponderance of evidence, even if no objections have been filed thereto; and that the commissioner who submitted the report was asked to make a report on those facts found by him in certain documents in the custody of the Anti-Usury Board and did not hear witnesses thereon. We find these arguments&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents valid&nbsp; and supported by the facts and the circumstances.<br><br>The commissioner&nbsp; who submitted&nbsp; the. statement of accounts, Exhibit O, was&nbsp; not designated for the "purpose of trying or considering <span style="font-style: italic;">an issue in a case</span> within the meaning of section&nbsp; 1 of Eule 34 of the Rules, of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; He was not asked to find how much was owed by one party to the other.&nbsp; He was not&nbsp; entrusted with&nbsp; the determination of an issue.&nbsp; AH that he was asked to do was "to&nbsp; examine all the records relevant to this case, now in the&nbsp; custody of the Anti-Usury Board"&nbsp; (p. 80 of the Record on Appeal). The report of the said accountant, therefore, was&nbsp; not the report contemplated&nbsp; within Rule 34.<br><br>In the second place, we presume that the papers examined were statements&nbsp; prepared by&nbsp; Quisumbing himself, which must have been&nbsp; seized by the&nbsp; Anti-Usury&nbsp; Board, or submitted by him to the latter in the course&nbsp; of the investigation as to the&nbsp; legality of his transactions.&nbsp; The authenticity and correctness of said documents were never before the court.&nbsp; The same were not presented to support the report and no opportunity was&nbsp; afforded the adverse party to question&nbsp; them.&nbsp; Admitting for the sake of argument that the documents were in the handwriting&nbsp; of Quisumbing, the same are incompetent against Paz Fernandez and Darjuan,&nbsp; because books of account, as regards other persons, are hearsay or r<span style="font-style: italic;">es inter alios acta,</span> except when circumstances are shown to justify their admission as an exception&nbsp; to the above&nbsp; rule (Aldecoa &amp;&nbsp; Co. vs. Warner, Barnes &amp;&nbsp; Co., 30 Phil- 153).&nbsp; No reason of necessity or circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness was adduced; Quisumbing was living, indeed he actually testified. Neither were the documents shown to have been kept in the performance of&nbsp; a duty required by law (section 35, Rule 123, Rules of Court).<br><br>"A mere ex parte memorandum of&nbsp; a transaction&nbsp; or occurrence, even though made at the time of such a transaction or occurrence, is&nbsp; not, ordinarily admissible as evidence thereof&nbsp; against a&nbsp; third person, unless&nbsp; prepared in the discharge of some public duty of some duty arising out of the business relations of the person making it&nbsp; with others, or&nbsp; in the regular course of his own&nbsp; business, or with knowledge and concurrence of the party to be charged and for the purpose of charging him&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (20&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Jur. section 942,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 796.).<br><br>The allegations of Quisumbing are sought to be proved . by original statements of accounts which he submitted in court at the time of the trial, marked&nbsp; Exhibits D to N. The findings of the Court of Appeals are based on&nbsp; these very statements. If Quisumbing had wanted&nbsp; to,rely upon the papers in the possession of the Anti-Usury Board, he could have secured certified or photostatic&nbsp; copies thereof for presentation at the time of the trial. Evidently, he did not rely on these papers or statements of accounts.&nbsp; That he did not rely on them is confirmed by the&nbsp; fact that no mention about them is made in the decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The counsel for the respondents alleged&nbsp; without contradiction that the question of the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; Exhibit O&nbsp; was never brought before the consideration&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Lastly, the conduct of petitioner Quisumbing himself in relying upon original&nbsp; statements signed by&nbsp; the adverse party, upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; statements he&nbsp; had&nbsp; testified,&nbsp; and the further fact&nbsp; that he did not testify on the statements or papers subject of the report Exhibit 0 shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; these papers must&nbsp; have been considered by him of" inferior&nbsp; value as evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the said report&nbsp; (Exhibit 0)&nbsp;&nbsp; does not dovetail&nbsp; with the other documentary evidence that he had presented. All these&nbsp; circumstances show&nbsp; that&nbsp; Quisumbing never pretended that said report was relied&nbsp; upon by him as basis&nbsp; of his claims.&nbsp; He now relies upon the report&nbsp; evidently as an excuse for coming to this Court. For all the above reasons, we find no cause for reversing the decision of the respondent tribunal in relying mainly for its decision&nbsp; on the other documentary evidence submitted&nbsp; by the appellants themselves. <br><br>The&nbsp; fourth assignment of error seeks to&nbsp; strike&nbsp; out and correct a statement contained in the decision that 45 per cent was charged by Quisumbing during a short period of 40 days in&nbsp; addition to 12&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon in the mortgage.&nbsp; It is claimed that this is unnecessary?&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe otherwise.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statement is a conclusion&nbsp; of fact made by the Court of Appeals, upon which&nbsp; the decision is based.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very material to the decision, and thia Court is not authorized, and no one for that matter is, to order its suppression.<br><br>The fifth assignment of error refers to an alleged mistake in arithmetic, in the computation. The above error should have been submitted to the Court of Appeals for its correction.&nbsp; This Court, being an appellate tribunal, reviews only errors&nbsp; or issues actually brought before&nbsp; the respondent court, and it appearing that the supposed&nbsp; error is insignificant the same is hereby overruled.<br><br>Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is hereby affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in&nbsp; toto,</span>&nbsp; with costs against the petitioners.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, </i>and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
