				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Nederlandsch Indische Handelsbank,&nbsp; N. V., hereafter called the bank,&nbsp; brought this action in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila against&nbsp; the&nbsp; South Sea&nbsp; Surety &amp; Insurance Company,&nbsp; Inc., hereafter&nbsp; called the&nbsp; surety company, to collect the amount of&nbsp; P14,000 on a performance bond,&nbsp; jointly&nbsp; and severally executed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; surety company&nbsp; with the Walker Rubber&nbsp; Corporation, hereafter designated&nbsp; as vendee,&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the Associated Finance Company, Inc., hereafter designated as vendor.&nbsp; The performance is to secure payment of the sum of P14,000, the price of 100,000 pounds of camel back rubber which vendor had&nbsp; agreed to sell to vendee.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that the bank relied on the written assurance of the surety that the latter would pay for the draft covering the rubber sold&nbsp; in the event that drawee&nbsp; (vendee)&nbsp; would fail to&nbsp; pay said draft on&nbsp; its due&nbsp; date,&nbsp; and that vendee&nbsp; failed to pay&nbsp; said draft upon presentation.&nbsp; The defendant surety answered the complaint,&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; that&nbsp; the vendee&nbsp; had complied with its&nbsp; undertaking with the vendor; that the bank could&nbsp; not have relied&nbsp; on the defendant surety's assurance in discounting the draft as it had already been accepted by the drawee when&nbsp; the surety agreed to secure its payment; that the vendee did&nbsp; not.violate the terms or default in any of its&nbsp; undertakings&nbsp; with the vendor; that the vendor released the vendee of any and all liability arising from the&nbsp; acceptance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; draft&nbsp; and that the bond was executed solely for the benefit of&nbsp; the vendor. In its answer the surety presents a third-party&nbsp; complaint against the Walker Rubber Corporation, vendee,&nbsp; and Chua Chuy, indemnitor, both of whom had executed an indemnity agreement with the surety, and prays that if it&nbsp; is declared liable for&nbsp; the draft,&nbsp; then that the vendee&nbsp; and Chua Chuy&nbsp; should&nbsp; reimburse to it&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the judgment.<br><br>The Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; sentencing the&nbsp; surety&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay to the bank the amount of P14,000, with interest, and&nbsp; at the same time&nbsp; ordered the Walker Rubber Corporation and Chua Chuy to&nbsp; reimburse all amounts that the surety shall pay to the plaintiff bank, plus attorney's fees and costs.<br><br>The case was appealed to the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, and the latter&nbsp; affirmed the judgement of the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; It also dismissed a cross-claim filed by the third party defendant Chua Chuy against the other third-party defendant Walker Rubber&nbsp; Corporation for lack of evidence. This appeal by certiorari&nbsp; is against this judgment of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; facts found&nbsp; by said court&nbsp; are as follows:<br><blockquote>"In accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; a contract of sale&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; E-l)&nbsp; entered into on March 4, 1949 between the Associated Finance Co., Inc., and the Walker Rubber&nbsp; Corporation, the former&nbsp; drew a draft (Exh. A)&nbsp; on&nbsp; the latter, on March&nbsp; 4, 1950 for W.4,000&nbsp; payable&nbsp; sixty days after sight or, to&nbsp; be exact,&nbsp; on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1950, representing&nbsp; the value of&nbsp; 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber which formed a part&nbsp; of goods&nbsp; and articles mortgaged&nbsp; by the Associated Finance 'Co., Inc.,&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the Nederlandsch&nbsp; Indische &amp; Handelsbank. Said&nbsp; draft bore&nbsp; on its&nbsp; face&nbsp; its acceptance&nbsp; by the drawee, the Walker Rubber Corporation, dated&nbsp; March 4,&nbsp; 1950.<br><br>"On March 5, 1949, the Walker Rubber&nbsp; Corporation, as principal, and the South Sea Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., as surety, executed a performance&nbsp; bond for the due and&nbsp; full&nbsp; observance of all the covenants, conditions&nbsp; and agreements&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; said contract of sale on condition, among others,&nbsp; that the liability&nbsp; of the surety thereon should&nbsp; expire on March 5,&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; and the same would&nbsp; be cancelled ten days after its expiration unless the surety was notified in writing of any existing obligation thereunder.<br><br>"Upon presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; draft to&nbsp; the Nederlandsch Indische &amp; Handelsbank for discount, said bank addressed&nbsp; a letter on March 15, 1950&nbsp; to the&nbsp; South Sea Surety &amp;&nbsp; Insurance Co., Inc., requesting information whether&nbsp; it&nbsp; would&nbsp; consider the&nbsp; said draft as being covered by its performance bond and if&nbsp; so, whether&nbsp; it would be in order for the bank to present the draft to&nbsp; said surety&nbsp; company for immediate payment in the event the drawee&nbsp; fail to&nbsp; honor&nbsp; same on its due date,&nbsp; viz: May 5, 1950, to which the&nbsp; South Sea Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.,&nbsp; answered on&nbsp; March 16, 1950 that it&nbsp; would consider the draft for P14,000&nbsp; in order and that the&nbsp; same could be presented&nbsp; to&nbsp; it&nbsp; for&nbsp; payment should&nbsp; drawee&nbsp; fail to honor it, advising the bank,&nbsp; however, that any draft drawn&nbsp; subsequent to March 15, 1950&nbsp; would not be considered as within the terms&nbsp; of the performance&nbsp; bond in question.<br><br>"On April 18, 1950, Nederlandsch Indische&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Handelsbank&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; the Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc., to&nbsp; deliver to Francisco Sycip,&nbsp; the president of&nbsp; the Associated&nbsp; Finance Co.,&nbsp; Inc., 100,000 pounds&nbsp; of the camelback&nbsp; rubber stored in its&nbsp; Echague&nbsp; bodega, Warehouse No. 2 (Exh. H).&nbsp; By means&nbsp; of an undated&nbsp; letter addressed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage Co., Inc.,&nbsp; the Associated Finance Co., Inc., and the Walker&nbsp; Rubber Corporation, Cebu&nbsp; City, made a demand on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; delivery to Mr. Francisco Sycip, of the balance of 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber, as per delivery order&nbsp; issued by the Nederlandsch Indische &amp; Handelsbank dated March 17, I960 (Exh. I).<br><br>"On its due date,&nbsp; the draft&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; A) wa,s refused&nbsp; payment by the Walker Rubber Corporation of Cebu City and&nbsp; the corresponding protest for non-payment&nbsp; was&nbsp; made&nbsp; in due time (Exh.&nbsp; E).&nbsp; On May&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1950, the Bank&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; through&nbsp; the manager of&nbsp; the&nbsp; local branch&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu City, to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the draft (Exh. A) was referred for collection returned it to the Nederlandsch Indische &amp; Handelsbank with the advice that the Walker Rubber Corporation,&nbsp; Cebu City, dishonored said draft, claiming that their liability&nbsp; thereunder has been&nbsp; released by virtue, of an agreement entered into&nbsp; between&nbsp; them and the drawers and charged the bank for their commission&nbsp; and airmail postage the sum&nbsp; of P18 (Exh. D),<br><br>"On April 10,&nbsp; 1950, the Associated Finance Co.,&nbsp; Inc., and&nbsp; the Walker Rubber Corporation, represented by their respective Presidents, Francisco Sycip&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Yaotin,&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into an agreement whereby the Associated Finance&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; assumed and took delivery of the undelivered balance of camelback rubber and further assumed the full&nbsp; responsibility of the P14,000&nbsp; draft thereby releasing&nbsp; and&nbsp; discharging&nbsp; the Walker Rubber&nbsp; Corporation from the liability as acceptor of said draft, and rescinding and declaring null&nbsp; and void the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale entered into between' them (Exh. 3-Walker)."<br></blockquote>Only the vendee&nbsp; Walker Rubber Corporation&nbsp; and indemnitor Chua Chuy&nbsp; have filed petitions&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their joint&nbsp; brief, they make eleven assignments of error. But&nbsp; in&nbsp; their Memorandum in lieu&nbsp; of oral argument,&nbsp; they re-embodied their&nbsp; previous assignments of error into three only as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Whether&nbsp; or not the respondent bank,&nbsp; which&nbsp; claimed to&nbsp; have discounted the draft,&nbsp; Exhibit A, but admitting, however, not to have paid&nbsp; for&nbsp; it,&nbsp; or&nbsp; not&nbsp; to have&nbsp; credited its&nbsp; drawer, the Associated Finance Co.,&nbsp; Inc., for&nbsp; its value, could be considered a holder in due course&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; Petitioners contend&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; respondent bank was&nbsp; never a&nbsp; holder in due course of said draft.<br><br>"Whether or not respondent bank&nbsp; was&nbsp; an immediate party to said draft, and whether or not said respondent bank was the beneficiary of the performance bond, Exhibit F,&nbsp; or Exhibit 1-South Sea Surety.&nbsp; Petitioners claim&nbsp; that respondent bank was a&nbsp; remote party or a&nbsp; stranger to the transaction covered&nbsp; by said draft and that said&nbsp; performance bond was exclusively for the benefit&nbsp; of the beneficiary named therein, the Associated Finance Co., Inc.<br><br>"Whether or not respondent South Sea Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., has the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to be indemnified by petitioners for whatever sums of money it would be made to pay to respondent bank&nbsp; as a consequence of the guaranty respondent&nbsp; surety made in favor the respondent bank on account of the performance bond in favor of the Associated Finance Co., Inc., without&nbsp; the knowledge or&nbsp; consent of petitioner Walker Rubber Corporation, the principal named in&nbsp; said performance bond.&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; contend&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent surety has no right to be reimbursed for what it would be made to pay to respondent bank as a consequence of the former's guaranty to the latter, without the knowledge or&nbsp; consent of petitioners."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; first&nbsp; assignment&nbsp; of error raises the question as to whether or not the bank is a holder in due course.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; of Appeals found that the draft, Exh. A, represents the value of 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber, which form part of the goods and articles&nbsp; mortgaged by&nbsp; the vendor in favor of the bank; that on April 18, 1950, upon demand made by the vendor&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendee,&nbsp; the bank authorized the&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Company&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver to the President of the vendor company said 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber then stored in its Echague bodega No. 2.&nbsp; The bank had a lien of mortgage on the 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber.&nbsp; When the bank parted with the possession thereof by delivery to the vendee, by reason of the&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; it&nbsp; relinquished its right over said&nbsp; rubber. Valuable consideration or value in&nbsp; general terms may be some&nbsp; right,&nbsp; interest, profit or benefit to&nbsp; the party who makes&nbsp; the contract, or some forbearance,&nbsp; detriment, loss, responsibility, etc. on the other side&nbsp; (Story on Promissory Notes, Sec.&nbsp; 186, cited in Tolentino&nbsp; on Commercial Laws of the&nbsp; Philippines, Vol.&nbsp; I, p. 244).&nbsp; For the bank in&nbsp; the case at bar the relinquishment of its possession&nbsp; and lien over the, rubber is its&nbsp; consideration for the&nbsp; draft and the performance bond executed to guarantee the payment of the draft.<br><br>It can not&nbsp; be&nbsp; contended, therefore, that the sight draft, Exh. A, was delivered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the vendor&nbsp; to' the bank&nbsp; for collection merely,&nbsp; because by the delivery of the 100,000 pounds&nbsp; of&nbsp; camelback rubber mortgaged to&nbsp; it, the bank released its lien over&nbsp; said&nbsp; rubber.&nbsp; The delivery to the vendee of the rubber&nbsp; and the release thereof from the bank's possession is the consideration for the draft, and said consideration made the holder thereof, the bank, a holder of the draft in due course for value.<br><br>It is stated on behalf of petitioners that if the face value of the draft had&nbsp; been deducted by the bank from the mortgage obligation of the drawer-vendor, the bank would have truly lost the value of the draft,&nbsp; but it is argued that the camelback rubber did not&nbsp; belong&nbsp; to the bank and the mortgage thereon&nbsp; did not make the bank owner thereof.&nbsp; In answer to this contention,&nbsp; it may be stated that the mortgage was as good,&nbsp; if not better than ownership itself.&nbsp; By virtue of&nbsp; the mortgage, the bank could have caused the rubber to&nbsp; be sold to satisfy the debt covered by the mortgage, and if the proceeds are insufficient it could have demanded a&nbsp; deficiency judgment that could . be enforced against any other property&nbsp; of the mortgage.<br><br>The above answers&nbsp; also&nbsp; the&nbsp; additional claim&nbsp; that in-as much as the bank&nbsp; did&nbsp; not deduct the amount of the draft from the mortgage&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; and neither did&nbsp; it credit&nbsp; the amount thereof&nbsp; with&nbsp; the vendor, the bank did not&nbsp; lose anything and, therefore, has&nbsp; not parted&nbsp; with any consideration for the&nbsp; draft.&nbsp; We also call attention to the fact that once&nbsp; the draft came into the possession of the bank, the latter asked&nbsp; from the surety if the performance bond that it had executed in favor of the vendor includes the surety's obligation to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the draft, and the surety promptly answered&nbsp; in the affirmative, that it would pay the draft if the same is dishonored upon presentation.&nbsp; The bank only authorized the delivery and parted with the possession of the 100,000 pounds of camelback rubber only&nbsp; upon the assurances of the surety that the draft was covered by the performance bond that it had executed and that it would pay the draft if dishonored.<br><br>An examination of the pleadings will disclose that the action of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank against&nbsp; the surety was&nbsp; predicated mainly on the acceptance of liability&nbsp; on the&nbsp; draft made expressly by the surety.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the basis of the action and of the decision.&nbsp; The release of the rubber from the control of the bank and the delivery thereof to vendee was due, not only to the draft, but by the express agreement of the surety to be liable for the draft on its performance bond.<br><br>It is further argued&nbsp; that&nbsp; the bank had not&nbsp; accepted the draft as partial&nbsp; payment of the mortgage,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; had it credited the&nbsp; mortgagor&nbsp; with the amount thereof.&nbsp; In answer thereto,&nbsp; the bank alleges that it intended to credit the amount of the draft after its collection.&nbsp; The argument of petitioners rests merely on the premise that the bank was merely an agent for collection, which is not true or correct.&nbsp; The argument would be&nbsp; true if the bank were so,&nbsp; but as we. have indicated,&nbsp; it actually had&nbsp; an interest in the rubber sold and delivered&nbsp; by it and the parting with the&nbsp; rubber&nbsp; was a&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; for&nbsp; the holding of the draft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>In the second&nbsp; assignment of error,&nbsp; it is again argued that the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; draft were the&nbsp; drawer-vendor and the acceptor-vendee, and that unless the bank acquired the draft for value the parties to&nbsp; said&nbsp; draft, the drawer' and the acceptor,&nbsp; could cancel the&nbsp; liability created&nbsp; thereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; This argument again fails to take into consideration the fact that the bank&nbsp; parted with the&nbsp; possession of the&nbsp; 100,000&nbsp; pounds of&nbsp; camelback rubber,&nbsp; by reason of the&nbsp; draft and the acceptance by the surety of liability under&nbsp; its performance bond,&nbsp; in case&nbsp; the&nbsp; draft&nbsp; is&nbsp; not paid in presentation.<br><br>It is further&nbsp; argued that the performance bond, Exh. F, was executed by the surety for the benefit of the vendor. This was the original purport or intent of the performance bond, but then the surety, upon a&nbsp; written&nbsp; request of the bank if it would consider the draft covered by the performance bond, agreed expressly in writing that the payment of the&nbsp; draft was covered by&nbsp; the&nbsp; same bond.&nbsp; The argument is to no avail in&nbsp; view of the express acceptance by the surety of liability under its performance bond, in case the draft was not paid upon presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; For clarity the letter of&nbsp; the bank, Exh. B is as follows:<br><blockquote>"South Sea Surety &amp; Ins.&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.<br>Manila<br><br>Gentlemen:<br><br>Performance Bond issued by your goodselves and Messrs. Walker<br>Rubber Corporation of&nbsp; Cebu in favour&nbsp; of&nbsp; Messrs.&nbsp; Associated<br>Finance Co,, Inc. of Manila under date of March 5, 1949.<br>Messrs.

C, and did not consent thereto.&nbsp; This claim&nbsp; is unfounded.&nbsp; Before the performance bond&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed the&nbsp; parties thereto&nbsp; already knew that the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; bond&nbsp; was to cover the sight draft,&nbsp; Exh.&nbsp; A, because it&nbsp; was known&nbsp; that the&nbsp; rubber was mortgaged&nbsp; to the bank and&nbsp; under the latter's control, and payment of the draft must first&nbsp; be secured before the bank would release the rubber from&nbsp; its&nbsp; mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,, the performance bond&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; provides that its purpose was to guarantee the payment&nbsp; of the sight draft:<br><blockquote>"Whereas, the contract&nbsp; requires the above bounden&nbsp; Principal&nbsp; to give a good and&nbsp; sufficient bond in the above-stated sum to secure the full and faithful fulfillment on its part of said contract, particularly the payment of trust&nbsp; receipt, sixty (60) days sight draft. documents against acceptance, payable to the Nederlandsch Indische &amp; Handelsbank, N.
