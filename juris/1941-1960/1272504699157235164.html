				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Special Proceeding No. 1184 of the Court of First Instance 
of Negros Occidental, the court issued an order on April 6, 1949, fixing the 
period of six months from April 16, 1949, within which claims against the 
intestate estate of the deceased Eduardo L. Jison could be filed. On May 12, 
1949, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., filed a claim against the intestate estate 
for the sum of P2,105.52, plus 8 per cent interest compounded monthly from May 
1, 1949, and 20 per cent of the total debt as attorney's fees. A copy of said 
claim was served on May 11, 1949, on attorney for the administrator. On May 5, 
1950, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., filed a mo'fcion for the approval of its 
claim, calling attention to the fact that the administrator had not filed any 
answer thereto. On May 8, 1950, the administrator filed an opposition, setting 
up the defense of moratorium. After the filing of a reply by the attorneys for 
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., the court on May 20, 1950, issued an order 
approving the claim and directing the administrator to pay, within thirty days 
from notice, the claim in question. From this order the present appeal was taken 
by the judicial administrator. 
<p align="justify">Under section 5, Rule 87, of the Rules of Court, all claims for 
money against the decedent, arising from contract, express or implied, whether 
the same be due, not due, or contingent, all claims for funeral expenses and 
expenses of the last sickness of the decedent, and judgment for money against 
the decedent, must be filed within the time limited in the notice; otherwise 
they are barred forever, except that they may be set forth as counterclaims in 
any action that the executor or administrator may bring against the claimants. 
The effect of the debt moratorium is merely to make a debt, even if already 
matured, not yet demandable; but section 5 of Rule 87 covers a claim which is 
not due, and requires its presentation within the prescribed period, if it is 
not to be barred. The purpose "is to settle the affairs of the estate with 
dispatch, so that the residue may be delivered to the persons entitled thereto 
without their being afterwards called upon to respond in actions for claims, 
which, under the ordinary statute of limitations, have not yet prescribed." 
(Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 3rd ed., Vol. II, p. 400.) </p>
<p align="justify">The general objective of the Moratorium Law, which is 
rehabilitation of debtors, must give way to the more urgent necessity of 
settling the estate of a decedent and distributing its residue among his heirs 
as soon as possible, thereby minimizing, if not avoiding altogether, expenses of 
administration. Sections 15 and 16, Rule 89, of the Rules of Court expressly 
enjoin the court to fix the period within which the executor or administrator 
should finish the settlement of the estate, such period not to exceed one year 
in the first instance, or more than two years where special circumstances shall 
so require, or more than two years and a half when the executor or administrator 
dies and a new one is appointed. Thus, "the speedy settlement of the estate of 
deceased persons for the benefits of creditors and those entitled to the residue 
by way of inheritance or legacy after the debts and expenses of administration 
have been paid, is the ruling spirit of our probate law." (Moran, Comments on 
the Rules of Court, 3rd ed., Vol. II, p. 435, citing Magbanua vs. Akol,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 40 Off. 
Gaz. 3871, and Borja vs. Borja,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> L-1259, April 27, 1949.)</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, as the Moratorium Law had not been set up timely, 
because the administrator failed to file an answer within five days from the 
service of copy of the claim in question, in accordance with section 10, Rule 
87, of the Rules of Court, said defense has been waived. In this connection, the 
trial court did not err in approving the claim without reception of evidence, 
since the same was not denied by the administrator in due time. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed, and it is so ordered 
with costs against the appellant. </p>
