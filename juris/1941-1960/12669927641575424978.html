				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal&nbsp; from a judgment&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Cebu&nbsp; granting Philippine citizenship to petitioner-appellee Jesus&nbsp; J. Go.<br><br>Petitioner-appellee is a Chinese citizen, born in Bogo, Cebu; he is single and has acquired his high school&nbsp; education from&nbsp; the Cebu Roosevelt Memorial Colleges; he has finished the&nbsp; course&nbsp; in Pharmacy, but has not taken the Board&nbsp; Examination, he being an alien; he has no lucrative profession, but he has an allowance of P60 from his father.&nbsp; He&nbsp; owns property valued at P6,000&nbsp; which was donated to him by his grandmother on July 17, 1954, or one week before he filed his application for naturalization.&nbsp; He speaks and writes English and 1; he Cebuano&nbsp; dialect; he believes in the principles underlying the&nbsp; Philippine Constitution and is not opposed to organized government nor affiliated with&nbsp; any association or group&nbsp; of persons who uphold doctrines opposed to all organized government; he does not believe in the necessity or propriety of violence or assassination for the success and predominance of men's ideas; he has never been convicted of any crime involving moral&nbsp; turpitude and is&nbsp; not&nbsp; suffering from&nbsp; any&nbsp; mental alienation or any incurable contagious disease.&nbsp; Seemingly he has all the qualifications required by law and none of the disqualifications for the grant of Philippine&nbsp; citizenship and therefore the decision appealed from should be maintained.&nbsp; But&nbsp; inasmuch as his witness Jesus Varallo testified that&nbsp; the petitioner-appellee mingled politically with the Filipinos and solicited votes of his Filipino friends for the candidate of his preference because he&nbsp; could not&nbsp; himself vote during elections, being an alien, the&nbsp; government appealed contending that under the ruling of&nbsp; this Court in the case of Benluy <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines, (94 Phil., 110, 50&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 142), the&nbsp; decision in&nbsp; question should be reversed.<br><br>Section 56 of the&nbsp; Revised Election Code&nbsp; clearly provides that "no foreigner shall aid&nbsp; any candidate, directly or indirectly, or take part in&nbsp; or to influence in any manner any election.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only&nbsp; in the case aforecited, but also&nbsp; in the cases of Ernesto Go <i>vs.</i> Republic of the Philippines, G. R. No. L-12101, Jan. 24, 1959; and&nbsp; Kiat Chun Tan <i>vs.</i> Republic of the Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra </span>p. 159, we ruled that&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of the Election Law&nbsp; committed by aliens prior to the filing of their application is sufficient cause for not granting them Philippine citizenship, such violation being considered a&nbsp; serious&nbsp; offense penalized under Sections 183 and 185 of&nbsp; the Revised Election Code with imprisonment of not less than one year&nbsp; and one day but not more than five&nbsp; years&nbsp; and deportation in case of a foreigner.&nbsp; The facts proven in the instant case are similar to those involved in the aforecited cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the decision of the lower court should be&nbsp; as it is&nbsp; hereby reversed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
