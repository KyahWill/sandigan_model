				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal against an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing a  petition for prohibition against the Municipal  Court of Manila.</p>
<p>In June,  1954,  Auyong  Hian filed two complaints  in the  Municipal Court of  Manila.  In the first one, Civil Case No.  31998, he seeks to  recover   a sum of money against Isabelo Pacquing appearing in a vale executed by Pacquing without mention  of place of  execution.  In  the second one, Civil Case No. 32003, recovery of another sum is sought against Carmen  B. Pacquing on another vale, also without mention of  place of execution.  In  the  first case defendant filed a motion to dismiss  on the ground that he is a resident of Davao City.   In the second,  a motion to dismiss was also  filed  on the ground that  defendant i3 a married woman,  whose husband was  not joined in the action.   The  municipal  judge  denied both motions to dismiss, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  appearing that the defendants were served with summons thru their daughter Praxedes Pacquing at 1051 Vallejo, Sta. Mesa, Manila,  which is their  residence and the  place where they could be  served with  summons, the  ground  for  the motion to  dismiss is  untenable." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  the  order  of denial the  judge  set  the cases for trial. <br><br>Thereupon, the  defendants brought  this action for prohibition in  the Court of First Instance, alleging that the municipal judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or  with grave abuse of discretion, because  in the first case venue was improperly laid, and in the second, Carmen B. Pacquing can not  be sued without joining her husband. Defendant in the prohibition case denied the  claim contained  in  the  petition for prohibition  that  petitioners are residents of Davap City and  alleged that the fact is that  they  are in Davao only  on  business.   It does not appear  from  the  record that there ever was  a trial on the above  issues where evidence was adduced by the parties.  A motion  to declare defendant  in  default  was filed and an answer thereto also registered, but no action thereon was taken by the Court.   On September 17, 1954, the Court  issued an order dismissing the  petition for prohibition  on  the ground  that  petitioners had not yet exhausted  all  the  remedies they  had in the  municipal court, such as an appeal.   A motion to  reconsider  this order of dismissal  was  denied before  this  appeal was, prosecuted.</p>
<p>The first  error imputed to the court <em>a quo</em> is  its failure to set the  petition  for hearing.   In  petitioner's  motion for the  reconsideration  of  the order of dismissal they asked for opportunity to present evidence to support their stand that  the municipal judge  had  no jurisdiction because in one case venue  was improperly laid and  in the other, the  husband  of defendant  was not joined  in the action.   But this  motion was  denied.</p>
<p>There is no question that in the  second case in the municipal  court, where the husband was  not joined in the action, the  prohibition does not lie because failure to join  the husband  is not  a jurisdictional objection. The remedy is for the husband to  be joined  as  a party defendant.</p>
<p>In  the first case,  in which  the  defendant Isabelo  I. Pacquing objected to the  venue of  the action, on the ground that he is a resident of Davao City, the objection was raised in a motion to dismiss.  But rightly  or wrongly, the municipal judge found that Isabelo  I.  Pacquing was not a resident of Davao.  Nevertheless, the supposed lack of residence of the defendant was still a  defense probable at the trial and  the issue thereon was a proper and legitimate  question for the municipal judge to try  and decide.</p>
<p>So  the real question presented to  the court a quo in the action for prohibition  is:  Was the  municipal  court without  power to continue  taking cognizance  of the case merely upon defendant's claim that  he was not a resident of Manila, and did it act in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss and setting the case for trial  on the merits?   The answer to the first question can be no  other  than  that the  court had the  duty and the  right to do so,  especially as it had provisionally found that  defendant  was  a  resident of Manila.  This finding did  not  deprive defendant of the right to present evidence at the trial to show that he was not a resident of Manila.   If at said trial the municipal judge would find that defendant was not a  resident,  it would then be his duty to dismiss the action on the ground that  venue was  improperly  laid.   But  in view of his opinion that Isabelo I. Pacquing was a resident of Manila, the only proper course for  him to follow was  to deny the motion to dismiss and set the cases for trial on the merits as he did.   It is clear, therefore, that the municipal judge did not  abuse his discretion in denying (the motion to dismiss  and in  setting the cases for hearing.</p>
<p>The above  considerations clearly  show  that the order dismissing the action for prohibition is correct, even if no hearing was had.   It is true  that the petitioners, had not yet exhausted their remedies  in the municipal court in the two cases pending therein.  In the first case where  Isabelo I. Pacquing is the defendant,  Pacquing should have waited for the trial of his case on  the merits.   If at  the trial he  proves that he is not  a  resident of  Manila and the municipal judge does not dismiss the case, that  would be the time  for  him  to  institute  the  action  for prohibition or to appeal.  In the other case, where claim is made that Carmen B. Pacquing is a married woman, as he is married to her, Isabelo  I.  Pacquing himself should  join his wife as a party defendant and not to ask that the case be thrown out of  court because  he is not joined in the action.  It is evident, therefore, that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> was correct in declaring that petitioners had not exhausted the remedies that they  could avail of in the municipal court.</p>
<p>The order  appealed from  is, therefore,  affirmed,  with. costs.</p>
