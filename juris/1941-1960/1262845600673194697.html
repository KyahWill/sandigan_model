				<BR><BR>In&nbsp; June,&nbsp; 1951, plaintiff Pearl Island Commercial Corporation, engaged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; manufacture of floor wax under the name of "Bee Wax", in the City of Manila, entered into a contract,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; A,&nbsp; with defendant&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; Tan Tong, wherein the latter, designated as sole&nbsp; distributor&nbsp; of&nbsp; said article in the&nbsp; provinces&nbsp; of Samar,&nbsp; Leyte,&nbsp; Cebu,&nbsp; Bohol, and Negros Oriental&nbsp; and all the provinces&nbsp; in&nbsp; the island of&nbsp; Mindanao,&nbsp; was&nbsp; going to buy the said&nbsp; floor wax for resale in the&nbsp; territory&nbsp; above-mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff undertook&nbsp; not to&nbsp; appoint&nbsp; any&nbsp; other&nbsp; distributor&nbsp; within the said territory; to sell to defendant Tong&nbsp; at&nbsp; factory price in Manila, F. O. B.&nbsp; Manila; that Tong could sell the article in&nbsp; his&nbsp; territory&nbsp; at&nbsp; any price he&nbsp; saw fit; that payment for any&nbsp; floor wax purchased shall be delivered to plaintiff within sixty&nbsp; days from the date of shipment; that (this is important)&nbsp; Tong was to furnish surety bond to cover all shipments of the floor wax; and that Lim Tan Tong may return to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff the floor wax that are damaged or unmerchantable,&nbsp; at&nbsp; its expense; and&nbsp; that in case&nbsp; of loss due&nbsp; to&nbsp; fortuitous&nbsp; event&nbsp; or&nbsp; force majeure, the plaintiff was to shoulder&nbsp; the loss, provided the goods were&nbsp; still in transit.<br><br>On the same day said contract was executed on June 16, 1951, defendant Manila. Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc., with Tong&nbsp; as principal, filed&nbsp; the surety bond&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B), binding itself&nbsp; unto&nbsp; the plaintiff in the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P5,000, by reason of&nbsp; the appointment of Tong as exclusive agent for plaintiff&nbsp; for the Visayas-Mindanao&nbsp; provinces, the bond being&nbsp; conditioned&nbsp; on&nbsp; the faithful performance of Tong's duties, in accordance with the agreement.&nbsp; It would appear that for its security, the Surety Company had Ko Su Kuan and Marciano Du execute in its favor an indemnity agreement&nbsp; that they&nbsp; would indemnify&nbsp; suid&nbsp; surety&nbsp; company in whatever amount it may pay to the plaintiff by reason of the bond filed by&nbsp; it.<br><br>On&nbsp; June 18, 1951,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; shipped&nbsp; 299 cases of&nbsp; Bee Wax,&nbsp; valued at&nbsp; P7,107,&nbsp; to Tong,&nbsp; duly&nbsp; received by&nbsp; the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tong failed to remit&nbsp; the value within sixty days, and despite the demand made by plaintiff on him to send that&nbsp; amount,&nbsp; he&nbsp; sent only&nbsp; P770,&nbsp; leaving&nbsp; a balance&nbsp; of P6,337, which he admits to be still with&nbsp; him,&nbsp; but which he&nbsp; refuses to remit&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; owed&nbsp; him&nbsp; a larger&nbsp; amount.&nbsp; To enforce&nbsp; payment of the balance of P6,337, plaintiff&nbsp; filed&nbsp; this present action not only against&nbsp; Tong, but also against the Surety Company,&nbsp; to recover&nbsp; from the&nbsp; latter the amount of its bond of P5,000.<br><br>The Surety Company in its&nbsp; answer&nbsp; filed a cross-claim against&nbsp; Tong,&nbsp; and&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court's&nbsp; permission, filed&nbsp; a third-party complaint against&nbsp; Ko&nbsp; Su&nbsp; Kuan and Marciano&nbsp; Du&nbsp; who, as&nbsp; already&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; had&nbsp; executed&nbsp; an indemnity agreement in its favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial,&nbsp; the lower court,&nbsp; presided by Judge Hermogenes Conception, rendered judgment,&nbsp; the dispositive part of which reads as follows:<br><br>"In view of all thk foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; renders judgment in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; and against the defendants as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"(a)&nbsp; The Court orders&nbsp; the defendants Lim&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Tong and&nbsp; the Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc., to pay jointly and severally&nbsp; the plaintiff Pearl Island Commercial Corporation the sum&nbsp; of P5,000.00, plus legal interest&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of the filing" of this&nbsp; complaint, until it is fully paid;<br><br>"(b)&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court orders&nbsp; the defendant Lim&nbsp; Tan Tong'&nbsp; to pay to the&nbsp; plaintiff the sum of&nbsp; P1,337.00&nbsp; witli&nbsp; legal&nbsp; rate oi' interest&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of this complaint until said amount is&nbsp; fully paid;<br><br>"(c)&nbsp; The&nbsp; two defendants shall pay jointly&nbsp; and severally another amount of P500&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plaintiif as&nbsp; attorney's fees,&nbsp; plus the&nbsp; costs of this suit;<br><br>"(d)&nbsp; The CouPt orders the cross-defendant Lim Tan Tong&nbsp; and the third-party defendants&nbsp; Ko Su Kuan and Marciano Du to&nbsp; pay jointly&nbsp; and&nbsp; severally to the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Surety &amp;.&nbsp; Fidelity Co., Inc., the sum of P5,000 with legal rate of interest from the date&nbsp; of the filing of this&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; until fully paid,&nbsp; plus P500&nbsp; as attorney's fees,&nbsp; plus the&nbsp; costs of&nbsp; this suit."</blockquote><br><br>The Surety company is&nbsp; appealing said&nbsp; decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal originally taken&nbsp; to the Court of Appeals, was later certified to us as involving only&nbsp; questions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; assigns&nbsp; the following errors:<br><br><blockquote>"I. The trial court erred in&nbsp; holding that the contract&nbsp; between the Pearl Island Commercial Corporation and Lim Tan Tong&nbsp; was one of agency&nbsp; so that breach thereof&nbsp; would come within the terms of the surety bond posted by appellant therein,<br><br>"II. The trial court&nbsp; erred in ordering the defendant-appellant herein to pay&nbsp; attorney's fees&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; charges stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the judgment."</blockquote><br><br>It is&nbsp; appellant's contention&nbsp; that it cannot be held&nbsp; liable on its bond&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason that the latter was filed on the theory&nbsp; that the&nbsp; contract between&nbsp; the plaintiff and Tong was one&nbsp; of&nbsp; agency&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; of which,&nbsp; said Surety&nbsp; Company guaranteed the&nbsp; faithful performance of Tong as agent, but that it&nbsp; turned out that said contract was&nbsp; one of purchase&nbsp; and sale, as shown by the very title of&nbsp; said contract&nbsp; (Exhibit A),&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; "Contract of Purchase and Sale", and&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; never&nbsp; undertook to guaranty the faithful performance of Tong as a purchaser. However, a careful examination of the said contract shows that appellant is only,&nbsp; partly right, for the reason&nbsp; that the terms of the said contract, while providing for&nbsp; sale of Bee Wax from the&nbsp; plaintiff to Tong and&nbsp; purchase of&nbsp; the same by&nbsp; Tong from the plaintiff,&nbsp; also&nbsp; designates&nbsp; Tong as the&nbsp; sole&nbsp; distributor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; article&nbsp; within a&nbsp; certain territory.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; paragraph 4&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract entitled "Security", provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; Tong&nbsp; was&nbsp; to&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; surety bond to cover all shipments made by&nbsp; the plaintiff to him. Furthermore, appellant&nbsp; must have understood the contract to be one, at&nbsp; least partly,&nbsp; of&nbsp; agency&nbsp; because&nbsp; the bond itself (Exhibit B)&nbsp; says the&nbsp; following:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREAS, the above bounden principal has been appointed&nbsp; as <i>exclusive agent</i> for Pearl Islands Commercial Corporation of Manila, Philippines, for&nbsp; the Visayas-Mindanao Provinces; * * *."</blockquote><br><br>Under the circumstances, we are afraid that the&nbsp; Surety Company is not now in&nbsp; a position to deny its liability for the shipment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 299 cases of Bee&nbsp; Wax duly received by Tong and his failure to pay its value of P7,107, minus P770 or a balance of P6,S37, of course,&nbsp; up to the limit&nbsp; of P5,000,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of the bond.&nbsp; True,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract (Exhibit A)&nbsp; is not entirely clear.&nbsp; It is in some respects, even&nbsp; confusing.&nbsp; While it speaks&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of Bee Wax to Tong and&nbsp; his responsibility&nbsp; for the payment&nbsp; of the value of every shipment so purchased, at the same time it appoints him&nbsp; sole distributor within&nbsp; a certain&nbsp; area, the plaintiff undertaking not&nbsp; to appoint any other agent&nbsp; or distributor within the&nbsp; same area.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; it seems&nbsp; to have been the sole&nbsp; concern&nbsp; and&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the plaintiff to be sure that it was&nbsp; paid the value of all&nbsp; shipments&nbsp; of Bee Wax to Tong and&nbsp; the Surety Company&nbsp; by&nbsp; its bond, guaranteed in the&nbsp; final analysis&nbsp; said&nbsp; payment&nbsp; by Tong, either as purchaser or as agent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the article was purchased&nbsp; by Tong or&nbsp; whether it was consigned to him as agent to be sold within his area, the fact is that Tong admits&nbsp; said&nbsp; shipment,&nbsp; admits its value,&nbsp; admits keeping the same&nbsp; (P7,107 minus the P770 he had paid on account), but that he is retaining it&nbsp; for reasons of his&nbsp; own, namely, that plaintiff allegedly owes&nbsp; him a larger amount.&nbsp; More- over,&nbsp; the Surety Company is adequately&nbsp; protected, especially by the&nbsp; judgment because&nbsp; by its express&nbsp; terms, appellant can&nbsp; recover&nbsp; from&nbsp; Ko&nbsp; Su&nbsp; Kuan and&nbsp; Marciano Du whatever&nbsp; amounts,&nbsp; including attorney's&nbsp; fees it&nbsp; may pay to plaintiff, and said&nbsp; two&nbsp; persons&nbsp; evidently&nbsp; have not appealed from the decision.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengson, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.<br>
