				<H3>PHILIPPINE LAWYER'S ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER, VS. CELEDONIO
AGRAVA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS DIRECTOR OF THE PHILIPPINES PATENT OFFICE, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition filed by the Philippine Lawyer's Association for prohibition&nbsp; and injunction against Celedonio Agrava, in his capacity as Director of the Philippines Patent Office.<br><br>On May 27, 1957, respondent Director&nbsp; issued a circular announcing that he&nbsp; had scheduled for June 27, 1957 an examination for the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; determining&nbsp; who are qualified&nbsp; to practice&nbsp; as patent attorneys before the Philippines Patent Office, the said examination to cover patent law and jurisprudence and the rules of practice before said office.&nbsp; According to&nbsp; the circular, members of the Philippine Bar, engineers&nbsp; and other persons with sufficient scientific and technical training are qualified to take the said examination.&nbsp; It would appear that heretofore, respondent Director has been holding similar examinations.<br><br>It is the contention of the petitioner Philippine Lawyer's Association that one who has passed the&nbsp; bar examinations and is licensed by the Supreme Court to practice law in the Philippines and who is in good standing, is duly qualified to practice before the Philippines Patent Office, and that consequently, the act of the respondent Director requiring members&nbsp; of the Philippine Bar&nbsp; in&nbsp; good standing to take and pass an examination given by&nbsp; the Patent Office as a condition precedent to their being allowed to practice before said office, such as representing applicants in the preparation and prosecution of applications for patent, is in excess of his jurisdiction and is in violation of the law.<br><br>In his answer, respondent&nbsp; Director, through the Solicitor General, maintains that the prosecution of patent cases "does not involve entirely or purely the practice of law but includes the application of scientific and technical knowledge and training, so&nbsp; much so that, as a matter of actual practice, the prosecution of patent cases may be handled not&nbsp; only by lawyers, but also by engineers and other persons with sufficient scientific and&nbsp; technical training who pass the prescribed examinations as given by the Patent Office;&nbsp; * * * that the Rules of Court do not prohibit the Patent&nbsp; Office,&nbsp; or any other quasi-judicial&nbsp; body from requiring further condition or qualification from those who would wish&nbsp; to handle cases before such&nbsp; bodies,&nbsp; as in the prosecution of&nbsp; patent cases before the Patent Office which, as stated in the preceding paragraph, requires more&nbsp; of an application&nbsp; of&nbsp; scientific and technical knowledge than the mere application&nbsp; of provisions&nbsp; of law; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; that the action taken by the respondent is&nbsp; in accordance with Republic Act No. 165, otherwise known as the Patent Law of the Philippines, which&nbsp; is similar&nbsp; to the&nbsp; United States Patent&nbsp; Law, in accordance with which the&nbsp; United States Patent&nbsp; Office has also prescribed&nbsp; a similar examination as that&nbsp; prescribed by respondent. * * *."<br><br>Respondent further contends that just as the Patent Law of the United&nbsp; States of America authorizes the Commissioner of Patents to prescribe examinations to determine as to who may practice before the United States Patent Office, the respondent, is similarly&nbsp; authorized to do so by our Patent Law, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 165.<br><br>Although as already stated, the Director of Patents, in the past, would appear to have been holding tests or examinations the passing of which was imposed&nbsp; as&nbsp; a required qualification to practice before the Patent Office, to our knowledge, this is the first time that the right of the Director of Patents to&nbsp; do so, specially&nbsp; as regards members of the bar, has been questioned formally, or otherwise put in issue.&nbsp; And we have given it careful thought&nbsp; and consideration.<br><br>The Supreme Court has the exclusive and constitutional power with respect to admission to the practice of law in the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and&nbsp; any member of the&nbsp; Philippine Bar in good standing may practice law anywhere and before any entity, whether judicial or quasi-judicial or administrative, in the Philippines.&nbsp; Naturally, the question&nbsp; arises as to whether or not appearance before&nbsp; the Patent Office and the preparation and prosecution of patent applications. etc., constitutes or is included&nbsp; in the practice&nbsp; of law.<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">The&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of law&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; limited&nbsp; to the conduct of cases or litigation m court;</span> it embraces the preparation&nbsp; of&nbsp; pleadings and other&nbsp; papers incident&nbsp; to actions and special proceedings, the management&nbsp; of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges&nbsp; and courts,&nbsp; and in&nbsp; addition,&nbsp; conveying. In general, all advice to clients, and all action taken for them in matters connected with&nbsp; the law incorporation sendees, assessment and condemnation services contemplating an appearance before a judicial&nbsp; body,&nbsp; the foreclosure of a mortgage,&nbsp; enforcement of a&nbsp; creditor's&nbsp; claim in bankruptcy and&nbsp; insolvency proceedings,&nbsp; and conducting proceedings in attachment, and in matters of estate&nbsp; and&nbsp; guardianship have been held to constitute law practice,&nbsp; as&nbsp; do the preparation and drafting of legal instruments, <span style="font-style: italic;">where the work done involves the determination by the trained legal mind of the legal effect of facts and conditions."</span> (5 Am. Jur. p.&nbsp; 262, 263).&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Practice of law</span> under modern conditions consists in no small part of work performed outside of any court and having no&nbsp; immediate relation&nbsp; to&nbsp; proceedings in court.&nbsp; It embraces&nbsp; conveyancing, the giving of legal advice on a large variety of subjects,&nbsp; and the preparation and&nbsp; execution of legal&nbsp; instruments covering an&nbsp; extensive field of business and trust&nbsp; relations and other&nbsp; affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Although these transactions may&nbsp; have no direct connection with court proceedings, they are always subject&nbsp; to become involved in litigation.</span> They require in many aspects a high degree of legal skill,&nbsp; a wide experience with&nbsp; men&nbsp; and affairs, and great capacity for adaptation to difficult and&nbsp; complex&nbsp; situations. These&nbsp; customary functions of&nbsp;&nbsp; an attorney or counselor at law bear an intimate relation to&nbsp; the administration of justice by&nbsp; the courts.&nbsp; No valid distinction, so&nbsp; far as concerns the question set forth&nbsp; in the order, can&nbsp; be drawn&nbsp; between that part of the work of the lawyer which involves appearance in court and that part which&nbsp; involves&nbsp; advice and drafting of&nbsp; instruments in his office.&nbsp; It is of importance to the welfare of&nbsp; the public that&nbsp; these manifold&nbsp; customary functions be performed&nbsp; by persons possessed of adequate learning and skill, of sound moral character, and acting at all times under the heavy trust obligations&nbsp; to clients which rests upon&nbsp; all&nbsp; attorneys."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Moran,&nbsp; Comments&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court, Vol. 3 (1953 ed.), p.&nbsp; 665-666, citing In&nbsp; re Opinion of the Justices&nbsp; (Mass.), 194 N. E. 313, quoted in Rhode Is. Bar Assoc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Automobile Service Assoc.&nbsp; (R. I.) 179&nbsp; A. 139, 144).&nbsp; (Italics ours)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></blockquote>In our opinion, the practice of law includes such appearance before the Patent Office, the representation of applicants, oppositors, and&nbsp; other persons, and the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; of their applications for patent, their oppositions thereto, or the enforcement of their rights in patent cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first place, although the transaction of business in the Patent Office involves the use and&nbsp; application of technical and scientific knowledge&nbsp; and training,&nbsp; still,&nbsp; all such business&nbsp; has to be conducted and all orders and decisions&nbsp; of the Director of Patents have to be rendered in accordance with&nbsp; the Patent&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; other laws,&nbsp; including the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Patent Office&nbsp; in accordance with law.&nbsp; Not only this, but practice&nbsp; before', the&nbsp; Patent Office&nbsp; involves the&nbsp; interpretation and application of other laws and legal principles, as well as the existence of facts to be established&nbsp; in accordance with the law&nbsp; of evidence and procedure.&nbsp; For&nbsp; instance:&nbsp; Section 8&nbsp; of our Patent Law provides that an&nbsp; invention shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; patentable if it is contrary to public order or morals, or&nbsp; to public health or welfare.&nbsp; Section 9 says&nbsp; that an invention shall not be considered new or&nbsp; patentable if it&nbsp; was known or used by others in the Philippines before the invention thereof by the inventor named in the application for patent,&nbsp; or if it was patented or described in any printed publication in the Philippines or any&nbsp; foreign country more than&nbsp; one year before the application for a patent therefor, or if it had been in public use or on sale&nbsp; in the Philippines for more than one year before the application for the patent therefor.&nbsp; Section 10 provides that the right to the patent belongs&nbsp; to the true and actual&nbsp; inventor, his heirs,&nbsp; legal representatives or assigns, and Section 12&nbsp; says&nbsp; that&nbsp; an application for a patent may be filed only by the inventor, his heirs, legal representatives or assigns.&nbsp; Sections 25 and 26 refer to correction of any mistake in a patent.&nbsp; Section 28 enumerates the&nbsp; grounds for&nbsp; cancellation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a patent; that although any person may apply for such cancellation, under Section 29,&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General is authorized to petition&nbsp; for the cancellation of a patent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 30 mentions&nbsp; the requirements of a petition for cancellation.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 31&nbsp; and 32 provide for a notice of hearing of the petition for cancellation of the patent by the Director of Patents in case the said cancellation is warranted.&nbsp; Under Section 34, at any time after the expiration of three years from the day the patent was granted, any person may apply for the grant of a license under a particular patent on several grounds, such as, if the patented invention is not being worked in&nbsp; the Philippines on a commercial scale,&nbsp; or if the demand for the patented article in the Philippines is not being&nbsp; met to&nbsp; an&nbsp; adequate extent and reasonable terms, or if by&nbsp; reason of the patentee's refusal to grant a license on reasonable terms or by reason of the conditions attached by him to the license, purchase, lease or use of the patented article or working of&nbsp; the patented process or machine of production, the establishment of a new trade or industry in the Philippines is prevented; or if the patent or invention relates to food or medicine&nbsp; or is necessary to public health or public safety.&nbsp; All&nbsp; these things involve the application of laws, legal principles, practice and procedure. They call for&nbsp; legal knowledge, training and experience for which&nbsp; a&nbsp; member of the bar has been prepared.<br><br>In support of the proposition that&nbsp; much of the business and many of&nbsp; the acts, orders and decisions of the Patent Director involve questions of law or a reasonable and correct evaluation of facts, the very&nbsp; Patent Law,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 165, Section 61, provides that:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the applicant for a patent or for the registration of a design, any&nbsp; party to a proceeding to cancel a patent or to obtain&nbsp; a compulsory license, and any party to any other proceeding in the Office may&nbsp; appeal to the Supreme Court from&nbsp; any final order or decision of the Director."<br></blockquote>In other words, the appeal&nbsp; is taken to this Tribunal.&nbsp; If the transaction of business in the Patent Office and the acts, orders and decisions of the&nbsp; Patent Director involved exclusively or mostly technical and scientific knowledge and training, then logically, the&nbsp; appeal should be taken not to a court or judicial body, but rather to&nbsp; a board of scientists, engineers or technical men, which is not the case. <br><br>Another aspect of the question involves the consideration of the nature of the functions and acts of the Head of the Patent Office.<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; commissioner in&nbsp; issuing or withholding patents, in&nbsp; reissues, interferences, and&nbsp; extensions, exercises <span style="font-style: italic;">quasi-judicial</span> junctions.&nbsp; Patents are public&nbsp; records,&nbsp; and it is the duty of&nbsp; the Commissioner to give authenticated copies to any&nbsp; person, on payment of the&nbsp; legal fees."&nbsp;&nbsp; (40&nbsp; Am. Jur. 537).&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied). <br><br>"* * *.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Commissioner has the only original initiatory" jurisdiction that exists up to&nbsp; the granting and delivering of&nbsp; a patent, and it is his duty to&nbsp; decide whether the patent is new and whether it is the&nbsp; proper subject of a patent;&nbsp; and his action in&nbsp; awarding or&nbsp; refusing a patent is a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">judicial junction</span>.&nbsp; In passing on an&nbsp; application the commissioner should decide not only <span style="font-style: italic;">questions of law</span>, but also questions of&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; as whether there has been a prior public use or sale&nbsp; of the&nbsp; article&nbsp; invented.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (60 C.J.S. 460). (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>The Director&nbsp; of Patents, exercising as he&nbsp; does judicial or quasi-judicial functions,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; to hold&nbsp; that a member of the&nbsp; bar, because&nbsp; of his legal&nbsp; knowledge and training, should be allowed to practice before the Patent Office, without further examination or&nbsp; other qualification. Of course, the Director of Patents, if he deems it advisable or necessary, may require that members of the bar practising before him enlist the assistance of technical men and scientists in the preparation of papers and documents, such as, the drawing or&nbsp; technical&nbsp; description of an&nbsp; invention or machine sought to be patented, in the same way that&nbsp; a lawyer filing&nbsp; an application for the registration of a parcel of land on behalf of his client, is required to submit a plan and&nbsp; technical description of said land, prepared by a licensed surveyor.<br><br>But respondent Director claims&nbsp; that he is&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; authorized by the law to require persons desiring to practice or to do business before him to submit to an examination, even if they&nbsp; are already members of the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; He contends that our Patent Law, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 165, is patterned after the United States Patent Law; and that the U. S. Patent Office in its Rules of Practice of the United States Patent&nbsp; Office in&nbsp; Patent Cases prescribes an examination similar to that&nbsp; which he (respondent)&nbsp; has prescribed and scheduled.&nbsp; He invites our attention to the following provisions&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Rules of Practice:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Registration of attorneys and agents</span>.— A register of attorneys and a register of agents are kept in the Patent Office on which are entered the&nbsp; names of all persons recognized as entitled to represent applicants before the Patent Office in the preparation and prosecution of applications for patent.&nbsp; Registration in the Patent Office under the provisions of these rules shall only entitle the person registered to practice before the Patent&nbsp; Office.<br><br>"(a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Attorneys at law</span>.— Any&nbsp; attorney at law in good&nbsp; standing admitted to practice before any United&nbsp; States Court or the highest court of any State or Territory of the United States who fulfills the requirements and complied with the provisions of these rules&nbsp; may be admitted to practice before the&nbsp; Patent Office and have his name entered on the register of attorneys.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*******<br></div><br>"(c)<span style="font-style: italic;"> Requirement for registration.</span>— No&nbsp; person will be admitted to practice and register unless he shall&nbsp; apply to the Commissioner of Patents in writing on a prescribed form supplied by the Commissioner and furnish all requested information and material;&nbsp; and shall establish to the satisfaction of&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; that he is of good&nbsp; moral character and of good&nbsp; repute and possessed&nbsp; of the legal&nbsp; and scientific and&nbsp; technical qualifications&nbsp; necessary to&nbsp; enable him to render applicants for patent valuable service, and&nbsp; is otherwise&nbsp; competent to advise and&nbsp; assist him in the presentation and prosecution of their application&nbsp; before the Patent Office.&nbsp; In order that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; may&nbsp; determine whether&nbsp; a person seeking to have his name placed upon either of the&nbsp; registers has the qualifications specified, satisfactory proof of good moral character and repute, and&nbsp; of&nbsp; sufficient basic&nbsp; training in&nbsp; scientific and technical matters must be submitted and an examination which&nbsp; is held from time to time must be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; and passed.&nbsp; The taking of an&nbsp; examination may be&nbsp; waived in the case of any&nbsp; person who&nbsp; has&nbsp; served for three years&nbsp; in the&nbsp; examining corps of the Patent Office."<br></blockquote>Respondent states&nbsp; that the&nbsp; promulgation of the Rules of Practice of the United&nbsp; States Patent Office&nbsp; in Patent&nbsp; Cases is authorized by the United States Patent Law itself, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Patents, subject to the approval&nbsp; of the Secretary of Commerce may prescribe rules and regulations governing the <span style="font-style: italic;">recognition of&nbsp; agents, attorneys, or other&nbsp; persona representing applicants or other parties before his office, and may require of such&nbsp; persons, agents,&nbsp; or attorneys,</span> before being recognized as representatives&nbsp; of&nbsp; applicants or&nbsp; other&nbsp; persons, that they&nbsp; shall show they&nbsp; are of good moral&nbsp; character and in good repute, are <span style="font-style: italic;">possessed of the necessary qualifications to enable them to&nbsp; render&nbsp; to applicants or other persons valuable service, and are likewise competent to advise and&nbsp; assist&nbsp; applicants or other persons in&nbsp; the presentation or prosecution</span> of their applications or other business before the Office. The Commissioner of&nbsp; Patents may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend or&nbsp; exclude, either generally or in any particular case,&nbsp; from further practice before his office any person, agent, or attorney shown&nbsp; to be incompetent or disreputable, or guilty of gross misconduct, or who refuses to comply with the said rules and regulations, or who&nbsp; shall, with intent to defraud&nbsp; in any manner, deceive, mislead, or threaten any applicant or prospective applicant, or other person&nbsp; having immediate&nbsp; or&nbsp; prospective business before the&nbsp; office, by&nbsp; word, circular, letter,&nbsp; or by advertising. The reasons for any such&nbsp; suspension or exclusion shall be duly recorded.&nbsp; The action of the Commissioner may be&nbsp; reviewed upon the petition of the&nbsp; person so refused recognition or&nbsp; so suspended or excluded by the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia under such conditions and upon such&nbsp; proceedings as the said court may&nbsp; by its rules&nbsp; determine." (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>Respondent Director concludes that Section 78 of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 165 being: similar to the provisions&nbsp; of law just reproduced, then he&nbsp; is&nbsp; authorized to prescribe the rules and regulations requiring that persons desiring to practice before him should submit to and pass an examination. We reproduce said Section 78, Republic Act No. 165, for purposes of comparison:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 78. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rules and regulations</span>.— The Director subject to the approval of the Secretary&nbsp; of Justice, shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; conduct of all business in the Patent Office."<br></blockquote>The above provisions of Section 78 certainly and by far,y are different from the provisions of the United States Patent Law&nbsp; as&nbsp; regards authority&nbsp; to hold examinations to determine&nbsp; the qualifications of those allowed to practice before the Patent Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the U. S. Patent Law authorizes the Commissioner of Patents to require attorneys to show that they possess the necessary qualifications&nbsp; and competence to render valuable service to and advise&nbsp; and assist their clients in&nbsp; patent cases, which showing may take the form of a test or examination to be held by the Commissioner,&nbsp; our Patent Law,&nbsp; Section 78, is&nbsp; silent on this important&nbsp; point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our attention has not been called to any express&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of our&nbsp; Patent Law,&nbsp; giving&nbsp; such authority to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; the qualifications of persons allowed to practice before the Patent Office.<br><br>Section 551 of the Revised Administrative Code authorizes every chief of bureau to prescribe forms and make regulations or general orders not inconsistent with law, to secure the harmonious and efficient&nbsp; administration of his branch of the service and to carry into full effect the laws relating to matters within the jurisdiction of his bureau.&nbsp; Section 608&nbsp; of Republic Act 1937, known as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, provides that the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs shall, subject to&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval of the Department Head, make&nbsp; all rules and regulations necessary to enforce the provisions of said code.&nbsp; Section 338&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code, Commonwealth Act No. 466 as amended, states that&nbsp; the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Collector of Internal Revenue, shall promulgate all needful rules and regulations for the effective enforcement of the provisions of the code.&nbsp; We understand that&nbsp; rules and&nbsp; regulations have been promulgated not only for the Bureaus of Customs and Internal Revenue, but also for other bureaus&nbsp; of the Government, to govern the transaction of business&nbsp; in and&nbsp; to enforce the law for said bureaus.<br><br>Were we to allow the Patent&nbsp; Office, in the absence of an express and clear provision of law giving the necessary sanction, to require lawyers to&nbsp; submit to&nbsp; and pass&nbsp; on examination prescribed by&nbsp; it before&nbsp; they are allowed to practice before said Patent&nbsp; Office, then there would&nbsp; be no reason why other bureaus specially the Bureaus&nbsp; of Internal Revenue and&nbsp; Customs, where the business in the same area are more or less complicated, such as the presentation of books&nbsp; of&nbsp; accounts, balance sheets,&nbsp; etc., assessments exemptions, depreciation, these as&nbsp; regards the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the classification of goods, imposition of customs duties,&nbsp; seizures,&nbsp; confiscation, etc.,&nbsp; as regards the Bureau of Customs, may&nbsp; not also&nbsp; require that any lawyer&nbsp; practising before&nbsp; them or otherwise transacting business with them on behalf of clients, shall first&nbsp; pass an examination to qualify.<br><br>In conclusion, we hold that under the present law, members of the Philippine Bar authorized&nbsp; by this Tribunal to practice law, and in good standing, may practice their profession before the Patent Office, for the reason that much of the business in said office involves the interpretation and determination&nbsp; of the scope and application&nbsp; of the Patent Law and other laws applicable, as well as the presentation of evidence to establish facts involved; that part of the functions of the Patent Director are judicial or quasi-judicial,&nbsp; so&nbsp; much so that appeals from his orders and decisions are, under the law, taken to the Supreme Court.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> In re; Albino Cunanan, 50 Off.
