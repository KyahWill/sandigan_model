				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF  THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  VIRGILIO DIVINAGRACIA,  DEFENDANT AND  APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Virgilio Divinagracia was accused of murder before the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Iloilo and having been&nbsp; found guilty&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced to suffer<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion perpetua</span>, with the accessory penalties of the law, to&nbsp; indemnify the heirs of the&nbsp; deceased in&nbsp; the amount of P4,000, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; He appealed from this decision.<br><br>In the&nbsp; evening of&nbsp; December 5, 1953,&nbsp; at about 7:00 o'clock, Ernesto Cartel went&nbsp; to&nbsp; buy bread in a&nbsp; store situated in barrio Malitbog,&nbsp; municipality of Calinog,&nbsp; province of Iloilo, which was&nbsp; ten meters away from his house.&nbsp; On his&nbsp; way&nbsp; home,&nbsp; he met Virgilio&nbsp; Divinagracia who was then armed with a carbine and was accompanied by a man&nbsp; whom Cartel did not recognize.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; Cartel arrived in his house, he gave the bread to his child and went to the balcony&nbsp; from&nbsp; where he&nbsp; saw&nbsp; Divinagracia going&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp; neighboring house of Marina Gicole.&nbsp; Not long thereafter,&nbsp; Cartel&nbsp; saw&nbsp; Divinagracia&nbsp; and his companion go&nbsp; to one side of Gicole's house and after a while he&nbsp; also&nbsp; saw&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; Combong,&nbsp; a municipal&nbsp; policeman, walking on the&nbsp; road in front of the same house.&nbsp; While Santos Combong&nbsp; was exactly in front&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; house, Divinagracia,&nbsp; who was hiding behind a&nbsp; fence,&nbsp; fired&nbsp; at Santos, who, after being hit, fell to the ground.&nbsp; He died instantly.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, Divinagracia and his companion ran away passing by the house of Leonardo Caro situated nearby.<br><br>At this&nbsp; juncture,&nbsp; Cartel, who saw the firing from&nbsp; the balcony of his house, betook himself to the house of Caro to&nbsp; inquire if&nbsp; he heard the firing of the shot and Caro answered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative.&nbsp; Caro&nbsp; further&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that Divinagracia and his companion passed by his house in a hurry.&nbsp; Because at that time armed men known as dissidents were roaming the vicinity threatening and terrorizing the residents,&nbsp; Cartel and&nbsp; Caro, out of fear, refrained from reporting to the authorities the bloody&nbsp; incident.<br><br>The next morning, Domingo Cachuela, a local policeman, went to the place&nbsp; to&nbsp; investigate&nbsp; the shooting&nbsp; of&nbsp; Santos Combong.&nbsp; He found his dead body sprawled&nbsp; on the road about ten meters distant from the house of Marina Gicole. He also found an empty carbine&nbsp; shell somewhere&nbsp; on the ground.&nbsp; He&nbsp; and&nbsp; Justino&nbsp; Lanaria, a&nbsp; sanitary inspector who accompanied&nbsp; the policeman, examined the body of the victim and found&nbsp; that it had&nbsp; one bullet wound on the breast which ran&nbsp; through his body and came out at the back.&nbsp; After&nbsp; being satisfied&nbsp; that Combong died as a result of the wound, they asked the family of the deceased to take the body to their house and give it burial.&nbsp; Cachuela investigated&nbsp; Marina Gicole&nbsp; and&nbsp; Leonardo Caro but because&nbsp; they&nbsp; were then&nbsp; under the influence of&nbsp; fear&nbsp; they professed ignorance of how the shooting took place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cachuela nonetheless&nbsp; made a sketch of his findings indicating therein the position of&nbsp; the&nbsp; body of&nbsp; the&nbsp; victim in relation to the road and the ^houses of Gicole, Cartel and Combong.<br><br>The police force of Calinog continued to investigate the death&nbsp; of Combong but the people in the vicinity refused to give any further information about his death.&nbsp; Sometime&nbsp; in May, 1955, however, Divinagracia was arrested and confined in jail for robbery in band committed in the nearby province&nbsp; of Capiz.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; Ernesto&nbsp; Cartel and Leonardo Caro learned that Divinagracia was confined in jail in Capiz, they gathered courage and&nbsp; revealed for the first time&nbsp; to the&nbsp; chief of&nbsp; police of&nbsp; Calinog what&nbsp; they knew of the shooting of the&nbsp; deceased.&nbsp; Their statements were taken down in writing which culminated in the arrest and prosecution of&nbsp; Divinagracia.<br><br>The accused set up&nbsp; an alibi.&nbsp; He claims that in&nbsp; May,. 1952, he left barrio Malitbog and transferred his residence to Bacolod&nbsp; City where he engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; occupation ol selling fish; that in December,&nbsp; 1953, when the shooting occurred,&nbsp; he was in said city living in the house of one Casiano Geron; that in&nbsp; May, 1954, he&nbsp; left Bacolod City and went to live again in&nbsp; Calinog;&nbsp; that sometime in 1955 he was accused of&nbsp; robbery in band&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Capiz, and as&nbsp; a consequence he was lodged in jail&nbsp; in Capiz; that on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1955, he was released from jail and returned&nbsp; to barrio Malitbog which. was the natal place of&nbsp; his wife; that he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not know that Combong had died and it was only on June 8, 1955&nbsp; when he&nbsp; was arrested that he came to&nbsp; know of his death.<br><br>There is enough evidence to show&nbsp; that Santos Combong died&nbsp; as a result of a bullet&nbsp; wound he sustained in the evening of December 5, 1953&nbsp; caused by a shot fired at him by&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; The shooting&nbsp; was witnessed by Ernesto Cartel who actually saw from his balcony how&nbsp; appellant,. who&nbsp; was&nbsp; then hiding&nbsp; behind&nbsp; a&nbsp; fence, fired at his&nbsp; victim with a carbine and who thereafter ran away, accompanied by&nbsp; a companion whom Cartel did not&nbsp; recognize, passing by&nbsp; the house of Leonardo Caro.&nbsp; Cartel could not have been mistaken in his&nbsp; identification&nbsp; of&nbsp; appellant because he&nbsp; met the latter a moment&nbsp; before and&nbsp; even&nbsp; asked him where he was going.&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp; Caro did not actually witness the shooting, he however heard the firing&nbsp; of a shot and immediately thereafter saw appellant passed by his&nbsp; house in&nbsp; a hurry.&nbsp; The testimony of Caro can therefore be considered as corroborative of that of Cartel.&nbsp; The evidence also&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; Cartel&nbsp; had&nbsp; known&nbsp; appellant for a long time previous to the&nbsp; incident since during the Japanese occupation both had resided in barrio Malitbog.&nbsp; The testimony of&nbsp; Cartel&nbsp; finds&nbsp; further corroboration ten meters away from that of Marina Gicole in front of&nbsp; which the shooting&nbsp; occured and&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; nothing that&nbsp; could obstruct his view from the balcony of his&nbsp; house to the place where the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; fired the&nbsp; shot.&nbsp; Caro, on the other hand,&nbsp; testified that minutes&nbsp; before he heard the firing of&nbsp; a carbine,&nbsp; he saw&nbsp; appellant, his face covered by a handkerchief, carrying&nbsp; a carbine, and&nbsp; immediately thereafter,&nbsp; appellant and his companion ran away and passed near his&nbsp; house.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that Cartel&nbsp; and Caro&nbsp; were nephews of the victim,&nbsp; but such relationship&nbsp; alone cannot discredit&nbsp; their testimony if they are&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; credible, and here the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; found them to be worthy of credence.<br><br>The rule&nbsp; is well-settled&nbsp; that an&nbsp; <i>alibi</i>&nbsp; cannot prosper unless clear and satisfactory&nbsp; evidence is presented that the accused was present at some other place at&nbsp; the time the crime&nbsp; was allegedly committed and&nbsp; that from that place it was physically&nbsp; impossible for him to&nbsp; have been at the place where the crime was committed either before or&nbsp; after the time he was at such other place&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Oxiles, 29&nbsp; Phil., 587; People <i>vs.</i> Palamos, 49 Phil., 601). Much less&nbsp; can&nbsp; it prevail&nbsp; when there is clear&nbsp; evidence regarding the identification of the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Masani,&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-3973,&nbsp; Sept.&nbsp; 18, 1952; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Binsol, 100 Phil., 713; People <i>vs.</i> Umali, G. R.&nbsp; Nos. L-886670, January 23, 1957; People <i>vs.</i> Villaroya, 101 Phil., 1061; People V8&gt; Alcaraz, 103 Phil., 533.)&nbsp;&nbsp; As already said, there is&nbsp; enough&nbsp; evidence identifying appellant&nbsp; as&nbsp; the one who feed the shot that snuffed out the life of the deceased.<br><br>We wish to commend the&nbsp; efforts made by counsel <i>de oficio</i> in pointing out flaws in the evidence for the prosecution in an effort to get appellant's acquittal,&nbsp; but such efforts notwithstanding, we&nbsp; are persuaded&nbsp; to affirm his conviction&nbsp; because&nbsp; the laws,&nbsp; if any,&nbsp; are not convincing enough&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify a contrary&nbsp; conclusion.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; his claim that the witnessess for the prosecution, Cartel and Caro, should not be given credence because they waited for about one year and a half to report to the authorities what they allegedly know of the&nbsp; shooting,&nbsp; appears sufficiently explained in the brief&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Solicitor General.&nbsp; We quote: "Cartel and Caro, however, successfully explained the reason of their silence for&nbsp; more than&nbsp; a&nbsp; year.&nbsp; According to them, they did not reveal earlier than May, 1955, the identity of the appellant as the murderer, because at the time that Combong was murdered, the&nbsp; appellant and his companions used to&nbsp; roam around the barrios; and&nbsp; with impunity, terrorized the residents&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; barrios&nbsp; who cowered with fear * *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; The temerity with which&nbsp; appellant and his companions committed crimes here and there is demonstrated by the fact that even the deceased, Santos Combong, who was then a town policeman, was killed by appellant and his companions * *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; If a then policeman could&nbsp; be killed by&nbsp; these&nbsp; dissidents, a few&nbsp; meters&nbsp; away from&nbsp; the house of the policeman&nbsp; * * *,&nbsp; it is not hard to imagined&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of fear that Ernesto Cartel and Leonardo Caro, both of whom were simple-minded&nbsp; residents of the barrio, had entertained towards the appellant who in open&nbsp; defiance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; law, had been carrying a carbine&nbsp; around the&nbsp; barrio."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See People <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Umali, G. R. Nos. L-8866-70, January&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1957).<br><br>We&nbsp; take&nbsp; note of counsel <i>de oficio's</i> claim that there is no proof of the motive that may have impelled appellant to commit the crime, but such proof is&nbsp; not indispensable if his guilt or participation is otherwise established by sufficient&nbsp; evidence as in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Mc Mann) 4 Phil., 561; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Carlos,&nbsp; 15&nbsp; Phil., 47;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Javier, G. R. No. L-7841, Dec. 14,&nbsp; 1956; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Bugagao, G. R. No. L-11328, April 16, 1958).<br><br>The decision appealed&nbsp; from being in accordance&nbsp; with law and the evidence,&nbsp; the same&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes A,, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
