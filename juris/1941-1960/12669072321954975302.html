				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Juan Palacios executed his last will&nbsp; and&nbsp; testament on June&nbsp; 25, 1946 and&nbsp; availing himself&nbsp; of the&nbsp; provisions of the new Civil Code, he filed on May 23, 1956 before the Court of First Instance of Batangas a petition for its approval.&nbsp; In said will, he instituted as his sole heirs his&nbsp; natural children Antonio C. Palacios and Andrea C. Palacios.<br><br>On June 21, 1956, Maria Catimbang filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; opposition to the probate of the will alleging that she is the acknowledged natural daughter of petitioner but that she was completely ignored in said will thus impairing her legitime.<br><br>After the presentation of petitioner's evidence relative to the&nbsp; essential&nbsp; requisites and formalities provided by law for the validity of a will, the court on July 6, 1956 issued an order admitting the will&nbsp; to probate.&nbsp; The court, however, set a date for the hearing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opposition relative to&nbsp; the intrinsic&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of the will&nbsp; and,&nbsp; after proper hearing concerning this incident,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; issued another order&nbsp; declaring oppositor&nbsp; to be the natural child of petitioner and annulling the will insofar as it impairs her legitime, with costs against petitioner.<br><br>From this last order, petitioner&nbsp; gave notice of&nbsp; his intention&nbsp; to appeal&nbsp; directly to&nbsp; the Supreme Court, and accordingly, the record&nbsp; was elevated&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court.<br><br>It should be noted that petitioner instituted the present proceeding in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; of&nbsp; his will availing himself of the provisions&nbsp; of Article 838, para graph 2, of the new Civil Code, which permit a testator to petition the proper&nbsp; court during his lifetime for the allowance of his&nbsp; will, but to such petition one Maria Catimbang filed an opposition alleging that she&nbsp; is the acknowledged&nbsp; natural daughter of petitioner but that she was completely ignored in the will thus&nbsp; impairing her legitime.&nbsp; In other words, Maria Catimbang does not object to the probate of the will insofar as its due execution is concerned or on the ground that it has not complied with&nbsp; the formalities prescribed by law; rather she objects to&nbsp; its&nbsp; intrinsic validity or to the legality&nbsp; of the provisions of the will.<br><br>We hold that such opposition cannot be&nbsp; entertained in this proceeding because its only purpose is merely to determine&nbsp;&nbsp; if the will&nbsp; has&nbsp; been executed&nbsp; in accordance with the requirements of the law, much less if&nbsp; the purpose of the opposition is to show that the oppositor&nbsp; is&nbsp; an acknowledged natural child&nbsp; who allegedly has been ignored in the will for&nbsp; such&nbsp; issue cannot be raised here but in a separate action.&nbsp; This is especially so when the testator, as in the present case,&nbsp; is still alive and has merely&nbsp; filed a petition for the allowance of his will leaving the&nbsp; effects thereof after his death.<br><br>This is in line with our ruling in Monta√±ano<i>vs.</i> Suesa, 14&nbsp; Phil., 676,&nbsp; wherein&nbsp; we said: "The authentication of the will decides no&nbsp; other questions than such as touch upon the capacity of the testator and the compliance with those requisites or solemnities which the law&nbsp; prescribes for the validity of a will.&nbsp; It does not determine nor even by implication prejudge the validity or efficiency of the provisions; that may be impugned as being vicious or null, notwithstanding its authentication.&nbsp; The questions relating to these points remain entirely unaffected, and may be raised even after the will has been authenticated."<br><br>On the other hand, "after a will has been probated during the lifetime of a testator it does, not necessarily mean that he cannot alter or revoke the same before his death.&nbsp; Should he, make&nbsp; a new will, it would also be allowable on his petition, and if he should die before he has had a chance, to present such petition, the ordinary probate proceedings after the testator's&nbsp; death would be in order" (Report of the Code Commission, pp. 53-54).<br>The reason for this comment is that the&nbsp; rights to the succession are transmitted from the moment of the death of the decedent (Article 777, new&nbsp; Civil Code).<br><br>It is clear that the trial court&nbsp; erred in entertaining the opposition and in annulling the portion of the will which allegedly impairs the legitime of the oppositor on the ground that, as&nbsp; it has found, she is an acknowledged natural daughter of the&nbsp; testator.&nbsp; This is an extraneous matter which should be threshed out in a separate action.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and<i> Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
