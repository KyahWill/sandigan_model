				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Hilario Asondido&nbsp; was an&nbsp; emergency laborer employed in the Division of Ports and Harbors of the Bureau of Public Works&nbsp; from May 22, 1950,&nbsp; to December 31, 1952, and put to work&nbsp; on various assignments mixing cement, cleaning the pier deck&nbsp; and operating the jack-hammer, a hand-operated machine run by compressed air, used for boring holes in concrete&nbsp; pavements.&nbsp; It appears on record that on December 31, 1952, he coughed blood and a subsequent examination by a doctor of the Philippine-American Life Insurance Co. diagnosed his ailment as&nbsp; "active&nbsp; pulmonary tuberculosis affecting the 1st,&nbsp; 2nd and&nbsp; 3rd interspace of left lung", although previous&nbsp; to that occasion, or on October 12, 1952, a physical examination preparatory to being insured&nbsp; was conducted by a&nbsp; physician&nbsp; of the same Insurance&nbsp; Company&nbsp; who&nbsp; found him negative&nbsp; of&nbsp; said disease.&nbsp; Hilario&nbsp; Asendido filed&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 3, 1958, his resignation with&nbsp; the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Works, and went to Pila, Laguna, undergoing treatment at&nbsp; the Laguna Chest &amp; Tuberculosis Demonstration&nbsp; Center where&nbsp; his condition was diagnosed as far&nbsp; advanced tuberculosis on February 2, 1953.<br><br>It is not&nbsp; clear&nbsp; from the evidence when Asendido filed his claim against the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Works, but there was such a&nbsp; claim filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission as a result of&nbsp; which hearings were conducted by&nbsp; Referee&nbsp; Priscila&nbsp; Argonza&nbsp;&nbsp; Medina&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Office. Throughout the proceedings, the Bureau&nbsp; of Public Works&nbsp; was represented by an attorney of the&nbsp; Legal Division of said Bureau. <br><br>On February 14,&nbsp; 1955, Referee Argonza Medina rendered decision finding that the claimant Hilario Asendido might have had incipient tuberculosis at the time he first entered employment,&nbsp; but in such stage yet as to escape&nbsp; detection even by a physician.&nbsp; It went on further to say&nbsp; that&nbsp; this ailment must have&nbsp; been aggravated by&nbsp; the nature of his work, that is, the continuous operation of the jackhammer in the month of December, 1952, resulting in the appearance of blood&nbsp; in his&nbsp; coughings, and declared that&nbsp; such was compensable under section 2 of Act&nbsp; 3428, as amended. Hence,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Bureau of&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Works was&nbsp; ordered:<br><blockquote><ol><li>&nbsp;To&nbsp; pay the claimant Hilario Asendido,&nbsp; thru this Commission the sum&nbsp; of One Thousand Six Hundred Twelve Pesos and 80/100 (P1,612.80) in lump sum. with no discount, as compensation corresponding&nbsp; to the period "from January 1, 1953, up to February 28, 1955, and Fourteen Pesos and&nbsp; Forty Centavos&nbsp; (P14.40) weekly thereafter until the&nbsp;&nbsp; pulmonary tuberculosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; is declared&nbsp; arrested and&nbsp; he can normally resume his&nbsp; former&nbsp; work or until&nbsp; the maximum&nbsp; compensation of P4,000.) is fully paid; <br><br></li><li> To&nbsp; reimburse the claimant of the amount of One Hundred Ninety Five Pesos and 10/000 (195.10) as medical expenses, and to pay for&nbsp; the medical and hospital&nbsp; expenses to be incurred in the future by the claimant as a result of his illness; and <br><br></li><li> To pay into the Workmen's Compensation Fund the amount of P17.00 as costs and the amount of P1.00 for&nbsp; every P100.00 to be paid as&nbsp; compensation, pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; section&nbsp; P5 of Act 3428, as amended".</li></ol></blockquote>A copy of&nbsp; said decision&nbsp; was received&nbsp; by the Bureau of Public Works on February 26, 1955,&nbsp; and&nbsp; was&nbsp; referred to the Director of Public Works on March 17, 1955,&nbsp; who forwarded the&nbsp; same to&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General for appeal or for such action&nbsp; as may be deemed appropriate on&nbsp; the matter.&nbsp; Pursuant thereto, the Solicitor&nbsp; General filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission on March&nbsp; 24, 1955, a&nbsp; petition for relief from&nbsp; the decision of Referee Priscila&nbsp; Argonza Medina, stating that under section 1661 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Solicitor General is&nbsp; the&nbsp; counsel for the Republic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines; that as the&nbsp; judgment to be enforced will cause a financial liability of the Government, the proper party in this case should&nbsp; have been the Republic of the Philippines,&nbsp; (section 53, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 772); that as&nbsp; such&nbsp; party to this suit, the Government&nbsp; should have been notified through the Solicitor General's&nbsp; Office; that although&nbsp; the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Works was represented during the&nbsp; hearings, said counsel had no authority under the law to represent the Director before any board, commission or court requiring the services&nbsp; of&nbsp; a lawyer;&nbsp; that&nbsp; is the Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines, the&nbsp; real party in&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; was not notified, it&nbsp; was&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of its day in court,&nbsp; and prayed that the decision of the referee be set aside and a new trial&nbsp; be held so as to give the&nbsp; proper party the opportunity to be&nbsp; heard&nbsp; and&nbsp; be duly represented&nbsp; by its legal counsel, and&nbsp; for such&nbsp; other&nbsp; relief&nbsp; as may&nbsp; be deemed proper and equitable. <br><br>It seems&nbsp; that this petition was denied&nbsp; and the Solicitor General filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Commission&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; to review the decision of Referee Medina.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May 31, 1955, an order was issued by said Referee&nbsp; denying the petition for review on&nbsp; the ground that the same was not sufficient in&nbsp; form and&nbsp; substance&nbsp; for failure to&nbsp; comply with&nbsp; the requirement of section&nbsp; 3&nbsp; of Rule&nbsp; 38 regarding the attachment of an affidavit of merit to the petition, at the same time maintaining that&nbsp; the Commission acquired jurisdiction over the person of the respondent and that said&nbsp; party was given its day in court, and in accordance with Section 49&nbsp; of Republic Act 773, the record of the case was elevated to&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner for review. As the&nbsp; Commissioner issued on October 12, 1955, an&nbsp; order affirming the judgment rendered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Referee in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; Hilario Asendido, the Solicitor General representing the&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines,&nbsp; brought the matter&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court and&nbsp; in this instance&nbsp; assails the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the respondent Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commissioner affirming the order of Referee Medina as devoid of basis in law and in fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order appealed from was based on the premise that the petition for review filed by therein petitioner, the&nbsp; Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; was defective and&nbsp; it is now the contention of the Solicitor General that affidavits of merits are not necessary where the Court ov body has no jurisdiction over the person of a party or of the subject matter.&nbsp; Herein petitioner further asserts that the&nbsp; claim being one involving financial liability of&nbsp; the Government, the proper party should&nbsp; have been the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines and as the latter was not notified, the proceedings&nbsp; held before Referee Medina&nbsp; were null and void in so far&nbsp; as the Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines is&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp; and order of respondent Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commissioner be declared erroneous and&nbsp; the case be set for new trial.<br><br>From the foregoing recital of facts, We can glean&nbsp; that the Solicitor General, in representation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the Republic of the Philippines, questions the jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; to&nbsp; adjudge the Bureau of Public Works liable and to require it to&nbsp; pay the claim of the&nbsp; laborer who had rendered&nbsp; services in said Bureau. It is the petitioner's consistent stand that the case, which necessarily&nbsp; involves a liability&nbsp; to the national&nbsp; funds, is an action&nbsp; against the Government and&nbsp; the proper party should have been the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; The main issue raised by this&nbsp; appeal is whether or not&nbsp; the Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines is an indispensable party in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; whether the order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; was issued in excess&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction. <br><br>The&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Public&nbsp; Works is an&nbsp; agency&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Executive branch, the appropriation&nbsp; for its&nbsp; operation and maintenance being provided for by the National Government.&nbsp; Although the various functions of said Bureau are executed under&nbsp; the direction of the Director, as contended by counsel for respondent&nbsp; claimant, it is obvious that said Director is subject to the control of the Department Head, who in turn falls under the supervision and control of the President.&nbsp; In contemplation of the Workmen's Compensation Act, this Bureau cannot be considered as the employer of&nbsp; those&nbsp; working thereunder,&nbsp; for&nbsp; it is merely a&nbsp; part of the machinery&nbsp; of the Government, the services&nbsp; or works rendered to said Office being&nbsp; designed for the&nbsp; good&nbsp; and welfare of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public the said&nbsp; Office&nbsp; not being in business but engaged in the performance of&nbsp; functions which .are the proper concern of the Government. <br><br>Moreover, in a recent ruling this Court&nbsp; held that cases involving&nbsp; financial liability that may be&nbsp; proved&nbsp; against the Government are actions against the Government&nbsp; (See Araneta et al. vs. Gatmaitan et al., <i>supra</i>, p.&nbsp; 328).. which strengthens petitioner's contention that the action at&nbsp; bar should have properly been&nbsp; brought&nbsp; against the Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; that the law intended the National Government to be liable for&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; arising under the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Act&nbsp; is&nbsp; clearly embodied in&nbsp; sections 3&nbsp; and 53 of Republic Act&nbsp; 722,&nbsp; amending Act&nbsp; No. 3428,&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; read as&nbsp; follows: <br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 3. APPLICABLE TO GOVERNMENT.—This Act shall also be applicable to&nbsp; mounted messengers in the service&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National Government and all its political subdivisions <i>and to&nbsp; the employees and laborers&nbsp; employed in public works and in the industrial concerns of the Government and to all other persons performing tnanual labor in the&nbsp; service of the National Government and its political subdivisions and&nbsp; instrumentalities ;</i><br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>Sec.&nbsp; 53. DEPOSITS OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO GUARANTEE PAYMENT&nbsp; OF&nbsp; COMPENSATION.—The&nbsp; National, provincial, and municipal <i>government</i>, as well as government-owned or controlled&nbsp; corporations employing&nbsp; laborers&nbsp; and&nbsp; employees comprised within&nbsp; the provisions of this&nbsp; Act, <i>shall deposit with the office of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner an amount to&nbsp; be determined by said Commissioner to guarantied payment of compensation</i>.&nbsp; The said deposits shall be received by the Commissioner&nbsp; and disbursed, thru the&nbsp; authority of the&nbsp; Commissioner or his&nbsp; deputy,&nbsp; as&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; payments to injured laborers of the government entities making the contribution or&nbsp; the&nbsp; laborers'&nbsp; dependents in cases of death whenever&nbsp; the&nbsp; said laborers or their&nbsp; dependents are entitled&nbsp; to compensation under the provisions of this Act. </blockquote>We&nbsp; already&nbsp; found&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; to&nbsp; pass&nbsp; upon&nbsp; this&nbsp; matter squarely in&nbsp; another case&nbsp; involving practically&nbsp; the same set of facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; In G. R.&nbsp; No. L-9252,&nbsp; Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines vs. Hernando et&nbsp; al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; July&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1956, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bautists&nbsp; Angelo, made "the following pronouncement:<br><blockquote>"While&nbsp; it is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Public&nbsp; Works&nbsp; or&nbsp; the Commissioner of Public Highways can be sued on matters covering their&nbsp; official functions or&nbsp; activities,&nbsp; the situation varies when it refers to a claim&nbsp; for&nbsp; death benefit or compensation, for, as already adverted to&nbsp; the proper party in interest is the national government because the money to be applied to the payment of the compensation belongs&nbsp; to it under section&nbsp; 53 of the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Act. This&nbsp; is the situation&nbsp; obtaining in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as&nbsp; it appeal's that the national government was not given its day in court, the decision of the referee cannot&nbsp; stand, since&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered in excess of jurisdiction. <br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></blockquote>On this&nbsp; score alone,&nbsp; the present appeal by the Government is&nbsp; clearly meritorious,&nbsp; but we desire to pass upon the&nbsp; question&nbsp; invoked&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondents,&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petition for&nbsp; relief&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Solicitor General&nbsp; to&nbsp; review&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; Referee Medina was defective&nbsp; for&nbsp; failure to comply&nbsp; with the requirements of section 3 of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 38 of the Rules of&nbsp; Court regarding&nbsp; submission of&nbsp; an affidavit of&nbsp; merit.&nbsp; Said section&nbsp; prescribes the&nbsp; following: <br><blockquote>Sec. 3.&nbsp; WHEN&nbsp; PETITION&nbsp; FILED; CONTENTS&nbsp;&nbsp; AND VERIFICATION.— A&nbsp; petition provided for in&nbsp; either&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; preceding sections of&nbsp; this rule must be verified filed within sixty&nbsp; days&nbsp; after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other proceedings to&nbsp; be set aside, and not more than six months&nbsp; after&nbsp; such judgment&nbsp; or order&nbsp; was entered, or such proceeding&nbsp; was taken; and must be accompanied with, affidavits showing the&nbsp; fraud, accident, mistake,&nbsp; or excusable negligence relied&nbsp; upon, and the facts constituting the&nbsp; petitioner's good and substantial&nbsp; cause of action&nbsp; or&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; as the case may be,&nbsp; which he may prove if his&nbsp; petition be granted. </blockquote>The requirement&nbsp; of&nbsp; this section&nbsp; is&nbsp; similar to that of section 2 of Rule 37 concerning motions for&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial, and although the rulings of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court advocate strict compliance&nbsp; "with the same, the view setting exceptions to the general rule was laid down in the cases of Coombs vs. Santos, 24 Phil. 451; McGrath vs. Del Rosario, 49 Phil. 330;&nbsp; and Gonzales&nbsp; vs. Francisco, 49 Phil.&nbsp; 747,&nbsp; cited in I Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 ed. p. 780. It was thus held&nbsp; that&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; accompany a motion to set aside judgment with an affidavit&nbsp; of merit is irreversible error&nbsp; "<i>except</i> where there was no jurisdiction over the defendant or of the subject matter&nbsp; of the action, where a judgment was taken by&nbsp; default&nbsp; before&nbsp; defendant's time to answer had expired, where&nbsp; it was&nbsp; entered by mistake, or was obtained by&nbsp; fraud, and other similar case".&nbsp; This seems to be a sound rule on the matter,&nbsp; for in a petition directly assailing the jurisdiction of the court, an affidavit of&nbsp; merit&nbsp; has&nbsp; no&nbsp; practical&nbsp; value.&nbsp;&nbsp; An affidavit of merit is one setting forth&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant has&nbsp; a meritorious defense&nbsp; (substantial and not&nbsp; technical)&nbsp; and&nbsp; stating the facts constituting&nbsp; the same (Black's Law Dictionary, 4th ed.,&nbsp; p. 80).&nbsp; An attack on the jurisdiction of the court is given such primary recognition&nbsp; in our&nbsp; jurisprudence that&nbsp; this defense can properly&nbsp; be raised&nbsp; for the first time&nbsp; even&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; Certainly, an&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; of&nbsp; merit which essentially deals with facts constituting petitioner's defense and/or&nbsp; basis of&nbsp; such&nbsp; defense has&nbsp; no place in&nbsp; a pleading that advances an&nbsp; argument that goes down to the very root&nbsp; of the proceedings. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision rendered in W.C.C. Case&nbsp; No. 2594 by Referee Priscila Argonza Medina dated February 14,&nbsp; 1955, and all other orders issued by her&nbsp; in connection therewith, as well as the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Com- missioner&nbsp; Cesareo&nbsp; de Leon of October 12, 1955,&nbsp; affirming the judgment rendered by said Referee, are&nbsp; set aside and respondent Commissioner&nbsp; is hereby ordered to set the case for new trial after&nbsp; giving notice&nbsp; to all parties concerned, so as to give herein petitioner, the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines, its day in&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pronouncement&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; so ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Conception,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
