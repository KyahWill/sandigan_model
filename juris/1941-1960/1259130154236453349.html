				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Upon the filing&nbsp; of the petition herein, praying for&nbsp; the reasons therein stated, that&nbsp; a writ of habeas corpus&nbsp; be issued, and that,&nbsp; after appropriate proceedings, the petitioner be discharged, upon the ground that he is illegally detained and deprived of his liberty, this Court issued a resolution, dated December 24, 1958, ordering respondent ¦Brig.&nbsp; Gen. Pelagio&nbsp; Cruz,&nbsp; Commanding General&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary,&nbsp; to file, within five (5)&nbsp; days from notice, an answer returnable to the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; In&nbsp; due&nbsp; course,&nbsp; thereafter,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1959,&nbsp; said&nbsp; court&nbsp; issued an order&nbsp; stating that the facts set forth in the&nbsp; petition—with the&nbsp; exception of the conclusion therein made, relative to the alleged illegality&nbsp; of petitioner's detention—had been substantially admitted&nbsp; in the answer of said respondent, who, however, assailed the jurisdiction of&nbsp; said Court of First Instance, under section&nbsp; 2, Rule 102 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court, to pass upon the issues in this case, namely:<br><blockquote>"May a&nbsp; person be arrested&nbsp; without warrant for an alleged violation of an&nbsp; Act which expressly&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that no prosecution thereunder shall be&nbsp; made unless a&nbsp; preliminary investigation has been conducted by the proper Court of First Instance? "When&nbsp; such&nbsp; person has been so arrested, is he&nbsp; entitled to be released during the&nbsp; time the preliminary investigation is being conducted?"<br><br>and directing, without passing upon the said&nbsp; question of jurisdiction, that&nbsp; the record of the&nbsp; case—including&nbsp; the transcript of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings had,&nbsp; during the&nbsp; hearing, and the memoranda&nbsp; of the parties—be forwarded to this Supreme Court for&nbsp; further&nbsp; proceedings.<br></blockquote>Section 2 of Rule&nbsp; 102 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">The writ of habeas corpus&nbsp; may&nbsp; be granted by&nbsp; the Supreme Court, or any member thereof,</span> on any day and at any time, or by the Court of Appeals&nbsp; or any&nbsp; member thereof&nbsp; in&nbsp; the instances authorized by law, and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">if so&nbsp; granted it shall be enforceable anywhere in the Philippines, and may be made returnable before&nbsp; the court or any member thereof, or before&nbsp; a Court of First Instance, or any judge thereof.</span>&nbsp; It may also be granted by a Court of First Instance,&nbsp; or&nbsp; a judge thereof, on any day&nbsp; and at any time, and returnable before&nbsp; himself,&nbsp; enforceable&nbsp; only&nbsp; within&nbsp; his&nbsp; judicial district."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Pursuant to this provision, the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of habeas&nbsp; corpus may be granted, either by an&nbsp; appellate&nbsp; court,&nbsp; or any member thereof, or by a court of first instance.&nbsp; If granted by the Supreme Court, or any&nbsp; member thereof,&nbsp; or by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; or&nbsp; any member&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; in the instances authorized&nbsp; law,&nbsp; "it&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">enforceable&nbsp; anywhere in the&nbsp; Philippines</span>, and&nbsp; may be&nbsp; made returnable before&nbsp; the court or&nbsp; any&nbsp; member thereof, or before&nbsp; a Court&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; judge thereof."&nbsp; If granted by a&nbsp; court of first instance&nbsp; or&nbsp; a judge thereof, it shall&nbsp; be "returnable&nbsp; before&nbsp; himself,&nbsp; enforceable only within his judicial district."<br><br>The case at bar falls under the first alternative, the writ of&nbsp; habeas corpus herein having&nbsp; been issued&nbsp; by this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conformably with the first sentence&nbsp; of said section 2, the&nbsp; writ was made returnable&nbsp; before the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent, however,&nbsp; maintains that the&nbsp; court&nbsp; of first instance alluded to&nbsp; in said section&nbsp; 2, is&nbsp; "the&nbsp; court of first&nbsp; instance&nbsp; within&nbsp; whose jurisdiction the petitioner is confined", under the theory, presumably, that the decision&nbsp; of such&nbsp; court would&nbsp; be "enforceable&nbsp; only, within&nbsp; his&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; district."&nbsp;&nbsp; This view is devoid&nbsp; of merit.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; borne&nbsp; out,&nbsp; neither by said section 2&nbsp; of the rules, nor by the language&nbsp; of the law&nbsp; pertinent&nbsp; thereto or the established&nbsp; practice thereon.<br><br>Although the last&nbsp; sentence of&nbsp; section 2 declares that the&nbsp; writ of habeas corpus&nbsp; granted by&nbsp; a&nbsp; court of first instance&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; enforceable&nbsp; only&nbsp; within&nbsp; his judicial district, this&nbsp; limitation is&nbsp; not in point,&nbsp; the writ in this case having been granted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; and, as provided in said section, "it shall&nbsp; be enforceable anywhere in the&nbsp; Philippines,"<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; apparent from&nbsp; sections&nbsp; 12&nbsp; to 15<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>of said Rule 102&nbsp; (which are&nbsp; quoted hereunder),&nbsp; that&nbsp; the court or judge to whom the writ&nbsp; is returned&nbsp; shall have the authority and the duty&nbsp; to inquire into the facts&nbsp; and the law pertinent to the legality or illegality of&nbsp; petitioner's detention&nbsp; and to order his discharge from confinement, should&nbsp; it appear satisfactorily "that he is&nbsp; unlawfully imprisoned or restrained."&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted, also, that the procedure set forth in the Rules of Court is in&nbsp; line with the provisions&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 654&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Commission,&nbsp; section 7 of which&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote>"In cases where an original petition for habeas corpus&nbsp; is&nbsp; filed in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court shall&nbsp; have the&nbsp; power either to decide on the face of the petition filed that&nbsp; no case has been made for&nbsp; the issuing of a writ,&nbsp; or&nbsp; should such a&nbsp; case appear by the allegations of the petition, to&nbsp; issue the writ and&nbsp; make the same returnable and&nbsp; direct the hearing,&nbsp; either before the Supreme Court as a whole, or any judge&nbsp; thereof, or any judge of a Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance."<br></blockquote>This section is&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn, substantially identical to section 81 of General Orders&nbsp; No. 59,&nbsp; quoted on the margin.<br><br>Respondent's&nbsp; pretense is,&nbsp; seemingly,&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the belief that the "writ of&nbsp; habeas&nbsp; corpus" mentioned&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 2 of&nbsp; Rule 102—which, if issued by a&nbsp; court&nbsp; of first&nbsp; instance&nbsp; or&nbsp; a judge thereof shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; "enforceable only&nbsp; within&nbsp; his judicial district"—is&nbsp; the same&nbsp; order&nbsp; of "discharge", referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; in section 15 of said rule.&nbsp; However, the writ alluded to in&nbsp; said section 2 is nothing but the&nbsp; one&nbsp; specifically described&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 6&nbsp; of Rule&nbsp; 102, reading:<br><blockquote>"In case of imprisonment or&nbsp; restraint&nbsp; by&nbsp; an officer, the writ shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; directed to&nbsp; him,&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall command&nbsp; him&nbsp; to&nbsp; have the body&nbsp; of&nbsp; the person&nbsp; restrained of his liberty before the court&nbsp; or judge designated in the writ at the time and place therein specified. In case of imprisonment or restraint by&nbsp; a person&nbsp; not&nbsp; an officer, the writ shall be directed&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; officer, and&nbsp; shall command him to take and have the body of&nbsp; the person&nbsp; restrained of&nbsp; his liberty before the court or judge designated in the writ at the time and place therein specified, and to&nbsp; summon the person&nbsp; by whom he is restrained then&nbsp; and&nbsp; there&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear before said&nbsp; court or judge to show&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause of the&nbsp; imprisonment or restraint."<br></blockquote>In other words, said writ&nbsp; of habeas corpus plays a role somewhat&nbsp; comparable to&nbsp; a&nbsp; summons, in&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; civil actions, in that, by service of said writ, the court acquires jurisdiction&nbsp; over&nbsp; the person&nbsp; of&nbsp; the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once authority over&nbsp; the latter has thus&nbsp; been&nbsp; established,&nbsp; the appellate&nbsp; court issuing the&nbsp; writ,&nbsp; or the court&nbsp; of&nbsp; first instance&nbsp; to which the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; has been made&nbsp; returnable— acting&nbsp; in&nbsp; place of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellate&nbsp; court—may render&nbsp; a decision,&nbsp; which—like other decisions of the Supreme court and of courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; first&nbsp; instance—may be enforced <span style="font-style: italic;">anywhere</span> in the Philippines.<br><br>In&nbsp; point of practice, when a writ&nbsp; of habeas corpus&nbsp; is, comformably&nbsp; to law,&nbsp; made&nbsp; returnable to a&nbsp; court&nbsp; other than&nbsp; that issuing&nbsp; the writ,&nbsp; the court to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the writ is returned or the judge&nbsp; thereof possesses full authority to examine&nbsp; all issues raised&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case and&nbsp; to settle&nbsp; the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the language&nbsp; of the American Jurisprudence:<br><blockquote>"After a return to a writ, the court or&nbsp; judge to whom&nbsp; the return is made must pass upon all questions of both law and fact and determine the&nbsp; ultimate question&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; prisoner&nbsp; is wrongfully restrained&nbsp; of his liberty.&nbsp; It is necessary for the&nbsp; court to determine the&nbsp; weight and credibility&nbsp; of the evidence where&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony is conflicting.<br><br>"* * * With further reference&nbsp; to habeas corpus proceedings in Federal courts, it is expressly provided by&nbsp; statute that the court or judge before whom the prisoner may&nbsp; be brought&nbsp; shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts of the case, by hearing&nbsp; the testimony and&nbsp; arguments,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereupon to <span style="font-style: italic;">dispose of the prisoner as&nbsp; law and justice may require."</span>&nbsp; (25 Am, Jur., p. 245; Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Accordingly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila may&nbsp; validly inquire into the legality of petitioner's restraint and issue such orders, in connection&nbsp; therewith, as may&nbsp; be proper, in&nbsp; the light of the&nbsp; facts proven and the law applicable thereto.<br><br>Would it not be advisable that the merits of the&nbsp; case be adjudicated here and now?&nbsp; It is the considered&nbsp; opinion of this Court that it&nbsp; would be best that this task be under taken by the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, inasmuch as:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; said&nbsp; court has&nbsp; already acquired jurisdiction thereon, owing to the writ made returnable, and returned, thereto,&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; said&nbsp; court has&nbsp; been&nbsp; conducting,&nbsp; and is still conducting, the preliminary investigation in Criminal&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 46410 thereof,&nbsp; against petitioner&nbsp; herein, which respondent invokes in justification&nbsp; for&nbsp; his (petitioner's)&nbsp; detention,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court is&nbsp; better situated,&nbsp; than we are,&nbsp; to&nbsp; ascertain&nbsp; the pertinent&nbsp; facts and to make a&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; appraisal&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>This should not be&nbsp; construed, in any manner whatsoever, as indicating that we sanction the indefinite detention of an individual, without either&nbsp; a warrant of arrest or an order of&nbsp; commitment, or&nbsp; that one charged with a violation of the Anti-Subversion&nbsp; Act&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 1700), penalized therein "by&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">prison mayor</span> to&nbsp; death", may be kept&nbsp; under custody,&nbsp; without said&nbsp; warrant of arrest or order of&nbsp; commitments, regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; the duration of the preliminary investigation conducted pursuant to the provisions of said Act.&nbsp; The&nbsp; importance of&nbsp; a warrant of arrest and/or said order of commitment; the effect, upon the legality or illegality of&nbsp; a&nbsp; detention&nbsp; without warrant, of the filing of a complaint or information after the&nbsp; expiration of the period fixed by law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the delivery&nbsp; of the detainee&nbsp; to&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; judicial&nbsp;&nbsp; authority (Art. 125, Revised Penal Code, as amended by Act No.&nbsp; 3940); the&nbsp; steps&nbsp; to&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; after&nbsp; said&nbsp; delivery; the&nbsp; purpose of a preliminary investigation; the period of time within which the&nbsp; same should be completed; and the alternatives that may&nbsp; be availed of when no&nbsp; warrant&nbsp; of arrest or order of commitment has been issued and the preliminary investigation&nbsp; is&nbsp; not seasonably&nbsp; undertaken&nbsp; or can&nbsp; not be finished promptly, have been thoroughly&nbsp; elucidated in the decisions of this Court in Lino <i>vs.</i> Fuguso (77 Phil., 933)&nbsp; and&nbsp; Sayo <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Chief of Police of Manila&nbsp; (80 Phil., 859), and&nbsp; in the resolution on&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration filed in the latter case,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it is not our&nbsp; intention in&nbsp; the present resolution&nbsp; to&nbsp; alter the&nbsp; view thus expressed&nbsp; in said cases.<br><br>Wherefore, let the record of the case at bar be remanded to&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; for appropriate action.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
