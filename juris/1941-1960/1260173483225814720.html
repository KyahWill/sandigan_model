				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing its complaint&nbsp; (civil No.&nbsp; 28561).&nbsp; The parties entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a stipulation&nbsp; of facts at the hearing of the case held on 15 February 1956, the terms of which are, as stated by the trial court, as follows:<br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; that on January 14, 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Carnation Company of San Francisco, California,&nbsp; U.S.A., shipped on board&nbsp; the steamship "Mangalore"&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant De La Rama Steamship&nbsp; Co., Inc. 1,000 cases of carnation milk, 600 cases of which are&nbsp; Tails 48 and 400 cases Baby 96, all marked "Tomas Grocery, 1006-PH, Manila"; that on&nbsp; February 5,&nbsp; 1955, the steamship "Mangalore"&nbsp; unloaded the cargo at Manila where defendant Delgado Brothers,&nbsp; Inc. handled the arrastre services; that on February 8, 1955, the said shipment was received from defendant Delgado Brothers, Inc.,&nbsp; short of&nbsp; 178 cases (105 cases Tails 48 and 73 cases Baby 96), the value of which is P2,884.49; and that on March 3, 1955, a formal claim was presented by the plaintiff&nbsp; against the defendant Delgado Brothers, Inc.&nbsp; In view of said stipulation of facts, the parties did not present anymore testimonial evidence&nbsp; but only presented documentary&nbsp; evidence.<br><br>The question for this Court to decide is: Who is responsible for the shortage.<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; trial court absolved the&nbsp; defendant De La Rama Steamship&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc. from liability&nbsp; because it had delivered&nbsp; the whole shipment of 1,000 cases&nbsp; of milk to the appellee, the operator authorized by the Bureau&nbsp; of Customs to handle the hauling service at the port of&nbsp; Manila. Pursuant to paragraph&nbsp; 12 of the bill of lading issued by the&nbsp; steamship company, "The responsibility of the Carrier in any&nbsp; capacity shall altogether cease and the goods shall be considered to be&nbsp; delivered and at their own risk and expense in every&nbsp; respect&nbsp; when taken&nbsp; into&nbsp;&nbsp; custody of customs or other authorities."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit A.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It also absolved the appellee&nbsp; from&nbsp; liability for&nbsp; failure of the appellant to file&nbsp; its claim for loss&nbsp; or non-delivery of goods within fifteen days from&nbsp; date&nbsp; of&nbsp; arrival of the goods pursuant to paragraph 15&nbsp; of the&nbsp; management&nbsp; contract entered into by the Bureau of&nbsp; Customs and the&nbsp; appellee on 21&nbsp; October 1950&nbsp; (Exhibit 7).<br><br>The&nbsp; appellant does not question the release&nbsp; from liability of&nbsp; the defendant De La Rama Steamship&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.<br><br>Section 13, Act No. 3002, as&nbsp; amended by&nbsp; Republic Act No. 140, authorizes the Bureau of Customs to enter into a contract&nbsp; with&nbsp; any&nbsp; person,&nbsp; association&nbsp; or&nbsp; corporation to receive, handle, take custody of and deliver merchandise to be loaded and unloaded at the port of Manila and other ports&nbsp; of entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 21 October&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau of Customs entered into a contract with the appellee appointing it&nbsp; sole&nbsp; manager of&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrastrte&nbsp; service&nbsp; at&nbsp; the port of Manila (Exhibit 7).&nbsp; Paragraph 15&nbsp; of the management contract, which is&nbsp; the focal point of decision&nbsp; in this case, provides in part:<br><blockquote>* * * in any event the contractor (the appellee) shall be relieved and released&nbsp; of any and&nbsp; all&nbsp; responsibility or&nbsp; liability&nbsp; for loss, damage, mis-delivery, and/or non-delivery of goods, unless suit in the&nbsp; court of proper jurisdiction is brought&nbsp; within a&nbsp; period of one (1)&nbsp; year from the date of the&nbsp; arrival&nbsp; of the goods, or from the date when the claim for the value of such goods has been&nbsp; rejected or denied by the contractor, provided that such claim shall have been filed with the contractor within fifteen&nbsp; (15) days from the date of the arrival of the goods.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; * (Exhibit 7-A.)<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; 8 February 1955 three deliveries were&nbsp; made (Exhibits 3, 4&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 5-Delgado)&nbsp; and on 10&nbsp; February the last delivery was made&nbsp; (Exhibit 6-Delgado)&nbsp; to the appellant of the 822&nbsp; cases of milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 3&nbsp; March 1955 the corresponding claim for&nbsp; shortage of 178 cases&nbsp; was filed with the appellee, or 21 days after the&nbsp; last delivery&nbsp; (Exhibits C &amp; 2-Delgado)<br><br>Among the conditions imposed by the enabling&nbsp; Act&nbsp; to be incorporated in the contract to&nbsp; be&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; by the Bureau&nbsp; of Customs with any person, association&nbsp; or corporation to receive, handle, take custody&nbsp; of,&nbsp; and&nbsp; deliver merchandise to be&nbsp; loaded&nbsp; and&nbsp; unloaded at&nbsp; the port&nbsp; of Manila and other ports of&nbsp; entry&nbsp; is "the prompt payment of all losses&nbsp; thereof, as may be agreed upon between the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs and&nbsp; the contractor,&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to the approval of&nbsp; the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance."&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision, therefore, in the management contract (Exhibit 7-A)&nbsp; that claims for losses should be filed with the contractor within 15 days from date of arrival of the goods before an action may be brought&nbsp; against it in&nbsp; court for recovery of the value of the losses, is in consonance with the provisions of the enabling Act,&nbsp; intended&nbsp; undoubtedly to afford the contractor&nbsp; the opportunity to check&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp; claims for losses which verification would be more difficult if a longer period of time be allowed to pass.<br><br>The appellant contends that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; not&nbsp; a party to the management contract entered into by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Customs and the appellee and that for that reason it could not be bound&nbsp; by&nbsp; such condition.&nbsp; It appears that&nbsp; the 822 cases of milk were withdrawn from the appellee by Protacio Villafuerte, a licensed&nbsp; customs broker (Exhibits&nbsp; 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6-Delgado). The notice of claim for loss filed with the appellee was signed&nbsp; by him for and in behalf of the appellant (Exhibits C &amp; 2-Delgado).&nbsp; In the&nbsp; permit&nbsp; to deliver imported goods dated 4 February&nbsp; 1955 issued by the&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Customs,&nbsp; the name of the same&nbsp; customs broker appears&nbsp; (Exhibit B).&nbsp; The gate passes issued by the appellee to bring the cargo out of&nbsp; the pier was in the name&nbsp; of the said customs broker (Exhibits 3,&nbsp; 4, 5 &amp; 6Delgado).&nbsp; The appellant has&nbsp; not repudiated its privity with the broker&nbsp; and&nbsp; has accepted the benefit of&nbsp; delivery of&nbsp; the 822&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of milk through&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Therefore, it is bound by the notice appearing on the back of the permit to&nbsp; deliver&nbsp; imported goods&nbsp; (Exhibit B)&nbsp; and&nbsp; on the&nbsp; gate passes (Exhibits 3, 4, &amp; 6-Delgado) that claims for losses must be "filed with the CONTRACTOR within fifteen (15) days from the date of the arrival of the goods" before the appellant could sue the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; in&nbsp; court for recovery&nbsp; of the value of the losses.&nbsp; As the trial court aptly observed the appellant cannot&nbsp; avail itself of the provisions of the management&nbsp; contract (Exhibits 7&nbsp; and 7-A), when its agent Protacio Villafuerte, a&nbsp; licensed customs&nbsp; broker, accepted delivery of the&nbsp; cargo, as shown by the permit to deliver imported goods&nbsp; (Exhibit B)&nbsp; and the gate passes In re: Petition by del Rosario-Francisco&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Garcia (Exhibits 3, 4,&nbsp; 5 and 6-Delgado), and&nbsp; at the&nbsp; same time deny being&nbsp; a party thereto when adverse to its interests. <br><br>Moreover, the appellant has not given any reason for&nbsp; the delay in filing its claim&nbsp; with the appellee.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; the appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
