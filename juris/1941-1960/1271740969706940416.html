				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 16, 1938, the appellant  and his wife (the deceased Inocencia Itok) went to the house of one Sotera Baroro for the purpose of asking the latter permission to extract  oil  from some of  her coconuts.  Having  been granted permission,  Inocencia Itok borrowed a bolo with which to husk the coconuts.   When the deceased saw that her husband was not doing anything to help her, she asked one Segundino Itok, son of Sotera Barorp, to assist her in husking the coconuts;  whereupon the  appellant told the deceased to give him the bolo as he  would do the husking himself.  On receiving  the  bolo, the appellant turned  on his wife and started hacking her, as a result of which she was wounded in several parts of her body.  The  appellant was consequently indicted for the crime of serious physical injuries, to which he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to suffer a  penalty of seven  months  and one  day.   While appellant was serving this sentence, Inocencia Itok died of meningitis which was caused by the infection of the wound on her forehead inflicted  by the appellant; whereupon  he was indicted in the Court  of First Instance  of Oriental Negros  for  the crime  of parricide.  To this  charge the appellant interposed the plea of double jeopardy, but the lower court  found him guilty of the crime as charged and sentenced him to an  indeterminate  sentence of six years and one day of prision mayor to twelve years and one day of reclusion temporal, with the accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of ¥2,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of in- solvency, and to pay the costs.  Hence, this appeal.<br><br>The question here presented is:  May the defendant who had previously been convicted of serious  physical injuries be subsequently prosecuted for parricide involving the same assault charged and proven in the first prosecution, in view of the provision of section 9, Rule 113 of our Rules, here- inbelow quoted?<br><br>We are not unmindful  of  the rule laid down in  several cases that the protection against a second jeopardy is only for the  same offense, not for the same act.   (People  vs. Espino, G. R. No. 46123, Jan. 30, 1940; People vs. Cabrera, 43 Phil., 82; U. S. vs. Vitog, 37 Phil., 42; Gavieres vs. U. S., 220 U.  S., 338, 55  L.  ed., 489; 41 Phil.,  961; Kepner vs. U. S., 195 U. S., 100; U. S. vs. Capurro, 7 Phil., 24; U. S. vs. Ching Po, 23 Phil., 578.)   There is, however, cdnsiderable discordance in the cases in determining the test as to when two  offenses are substantially the same.  One test  is to ascertain whether the facts alleged in the second informa- tion would, if given in evidence, have warranted a conviction on the first, and  if this is the case, then the offenses are assumed to be identical.   (U. S. vs. Ching Po, supra;  U. S. vs. Lim Tigdien,  30 Phil., 222;  Gavieres vs. U. S., supra; People vs. Cabrera, supra; People  vs. Alvarez, 45 Phil., 472; People vs. Martinez, 55  Phil., 6;  People vs. Defoor, 100 Cal., 150; State vs. Price, 127 Iowa,  301; Newton vs. Commonwealth, 198 Ky., 707; Moore vs. State, 59 Miss., 25; Nochderffer vs. State,  34 Okla. Cr., 215.)   In other cases, the plea of former conviction or acquittal is sufficient if the proof shows the second case to be the same transaction as the first.   (Roberts  v. State,  14 Ga. 8; Burnam v. State, 2 Ga. App., 395;  Newton v. Commonwealth, 198 Ky. 707; State v. Mowser,  92 N. J.  L.,  474; Love v. State, 41 Okla. Cr., 291; Smith v. State, 159 Tenn., 674.)   Another test is to inquire whether the two offenses are in substance precisely the same or of the same nature or of the same species, so that the evidence which proves the one would prove the other; or if this is not the case, then the one crime must be an ingredient of the other.  (People vs. Alvarez, 45 Phil., 472,  478; U. S. vs. Gustilo, 19 Phil., 208; U. S. vs. Capurro, 7 Phil.,  24; Grey v.  U.  S., 172 Fed., 101; Wilcox v. U. S., 161 Fed., 109.)<br><br>Other negative  tests have  also  been laid down;  viz.: (1) A single act may  be an offense against two statutes, and  if each statute requires  proof of  an additional  fact which the other does not, an acquittal or  conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecu- tion  or  conviction under  the  other.  (Gavieres v.  United States, 220 U." S.,  338; Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass., 433; State v. Hooker, 145 N. C., 581; People v. Alvarez, supra.)   (2) If the evidence required to convict under the first indictment would not be sufficient to convict under the second indictment, but proof of an additional fact would be necessary to constitute  the offense charged in the second, the former conviction or acquittal is not a bar.  (Blair v. State, 81  Ga., 629; 7  S. E,. 855; State v. White, 123 Iowa, 425. 98 N. W.t 1027.) (3) Unless the two offenses charged are the same in  law and in fact,  they are  not the same offense.   (Ruble  v. State, 51 Ark., 170; Com.  v.  Rody, 12 Pick., 496, 503; State v. Kingsbury, 147 Wash., 426, 432.) In the case of Diaz vs. United States, (223 U. S., 432), it was held that a conviction upon an indictment for assault and  battery is not a  bar to  a subsequent prosecution for homicide, where  the  person  assaulted died of the injury inflicted.  In that case  the  Supreme Court of the United States  said:<br><br><blockquote>"The homicide  charged against the accused in the court of first instance and the assault and battery for which he was tried before the justice of the peace, although identical in some of their elements, were distinct offenses both in law and in  fact.   The death  of the injured person was the prin- cipal element of the homicide, but was no part of the assault and  battery.  At the time of the trial for the latter the death had not ensued, and not until it did ensue was the homicide committed.  Then, and not before, was it possible to  put  the accused in  jeopardy for that offense.  (Com. v. Roby, 12  Pick. Am. Rep., 335;  Johnson v. State, 19 Tex. App., 453; 53 Am. Rep., 385.)"<br></blockquote><br>At first glance, it would seem  that the aforecited case of Diaz vs. U.  S. furnishes a concrete basis upon which the solution to the question herein presented may be predicated. Here as in the Diaz case, the death of the victim had not ensued at the time proceedings  were had on the first information and the crime of parricide  for which the defendant was prosecuted on the second information was then not yet consummated.  But a further examination of the aforecited case reveals that jeopardy for the higher offense could not have attached for the reason that, unlike in the case at bar, the accused was tried for assault and battery in the justice of the peace court, which was without juris- diction to try him for homicide, and, of course, the jeopardy incident  to  the trial in that  court  did not  extend  to  an offense beyond its jurisdiction.<br><br>The principle in the above-cited case of Diaz  vs. United States, supra,  was applied  by this  court in the cases of United States vs. Ledesma and Bernad (29 Phil., 431), and People vs. Espino, G. R. No. 46123, promulgated January  30, 1940.  In both cases the defendants were previously con- victed in the justice of the peace  court of slight physical injuries and were later charged with grave physical injuries in the Court of First Instance.  In the case, however, of People vs. Martinez (55 Phil., 6), where the accused was first charged with lesiones menos graves in the Court of First Instance and later prosecuted  for lesiones graves in the same court, this  court upheld  the plea of autrefois convict or former jeopardy,  holding that "not only was the first case an ingredient of the second case but the  allegations in the second information would also, if proven, have been sufficient to  support the former information."<br><br>Upon  the other hand, the Rules  of  Court recently promulgated by this court and which took effect on July 1,1940, prescribe in section  9, Rule  113, thereof as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec.  9.  Former  conviction or  acquittal  or former jeo- pardy.—When a defendant shall  have been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated  without  the express consent  of the  defendant, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, and after the  defendant  had  pleaded to the charge,  the  conviction  or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for  any offense  which  necessarily  includes oi  is necessarily  included in the  offense charged  in  the former complaint or information."</blockquote><br>That is to say, under the New Rules, one offense shall be considered the same as the other not only when one  is identical to the other but also when one necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the other.   This section  9, Rule 113, is in lieu of sections 26,  27 and 28 of General Orders  No. 58.  It  will be noted that this section 9  is a composite of sections 26 and 28 of General Orders No. 58, with some modifications.  It will also be "noted that section 27 of General Orders No. 58 has been eliminated.<br><br>Section 26 of General Orders No. 58 was  the  main law on jeopardy prior to the promulgation of the Rules of Court. Section 27 merely provides for an exception to the general rule expressed in section 26 and contemplates a situation where jeopardy does not attach.  Section 28 is but another defense available to  the defendant similar to jeopardy.<br><br>Under the New Rules, the pleas available to a defendant under sections 26 and 28 of General Orders No. 58 are all considered as pleas of former jeopardy or former conviction or acquittal.  The important change,  however, lies in the wording of the last part of the New Rules (sec. 9, Rule 113) which was taken from  section  26, General Orders No. 58. The  original provision of section 26, General Orders No. 58, states:  "the conviction, acquittal, or  jeopardy shall  be  a bar  to another information or indictment for the offense charged, or for an  attempt to  commit the same,  or for a frustration  thereof,  or  for any offense necessarily therein included of tvhich he might have been convicted under such complaint or information."<br><br>To our mind, the principle embodied in the New Rules of Court is a clear  expression  of selection of rule amidst conflicting theories.   We take  the position that  when we amended section 26 of General Orders No.  58 by providing that the conviction  or  acquittal  of  the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for any offense not only necessarily therein included but which necessarily includes the offense charged in the former complaint or information, we meant what we have, in plain language, stated.  We  certainly did  not mean to engage in the simple play of words.  That we are correct in this assertion is borne by the fact that soon after we approved the Rules, doubt arose as to the wisdom of the amendment, and suggestion was  made to revert to the old rule but no agreement was reached.  If we made a mistake in changing the rule and we find it necessary or advisable to go back to the former rule, judicial candor demands that  we so state and recognize the error for the guidance of ourselves and of the  legal profession and  of all concerned.  While, indeed, there are weighty considerations for the reversion to the former doctrine, we are of  the opinion that there are no less weighty reasons for the maintenance of the present rule as contained in section 9 of Rule 113:<br><br><blockquote>(1) In the present case the defendant had  already been convicted of, and had more than begun to serve sentence for, the crime of lesiones graves.  This offense is necessarily included in the greater crime of parricide, and "as the government cannot begin with the highest, and then go down step by  step, bringing the  man into jeopardy for every dereliction  included  therein, neither can it begin with the lowest and ascend to the highest, with precisely the same result."  (People vs. Cox, 107 Mich., 435, 438.)<br><br>(2) The  injustice suffered which, it is  alleged,  would result from the  bar  of the subsequent prosecution for the greater offense, could, in our opinion, be remedied by requiring prosecuting attorneys not to take precipitated action in cases of this kind, but to use their best judgment in watch- ing for the development of the case, as after all there is no danger of prescription or this danger is too remote.   The administrative field here is as wide as its range is effective. To  our mind, there  is as much  injustice  in  subjecting a person to double prosecution with  all its concomitant  and consequent annoyance  and difficulties as there may be in barring a subsequent prosecution for the  greater offense. We admit  that  a criminal prosecution must necessarily entail difficulties, for if the prosecution is justified, the resultant affects must  either be tolerated or accepted.   But from a single prosecution to a double or repeated prosecution in a case arising from the same transaction, there must be some difference.  If and when the Government is  in a position to avoid or forestall unnecessary harrassment and humiliation—placed  in  having to select  between the two alternatives—we readily incline  to  shelter the individual and exact fairness and a higher degree of vigilance from the State.  There is no substantial  difference  in principle between this case and one where the Government elects to prosecute on the lower offense where it is in a position to elect between trying the defendant on the lower  or higher offense into which it may be divisible.  In the former, it is responsible  for the precipitated action; and in the  latter, the election is at its peril.  The result is the same. In both cases the Government must  assume the responsibility,  stop and ponder to improve upon its machinery of administration of criminal justice.<br><br>(3)  Conviction of the greater offense of parricide in this case means necessarily conviction of the constituent offense of lesiones graves.  To avoid injustice, the eventual absorption of  the penalty imposed in the former prosecution for the lesser offense is here suggested, so that the accused shall only serve  the sentence imposed for the greater offense in accordance  with the rule  laid  down in  the  Espino  case (People vs. Espino, G. R. No. 46123)  which was decided January 30,1940, before the Rules of Court went into effect. If this  rule of eventual absorption is applied in a case of subsequent conviction for the higher offense, it should also be applied in case of acquittal for the higher  offense for, certainly, acquittal for parricide means acquittal for lesiones graves produced by the same act or arising from the same transaction.  But, if the rule of eventual absorption is not possible in the latter case,  under what process  of logical reasoning may the rule of eventual  absorption be justified in the former case ?   Why should there be absorption in case of conviction and no such absorption in case of acquittal?<br><br>(4) An attempted or frustrated crime  is included in the consummated.  Both under  the General Orders No. 58 and the New Rules of Court, a  person convicted of a consummated offense may not be, for the same act, prosecuted for any attempt or frustration thereof.  If, after trial and conviction for an attempted or frustrated offense, there should supervene a consummated offense, we express the opinion that conviction or acquittal of the lesser offense is a bar to subsequent prosecution for the consummated offense. There is no distinction in principle between this case and the case at bar.<br><br>(5) Error or even possible  combination on the part of the prosecuting attorney in prosecuting for the lesser offense is of course possible; but, in our opinion, there is as much peril in one case as in the other.  The problem is to minimize the error or danger of combination.</blockquote><br>We must observe that we are not here concerned with a case where the lesser offense is included in  the  greater offense over which the inferior court had no jurisdiction. On this point the  Diaz case is not in point.   If the Diaz case may be invoked, it is on the principle that at the time of the prosecution for the lesser offense the greater offense had not  as yet been  consummated, and  that therefore the prosecution for the higher offense was  not barred by the prior  conviction for the  lesser  offense.  But  with  this principle  we were familiar at the time  we approved  the rule above referred to.  Nevertheless, we departed there-from.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court, herein appealed from, is accordingly reversed, and the information for parricide against the defendant-appellant,  Ponciano Tarok, hereby dismissed, with cost de oficio.   So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Abad Santos,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><br>Diaz, M., disidente:<br><br>Disiento, porque no creo que la regla 113 de los  Nuevos Reglamentos requiere una interpretacion tan  liberal como la que le  da la mayoria, que justifique  la declaracidn de que hay jeopardy donde no lo hay.<br><br>El apelante infiri6 varias lesiones a su  mujer dandole ta- jos en diferentes partes del cuerpo; y por haber creido el Fiscal que  ella sanaria de sus lesiones en  cuarenta dias, se apresuro a procesar a dicho apelante, por lesiones gra- ves  solamente.   Convicto,  poco despues,  el apelante,  del delito de lesiones graves de que fue acusado, por haberse confesado culpable de dicho delito, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Siquijor le impuso unicamente la pena de siete meses y un dia de prisi6n correcional.  Habiendo fallecido la ofendida de resultas de sus lesiones mientras el apelante se hallaba extinguiendo su condena en la carcel, el  Fiscal volvid a procesarle acusandole esta vez del delito de  parri- cidio.  Entonces,  interpuso la  defensa de jeopardy, y en esta instancia la  mayoria le da la razon.<br><br>La Comisidn de Filipinas que es la fuente de la mencio- nada regla 113 de los Nuevos Reglamentos contiene una disposicion que dice:<br><br><blockquote>"No se pondra a una persona en peligro de ser castigada (jeopardy)  dos veces por la misma infracci6n.  Si un acto estuviere penado por una ley general y una ordenanza, la condena o absolution bajo una acusaci6n u otra sera 6bice a otro procesamiento por el mismo acto."   (Titulo III, Art. 1, inciso 20, Constitucion de Filipinas.)</blockquote><br>Parece no haber duda  alguna por ser evidente, que le- siones graves y parricidio constituyen en si dos infraciones de ley, enteramente distintas una de otra, no solamente por razon de su propia naturaleza, sino tambien por las  penas con que cada una  de ellas es castigada por la ley.   Elemento esencial  del delito de  lesiones  graves es, que se  haya ca- usado  a otro,  alguna  herida o Iesi6n del  caracter  de las mencionadas en el articulo 263 del Codigo Penal Revisado. En el delito de parricidio, el elemento indispensable es la muerte de un c6nyuge, causada por  el otro. Este ultimo delito esta castigado con  una pena muy severa:  reclusi6n perpetua a muerte, mientras el de lesiones graves como el de que fu6 convicto anteriormente el apelante, lo esta solamente con arresto mayor en su grado maximo a prisidn correccional en su grado minimo.<br><br>Cuando el apelante  fue  procesado  por lesiones, no exis- tia aun ni era siquiera inminente  el parricidio de que mas tarde fue acusado.   La muerte de su esposa ocurrio mucho despues, estando ya preso en la carcel, extinguiendo su con- dena de prision correccional.  Este solo hecho no permite considerar existente  el delito  de parricidio cuando se le proceso por lesiones graves  y fue convicto y condenado a sufrir la pena ya indicada.<br><br>La referida regla 113 de los Nuevos Reglamentos dispone en verdad, en su articulo 9, que:<br><br><blockquote>"*   *  *  the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included  in the offense charged  in the former complaint or information."; pero, si el delito de parricidio incluye el de lesiones graves, de ningun modo puede decirse que el ultimo incluye el de parricidio.  Al adoptar el Tribunal la citada regla no tuvo el proposito de darle el alcance que la mayoria ahora le da; pues, bien sabia que no le estaba permitido legislar, declarando que no es punible un delito o que deja de serlo, aun- que lo sea claramente por expresa disposition de una ley sustantiva, cual es el Codigo Penal Revisado, solamente por apresuramientos impremeditados, impaciencias injustificadas o capricho del Fiscal, o por cualquier otro acto mas o menos irreflexivo o  imprudente de su parte.  Interpretar la regla en el sentido expresado en la opini6n de la mayoria, es sencillamente dar lugar a que no se castiguen como debieran castigarse, delitos manifiesta e inusitadamente graves.</blockquote><br>Tengo para  mi  que la regla  se  refiere  a casos en que pueden  inversamente considerarse dos delitos incluido el uno  en  el otro, vgr.  el de  falsificaci6n de un documento privado que incluye el de estafa mediante falsification de documento privado; el de rebeli6n  y  algunas formas de sedition; el de importaci6n ilegal de  drogas prohibidas y uso, o venta ilegal de las mismas; el de malversacion de pro- piedades publicas y  algunas  formas de exacci6n ilegal, si de lo cobrado ilegalmente se apropia el funcionario publico que lo haya cobrado; el de bandolerismo y  el de robo en cuadrilla; el de traicion y ciertas formas del delito de sostener correspondencia con pais enemigo, prohibido y penado en el articulo 120 del C6digo Penal Revisado; el de encu- brimiento del delito de f alsificacion de documentos piiblicos, oficiales o mercantiles y el uso de dichos documentos come- tido  con infraction del articulo 172 del mismo Codigo, etc. etc.<br><br>Asi lo da a entender por otra parte,  el articulo 5 de la regla 116 de los Reglamentos, que puede considerarse complementario del articulo 9 de la tantas veces mencionada regla 113, siendo dicho primer articulo del siguiente tenor:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 5. When an offense  includes or is included in an- other.—An offense charged necessarily includes that which is proved, when  some of the essential elements or ingre- dients of the former, as this is alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter.  And the offense charged is necessarily included in  the offense proved, when the es- sential ingredients of the  former constitute or form a part of those constituting the latter."</blockquote><br>El elemento esencial del delito de parricidio es, como ya se ha dicho, la muerte de un conyuge  causacla por el otro; y en el caso del apelante,  este hecho de la muerte no habia surgido aun  cuando fue procesado, convicto y condenado por sentencia firme, por lesiones graves, porque su mujer siguio viviendo hasta entonces y hasta varias semanas despues, no  habiendole sobrevenido la muerte sino  solamente el 29 de  noviembre de 1938, es decir, 26 dias despues de haberse dictado la sentencia que le condeno por lesiones graves.<br><br>Para conseguir una condena por parricidio, algo mas que las lesiones causadas a la victima y la naturaleza de las mismas debe probarse: debe probarse el  hecho  de su  muerte. En  materias de jeopardy,  para  que  el  mismo  exista, las pruebas deben  ser de tal naturaleza que  sirvan para sostener  con igual exito, cualquiera de los  dos procesos. (Pueblo contra Martinez,  55  Jur. Fil., 6.)  Esto no ocurre en el caso de autos porque las pruebas presentadas en el primer proceso no bastaban para demostrar la comision del delito de parricidio.<br><br>Para no tener que sufrir el apelante dos penas, por las lesiones que infirio a su mujer y por la muerte de esta de resultas de dichas lesiones, se debiera acreditarle la que ya se le impuso por lesiones graves, siguiendo k&gt;  mismo que se dijo en la causa de Pueblo contra Espino, R.G. No. 46123. Por las razones expuestas, voto por la imposition al apelante de la pena de reclusion perpetua, que es la pena prescrita para el delito de parricidio, segun el  articulo  246 en relacidn con la  regla 3." del articulo 63 del  C6digo Penal Revisado, pero sin perjuicio de acreditarle la pena que le fue impuesta en su proceso anterior por lesiones graves.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><br>Moran. <span style="font-style: italic;">J</span>., dissenting:<br><br>For  having hacked his wife with a bolo, the accused herein was charged with, and, upon plea  of guilty,  convicted of, the crime of serious physical  injuries.  While he was serving sentence, the victim died of the  same wounds inflicted upon her, and to the subsequent  indictment for parricide presented against him, he interposed the plea of double jeopardy which was overruled, and after trial, he was found guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>The  question  here  raised is: Upon the foregoing facts, may the defendant who had been  previously convicted of serious physical injuries be subsequently  prosecuted  for parricide involving the same assault charged and proved in the first prosecution?  The majority takes the position that even if the latter  offense of which he was  subsequently charged was non-existent at the time of his conviction for the former, as it necessarily includes the offense of which he was previously convicted, the case falls squarely  within the provision of the last part of Rule 113, section 9, of the Rules of Court,  and therefore the second prosecution will not lie.  I do do not share this view.<br><br>Rule  113 section  9, in part provides:<br><br><blockquote>"*   *  *  the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar  to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same  or  frustration thereof,  or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information."</blockquote><br>In  Diaz v. United States (223  U. S., 442), defendant therein after having been convicted of assault and battery was,  upon the subsequent  death  of the  victim,  prose- cuted again for homicide, and in overruling the plea of dou- ble jeopardy, the Federal Supreme Court held:<br><br><blockquote>"*   *   *   the provision against  double jeopardy in the Philippine Civil Government Act of July  1, 1902, 32 Stat. 691, c. 1969, sec. 5, is in terms restricted to instances where the second jeopardy is 'for  the same offense' as was the first.  Cavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338.   That was not the case  here.  The homicide charged against the accused in the  Court of First  Instance and the assault and battery for which he was tried before the justice of the peace, although identical in  some of their elements, were distinct offenses both in law and in  fact.  The death of the injured person was the principal element of the homicide, but was no part of the assault and battery.  At the time of the trial for the latter the  death had not ensued, and not until it did ensue was the homicide  committed.  Then, and not before, was it possible to put the accused in jeopardy for that offense.  Commonwealth v. Roby, 12 Pick. 496; SUde v. Littlefield, 70 Maine, 452; Johnson v. State, 19 Tex. App.  453."</blockquote><br>I see no reason why this  doctrine cannot be made con- trolling upon the instant case.  Here, as in the Diaz case, the parricide charged against the accused and the serious physical injuries of which he was previously convicted, although identical in some elements, were  distinct offenses both in law and in fact.  The supervening death of the of- fended party was the principal  element  of the parricide and was no part of the offense of serious physical injuries. Here, as in the Diaz case, at the time of the trial for serious physical injuries the death  of the victim had  not as yet ensued, and not until did it ensue was parricide committed.<br><br>Then, and not before, was it possible to place the accused in jeopardy for that offense.<br><br>We followed and applied that doctrine in United States vs. Ledesma and Bernad (29 Phil., 431), and People vs. Espino, G.  R. No. 46123, January 30, 1940.  In the latter case, the facts of which are  closely analogous to those of the instant one,  the Chief Justice, in concurring with the majority opinion, said: <br>"Estoy conforme con la decision so lamente porque al ser condenado el apelante por la primera vez no existia aun el delito por el que se le conden6 por segunda  vez."  And, as far as I know, that is the settled rule of American jurisprudence.   Thus,  in State v. Howe (27 Ore. 138, 44 Pac. 672, 673)  it was  held "that a conviction or acquittal upon one indictment is a bar to a sub- sequent prosecution upon another, when the facts  alleged in the second indictment would, if given in evidence, have warranted a conviction on the first"; but this rule "must be accepted with some qualification, and as only true in a general sense.   Thus, if, after a  conviction of assault and battery the  injury resulted in death, the defendant, it is said, may be prosecuted for manslaughter or murder, although, under the facts set out in the second indictment, he might have been  convicted of the crime charged in the first.   1 Bishop  New Criminal Law,  sec. 1059."   (See  also cases cited in  Diaz v.  United States, supra; 28 An. Cas. 1913C, 1138; 24 An. Cas. 1912C, 669-670; Peo. v. Defoor, 100 Cal. 150; Hopkins v.  U. S., 4 App. 430;  State v. Littlefield,  70 Me. 452, 35 Am. R, 355; Com. v. Cutler, 9 Allen  486; Com. v. Roby, 12 Pick. 496; Peo. v.  Warren, 109 N. Y. 615,  15 N. E. 880; Burns v. Peo., 1 Park. Cr. 182; State v. Ross, 4 Ch. S. &amp; C. P. 5,  2 Ch. NP. 368; Com. v. Mezzanotti, 219 Pc. 210, 68 A.  186; Com. v. Ramunno, 219 Pa. 204, 208, 68 A. 184; Com.  v. Neeley, 2 Chest.  Co. 191; McNulty v. State, 110 Tenn. 402, 75 S. W. 1015; Curtis v. State, 22 Tex.  A. 227, 3  S. W. 86 Johnson v. State, 19 Tex. A. 455; Winn v. State, 82 Wis. 576, 52 N. W. 775.)  An this is  said to  be a "well-recognized exception to the rule."   (16 C. J., 276.)<br><br>But  the  majority refuses  to recognize  the  controlling force of the Diaz decision on the instant case upon the ground—and this, as I see it, is the gist of the majority opinion—that while we were familiar with the doctrine of the Diaz case at the time of the adoption of the Rules, we nevertheless  departed therefrom.  The  alleged departure consists in the wording of the last part of Rule 113, section 9, supra, which recites by way of addition to those specified in section 26 of General Orders No. 58* from which it was taken, not only the offense which is necessarily included in, but also that which necessarily includes the offense charged in the former complaint or information.  And in this sense, the majority believes that the new rule represents "a clear expression of selection of rule amidst conflicting theories/' I see no such departure nor do I think the present rule to be a selection of rule amidst conflicting theories, because no such  conflicting theories ever existed at all before the adoption of the new  Rules of Court.<br><br>The principle of double jeopardy is, as  a matter of consti- tutional or statutory history, not of indigenous origin.  Regarded as a part of the universal law of reason, justice and conscience (16 C. J., 233), and as such quite impossible to trace to any  distinct origin, "it seems to have been always embedded in  the common law of England as well as in the Roman Law, and doubtless in every other system of juris- prudence, and, instead of having a specific origin, it simply always existed."  (Stout v. State, 36 01.  744, 756; 130 Pac. 553.)  It found, however, definite expression in the Constitution of the United States, and from there, it found its way into this country, first, in the Philippine Bill of 1902, then in the Jones  Law of 1916, and, finally in the present Philippine Constitution.  Being thus a mere recognition of the maxim of the common  law, and adopted from the Constitution of the United States, the principle of double jeopardy  followed in  this jurisdiction the same—no narrower or wider—line of development as in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.<br><br>It is true that under section 26 of General Orders No. 58, from which Rule 113, section 9, of the new Rules of Court, was taken, jeopardy may be pleaded only in cases of convic- tion and acquittal or for an attempt to commit the same offense, or for a frustration thereof, or for any offense nec- essarily included  therein; and no mention is made of  an offense which may necessarily include that with which  an accused has previously been charged.  But said section  26 of General Orders No. 58 was manifestly not expressive of the whole scope of the principle of double jeopardy as we know it in the established jurisprudence of  the  United States and, indeed, our own jurisprudence has not been canalized within the narrow limits of this statutory rule.  It is to cure this deficiency that we included in the new Rules, as among the cases where double jeopardy may be pleaded, the offense which necessarily includes  that for which  an accused has been previously indicted.  In other words,  by such inclusion, we merely give expression to a principle  already known and observed in our jurisdiction, and which section  26 of General  Orders No.  58 failed  to embody.<br><br>Thus, in 8 Ruling Case  Law, 146, we read:<br><br><blockquote>"Where a  person  is brought to trial and  jeopardy has attached he cannot be tried thereafter for a greater offense arising out of the same criminal act."  (See  a  long line of cases cited therein.)<br></blockquote><br>In 16 Corpus Juris, 271, we read:<br><br><blockquote>"One who is convicted of a crime less in degree than the offense for which he is indicted is by implication acquitted of the greater offense and may plead the acquittal as a bar to a subsequent indictment for it."   (See a long  line of cases  cited therein.)</blockquote><br>And in People v.  Cox  (107 Mich. 435,  438), the court observed:<br><br><blockquote>"*   *  *  as the  Government cannot begin with the highest, and then go down step by step, bringing the man into jeopardy for every dereliction included therein, neither can it begin with the lowest and ascend to the highest with precisely the same result."</blockquote><br>We cited this case with approval in United vs. Lim Suco (11 Phil., 484), we applied the principle in United States vs. Ledesma (29 Phil., 431), and we recognized it in People vs. Martinez (55 Phil., 6, 10).<br><br>Notwithstanding, therefore, the omission in section 26 ot General Orders  No.  58 of an offense which necessarily includes that of which an acused has previously been  indicted, we had always regarded it as a case embraced within  the scope of double jeopardy.   In thus including this matter in the new Rules, we only give expression to what is already established  and uniformly observed in this jurisdiction. Rule 113, section 9,  furnishes, therefore, no new  formula, adds nothing to, and takes nothing from, the time-onored principle of  double  jeopardy.  It merely  reiterates, in a clear and concise way, the existing statutory rule and  the established jurisprudence thereon.  To say that the present rule is a departure from the old rule and a selection "amidst conflicting theories" is to misconceive and misstate the legal history of the principle.<br><br>In the majority opinion  mention is made  as to an  attempt to amend Rule 113, section 9, and to revert to  the old rule.  The fact is that sometime in  May, 1940, it  was suggested that the well-recognized exception to the rule of double jeopardy as enunciated in the Diaz decision, be embodied, for  the  sake of completeness and  clarity,  in Rule 113, section 9; but some members of this court entertained doubts as to the inclusion, and there being no quorum then, the matter  was left unconsidered.  It never  occurred to this court, however, to abandon the doctrine of the Diaz case then, and, as far as I can recollect, not even a suggestion to this effect has ever been made.  About five weeks  after we had approved the Rules of Court we decided the Espino case (January 30, 1940), wherein we applied the Diaz  doctrine, and nobody then thought that such doctrine has been abrogated by the  Rules  then  recently approved.   It may be said, therefore, that Rule 113, section  9, has been  approved by this court without a deliberate purpose  of aban- doning the  Diaz exception.<br><br>I have shown that the old and the present rule are  the same, and,  therefore, the premise upon which the majority has predicated its opinion is erroneous.   It  only  remains to be noted that where the greater offense of which an accused  is subsequently charged was not yet existing at the time  he was convicted for the lesser offense, double jeopardy cannot be invoked.  That was the Diaz case; that was the Espino case which we decided on January 30, 1940, after  the approval of the Rules of  Court; that is also  the case here.   And, as the old and the present rule are  the same, the exception recognized  before must perforce be  recognized now.  And the  reason  for this exception  is  obvious.  Not until the offense exists in law and in fact could it be  possible to place an  accused in jeopardy thereof.   To hold otherwise is to supply by a stretched fiction of law what is wanting in actuality.  "Our laws (our Rules) should receive  a sensible construction.  General terms should be so limited in their application  as not  to  lead to injustice, oppression,  or an absurd  consequence.   It  will always, therefore, be  presumed that the legislature  intended  exceptions to  its language which would avoid results of this character."   (In re Allen, 2 Phil., 641).<br><br>Finally, practical consideration of public interest argues strongly against the majority view.  Under it, if the prosecuting officer acts promptly in cases of this character,  the anomalous situation may arise, as it did arise here, whereby the accused may be penalized lightly for what may turn out later to be a shockingly enormous  offense, and no way is open by which  such anomally  may be corrected.  If, on the other hand, he stands by and watches the development of the case, as suggested by the majority, we punish  the accused in advance by keeping him in a state of constant anxiety, with the fear of prosecution  weighing upon him at every hour of waiting,  not knowing when he shall stand trial for his offense and for what offense he shall be tried. Even worse still,  the majority rule if  I may  be permitted to imagine  such a wrong, widens the  chances of collusion between the prosecuting officer and the accused to the grave detriment of public interest.  All these cannot happen  under the Diaz ruling.  And, to avoid the injustice of the  accused serving twice the penalty first imposed upon him, the same, or so much thereof as he has actually served, may be credited to the penalty imposed upon him for the  graver offense, as we have done in the Espino case.  With this, we do no injustice to the accused  and afford a just public vin- dication for the wrong proportioned to its enormity.<br><br>Against this the majority argues, however, that as eventual absorption is impossible of application in case of acquittal  for the graver  offense, it would not be logical to insist in such  absorption in  case of  conviction.  But,  if a principle is admittedly  just and  proper, the fact that it is impossible of application in one case should  not prevent its application in another where such application is possible. The majority's reasoning is in effect as follows: "It is right to be charitable while  you live; but since you cannot be charitable  when you are dead, why should you be charitable when you  are  alive?"   That  this ratiocination is  plainly illogical, seems to be self-evident.<br><br>Judgment reversed.<br></div>
