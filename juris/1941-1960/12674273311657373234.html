				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This appeal, from a judgment of conviction for robbery with 
homicide, raises the sole question of identity. <p></p>
<p align="justify">There were six defendants. Two were discharged for lack of 
sufficient evidence after the prosecution rested, and two others were acquitted 
for the same reason after both parties submitted the case.
</p><p align="justify">Hermogenes Cabuang and Daniel Artates, the remaining accused, 
were pronounced guilty of the crime of robbery with double homicide, and 
sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. with the accessories of the law; to pay, 
jointly and severally, the sum of P500 to Serapio de la Cruz; to return the two 
wrist watches or pay their value, P300, jointly and severally, to the heirs of 
Francisco Natividad; to indemnify the said heirs and those of Evangelina 
Natividad, also jointly and severally, in the sum of P4,000, and each to pay his 
proportionate share of the costs. From this sentence only Daniel Artates 
appealed.</p>
<p align="justify">The conviction of the appellant;rests on the testimony of two 
eyewitnesses, Leonora de la Cruz and Feliciana Arellano, and on his sworn 
confession.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears that at about 8 o'clock on the evening of September 
21, 1946, two armed men broke into the house of Serapio de la Cruz in barrio 
Pongonsile, municipality of Aguilar, province of Pangasinan, forcing their way 
through the back door. Before the two robbers rammed the door, a volley of shots 
was fired into the house killing a nineyear old daughter of Leonora de la Cruz 
and wounding the latter in the left arm and the right elbow.</p>
<p align="justify">Inside the house, one of the two robbers kicked Serapio de la 
Cruz, Francisco Natividad (Leonora's husband), and Feliciana Arellano, and then 
shot and fatally wounded Francisco Natividad with a pistol. Afterward he 
demanded money from Serapio de la Cruz and got P500. He also searched the house 
with a flashlight and grabbed two wrist watches, worth P150, which he saw 
hanging on the wall. Both watches belonged to Francisco Natividad.</p>
<p align="justify">While all this was going on, the other robber in the house was 
seated on an army cot nursing a wound. He carried a rifle. An undetermined 
number stayed downstairs.</p>
<p align="justify">At the trial, the two eyewitnesses pointed to Hermogenes 
Cabuang as the man carrying a rifle and seated on a cot. The other man, who, 
they said, shot down Francisco Natividad, received P500 from Serapio de la Cruz, 
and picked the two watches from the wall was Daniel Artates.</p>
<p align="justify">Very little or no weight can be given to these witnesses' 
identification of Daniel Artates. In an affidavit (Exhibit 1 and 1-A) subscribed 
and sworn to by Leonora de la Cruz soon after the crime, this woman declared 
that she recognized only one of the malefactors. She further stated that she 
recognized that person because she had often seen him in the public market in 
Mangatarem, Pangasinan. She had not seen the other before. (According to the two 
witnesses, the man whom they had frequently seen in the public market was 
Cabuang, and it was Cabuang, they said, who was seated on a cot and had a 
rifle.) Now, Leonora de la Cruz also admitted that before the trial of this case 
she was summoned to the office of the provincial fiscal for the purpose of 
pointing out the two men she had seen in the house, and it appears that out of 
four accused who were made to stand up in front of her she identified Hermogenes 
Cabuang only. Daniel Artates, who was one of those four prisoners, she did not 
pick out.</p>
<p align="justify">Feliciana Arellano, the other witness, admitted that on 
September 23, she made and signed a statement (Exhibit "2" Cabuang-Artates) 
before the municipal mayor, and that she said "No, sir" when she was asked, "Do 
you recognize the robbers who went to the house that night?" And in answer to 
the question of the provincial fiscal on redirect examination, "To whom did you 
refer, out of these six accused, as the man holding the caliber .45 pistol, 
'about 5 feet tall, about 48 kilos and about 30 years old, who wore a fatigue 
shirt terno rolled until the knee?' ", she pointed to Daniel Artates. But to the 
fiscal's next question asking her which of the six defendants "sat on the cot 
with a rifle, is about 5 feet and 3 inches tall wearing a fatigue terno?" 
(Cabuang's description) she indicated Daniel Artates again.</p>
<p align="justify">It is manifest from this confusion and from the contradictions 
between the witnesses' testimony at the trial and their previous statements, 
that Leonora de la Cruz and Feliciana Arellano were uncertain about the identity 
of Cabuang's companion who came inside the house with him. As a matter of fact, 
Daniel Artates said in his extra-judicial statement, which was introduced in 
evidence by the prosecution, that it was Hermogenes Cabuang and Paran who 
entered the house.</p>
<p align="justify">However, we are satisfied that appellant's confession was 
voluntary. Apropos of this confession, the trial court observed that "prior to 
the trial of the case in the Court of First Instance, both accused, Cabuang and 
Artates, appeared in the preliminary investigation before the Justice of the 
Peace of Mangatarem, Pangasinan, and they did not then complain to the judge or 
any other civil official that they had been subjected to ill-treatment, or that 
they had been intimidated;" that they did not show "to the judicial official the 
traces of maltreatment that they received;" "that both Artates and Cabuang 
remained silent and made revelation for the first time of the supposed 
maltreatment only during the trial in the Court of First Instance, knowing 
pretty well the importance of this confession." The court concluded that "the 
repudiation by the accused of their affidavits or confessions is an afterthought 
born of their eleventh hour attempt to escape responsibility."</p>
<p align="justify">The record does not disclose any circumstance of weight which 
would justify us in reversing the above findings. One important point which the 
court below may have overlooked strengthens rather than weakens its conclusions. 
It is the fact that the appellant expressly ratified the truth of his confession 
to the Justice of the peace of Lingayen who took his oath.</p>
<p align="justify">Judged by its contents, we do not believe the confession was 
framed by the military police out of their own mind. The narration is lengthy 
and rich in details which only the appellant could very well have supplied, 
while the military police had no reason or necessity to invent them. 
Furthermore, the confession contains matters calculated to exonerate the 
declarant or mitigate his responsibility. For example, it named Hermogenes 
Cabuang and Paran as the two men who broke into the house, and it said that the 
declarant had been forced to join the band. The first assertion is in direct 
contradiction to the prosecution's theory that it was Artates who killed 
Natividad, carried away Natividad's watches, and was handed the cash. A 
confession fabricated by the police would have been patterned after the main 
features of the eyewitnesses' testimonyâ€”to bolster, not weaken or destroy, 
it.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant's confession constitutes sufficient evidence to 
convict. The appealed judgment is therefore affirmed with costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Montemayor,</i> 
and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, J.:</p> I certify that Mr. Justice Pablo voted to affirm the appealed 
decision.</div>
