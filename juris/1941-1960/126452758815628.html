				G.R. No. L-28, November 27, 1945</h4>
				<H3>MATILDE HERRERO AND ANTONIO L. CRISOSTOMO, PETITIONERS, VS. POMPEYO DIAZ, JUDGE OF FIRST  INSTANCE OF MANILA,  AND MANUEL GASPAR, RESPONDENTS. 
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a  petition  for certiorari and prohibition praying for the annulment of the resolution of the respondent judge ordering the reconstitution of  the record  of criminal case  No. 6450 of the  Court  of First Instance  of Manila,  and prohibiting  him  from proceeding with the  said criminal case for adultery instituted against the petitioners by complaint of Manuel Gaspar, one of the respondents herein, during the regime of the so-called Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Petitioners  contend that  the respondent judge  acted without jurisdiction in issuing  the order in question, because all the proceedings in said criminal case No.  6450 have been invalidated by the proclamation of General Douglas  MacArthur of October 23, 1944, and because the Court of First Instance of Manila has  no jurisdiction to continue the proceeding in  cases commenced  in the Court of First Instance of Manila under the  so-called Republic of the Philippines; and that the respondent judge acted in excess of his  jurisdiction in  ordering the reconstitution of said  case, not wpon petition of the fiscal as required  by Act No. 3110, but upon petition of the attorney for the offended party.</p>
<p>The first two questions raised by petitioners  fall squarely under the ruling of this Court in the case  of Co  Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon  (G. R. No. L-5, p. 113, <em>ante</em>), promulgated on September 17, 1945, in which this Court held that all judicial  acts and proceedings  of the courts of justice during the Japanese occupation which are not of political  complexion, were before, and remained good and valid after, the restoration  of the Commonwealth Government; that  they have not been invalidated  by the proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur  of October 23,  1944; and  that the  present courts  have jurisdiction over cases, not of  a  political complexion, filed therewith during the Japanese occupation, and may take cognizance of and continue them to  final judgment.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the  crime with  which petitioners are charged is not of a political complexion, for petitioners are accused of the crime of adultery penalized by the Revised Penal Code of the Comomnwealth Government.   This  code and the Court  of  First  Instance in which  the complaint was filed were the  same code and court  of the Commonwealth which were continued by the so-called Republic of the Philippines, a government established  in the  Islands by.the Japanese forces of occupation.</p>
<p>A criminal proceeding in  a  court of  justice is  said to be of a political complexion when-the offense charged  is a new act not defined and penalized by the municipal laws, or an act already penalized by the latter as a crime against the legitimate government, but taken out of the territorial law and penalized as a new offense committed against the belligerent occupant, incident to a state of war and necessary for the control of the occupied territory and the protection of the army of the occupier.  They  are. acts which tend,  directly or indirectly, to aid or favor  the enemy and are directed against the welfare, safety and security of the belligerent occupant.  As  examples,  we  have the crimes against national security, such as treason, espionage, etc., and against public order, such as rebellion, sedition, etc., crimes against  the Commonwealth or United States Government under the Revised Penal Code  which were  made crimes against  the belligerent occupant.</p>
<p>Petitioners' contention that the attorney for the offended party is not authorized by Act No. 3110 to move  for the reconstitution of the record  of the criminal case in  question, and that in allowing its reconstitution upon the mere petition of  the  private  prosecutor  the  respondent judge acted in excess of his jurisdiction, untenable.</p>
<p>The intervention of the offended party or his attorney is authorized by section 15 of Rule 106 of the Rules of Court, subject to the  provisions of section 4 of the same Rule that all criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of  the fiscal.  Taking into consideration that a criminal action for adultery  can only  be commenced or recommended by the offended party and not by  the  fiscal (article 344, Rev. Pen.  Code),  and that the petition for reconstitution was filed without objection or with  the acquiescence  of the city fiscal, it is evident that the provisions  of the law on  reconstitution of records have been substantially complied with.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the petition is denied.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J.,  Ozaela, Paras, Jamnilla, Be Joya, Pablo</em>, and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J. </strong></p>
<p>The judicial process, consisting alone of an information for admitting and the bond of accused the reconstitution of which has been ordered by the Court of First Instance of Manila in the present case, is among those declared null and void and without effect in the proclamation issued by General Douglas MacArthur on October 23,  1944, in pursuance to the declaration issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 23, 1943, denying recognition to the Vargas Executive Commission and the Laurel Philippine Republic set up under the Japanese regime, as we have explained in  our opinions in Co Kim Cham  <em>vs. </em>Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (G. R. No.  L-5, p. 153, <em>ante</em>), and Peralta <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons (G. R. No. L-49, p.  334, <em>ante</em>).</p>
<p>We vote  for the granting of the writs prayed for.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.,  :</strong></p>
<p>I dissent.  My reasons are the same as those expressed in my main dissenting opinion in G. R. No. L-5 Co  Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (p. 199, <em>ante</em>),  in my dissenting opinion upon the motion for reconsideration therein  (p.  398, <em>ante</em>), and  in my concurring opinion  in G. R. No. L-49, Peralta <em>vs.</em> Director  of Prisons (p.  355, <em>ante</em>).  For those reasons, my opinion is that the resolution of the Japanese-sponsored Court of First Instance  of Manila ordering the reconstitution of  the record of criminal case No. 6450 thereof was  and is null and void.</p>
<p>The writs prayed for should be granted.<br>
