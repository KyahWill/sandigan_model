				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by certiorari against&nbsp; a judgment of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; affirming&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Capiz.&nbsp; The facts found in the&nbsp; Court of Appeals,&nbsp; which&nbsp; are pertinent&nbsp; to this appeal are&nbsp; as follows:<p></p><p>In&nbsp; the month&nbsp; of&nbsp; March,&nbsp; 1936&nbsp; petitioners-appellants sold to Lee Liong, a Chinese citizen, predecessor in interest of respondents-appellees, a parcel of land situated&nbsp; on the corner of Roxas Avenue and Pavia Street, Capiz (now Roxas City), Capiz, designated as&nbsp; lot 398 and covered by&nbsp; original Certificate of Title No. 3389.&nbsp; The&nbsp; cost was P6,000 and&nbsp; soon&nbsp; after the sale&nbsp; Lee Liong constructed thereon&nbsp; a concrete building which he&nbsp; used as a place for his&nbsp; lumber business&nbsp; and in&nbsp; part as&nbsp; residence&nbsp; for himself and&nbsp; family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; had contended that the sale was&nbsp; a conditional sale, or one with the&nbsp; right of repurchase during the three last years of a ten year period, but both the trial court and the Court of Appeals&nbsp; found that the&nbsp; sale was an absolute one.&nbsp; Another contention of the petitioners-appellants is that the sale is null&nbsp; and void as&nbsp; it was made&nbsp; in violation of the provision contained in the Constitution&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; XIII, section 5), but the Court of Appeals found that&nbsp; the purchaser was not aware of the constitutional prohibition while petitioners-appellants were because&nbsp; the negotiations for&nbsp; the sale were conducted with&nbsp; the knowledge and direct&nbsp; intervention of&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Rafael Dinglasan,&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the plaintiffs, who was at that time an assistant attorney&nbsp; in the Department of&nbsp; Justice.&nbsp; And it held that even if Lee&nbsp; Liong had known&nbsp; of the prohibition,&nbsp; the suit would not&nbsp; lie because&nbsp; of the&nbsp; principle&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">pari&nbsp; delicto,</span> that courts will not&nbsp; aid&nbsp; either&nbsp; party to&nbsp; an illegal&nbsp; contract&nbsp; if&nbsp; both&nbsp; are equally guilty but will leave them where they find&nbsp; them, citing Rellosa <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Gaw&nbsp; Chee&nbsp; Hun,&nbsp; 93 Phil.,&nbsp; 827, promulgated March 18,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; and articles&nbsp; 1302, 1305 and 1306&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeals said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"By the same token, we hold that&nbsp; appellants cannot now&nbsp; retrieve the lot in question.&nbsp; 'Money&nbsp; paid&nbsp; under an&nbsp; agreement which is executed, whether as the consideration or in performance of&nbsp; the promise,&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; recovered back where&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties are&nbsp; in&nbsp; part&nbsp; delicto.&nbsp; And&nbsp; goods&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; or&nbsp; lands conveyed under&nbsp; an&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; are subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same rule&nbsp; (17 C.&nbsp; J&nbsp;&nbsp; S.&nbsp; 656,&nbsp; 658-659,&nbsp; 660).&nbsp; By&nbsp; this&nbsp; holding&nbsp; we are&nbsp; riot sanctioning or legalizing&nbsp; the&nbsp; transaction in question.&nbsp; We merely refuse to&nbsp; aid either&nbsp; party&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; As&nbsp; stated in&nbsp; Corpus Juris&nbsp; Secundum&nbsp; (Vol. 17,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 659),&nbsp; the '<span style="font-style: italic;">pari&nbsp; delicto rule</span>' is made&nbsp; for&nbsp; the protecti6n of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public and not for&nbsp; the benefit of the parties; its object in refusing relief to either&nbsp; party where&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract is&nbsp; executed is not&nbsp; to give validity to the transaction but to&nbsp; deprive&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; of all right to&nbsp; have&nbsp; either enforcement of, or&nbsp; relief from,&nbsp; the&nbsp; illegal agreement.&nbsp; In such cases the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of illegality&nbsp; prevails,&nbsp; not as a protection&nbsp; to defendant,&nbsp; but&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; disability&nbsp; in plaintiff. The court does&nbsp; not give effect to&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; but&nbsp; merely refuses&nbsp; its&nbsp; aid&nbsp; to&nbsp; undo what the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; have already&nbsp; done.&nbsp;&nbsp; While' it&nbsp; may not always seem an honorable thing to do, yet a&nbsp; party to an illegal agreement is permitted&nbsp; to set up&nbsp; the&nbsp; illegality as&nbsp; a defense, even though it may be alleging his own turpitude.&nbsp; </p><p>"Upon the&nbsp; other hand there&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; preponderating&nbsp; weight&nbsp; of judicial authorities holding that an&nbsp; alien&nbsp; can take by deed and can&nbsp; hold&nbsp; land until&nbsp; office found or&nbsp; until&nbsp; the land is taken&nbsp; by the&nbsp; State, and&nbsp; he had&nbsp; full&nbsp; capacity to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; against all&nbsp; the rest of the world&nbsp; (2 C. J.&nbsp; 1051-1054; 2 Am. Jur. 476; Abrams <em>vs.</em> State,&nbsp; 45&nbsp; Wash. 327, Goon Gan <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Richardson, 44 P. 762, 16&nbsp; Wash.&nbsp; 373, Oregon Mortg.&nbsp; Co. Garstens, 47&nbsp; P.&nbsp; 421, 16&nbsp; Wash. 165, 35&nbsp; L. R.&nbsp; A.&nbsp; 841); that before an&nbsp; adjudication&nbsp; of&nbsp; escheat the&nbsp; title&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; alien&nbsp; grantee&nbsp; is&nbsp; unaffected;&nbsp; he&nbsp; has&nbsp; complete dominion&nbsp; over the property&nbsp; acquired by&nbsp; purchase; and&nbsp; he&nbsp; can hold land even&nbsp; against the State itself&nbsp; (19 Am.&nbsp; Jur.&nbsp; 391; 2 Am. Jur. 476-477; 23&nbsp; A.&nbsp; L. R. 1244-1245); and that the one deeding the&nbsp; land&nbsp; to&nbsp; an alien retains no right, title or interest&nbsp; therein, although&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; an alien shall be&nbsp; void (Abrams <em>vs.</em> State of Washington, 45 Wash. 327, 9 L. R. A. MS 186; 2 Am.&nbsp; Jur. 490-491;&nbsp; 3 C. J.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; 550)."&nbsp; (pp. 31&nbsp; to 32, Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; decision, contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 67-68, Record on&nbsp; Appeal.)</p></blockquote><p>On this appeal it is contended that as the sale to Lee Liong is&nbsp; prohibited by the Constitution,&nbsp; title to the land did not pass to said alien because the sale did not produce any juridical effect in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the constitutional prohibition&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; self-executing&nbsp;&nbsp; in character,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to give&nbsp; effect to the Constitutional mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; answer we state that granting the sale to be null and&nbsp; void and can&nbsp; not give title to the vendee, it does not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; follow therefrom that&nbsp; the&nbsp; title remained in the vendor,&nbsp; who had&nbsp; also violated&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional prohibition, or that he&nbsp; (vendor)&nbsp; has the right to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; the&nbsp; title&nbsp; of which&nbsp; he had divested&nbsp; himself by his act in ignoring the prohibition.&nbsp; In&nbsp; such contingency another principle of law sets in to&nbsp; bar the equally guilty&nbsp; vendor from, recovering&nbsp; the title&nbsp; which&nbsp; he had voluntarily vconveyed for&nbsp; a&nbsp; consideration,&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">pari delicto</span>.&nbsp; We have&nbsp; applied&nbsp; this principle as a bar to the present action in a series of cases, thus:</p><p>"The&nbsp; next question to be determined is whether plaintiff-appellant can maintain the&nbsp; present action of annulment&nbsp; and recover the property&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; effect of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; governing rescission of contracts;&nbsp; or,&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; another&nbsp; way,&nbsp; whether he can. recover&nbsp; the property notwithstanding the share he&nbsp; had&nbsp; in the&nbsp; execution of the sale which is&nbsp; known to be tainted with invalidity. Our answer must&nbsp; of necessity be in&nbsp; the&nbsp; negative following the doctrine laid down in the case of Trinidad Gonzaga de Cabauatan et al. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Uy&nbsp; Boo, et&nbsp; al., G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-2207, wherein&nbsp; we made the following&nbsp; pronouncement: </p><p>"We can,' therefore, say&nbsp; that&nbsp; even if the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; can&nbsp; still invoke the Consitution, or the doctrine in the Krivenko case, to set aside the sale in question, they are now prevented from doing&nbsp; so if their purpose is&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover the lands that they have voluntariily parted with, because of their guilty knowledge that what they were doing was in violation of the Constitution.&nbsp; They cannot&nbsp; escape the law. As this&nbsp; Court well said: A party to an illegal contract cannot come into a court of law and ask to have his illegal objects carried out.&nbsp; The law will not aid either party to&nbsp; an illegal&nbsp; agreement; it leaves the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; where it finds them.'&nbsp; The rule&nbsp; is expressed in the maxims Ex&nbsp; dolo malo non oritur aetio',&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In pari delieto potior est conditio defendentis.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bough and Bough&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Cantiveros&nbsp; and&nbsp; Hanopol, 40&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 210,&nbsp; 216.)'"&nbsp; (Caile <em>vs.</em> Yu&nbsp; Chiaco&nbsp; Peng,&nbsp; 49&nbsp; Off.

A. 141, otherwise known as the Public&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Law), for which situation the legislature&nbsp; has&nbsp; adopted the policy, not of returning the homestead&nbsp; sold to the original homesteader, but of forfeiting the homestead and returning it to the public domain again subject to&nbsp; disposition&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; law.&nbsp; (Section 124, Id.)</p><p>The doctrine of&nbsp; in pari delioto bars&nbsp; petitioners-appellants from recovering the title to the&nbsp; property in question and renders unnecessary the&nbsp; consideration of the other arguments presented in appellants' brief.</p><p>There is one other cause why petitioners remedy can not be entertained, that&nbsp; is the prescription of the action. As the sale occurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; March,&nbsp; 1936, more than ten years&nbsp; had already&nbsp; elapsed from&nbsp; the time the&nbsp; cause of action accrued&nbsp; when the action was filed (1948).</p><p>We&nbsp; take this occasion to call the attention&nbsp; of the legislature to the absence of a law or policy on sales in violation of the Constitution; this Court would have&nbsp; filled the void were we not&nbsp; aware'of the fact&nbsp; that the matter falls beyond the scope of our authority and properly belongs to a coordinate power.</p><p>The petition for certiorari is hereby&nbsp; denied with costs.</p><p><em>Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, and Endencia, JJ., concur. </em></p><p><em>Paras, C.

So the only solution to the problem that confronts us in the&nbsp; case at bar is to adjudge the contract void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab&nbsp; initio</span> because it contravenes the Constitution, as construed&nbsp; by this Court in the Krivenko&nbsp; case, and&nbsp; apply the provisions of Article&nbsp; 1303 of the Civil Code or 1398&nbsp; of the new Civil Code.<br><br><br></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 44 Off.
