				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition&nbsp; for review of a decision of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on&nbsp; March 30,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; holding that petitioners&nbsp; herein filed their&nbsp; record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; outside of&nbsp; the reglementary period&nbsp; and, consequently,&nbsp; dismissed their petition for mandamus.<p>Petitioners are&nbsp; among&nbsp; those&nbsp; who&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration of&nbsp; thirty-three&nbsp; lots of the&nbsp; Sagay&nbsp; Cadastre in Cadastral&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 27&nbsp; (G.L.R.O. Record&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 284) of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Negros Occidental. On October&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the court, after&nbsp; due hearing, rendered decision&nbsp; adjudicating said lots to Dominador Lacson and Visitacion Lacson, respondents herein.&nbsp; Among those who took steps to perfect the,ir appeal were the petitioners.</p><p>Petitioners received&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; the decision on October 24,&nbsp; 1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1952, they&nbsp; filed&nbsp; their notice of appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days later, or on November 24, the last day of the period within which&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal may be perfected, petitioners filed a motion for extension of time to&nbsp; file&nbsp; their record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; in an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated November&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; allowing fifteen days more to file their record on appeal.&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; filed two more&nbsp; motions for extension, each time one day before the expiration of the&nbsp; period&nbsp; extended, which were also granted.&nbsp; On the last day of the period allowed by the court, or on January&nbsp; 3, 1953, petitioners finally filed&nbsp; their record on appeal without however filing their&nbsp; appeal bond, which was only filed twenty days thereafter, or forty days beyond the reglementary period.</p><p>When the record on appeal was submitted to the court for approval,&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; Dominador&nbsp; Lacson&nbsp; and&nbsp; Visitation Lacson registered their opposition on the ground that both&nbsp; the record on appeal and the appeal bond were filed out of time.&nbsp; On April 23, 1953, the court ordered the dismissal of the appeal on the&nbsp; sole ground&nbsp; that the appeal bond was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; reglementary period. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 16,1953, the motion was denied, the court reaffirming its&nbsp; order of dismissal.</p><p>Dissatisfied&nbsp; with the&nbsp; action&nbsp; of the trial&nbsp; court, petitioners&nbsp; filed a petition&nbsp; for mandamus&nbsp; in the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Respondents&nbsp; filed an answer thereto&nbsp; reiterating their&nbsp; contention that&nbsp; the record on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; as 'well as&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bond were&nbsp; filed but of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a decision, promulgated&nbsp; on July&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the Court of Appeals&nbsp; found that petitioners' appeal&nbsp; bond was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; out of time but expressed the opinion that&nbsp; appeal bonds are not necessary for the&nbsp; perfection of the appeal in cadastral cases, and since such matter involved a ruling&nbsp; on a point of&nbsp; law,&nbsp; it&nbsp; resolved&nbsp; to&nbsp; certify the&nbsp; case&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Supreme Court,&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 5, 1954, the&nbsp; Supreme Court returned the case to the Court of Appeals holding that the latter could&nbsp; act&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; question involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; aid of its appellate jurisdiction.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; on March 30, 1955, the Court of Appeals&nbsp; rendered a&nbsp; new decision finding this time that the record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; was&nbsp; belatedly filed and, consequently,&nbsp; denied&nbsp; petitioners' petition/for mandamus.</p><p>It should be&nbsp; noted that&nbsp; when&nbsp; the record on&nbsp; appeal was submitted by petitioners io the lower court&nbsp; for its approval, the latter denied&nbsp; the same and dismissed the appeal,&nbsp; not on the ground that the same&nbsp; was filed outside the reglementary&nbsp; period, but&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal bond was filed&nbsp; out of&nbsp; time,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter being&nbsp; the only ground&nbsp; on which&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; was&nbsp; predicated.&nbsp; But when the case was taken&nbsp; to the Court of Appeals&nbsp; on&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; for mandamus,&nbsp; the latter, though expressed the opinion&nbsp; that appeal bonds&nbsp; are not necessary in cadastral cases,&nbsp; found that&nbsp; the&nbsp; record on&nbsp; appeal was filed out&nbsp; of&nbsp; time&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; dismissed the&nbsp; petition for mandamus.</p><p>The question that&nbsp; now comes&nbsp; up for determination is:&nbsp; Under the circumstances of this case,&nbsp; can the record on appeal be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; having been filed within the reglementary period considering the several extensions of time granted to petitioners by the lower court?</p><p>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; received&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of the decision on the merits&nbsp; on October&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1952.&nbsp; On November 24,&nbsp; 1952, the last day of the period for the perfection of the appeal, they filed a motion for extension of time to file their record on appeal.&nbsp; This motion was granted on November 28, 1952.&nbsp; Two more motions for extension were filed, each on the&nbsp; last day of the extended&nbsp; period, and both motions&nbsp; were granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the&nbsp; last day of the period allowed by the trial&nbsp; court, or on January ,3, 1953, petitioners finally filed their record on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts clearly indicate&nbsp; that, while&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; court granting the last extension was not issued before the expiration of the&nbsp; period&nbsp; previously extended,&nbsp; the&nbsp; record on appeal was however&nbsp; filed within the additional period granted&nbsp; to petitioners by the trial court.&nbsp; In the circumstances,&nbsp; we hold that the&nbsp; record&nbsp; on appeal was filed on time and the Court of&nbsp; Appeals erred in considering the appeal to have&nbsp; lapsed and&nbsp; in dismissing the petition for mandamus on that ground.</p><p>Our reason for this ruling is clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this&nbsp; Court has held that "The pendency of&nbsp; a motion for extension of time to perfect&nbsp; an appeal or to file a brief does not suspend the running of the&nbsp; period sought to be extended" (Garcia <em>vs</em>. Buenaventura, 74 Phil., 611), however, it was also held "that&nbsp; when the&nbsp; order granting&nbsp; extension&nbsp; of time&nbsp; is issued&nbsp; and notice&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; served after the expiration&nbsp; of the period fixed by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; said&nbsp; extension&nbsp; of time must be counted from the date notice of the order granting&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; received"&nbsp; (Alejandro&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Endencia,&nbsp; 64 Phil., 321, 325), which&nbsp; implies&nbsp; that&nbsp; once a&nbsp; motion for extension is&nbsp; favorably acted upon,&nbsp; the appeal may still be&nbsp; perfected within&nbsp; the period&nbsp; so extended.&nbsp; And this is justified under the ruling long observed in this&nbsp; jurisdiction that the&nbsp; motions&nbsp; of&nbsp; this kind are addressed to the sound&nbsp; discretion of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; and may&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted if there are justifiable&nbsp; reasons that warrant&nbsp; them&nbsp; (Moya <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Barton,&nbsp; 76&nbsp; Phil., 831;&nbsp; Reyes <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Court of Appeals, 74 Phil., 235).&nbsp; Here there are good&nbsp; reasons as pointed out by the trial court in&nbsp; its order of April 23,&nbsp; 1953.</p><p>The question that now&nbsp; rises&nbsp; is:&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals having dismissed&nbsp;&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for mandamus&nbsp; on a wrong premise as above pointed out,&nbsp; can&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court now look into&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue raised by respondents in their brief to the effect that&nbsp; said Court of Appeals likewise erred in its view&nbsp; that&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bonds&nbsp; are not necessary in the perfection of appeals in cadastral cases&nbsp; even if this issue is not now raised by petitioners in their petition for review?&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; can respondents raise new issues even if&nbsp; they have not appealed from the decision of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals&nbsp; if their&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; is&nbsp; to sustain that decision on another ground?</p><p>Our answer is in the affirmative, following our&nbsp; ruling that "Appellee,&nbsp; who is not appellant, may assign errors in his brief where his purpose is to maintain the judgment on other grounds, though (but) he may not do&nbsp; so&nbsp; if his purpose&nbsp; is&nbsp; to have the&nbsp; judgment modified or&nbsp; reversed, for,&nbsp; in such a case, he must&nbsp; appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only purpose&nbsp; or&nbsp; ground&nbsp;&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; namely, to sustain the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals on&nbsp; a ground different from that on&nbsp; which&nbsp; was predicated, and&nbsp; we are inclined to uphold this view in this&nbsp; case considering&nbsp; that the issue involved is important and merits serious consideration.</p><p>It should be&nbsp; recalled that, while the record&nbsp; on appeal was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by petitioners&nbsp; within" the additional period granted&nbsp; them by the lower&nbsp; court, they&nbsp; however&nbsp; failed to file the&nbsp; appeal bond&nbsp; on time, the same having been filed forty&nbsp; days beyond&nbsp; the reglementary period.&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals found that such failure did not&nbsp; have the effect of defeating the right of petitioners to appeal because in its&nbsp; opinion appeal bonds are not necessary in&nbsp; the perfection of appeals in&nbsp; cadastral cases, basing its ruling on&nbsp; paragraph (<em>a</em>), section 18, of Act 2259 (Cadastral Law, as amended by Act 3081),&nbsp; which&nbsp; provides that "One-tenth of the&nbsp; cost of the registration&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; and the&nbsp; cadastral&nbsp; survey and monumenting * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; shall be borne by the&nbsp; Insular Government; one-tenth shall be paid by the province concerned,&nbsp; and one-tenth by the city, municipality, municipal district, township or&nbsp; settlement in which&nbsp; the land is situated * * *&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; remaining seven-tenths&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be taxed by the court against each and all of the lots included&nbsp; in a cadastral proceeding."&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, it&nbsp; is the view of that court that since the costs in cadastral proceeding are assessed, not against the losing party but against those declared to be&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners of the&nbsp; lots, an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bond is unnecessary when a losing party appeals in a cadastral case.</p><p>We&nbsp; disagree&nbsp; with this point&nbsp; of view.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; first place,&nbsp; the cost mentioned in&nbsp; said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 18 refer to the&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; that are incurred&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Government in the&nbsp; cadastral&nbsp; survey and monumenting that are undertaken in connection with the cadastral proceedings, and not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; to the costs of action that are awarded in a court&nbsp; litigation.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; for&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; under said section 18 (<em>c</em>), as amended by Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1151, the amount of the cost so assessed does not go to the winning party&nbsp; but to pay "for all services rendered by the Land Registration Commission and the clerk or his deputies in each cadastral proceeding."&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second place, the reason why these costs are not taxed against the&nbsp; losing party is obvious. Unlike&nbsp; ordinary registration proceedings which&nbsp; are voluntary in character, the registration&nbsp; under the cadastral&nbsp; law is compulsory,&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of the law being&nbsp; to&nbsp; quiet title to&nbsp; lands when&nbsp; public&nbsp; interest so requires&nbsp; (section 1).&nbsp; The proceeding being&nbsp; compulsory it is but fair&nbsp; that costs be not charged to those who in response to the call center to court though they may lose their case.&nbsp; And so it was provided&nbsp; that these costs be charged against the winner.</p><p>It is therefore an error to&nbsp; consider the costs contemplated&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 18 as costs charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; ordinary litigation.&nbsp; They have&nbsp; a&nbsp; different&nbsp; nature and&nbsp; peculiar purpose.&nbsp; They have been designed merely for the purpose of the cadastral proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation differs&nbsp; when the losing party appeals from&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of the cadastral court where he has&nbsp; to perfect his appeal in same manner as&nbsp; in&nbsp; ordinary case.&nbsp; An appeal bond in&nbsp; this case is necessary to answer for regular costs should he lose his appeal.&nbsp; These costs have their own legal meaning and import, for, as it was said,&nbsp; "Costs are in the nature of incidental damages&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to the successful&nbsp; party to indemnify him against the expense of asserting his rights in court, when the necessity of so doing was&nbsp; caused&nbsp; by other's breach of legal&nbsp; duty"&nbsp; (Spicer <em>vs</em>. Benefit Asso., 90 A. L. R., 517)</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp; Rule 132 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court provides that "These rules&nbsp; shall not apply to land registration,&nbsp; cadastral, and election&nbsp; cases&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; except&nbsp; by analogy or in a suppletory character and whenever practicable and&nbsp; convenient."&nbsp; And in line with this rule, section 14 of Act 496 (Land Registration Law) provides that "Every order,&nbsp; decision, and decree of the Court of Land Registration may be reviewed by the Supreme Court in the same manner as an order, decision, decree, or judgment of a&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance might be&nbsp; reviewed."&nbsp; And in section 11 of Act 2259 (Cadastral Act) we also find the following proviso:&nbsp; "except as herein otherwise provided all of the provisions of said Land Registration Act, as now amended, and&nbsp; as it hereafter may be amended, shall be applicable to proceedings under this&nbsp; Act."&nbsp;&nbsp; An analysis of&nbsp; all these provisions leads us to conclude that the requirements of our Rules&nbsp; of Court relative, to&nbsp; the perfection of an appeal in&nbsp; an ordinary case apply in&nbsp; the same manner and with equal force and&nbsp; effect&nbsp; to appeals from a decision of a court of first instance in registration and cadastral proceedings.</p><p>It&nbsp; appearing that petitioners have failed&nbsp; to file&nbsp; their appeal&nbsp; bond within&nbsp; the reglementary&nbsp; period&nbsp; it follows that&nbsp; they have lost their right to appeal.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; plain that the Court of Appeals erred in&nbsp; concluding&nbsp; that such failure is no legal consequence and in not dismissing&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for mandamus on that ground.&nbsp; The&nbsp; finding of said court on this matter should therefore be modified in the sense that the petition for mandamus, should be dismissed not&nbsp; on the failure to file the record on appeal on time, but on the failure to file&nbsp; the appeal bond on&nbsp; time.</p><p>Wherefore the petition is dismissed, with costs against petitioners.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
