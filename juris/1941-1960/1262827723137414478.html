				<H3>THE  COLLECTOR  OF INTERNAL  REVENUE,  PETITIONER,  VS. MANILA LODGE NO. 761 OF THE BENEVOLENT & PROTECTIVE ORDER OF ELKS AND THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals holding that the Manila Lodge No. 761 of the Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks "is not liable for privilege taxes on its sale by retail of liquor and tobacco exclusively to its members and&nbsp; their guests," and reversing and&nbsp; setting aside a decision of said appellant to the contrary, dated November 19, 1953,&nbsp; without special pronouncement as to costs. The uncontested facts are set forth in the&nbsp; decision of said&nbsp; Court, from&nbsp; which we quote:<br><blockquote>"This is an appeal from two decisions of the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue assessing and&nbsp; demanding from&nbsp; the petitioner herein the&nbsp; sums of P1,203.50 and P332.00, respectively representing fixed taxes as retail&nbsp; dealer&nbsp; in liquor, fermented liquor, and tobacco, allegedly due from petitioner for the period from the 4th&nbsp; quarter of 1946 to&nbsp; 1953 and the period from 1954-1955pursuant to subsections&nbsp; (i),&nbsp; (k) and&nbsp; (n) of section 193 of" the Tax Code, in relation to 178 of the same Code.<br><br>"The petitioner,&nbsp; Manila Lodge No. 761 is&nbsp; admittedly a fraternal, civic,&nbsp; non-stock, non-profit&nbsp; organization duly&nbsp; incorporated&nbsp; under Philippine laws.&nbsp; It owns and operates a clubhouse located at Dewey Boulevard, Manila,&nbsp; wherein it sells at retail, liquor, fermented liquor, cigar and cigarettes only to its members and their guests.&nbsp; B.I.R. agents discovered that the&nbsp; Manila Elks Club had not paid&nbsp; for the period in question&nbsp; the privilege tax for retail liquor dealer (B-4), retail&nbsp; dealer&nbsp; in fermented&nbsp; liquor (B-7), and&nbsp; retail tobacco dealer (B-9-a) prescribed in section 193 of the Tax Code.<br><br>"On November 19,&nbsp; 1953, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed against and demanded&nbsp; from the petitioner the payment of the&nbsp; sum of P1,203.50 representing&nbsp; fixed taxes, as retail dealer,&nbsp; for the period from its 4th quarter of 1946 to 1953, exclusive of the suggested compromise penalty of&nbsp; P80.00.&nbsp; The petitioner,&nbsp; claiming that it&nbsp; was exempted from the payment of the privilege taxes in question, requested that the said assessment be reviewed by the Conference Staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; The Conference Staff, after due hearing, upheld and reiterated the assessment made by the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; Forthwith, the petitioner appealed to this Court on June 1, 1955.<br><br>"During&nbsp; the pendency of the original petition for&nbsp; review in&nbsp; the above-entitled case, respondent&nbsp; issued another assessment covering fixed taxes for the years 1954 to 1955 in the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P332.00, exclusive of the&nbsp; suggested compromise penalty of&nbsp; P50.00.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; petitioner with leave of Court filed a&nbsp; supplemental&nbsp; petition for review which&nbsp; included the latter assessment.<br><br>"Petitioner&nbsp; bases its claim&nbsp; for&nbsp; exemption&nbsp; from the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of the privilege taxes' in question on&nbsp; the&nbsp; grounds that it is not&nbsp; engaged ,in&nbsp; the&nbsp; business of selling at&nbsp; retail&nbsp; liquor,&nbsp; fermented&nbsp; liquor, and tobacco because the sale&nbsp; of these aforementioned specific&nbsp; goods&nbsp; is made only to members of the club and their guests' on a very limited scale in&nbsp; pursuance only of its general purpose as a&nbsp; fraternal social club, to provide comfort, recreation, and convenience to such members, and merely to provide enough margin&nbsp; to cover operational expenses.' (Petitioner's Memo p. 3).<br><br>"Respondent, on the other&nbsp; hand, maintains that&nbsp; persons selling articles subject&nbsp; to specific tax, such&nbsp; as cigars,&nbsp; tobacco liquor and the like, are subject to the fixed taxes imposed by section 193 of the Tax Code, irrespective of whether or not they made&nbsp; profit,&nbsp; and whether&nbsp; or not they are civic or fraternal&nbsp; dubs selling only to their members and their guests.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; based on a&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; promulgated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue made in 1921."<br></blockquote>Petitioner herein maintains that:<br><blockquote>"1. The&nbsp; respondent Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals erred in reversing the decision&nbsp; of the petitioner-appellant which&nbsp; held&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; club liable for fixed taxes.<br><br>"2.&nbsp; The respondent Court of Tax Appeals&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; holding that before respondent&nbsp; club's liability for the privilege taxes&nbsp; imposed by section&nbsp; 193 of the Tax&nbsp; Code&nbsp; attaches it is&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; that it be engaged in the 'business' of selling liquor and tobacco.<br><br>&nbsp;"3. The respondent Court of Tax Appeals erred in&nbsp; holding that a fraternal, civic, non-stock,&nbsp; non-profit organization like&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent club selling at retail liquor&nbsp; and tobacco only to its members&nbsp; and their&nbsp; guests with&nbsp; just&nbsp; enough&nbsp; margin to cover operational expenses should not be&nbsp; held liable for the fixed taxes incident&nbsp; to the business of selling at retail, liquor and&nbsp; tobacco.<br><br>"4.&nbsp; The respondent Court of Tax Appeals&nbsp; erred in holding that the administrative construction of&nbsp; the Bureau of Internal&nbsp; Revenue on the matter&nbsp; in question&nbsp; is outside the ambit of, and is inconsistent with, the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code and Tax Code." <br></blockquote>This&nbsp; appeal is untenable.&nbsp; In the language&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals:<br><blockquote>"The bone of contention between the two parties herein * * *, lies in the proper&nbsp; interpretation and application of&nbsp; the pertinent provisions of the Tax Code, namely,&nbsp; subsections&nbsp; (i), (k)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (n)&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 193 in relation to section 178 of the Tax Code, which we quote hereunder:<br><br>'SEC.&nbsp; 178. <span style="font-style: italic;">Payment&nbsp; of privilege taxes.</span>—A privilege tax must be paid before <span style="font-style: italic;">any&nbsp; business</span> or occupation hereinafter specified&nbsp; can be lawfully begun&nbsp; or pursued.&nbsp; T<span style="font-style: italic;">he tax&nbsp; on business</span>&nbsp; is&nbsp; payable for every separate or distinct establishment or place <span style="font-style: italic;">where&nbsp; the business subject&nbsp; to the tax is conducted;</span> and one occupation or line of business does not become exempt by being&nbsp; conducted with some other occupation or&nbsp; business for which&nbsp; such tax has been paid. <br><br>'The occupation tax must be paid by each individual engaged in a calling&nbsp; subject thereto; the tax on a business by the person,&nbsp; firm, or company&nbsp; conducting the same.'&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br><br>SEC. 193. <span style="font-style: italic;">Amount of tax on business.</span>—Fixed&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; on business shall be collected as follows, the amount stated being for the whole year when not otherwise specified: <br>(i) Retail liquor dealers, one hundred pesos. <br>(k) Retail dealers&nbsp; in fermented liquors, fifty pesos.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>(n) Wholesale tobacco dealers,&nbsp; sixty pesos;&nbsp; retail tobacco dealers, sixteen&nbsp; pesos/<br><br>"The&nbsp; aforequoted provisions of the Tax Code are clear and precise. The privilege taxes prescribed&nbsp; in section 193&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Tax Code in relation&nbsp; to&nbsp; section 178 of the same,&nbsp; are to be&nbsp; imposed only on persons&nbsp; or entities who engage in the activities mentioned or classified therein&nbsp; for 'business'&nbsp; purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; This evident intention of the law becomes more palpable when we take&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration the fact that the drafters of&nbsp; our&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Code&nbsp; had grouped&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforequoted provisions of law under one general division of the Tax Code&nbsp; headed as 'Title V, Privilege&nbsp; Taxes on <span style="font-style: italic;">Business and occupation</span>.'<br><br>"It is not therefore&nbsp; entirely correct to maintain as respondent does, that all&nbsp; persons selling articles subject&nbsp; to specific taxes, like liquor and&nbsp; tobacco, should likewise be subject to the fixed&nbsp; taxes imposed by section 193 of the Tax Code.&nbsp; We believe, that in order that these persons&nbsp; should&nbsp; be subjected&nbsp; to&nbsp; the privilege taxes imposed by the aforementioned section of the Tax Code, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; that they be engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the 'business' of&nbsp; selling liquor and tobacco, otherwise the privilege taxes as a dealer of liquor and tobacco can not attach.<br><br>"At this juncture a definition of the word&nbsp; 'business' is in order and we have the following:<br><br>'The word 'business' in its ordinary and common use&nbsp; is employed to designate human efforts which have for their and living or reward; it is not <span style="font-style: italic;">commonly </span>used as descriptive&nbsp; of charitable, religious, educational&nbsp; or social agencies.'&nbsp; (Ballantine's Law Dictionary,&nbsp; 1948 Ed. P. 179)<br><br>&nbsp;'Business—'that which busies or engages time, attention or labor as a principal serious concern or interest; any particular occupation or employment habitually engaged in specially for livelihood or gain/ (Vol. 1, 1949 Merriam-Webster's New International&nbsp; Dictionary, 2nd Ed. p. 362.).<br><br>"Other definitions of the term 'business' as given&nbsp; by judicial&nbsp; pronouncement are found in Volume V,&nbsp; Words&nbsp; and Phrases,&nbsp; page 999 as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;'<span style="font-style: italic;">Business</span> is a word of large signification, and denotes the employment or occupation in which a person&nbsp; is engaged to procure a living'. (Citing: Goddard v. Chaffee, 84 Mass&nbsp; (Allen) 395; 79 Am Dec. 796). 'Business in common speech means&nbsp; habitual or regular occupation that a party is engaged in with a view to winning a&nbsp; livelihood or some gain,'&nbsp; (Citing: In re Lemont, 41 p. 2D, 497, 502)<br><br>'An&nbsp; enterprise not; conducted as a means of livelihood or&nbsp; for profit does not come within the ordinary meaning of the terms,&nbsp; 'business, trade or industry.'&nbsp; (Citing City of&nbsp; Rochester <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rochester Girl's Home, 194 N.Y.S. 236, 237).<br><br>'The&nbsp; term 'business' as used in&nbsp; law&nbsp; imposing a license&nbsp; tax on business, trades, etc. ordinarily&nbsp; means business in&nbsp; the&nbsp; trade or commercial sense only, carried on with a view to profit or livelihood.' (Citing: Cuzner <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. California Club 100 p.&nbsp; 868, 867, 155,&nbsp; Cal.&nbsp; 303, 20 L.R.A. N.S. 1095).<br><br>"From the foregoing&nbsp; definitions,&nbsp; it is evident that the&nbsp; plain, ordinary meaning of 'business'&nbsp; is restricted&nbsp; to&nbsp; activities or&nbsp; affairs where&nbsp; profit is the&nbsp; purpose, or livelihood is&nbsp; the motive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The term 'business' being used without any qualification in section 193&nbsp; of the Tax Code in relation to section&nbsp; 178 of the same, should therefore be construed in its plain and ordinary meaning, restricted to&nbsp; activities for profit or livelihood.<br><br>"With these&nbsp; considerations in mind, we now come to the question of whether or not the Manila Elks Club&nbsp; is engaged in the&nbsp; 'business' of selling liquor and tobacco.<br><br>''Respondent, in paragraph 1 of his answer, admits that the petitioner&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; Manila Elks Club&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; fraternal, civic,&nbsp; non-stock, non-profit organization,&nbsp; fit has been&nbsp; established without contradiction that the Manila Elks&nbsp; Club, in pursuance of its purpose as&nbsp; a fraternal social club, sells on retail at its clubhouse on Dewey&nbsp; Boulevard, liquor, cigars and cigarettes, on a very limited scale, only to its members and their&nbsp; guests, providing just enough margin to cover operational expenses without intention to obtain profit.&nbsp; Such being the case then, the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Elks Club cannot be considered&nbsp; as engaged&nbsp; in the 'business'&nbsp; of&nbsp; selling liquor and tobacco.<br><br>'Where the corporation handled&nbsp; no money except such as was necessary to cover <span style="font-style: italic;">operational expenses</span>,&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; no business for itself,&nbsp; and engaged in no transactions that contemplated a&nbsp; profit for itself—such&nbsp; a corporation is considered not organized for&nbsp; profit under&nbsp; the General&nbsp; Corporation Law.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Read v.&nbsp; Tidewater&nbsp; Goal Exch. 116 A 898, 904, cited in&nbsp; Vol. 34,&nbsp; Words &amp;&nbsp; Phrases, p. 220, defining&nbsp; 'profits'; underscoring provided.)<br><br>"The petitioner herein, Manila Elks Club, not being engaged in the business&nbsp; of selling at&nbsp; retail liquor&nbsp; and tobacco, cannot therefore be held liable for the privilege taxes required by section 193, subsections (1), (k) and (n). The weight of American authorities&nbsp; enhances the strength of&nbsp; our findings that a fraternal, civic, non-stock, nonprofit organization, like the Elks Club, selling at retail liquor and tobacco only to its members and their guests in pursuance with its general purpose as a fraternal&nbsp; social dub with just enough margin to&nbsp; cover&nbsp; operational&nbsp; expenses,&nbsp; should not&nbsp; be held liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the fixed taxes incident to the business of selling at retail, liquor and tobacco.<br><br>'A bonafide social club, which&nbsp; disposes&nbsp; of liquors&nbsp; at its clubhouse to members and their guests at a&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; charge as incident to the general purposes of the organizational is not required to take out a license by Rev. Laws No. 3777-3785,&nbsp; approved March 15,&nbsp; 1905, which provides for a license upon the business of disposing intoxicating liquors; the term&nbsp; business in such statute meaning&nbsp; business in the trade or commercial sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; (State v.&nbsp; University Club, 130 p. 468, 470; 35 Nev. 475; 44 L.R.A., N. S. 1026).<br><br>A social club, not organized for the purpose of evading the liquor laws, but which furnishes its members with liquors and refreshments without&nbsp; profit to&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; a&nbsp; retail liquor dealer,&nbsp; within&nbsp; the statute imposing a license tax on all&nbsp; persons dealing in, selling or disposing of intoxicating liquors by&nbsp; retail.'&nbsp; (Barden v. Montan Club, 25 P. 1042, 10 Mont. 330, II L.R.A. 693).<br><br>'Acts 1881, C. 149,&nbsp; authorizing taxation of liquors&nbsp; dealers, does not&nbsp; include&nbsp; a social&nbsp; club&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp; a&nbsp; library, giving musical entertainments, and furnishing&nbsp; meals&nbsp; for its members,&nbsp; which keeps a small&nbsp; stock of liquor; the members paying for its&nbsp; drink as it is taken,&nbsp; but no profit being made&nbsp; on such sales.'&nbsp; (Tennessee Club of Memphis v. Dwyer, 79 Tenn.&nbsp; (11 Lea) 452, 461, 47 Am. Rep. 298.) 'A social club composed&nbsp; of&nbsp; members&nbsp; who&nbsp; have no&nbsp; proprietary interest in the assets which provides a reading room, restaurant, bar room, library, billiard&nbsp; rooms and sitting&nbsp; rooms for&nbsp; its members, the expenses of which&nbsp; are defrayed&nbsp; by annual dues from each member, and by payments&nbsp; made by the members for food and drinks, is not engaged&nbsp; in the business of a retail liquor dealer, within section 11 of the Louisiana License Tax Laws.'&nbsp; (La Ann. 585, 20 L.R.A. 185).<br><br>Respondent, however, insists that the petitioner should pay the privilege tax on the sale at retail of liquor and tobacco because this has been allegedly the practice consistently&nbsp; followed by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Internal Revenue since 1921, and because section&nbsp; 1464 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code under which said&nbsp; ruling was then based had been reenacted by the legislature&nbsp; as section&nbsp; 193 of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; Thus, respondent contends,&nbsp; that the policy of the Bureau of Internal Revenue has therefore&nbsp; gained 'approval by legislative reenactments.'<br><br>"The alleged administrative practice is founded upon the&nbsp; following ruling rendered in 1921.<br><br>'Clubs&nbsp; selling exclusively to members thereof&nbsp; liquors and&nbsp; other products on which the specific tax&nbsp; is imposed <span style="font-style: italic;">should pay&nbsp; the privilege tax corresponding to the business&nbsp; engaged in.</span>&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact that such products are sold at cost to the members of the club does not affect the club's liability to tax.'&nbsp; (Ruling, Oct. 13,1921, B.I.R. 105.02; Exh. 3, pp. 66-69. BIR records.)<br><br>"We do not agree with&nbsp; the contention of the&nbsp; respondent.&nbsp; While there is admittedly a ruling on this point in 1921,&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no showing that such has been a long-continued practice. Be&nbsp; that as it may, any such administrative&nbsp; construction&nbsp; must be within the ambit of, and must be consistent with,&nbsp; the Revised Administrative Code and the Tax Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is likewise the&nbsp; rule that where&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute is unambiguous, an administrative construction is unwarranted (U. S. vs. Missouri P. R. Co. 278 U. S. 269,&nbsp; 73 L. Ed. 322) and&nbsp; no construction may be made to restrict or enlarge the&nbsp; meaning of&nbsp; an Act.&nbsp; (Blatt vs. U. S., 305 U. S. 267,&nbsp; 83 L. Ed.&nbsp; 167).<br><br>"An&nbsp; examination of section&nbsp; 1464 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code taken in connection with section 1453 of the same, discloses the fact that aside from the&nbsp; change in&nbsp; rates of taxes to be paid and the arrangement of the&nbsp; classification of businesses enumerated therein, section 193 of the present Tax Code is a verbatim copy of the aforementioned&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp;&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; The policy or principle&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by the said code regarding privileges taxes, i.e. that the privilege taxes are payable&nbsp; only by those persons or entities engaged in the business enumerated&nbsp; in section 1464 of the said Code, has not suffered any change, and the same still obtains under our present Tax Code.&nbsp; In the absence of&nbsp; a showing that the legislative body had&nbsp; been apprised of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid ruling,&nbsp; what has gained&nbsp; legislative approval&nbsp; thru reenactment&nbsp; is,&nbsp; we believe, the policy behind the above-mentioned provision of the Revised Administrative Code of taxing persons engaged in business and not the alleged practice following the&nbsp; administrative ruling of 1921.&nbsp; We believe that no amount&nbsp; of trenchant adherence to&nbsp; an&nbsp; established practice may justify its continued application where&nbsp; it is clear and manifest that the same is not in consonance with the policy of the legislature as defined by law."<br><br>It is urged by appellant that emphasis should be placed not on&nbsp; the term "business",&nbsp; but on&nbsp; the phrases "retail liquor dealers", "retail dealers in fermented liquors" and "retail tobacco&nbsp; dealers",&nbsp; appearing&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 193 of&nbsp; the National Internal Revenue Code,&nbsp; which are defined in section 194 thereof as follows:<br><br>"Sec. 194. <span style="font-style: italic;">Words and phrase defined.</span>—In applying the provisions of the preceding section, words and phrases&nbsp; shall be taken in the sense and extension indicated below:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"(i) 'Retail liquor dealer' includes&nbsp; every person, except a&nbsp; retail vino dealer, who for himself or on commission sells or offers for sale wine or distilled spirits (other than denatured alcohol) in quantities of five liters or less at any one time and not for resale.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"(k) 'Retail&nbsp; dealer in fermented liquors'&nbsp; includes every person, except retail dealers in tuba, basi, and tapuy, who for himself or on commission sells or offers for sale fermented liquors and quantities of five liters or less at any one time and not for resale.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"(o) 'Tobacco dealer'&nbsp; comprehends every person who for himself or on commission sells&nbsp; or&nbsp; offers&nbsp; for sale cigars,&nbsp; cigarettes,&nbsp; or manufactured tobacco."<br></blockquote>Undoubtedly,&nbsp; these&nbsp; definitions must&nbsp; be given all&nbsp; the weight due thereto, in the interpretation of section 193 of the Tax Code.&nbsp; As used therein, the phrases above referred to are, however, part and parcel of the provisions contained, not&nbsp; only in said section 193, but, also, in&nbsp; section 178 and other parts of the 'Tax Code, all of which must&nbsp; be&nbsp; given effect in their entirety as a harmonious, coordinated and integrated unit, not as a mass of heterogeneous and unrelated&nbsp; if not&nbsp; incongruous terms,&nbsp; clauses and sentences.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the phrases in question should be construed in the light of the context of the whole Tax Code, of which they are integral parts.&nbsp; And when this is done—when we consider that&nbsp; section 193 requires&nbsp; "retail liquor&nbsp; dealers", "retail&nbsp; dealers in fermented liquors" and "retail tobacco Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Manila Lodge No. 761 of the Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks and the&nbsp; CTA dealers" to pay the taxes on business" therein specified; that said section 193 is entitled "Amount of tax on&nbsp; business"; that said section 193 merely implements the general provision in section 178, to the effect that "a privilege tax must be paid before any business or occupation hereinafter specified&nbsp; can be lawfully begun and pursued";&nbsp; that the term "business" is used in said&nbsp; section 178 six (6) times; and that the aforementioned sections 178% 193 and 194 are part of Title V of the Tax&nbsp; Code, entitled "Privilege taxes on business and occupation"—it becomes crystal clear that the "retail liquor dealers",&nbsp; "retail dealers in fermented liquors" and "retail tobacco dealers" alluded to in said section 193&nbsp; are&nbsp; those engaged in "business",&nbsp; not fraternal, civic, non-stock, non-profit organizations, like herein respondent,&nbsp; which sells&nbsp; wines, distilled&nbsp; spirits, fermented liquors&nbsp; and tobacco, exclusively to&nbsp; its members and their guests,&nbsp; at such&nbsp; prices as are merely&nbsp; sufficient to cover operational expenses.<br><br>Petitioner assails the applicability of the decisions relied upon by the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals, upon the ground that said decisions refer to&nbsp; the authority to license, and, hence, to the exercise of the police power, not that of&nbsp; taxation which&nbsp; is involved in the case at bar.&nbsp; However, the distinction made&nbsp; enhances—instead of detracting from—the weight of said decisions as precedents, insofar as the issue herein is concerned.&nbsp; Indeed, the police power is, in general broader and subject to less restrictions than the power to tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not difficult to&nbsp; conceive&nbsp; the advisability, if not, necessity, of requiring&nbsp; a license for some activities under- taken by so-called "clubs", owing to the possibility, if not probability, of&nbsp; use of said name, appellation or denomination, in order to avoid or evade some laws or to camouflage certain&nbsp; ventures, pursuits or enterprises which otherwise would&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; be illegal,&nbsp; immoral&nbsp; or contrary to public policy.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the other hand, a tax is&nbsp; a burden and,&nbsp; as such, it will not be deemed&nbsp; imposed upon fraternal, civic, non-profit, non-stock organizations, unless the intent to the contrary is manifest and patent.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision&nbsp; of the Court of Tax Appeals is hereby affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
