				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition for certiorari against an order of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations dated January&nbsp; 5, 1953, ordering the petitioner to readmit 51 employees and laborers in their former positions.&nbsp; On June 11, 1952 the employees of the petitioner went oh strike and petitioner referred the matter to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations.&nbsp; The court enjoined the strikers to return to work the following day, June 12, 1952, with the understanding&nbsp; "that should any worker&nbsp; or&nbsp; striker&nbsp; fail or refuse&nbsp; to return to&nbsp; work, the Bank through its&nbsp; management&nbsp; is hereby authorized&nbsp; to replace them."&nbsp; A&nbsp; trial of the question&nbsp; of the legality of the strike was held and thereafter the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; January&nbsp; 5, 1953, declaring the&nbsp; strike illegal and ordering the&nbsp; dismissal of the leaders&nbsp; of the&nbsp; strike, but allowing for the return of the 51 employees that failed to return to work on June 12, 1952.&nbsp; Petitioner moved&nbsp; for reconsideration of this order, on the ground that the petitioner was not granted, opportunity to present evidence or&nbsp; confront the witnesses.&nbsp; An appeal to the. court&nbsp; <i>in&nbsp; banc</i>&nbsp; was&nbsp; made, but&nbsp; the court affirmed the order. Hence,&nbsp; this&nbsp; petition.<br><br>The first ground&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which the invalidity of the order is assailed&nbsp; is the fact that the court itself had expressly authorized&nbsp; petitioner to&nbsp; hire&nbsp; new employees, in place of the strikers who did not return to work&nbsp; on June 12, 1952. The argument cannot stand if we, consider that the order for the&nbsp; replacement of the striking employees was a provisional order, which did not finally determine the right of the striking employees to&nbsp; go&nbsp; back to work or of the new recruits to continue therein as permanent employees. The order of&nbsp; replacement was an.expedient to enable the petitioner to comply with its&nbsp; duties and functions, which were very closely&nbsp; related to the interests&nbsp; of the public. It needs no argument to show&nbsp; that&nbsp; in the very future of things the right of the striking&nbsp; employees to be readmitted to their old&nbsp; position was to depend upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; results of the litigation or the finding of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations on the legality&nbsp; or illegality of the strike.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the recruits as well as the Bank should have&nbsp; understood that their employment was temporary in nature, because it was only a provisional&nbsp; remedy calculated to minimize the injurious&nbsp; effects of the strike on the petitioner and its clients as well as' on the public.&nbsp; Certainly no permanent right to. the positions temporarily occupied could have been acquired by the recruits, or obligation on the part of the petitioner to retain&nbsp; them therein implied therefrom.&nbsp; The&nbsp; modification thereof&nbsp; by the decision of the court after trial, and. in accordance&nbsp; with the results thereof,&nbsp; must be&nbsp; held to be perfectly&nbsp; proper, just&nbsp; and legal. <br><br>The second ground relied upon in the petition, is the fact that an agent&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; had made his own inquiries as to the reason why the strikers had not returned back to work,&nbsp; in spite of the order of the court, at which inquiries&nbsp; petitioner or its&nbsp; representative was&nbsp; not present and had no opportunity to cross-examine the persons investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to this claim we note that the court found that&nbsp; the 51&nbsp; employees ordered to be readmitted by the&nbsp; petitioner failed to report for&nbsp; duty on June&nbsp; 12, 1952, not because they&nbsp; did not desire to report for work, but because they were unable to reach the premises of the petitioner because of the&nbsp; picketing then in existence and the threats, made against them&nbsp; by the&nbsp; pickets.&nbsp; This finding is&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; various circumstances&nbsp; and evidence actually before the court,&nbsp; not on the inquiries alone.<br><blockquote>"The failure of those employees&nbsp; who&nbsp; are&nbsp; still&nbsp; out&nbsp; of work to return on or before the deadline&nbsp; specified in the order of the Court dated&nbsp; June 11, 1952,&nbsp; was due to the picket line and the presence thereat oi non-employees of the bank, which is not very easy to cross.&nbsp; In fact, from the bank's report itself we read "that number of other employees&nbsp; have&nbsp; advised the petitioner&nbsp; bank by telephone that they could not&nbsp; report for work because they have been threatened."&nbsp; (Report&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Bank dated&nbsp; June 13, 1952);&nbsp; that one A. Magpayo, who was&nbsp; reemployed,&nbsp; while on his way&nbsp; to&nbsp; the bank at Plaza&nbsp; Moraga, was&nbsp; assaulted&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; by a striker named R. Silvestre and by an unidentified&nbsp; picketer who is said to be a member of the Federation of Free Workers who is not an employee of the bank on&nbsp; June 16, 1952) (Report of the bank dated&nbsp; June 16, 1952). Considering further that&nbsp; the time for the employees to report was barely twelve (12)&nbsp; actual working hours, from the hour of issue of the Interlocutory Order on June 11, to the deadline on 12, and that the order&nbsp; to replace is temporary,&nbsp; it was unnecessary to race&nbsp; with the time and&nbsp; expos.e. themselves&nbsp; to&nbsp; danger.&nbsp; A these show that the failure 'of the employees to report on&nbsp; time was forced upon them by circumstances over which they have no control. Such failure to report on time, besides being&nbsp; excusable&nbsp; and reasonable, is merely a technical violation of the said Interlocutory Order."<br></blockquote>The inquiries were made in the very premises of the petitioner at a time when the strike had just been declared, on the&nbsp; very day of the order for their return to duty. The petitioner&nbsp; cannot claim&nbsp; that the inquiries&nbsp; were made behind&nbsp; its back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of&nbsp; the inquiries&nbsp; were also so fresh that&nbsp; no opportunity for falsification&nbsp; could&nbsp; have arisen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court was also based upon letters&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner itself, which, like the report&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Bank, is admissible&nbsp; against the latter as an admission.<br><br>Lastly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court is not&nbsp; supposed to be bound by the strict rules of&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; in the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts. This&nbsp; is the express injunction contained in the law (Commonwealth Act No. 103,&nbsp; section 20)&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the form and manner in which it may arrive at the questions of fact in issue.<br><br>Failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; grant&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; petitioner to&nbsp; cross-examine the persons&nbsp; from&nbsp; whom inquiries&nbsp; were&nbsp; made is not a sufficient ground for the reversal&nbsp; of the order of the court and its findings.&nbsp; Petitioner has&nbsp; never claimed .that the&nbsp; persons examined did&nbsp; not tell the truth,&nbsp; or that&nbsp; it has&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to refute the court's findings that the&nbsp; 51 employees wanted to return to work but were impeded or prevented from doing so against their will.&nbsp; In its motion to reconsider the order subject of the petition, we find that no mention&nbsp; or claim of the falsity of the evidence gathered by the&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; the court, or that it had&nbsp; in&nbsp; its possession material evidence to disprove the findings.&nbsp; The import of petitioner's contention, therefore, is that it should be granted&nbsp; opportunity for a&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial&nbsp; to&nbsp; cross-examine the persons who were investigated&nbsp; by the representatives of the court for the sake of the right alone.&nbsp; But in the absence of&nbsp; an express allegation that a&nbsp; new hearing will change&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts found, the new trial or cross-examination demanded would be idle ceremony;&nbsp; it&nbsp; would not serve the ends of justice at all, especially so in a quasi-administrative body, like the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations, where the rules of confrontation and cross-examination have not been expressly granted&nbsp; as in&nbsp; a trial against an accused in a criminal case.&nbsp; Under the circumstances we find that the court cannot be said&nbsp; to have abused its discretion in setting aside&nbsp; its provisional order.<br><br>The&nbsp; petition is&nbsp; hereby denied,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Par√°s, C.
