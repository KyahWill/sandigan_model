				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a&nbsp; decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in its&nbsp; case&nbsp; No 25370, denying the appellant's petition for a writ of prohibition and mandamus to compel&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board of&nbsp; Immigration Commissioners&nbsp; to&nbsp; desist from continuing deportation proceedings. against petitioner's&nbsp; wife, Tjioe Wu Suan,&nbsp; and to issue to her a certificate showing her status to be&nbsp; that&nbsp; of a Filipino citizen.<br><br>The facts&nbsp; were stipulated&nbsp; by&nbsp; and&nbsp; between&nbsp; the parties to be&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote><ol><li> That according to the Identification Certificate No. 265j issued by the Honorable Jose P. Bengzon, as Acting Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration On&nbsp; June&nbsp; 29, 1960, photostatic copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; which, is&nbsp; hereto attached as Annex "A", petitioner Ricardo Cua is&nbsp; a Filipino citizen; <br></li><li>&nbsp; That Tjioe Wu&nbsp; Suan is the&nbsp; holder&nbsp; of a certificate in lieu&nbsp; of&nbsp; Passport No. 17-134 issued by the Republic of Indonesia in Hongkong; <br></li><li> That on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1952, Tjioe&nbsp; Wu&nbsp; Suan&nbsp; arrived&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines aboard a Philippine&nbsp; Air Lines&nbsp; plane from&nbsp; Hongkong; that after the requisite investigation&nbsp; she was admitted as a transient and&nbsp; registered under A. C.-B. No. Aâ€”241014 issued&nbsp; in Manila&nbsp; on November 13,&nbsp; 1952; that later on&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; extension&nbsp; to stay, the last one being up to March. 31, 1954; <br></li><li> That on&nbsp; December 4, 1953. the Indonesian&nbsp; Embassy in&nbsp; Manila reported to the&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; that&nbsp; the passport of Tjoe Wu Suan&nbsp; was allegedly forged; <br></li><li> That based on&nbsp; that report, Warrant of Arrest N.o. 229, dated December 10,&nbsp; 1953, was&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigration against Tjioe&nbsp; Wu Suan; <br></li><li>&nbsp; That on&nbsp; December&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; and&nbsp; Tjioe&nbsp; Wu Suan were married&nbsp; as&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by Annex "1" of the&nbsp; Petition; <br></li><li> That by&nbsp; reason of such&nbsp; marriage, the Board of Special Inquiry of the&nbsp; Bureau of&nbsp; Immigration,&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; an&nbsp; investigation, after which,&nbsp; it ruled&nbsp; that "as a&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen&nbsp; she is&nbsp; no longer subject&nbsp; to deportation"&nbsp; and that "she shall instead be issued the&nbsp; appropriate identification&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; showing&nbsp; her&nbsp; correct status&nbsp; as a&nbsp; Filipino citizen"&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; "2"y Petition) ;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 29, 1953,&nbsp; she was issued&nbsp; Identification. Certificate&nbsp; No. 1746&nbsp; annexed to&nbsp; "Manifestation" dated&nbsp; July 2,&nbsp; 1955; <br></li><li> That&nbsp; respondent Board of&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigration&nbsp; Commissioners&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; with&nbsp; the deportation proceedings and&nbsp; continues to do&nbsp; so against petitioner's Wife,&nbsp; and respondent refuses to refund the sum of&nbsp; one&nbsp; thousand&nbsp;&nbsp; (P 1,000)&nbsp;&nbsp; pesos,&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; wife&nbsp; had posted as cash bond for her1 temporary stay, as evidenced by&nbsp; Official Receipt&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5424220,&nbsp;&nbsp; dated&nbsp; December&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1953." (Appellee's Brief, pp. 6-8).</li></ol></blockquote> The writs prayed for&nbsp; were refused by the court&nbsp; below because it&nbsp; found&nbsp; that the marriage&nbsp; of&nbsp; the female&nbsp; alien Tjioe Wu Suan&nbsp; to petitioner Ricardo&nbsp; Cua,&nbsp; celebrated ten days&nbsp; after&nbsp; the warrant&nbsp; for her&nbsp; arrest and&nbsp; deportation was issued, was resorted to only as an expedient to thwart the course of the pending deportation proceedings&nbsp; against her.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; insisted&nbsp; that the&nbsp; marriage was valid and automatically&nbsp; conferred Philippine&nbsp; citizen- ship&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; alien&nbsp; woman,&nbsp; rendering her&nbsp; immune to deportation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The appeal can not be sustained.&nbsp; Granting&nbsp; the validity of marriage, this&nbsp; Court has ruled in the recent case of Ly Giok&nbsp; Ha vs. Galang, supra, p. 459,&nbsp; that the bare&nbsp; fact of a valid marriage to a citizen does not suffice to confer&nbsp; his citizenship ,upon the wife.&nbsp; Section 15 of the Naturalization law requires that&nbsp; the alien woman who marries a Filipino must show, in addition, that she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" as a Filipino citizen.&nbsp; As construed in&nbsp; the decision cited, this just condition&nbsp; requires&nbsp; proof that&nbsp; the woman who married a&nbsp; Filipino is&nbsp; herself not&nbsp; disqualified under section 4 of the Naturalization law.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;No&nbsp; such evidence appearing on&nbsp; record, the&nbsp; claim of assumption of Filipino citizenship by Tjioe Wu&nbsp; Suan, upon her marriage to petitioner, is&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; The lower court, therefore,&nbsp; committed&nbsp; no&nbsp; error in refusing to&nbsp; interfere with&nbsp; the&nbsp; deportation proceedings,&nbsp; where she can anyway establish the&nbsp; requisites&nbsp; indispensable&nbsp; for&nbsp; her&nbsp; acquisition of Filipino citizenship,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; validity of her Indonesian passport.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wherefore, the decision&nbsp;&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; affirmed. Costs against the petitioner in both instances.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp;&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Conception, Endencia</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ.</i>,&nbsp; concur.</div>
