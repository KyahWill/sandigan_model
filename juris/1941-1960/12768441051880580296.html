				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action for certiorari. Upon the filing of the 
corresponding bond, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued by this Court, 
soon after the institution of the case.
<p>It appears that, on March 20, 1951, respondent Manuel S. Camus and petitioner 
Price, Inc. - hereafter referred to as Camus and price, respectively - entered 
into a contract, whereby the former leased to the latter, for a period of ten 
(10) years, from April 1, 1951, the property described in the deed of lease, 
Annes A, the pertinent parts of which provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the said party of the first part Lessor, hereby grants, demise and 
let unto the said party of the second part Lessee, for lawful business purposes, 
all that certain strong stone material building with the lot and parcel of land, 
with an area of 1,700 square meters, situated, lying and being at No. 60 C. 
Arellano Street, Malabon, Rizal, covered as Lots No. 15 and No. 16, Block No. 1, 
Tambobong Estate, Psd. - 11759 of the Rural Progress Administration, to have and 
to hold the same for the full term of ten (10) years from April 1st, 1951 to 
March 31, 1960, inclusive, at the monthly rental of P300.00 Philippine Currency, 
for the above-mentioned building, to be paid without the necessity of express 
demand therefor on the.1st five (5) <u>days</u> of each ensuing month at the 
residence of the party of the first part Lessor at Malabon, Rizal; and also at 
the monthly rental of One Hundred Pesos (P100.00) Philippine Currency, for the 
use of the leased premises, payable beginning when the construction of the 
factory is already finished, and likewise payable at the time and place 
aforementioned;</p>
<p>"2. That the party of the second part Lessee, shall have or cause to erect, 
build or construct a Factory Building and Warehouse of strong materials 
<u>appropriate to or in furtherance of the business of the party of the second 
part Lessee</u>, on the said lot the plan as to the form and size and other 
specifications thereof being subject to the joint approval of both parties 
concerned, at the expense of the party of the second part lessee; and that the 
buildings thereon constructed shall be insured with a competent Insurance 
Company by the party of the second part Lessee, <u>in an amount equal to the 
insurable interest of the party of the first part</u> Lessor, in the sum of at 
least Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) Philippine Currency, <u>for himself, his 
heirs and/or administrators as his , beneficiary</u>; and that the insured 
buildings (Factory Building and Warehouse) hereinbefore mentioned shall 
authmatically become, without cost, the property of the party of the first part 
Lessor, immediately <u>upon the termination of this</u> contract;</p>
<p>"3. That the party of the second part Lessee agrees and covenants that, in 
case the aforementioned Factory Building and Warehouse are destroyed by fire 
during the life-time of this lease, the proceeds or money to be paid by and to 
be collected from the insurance company <u>shall be utilized in erecting a new 
set of Factory Building</u> and Warehouse, exactly as those destroyed; and in 
case the money to be paid by the insurance company will not be sufficient for 
the purpose, the party of the second part Lessee shall put in <u>additional</u> 
funds with which to build the said now set of Factory Building and Warehouse, 
and no extension of the life-time of this lease as a consequence thereby is 
contemplated;</p>
<p align="center">X X X X</p>
<p>"5. That the party of the first part Lessor, likewise covenants and agrees to 
cause or make the necessary <u>filling</u>, at his sole expense, <u>within a 
year from the signing of this contract</u>, the vacant portion of the lot along 
the river with an area of about 500 square meters <u>to increase its elevation 
and enable the party of the second part Lessee, to facilitate or make use of the 
whole lot</u>; as well as to construct, build or cause to erect the necessary 
<u>concrete</u> stone walls provided with barbed wire on top thereof and all 
expenses incurred or to be incurred incident to the filling as well as to the 
construction, building and erection of the stone walls, one (1) meter high, with 
barbed wire to be borne solely by the party of the first part Lessor." (Annex A, 
pp. 1-3) (Underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 19, 1954, Price instituted Civil Case No, 2582 of the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal, against Camus, for specific performance, damages, and 
extension of the period of said lease, upon the ground of non-compliance with 
the provisions of the above-quoted paragraph 5 of Annex A. About three (3) days 
later, or on or about January 22, l954, Camus, in turn, commenced Civil Case No. 
1159 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Malabon, Rizal, against Price, for 
forcible entry and detainer, upon the ground of non-payment of the rentals from 
February 16, 1953. In his answer therein, Price denied the main allegations of 
the complaint and averred, by way of special defenses, the aforesaid breach of 
contract by Camus, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"R. That as a result of all the foregoing facts, showing that plaintiff 
refuses to comply with the obligations imposed upon him by the contract of 
lease, herein defendant on January 20, 1954 filed a civil action in the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal, where it is docketed as Civil Case No. 2582, against 
the herein plaintiff for specific performance and damages. This case is now 
pending in the said Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>"S. That <u>actually the matter litigated in this present suit is included 
among the issues raised in Civil Case No. 2582, CFI-Rizal, the essence of which 
calls for an interpretation of a contract with reciprocal obligation</u>.</p>
<p>"T. That this Honorable Court with limited jurisdiction is not competent to 
decide on issue properly raised and included in a civil case <u>already pending 
in the Court of First Instance of Rizal</u>, and which court is that of 
competent jurisdiction." (Annex D, p. 5) (Underscoring 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In due course, the justice of the peace court rendered, in said case No. 
1159, a decision - dated February 10, 1954, copy of which, according to Price, 
was received on March 2, 1954 - in favor of Camus and against Price,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x condemning the sail defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of FOUR 
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED (P4,600.00), with interest thereon at the legal rate from 
the date of the filing of the complaint, for arrears in rentals from February 
16, 1953, to January 31, 1954, and the sum of FOUR HUNDRED PESOS (P400.00) a 
month thereafter until the premises are vacated; to pay to the plaintiff the sum 
of ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) as liquidated damages acoording to the terms 
of the contract Annex A'; to pay to the plaintiff the sum of FIVE HUNDRED PESOS 
(P500.00) as attorney's fees also according to the terms of the contract Annex 
'A', and to pay the costs of the suit. Defendant is also hereby condemned to 
vacate the premises mentioned in the complaint and to turn over the possession 
thereof to the plaintiff." (Annex E.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Price duly appealed from this decision, seasonably paying the corresponding 
docket fees and filing the requisite notice of appeal and cash bond, as well as 
a surety bond for the agregate sum of P6,900, covering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"a. P4,600.00 for alleged rentals from February 16, 1953 to January 31, 
1954;</p>
<p>"b. P1,000.00 for alleged liquidated damages;</p>
<p>"c. P500.00 for allege 1 attorney's fee;</p>
<p>"d, P400.00 for rental for February, 1954;</p>
<p>"e. P400.00 for rental for March, 1954." (Annex G)</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of paying to Camus, or depositing in court, the amount of the rentals 
for the succeeding months, at 400 each, Price filed, on or about April 8, 1954, 
a bond for P1,200 "to answer for the rentals for the month (of April, May and 
June, 1954, inclusive, in the event the plaintiff secures a final judgment in 
his favor," (Annex H.) Hence, on May 29, 1954, Camus filed, with the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal - before which the ejectment case was then pending on 
appeal, as Civil Case No. 2650 of said court - a petition for the execution of 
the decision of the justice of the peace court. Price objected thereto upon the 
ground</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<u>First</u>,that defendant's bond posted since April 6, 1954 in the amount 
of P1,200.00 covering rentals for April, May and June, 1954 is sufficient 
compliance with the provisions of Rule 72, Section 8, of the Rules of Court; 
<u>second</u>, that plaintiff has waived the right to an immediate execution 
based on the claim that the rentals for April and May, 1954 have not been paid 
or deposited, because he has not objected to the bond posted and offered to him 
since April 8, 1954; and <u>third</u>, that even supposing, without admitting, 
that the bond is not a compliance with the payment provided for in Rule 72, 
Section 8, still the error, if any, is a case of innocent mistake and excusable 
negligence, which, under the jurisprudence citied above, make the delay in 
payment under the circumstances not a ground for immediate execution, and that 
under such circumstances defendant should be afforded an opportunity to make the 
payment or deposit in cash if the court so desires." (Annex I, pp. 
6-7.)</p></blockquote>
<p>and prayed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the plaintiff's petition should be denied; and if this Honorable Court 
should rule that the bond posted is not sufficient compliance with the law, the 
defendant should be given a period of 3 days from notice within which to make 
the deposit in cash in lieu of the posted bond." (Annex I, p. 
7.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Acting upon said petition of May 29, 1954, the Court of first Instance, 
presided over by Hon. Emilio Rilloraza, Judge, issued, said Case No, 2650, an 
order (Annex J), dated July 24, 1954 - copy of which is said to have been 
received by Price on September 10, 1954 - directing the execution of the 
aforementioned decision of the justice of the peace court. On September 11, 
1954, the Clerk of Court of Rizal issued the writ of execution (Annex K), which 
said officer, as <u>ex-officio</u> Provincial Sheriff, threatened to enforce. 
Hence, Price instituted the present action for certiorari, with the prayer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the order of respondent judge, directing the immediate execution of the 
judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court of Malabon, Rizal, be annulled, the 
same having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion and without 
jurisdiction and in wanton disregard of the facts and circumstances of the case, 
and that ponding these proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued 
against the respondents restraining them from carrying out the order of the 
respondent judge, Annex 'J', as well as the writ of execution issued pursuant 
thereto on September 11, 1954, Annex 'K', with costs against 
respondents."</p></blockquote>
<p>As already adverted to, the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for was 
issued upon the filing of a bond for P1,000.00.</p>
<p>In their answer, respondents admit some of the allegations of the petition 
and deny other allegations thereof, Among other things, they, moreover, allege 
that the obligations of Camus, under the contract of lease, are independent of 
those of Price; that the filling and construction provided in said contract, 
have "already been totally" completed; and that the order of July 24, 1954, and 
the writ of execution were duly issued, for Price had failed, either to pay, or 
to deposit, the amount of the rentals for April, May and June, 1954.</p>
<p>At the outset, it should be noted that the very pictures submitted by 
respondents, as Annexes 9 and 10 to their answer, dated October 11, 1954, show 
that the stone wall constructed by Camus is of "<u>adobe</u>", and has no barbed 
wire fence, whereas the contract of lease provides for "<u>concrete</u> stone 
walls x x <u>with barbed wire</u>." Furtheremore, although the portion of the 
leased property reproduced in Annex 9 appears to have been filled, there is 
evidence (which has not been contradicted) to the effect that the elevation of 
said portion is lower by 40 centimeters than the average elevation of said 
property (see Annex L) . Moreover, the pictures Annexes M, N and O, taken on 
February 16, 1954, reveal that said portion was then unfilled and even under 
water, Anyhow, it is not even claimed that said filling and construction had 
been completed within the year, which expired on March 20, 1952, stipulated in 
the contract of lease. In fact, the answer filed by respondents before this 
Court impliedly admits the failure of Camus to make the filling and construction 
within said period. This admission is even clearer in his answer in Case No. 
2532, dated February 4, 1954, for he alleged in said pleading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. That sometime in 1951, <u>after signing the aforesaid Contract of 
Lease</u>, an agreement was entered into by and between plaintiff and defendant 
that the filling up of the aforesaid portion of the said lot would be done as 
soon as the dredger of the Bureau of Public Works would be taken to Malabon 
River to fill up the market site of Malabon, Rizal, in which event the said 
dredger would then be contracted and utilized by defendant to do the filling up 
of the said portion, but the said dredger was not as yet been brought to Malabon 
River up to the present;</p>
<p>"4. That defendant <u>has begun</u> filling up the said portion of the 
promises in question with <u>adobe</u> stones since May, 1951, and as matter of 
fact, the base of the stone wall along the Malabon River of the said lot has 
already been erected and finished since October, 1951, in order to contain the 
fillings to be made by the aforementioned dredger, and defendant has already 
spent for this purpose more than P1,200, and for this reason, plaintiff could 
not now complain, and is now in estoppel from demanding the completion of the 
filling up of the portion of the said premises, and the construction of the 
stone wall with barbed wire on top, in accordance with the said Contract of 
Lease." (annex 3, pars. 3 and 4) (underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, this paragraph (4) tends to weaken, or, even, refute, the 
allegations of paragraph (3), for, if, as therein stated, it had been agreed - 
although, it would seem, orally - after the execution of the contract of 
lease,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"that the filling x x x would be done as soon as the dredger of the Bureau of 
Public Work would be taken to Malabon river to fill up the market site of 
Malabon, Rizal, in which event the said dredger would then be contracted ana 
utillized by the defendant (Camus) to do the filling xxx but the said dredger 
has not as yet been brought to Malabon river up to tho present 
time"</p></blockquote>
<p>then there would seem to be no reason for Camus to begin the filling "since 
May, 1951 " as averred in paragraph 4 of his aforementioned answer in Case No. 
2582,</p>
<p>At any rate, there is <u>prima facie</u>, if not strong, evidence that Camus 
had not complied with some of his obligations under the contract of lease, and 
that this breach of contract dates back to March 20, 1952, or about eleven (11) 
months <u>prior</u> to the alleged default of Price in the payment of rentals 
(or from February 16, 1953). In this connection, the last paragraph of Article 
1169 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In reciprocal obligation, neither party incurs in delay if the other does 
not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent 
upon him. From the moment one of the parties fulfills his obligation, delay by 
the other begins."</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be noted, also, that respondent Judge, as well as the Justice of 
the Peace of Malabon, were aware of the pendency of Civil Case No. 2582 of the 
Court of First Instance of Rizal, for specific performance of the contract of 
lease. Said action was explicitly pleaded by Price, in the answer filed with the 
justice of the peace court, which answer formed part of the record before 
respondent Judge, when he issued the order complained, of. He knew, or must have 
known, therefore, that Camus was charged with non-performance of his (Camus') 
obligations as lessor; that this was, and is, the basis of the action and the 
main issue in Case No. 2582 of the court of first instance, for specific 
performance of said obligations; that the court of first instance has 
jurisdiction to decide said issue and action; that the jurisdiction of said 
court of first instance is, either exclusive, or concurrent with the justice of 
the peace court; that, if exclusive, the justice of the peace court would not be 
competent to pass upon said issue; that, neither would the latter court have 
authority to determine said issue, if it had concurrent jurisdiction with the 
court of first instance, this being the court which first assumed authority over 
said case, for Case No. 2582 was filed therein several days <u>before</u> the 
ejectment case in the justice of the peace court; that the determination of said 
issue in Case No. 2582 is essential to the settlement of the dispute in Case No. 
1159; that.accordingly, the issue in Case No. 2582 constitutes a prejudicial 
question, as regards the subject matter of the controversy in Case No. 1159; and 
that, consequently, the justice of the peace court should have, at least, 
deferred the hearing and determination of Case No. 1159, until after the 
rendition of judgment in Case No. 2582.</p>
<p>Indeed, the situation confronting the court may be likened to that which 
would obtain if a person instituted a detainer case to secure possession of a 
land - to which he claims to be entitle as owner thereof - held, under claim of 
title in fee simple, by another who has already sued the former in order to 
quiet title. Since the right of possession asserted by the plaintiff in the 
detainer case depends upon his alleged dominion, which is controverted in the 
action to quiet title, the justice of the peace court must dismiss said detainer 
case for want of jurisdiction to settle the question ownership, upon which 
plaintiff's claim is based. (Torres v. Peña, 44 O.G. 2699; Peñalosa v. Garcia, 
44 O.G. 2709; Cruz v. Garcia, 45 O.G. 227; Canaynay v. Sarmiento, 45 O.G, 252). 
Similarly, the forcible entry and detainer case instituted by Camus, is 
predicated upon the alleged default of Price in the paynent of rentals. Pursuant 
to Article 1169 of our Civil Code, Price would not be in default, even in case 
of non-payment of the rentals, if Camus had not fulfilled his obligations as a 
lessor, as intended by Price in the action for specific performance already 
commenced by him. Price, therefore, cannot be guilty of unlawful detainer, 
unless Camus is exonerated, in the action for specific performance, from the 
charge of breach of the contract of lease. By analogy with the former 
illustration, it could be argued, therefore, that the justice of the peace court 
cannot pass upon the right of possession invoked by Camus in the ejectment case, 
for the same depends upon whether Camus had complied or not with his part of the 
contract of lease, which, in turn, is the issue in Case No, 2582, In other 
words, respondent Judge had, before him sufficient facts to doubt the propriety, 
if not the validity, of the decision of the justice of the peace court.</p>
<p>Again, Price has established and is operating on the leased premises a candy 
factory, which would have to be closed, with the corresponding injury to the 
business of Price, if said decision were executed. Moreover, Price would then be 
divested of the possession of a building, which must be worth not less than 
P50,000, it has constructed on the leased premises, in accordance with the 
contract of lease. Pursuant thereto, Price is the owner of said building for the 
duration of the lease, Hence, the deprivation of said possession would violate 
the dominical rights of Price, which include the enjoyment, and consequently, 
the possession and use of said building.</p>
<p>It is true that, pursuant to paragraph 14 of the contract of lease,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x in case of a breach of any of the covenants on the part of the party 
of the second part Lessee, herein contained, the party of the first part Lessor, 
may, while the default shall continue, and notwithstanding any waiver of any 
prior breach of conditions, without notice or demand, enter upon the premises 
and thereby terminate this lease and may thereupon expel and remove the party of 
the second part Lessee." (Underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As a corollary thereof, title to said building would pass from Price to Camus 
upon the termination of the lease. However, said right of Camus to terminate the 
lease could be exercised only "while the default (of Price) shall continue," and 
Price is not in default as long as - in the words of Article 1169 of our Civil 
Code - Camus "does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with 
what is incumbent upon him" and there is prima facie proof of breach of contract 
by Camus, Anyhow, this is, as above stated, the issue in Case No, 2582, wherein 
it must be decided, together with all the issues incidental thereto, or 
necessarily included therein, such as the termination of the lease, the 
extinction of the title of Price over said building and its acquisition by Camus 
(Rule 39, Section 45, Rules of Court), which are, clearly, beyond the 
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court. If these questions were 
eventually decided, in Case No. 2582, in favor of Price, Case No, 1159 and the 
decision of the justice of the peace court in favor of Camus, would become 
untenable. Apart from this, Price might seek to recover damages for the injury 
occasioned by his ejectment, and Camus might be unable to indemnify said 
damages. In short, the execution of the decision of the jusitce of the peace 
court would ruin the business of Price, deprive it of the possession of building 
probably worth not less than P50,000, which is its property, until otherwise 
declared in Case No. 2582 - and this has not been done as yet - and may cause 
irreparable injury to Price,</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, although the rentals for April, May and June, 1954, have 
not been paid or deposited in cash, a bond has been given to guarantee its 
payment. Besides, Price has offered to make said cash deposit, if authorized by 
the court to do so. It may not be a^iss to add that Price, is, to all 
appearance, more than sufficiently solvent to pay the sum of P1,200 represented 
by said rentals, and must have been paying or depositing the amount of the 
rentals for the months following June, 1954. Hence, Camus would suffer no 
possible damage if Price were now allowed to deposit in cash said sum of 
P1,200.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in issuing the order complained of as well as the writ of 
execution, despite the strong equities in favor of Price and the dubious 
legality or prop of the decision of the justice of the peace court, respondent 
Judge has committed a grave abuse of discretion. Wherefore, (1) the writ prayed 
for is hereby granted, (2) the order of respondent Judge, dated July 24, 1954, 
and said writ of execution, are set aside and annulled, (3) the writ of 
preliminary injunction issued herein is hereby made permanent and (4) petitioner 
Price, Inc. is given three (3) days, from entry of judgment in this case, within 
which to deposit in court the amount of the rentals for April. May and June, 
1954. Respondent Manuel S. Camus shall pay the costs.</p>
