				<H3>PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC., PETITIONER VS. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND UNION OF PHILIPPINE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES (NLU), RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of a decision of the Court of Industrial 
Relations rendered on July 27, 1953 in Cases Nos. 791-V and 791-V(?) which 
declares the strike staged by the members of the Union of Philippine Education 
Employees on January 16, 1953 legal while, on the other hand, it declares the 
lay-off made by the Philippine Education Co., Inc. of nineteen (19) of its 
employees discriminatory and unjust and, as a consequence, it orders said 
company to reinstate said employees, with the exception of three (3), with 
payment of their salaries during their separation.
<p>The two cases above adverted to in reality constitute only ose which arose 
from the lay-off by the company of nineteen (19) employees belonging to the 
Union of Philippine Education Employees and protest against said lay-off the 
union staged a strike on January 16, 1953. The two cases were heard together but 
only one decision was rendered therein.</p>
<p>The two cases are merely incidents to several previous cases between the same 
parties which have not yet been terminated;, One of said oases which was filed 
by the union on August 9, 1950 involves the dismissal of Jacinto Fabron and 
Juanito Carangdang, president and secretary, respectively, of the union which 
caused the members of said union to strike on August 10, 1950 [Case No. 
489-V(1)]. After due hearing the court found the dismissal unwarranted and the 
strike legal, but while it ordered the reinstatement of Fabroa and Carangdag, 
the court refused to decree the payment of their back salaries, and it was from 
that portion of the decision that they appealed to this Court. On March 31, 
1952, this decision was affirmed (G.R. No. L-4423). In connection with that 
case, in order to settle the strike declared by the union, the parties reached 
an agreement, which was made the basis of an order of the court on August 14, 
1950, which contains, among others, the following stipulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That during the pendency of this case, the laborers shall not declare a 
strike and the respondent company, on the other hand, shall not dismiss, lay-off 
or suspend any of its employees without just cause and the express authority of 
the Court x x x."</p></blockquote>
<p>Another incident which arose prior to the one involved in the instant two 
cases is that which relates to a petition of the company for authority to reduce 
its personnel by 50% on the ground that the volume of its business was greatly 
impaired due to the imposition of the import and exchange controls by the 
government. This case has not yet been finally terminated as the same is still 
pending hearing before the court <em>a quo</em>. But on October 30, 1951, a 
peremptory order was issued by the court authorizing the company to lay off some 
of its daily paid employees numbering thirty (30) whose names were taken from a 
list submitted by the company itself. This incident is herein mentioned because 
of its direct bearing on the issues raised in the two cases under 
consideration.</p>
<p>The issues rosed by the parties filed in the two cases which formed the basis 
of the decision of the court are: (1) is the action of the company in laying-off 
nineteen of its employees justified?; and (2) is the strike declared by the 
union legal?</p>
<p>With regard to the first issue, the court found that the lay-off of the 
nineteen employees, with the exception of the three, was discriminatory and 
unjust, and with regard to the second, it found it to be legal, and, as a 
consequence, it ordered the reinstatement with back pay of the sixteen (16) 
employees whose names were mentioned in the decision. It is from this decision 
that the company interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>One of the points raised by the petitioning company is the finding of the 
court <em>a quo</em> that the lay-off made by said company of nineteen of its 
employees was discriminatory and unjust and done in bad faith because it did so 
in violation of its order of August 14, 1950 which provides that no employee 
shall be dismissed without previous authority of the court. The company contends 
that this finding is unwarranted because the order adverted to had ceased to 
have force and effect because the case in which it was issued has already been 
finally decided on March 31, 1952 (G, R. No. L-4423).</p>
<p>This contention is not devoid of merit for it indeed appears that when the 
lay-off of the nineteen employees of tho company was declared on January 15, 
1953, the case wherein the order of August 14, 1950 was entered had already been 
finally terminated and it stands to reason that the same lost its force when the 
case that gave it life was finally decided by this Court.</p>
<p>But we find that that was not the only reason why the lay-off was considered 
unwarranted and unjust but because it was made in disregard of the order of the 
court a quo of October 30, 1951 in relation to the company's petition for 
authority to lay off 50% of its employees filed way back in August, 1950 (Case 
No. 789-V(2). It should be stated that in that case the company submitted a list 
of employees it wanted to lay off out of which the court approved thirty who 
were being paid on a daily basis and, on that account, were considered as 
temporary employees. While that order was merely temporary because negotiations 
were still going on as regards the manner to be followed in the selection, of 
the employees to be eliminated in view of the substantial decrease in the volume 
of business of the Company, the company proceeded to decree the elimination of 
the nineteen employees herein involved, not only without previous authority of 
the court, but even in disregard of said order which at that time was considered 
as the basis or pattern to be followed in the elimination of future employees in 
the absence of a better arrangement as a result of which the members of 
respondent union struck on January 16, 1953. Indeed, as the court a quo found, 
out of the nineteen persons laid-off by the company, only eight were taken from 
among those for whose lay-off the company had asked for authority from the court 
and only one from the thirty authorized by the court to be laid off. The court 
also found,- and this fact was found of great weight - that, like in the 
previous cases of dismissals or lay-offs, almost all of the victims are union 
men, or to be more specific, out of the nineteen laid-off employees, eighteen 
are members of the union and only one is not. And in effecting the elimination 
of said employees the management did not even take up the matter with the union 
officers.</p>
<p>It is true that "an employer has a right to select his employees and to 
decide when to engage them", or "he has a right under the law to fall freedom in 
employing any person free to accept any employment from him and this, except as 
restricted by a valid statute or a valid contract, at a wage and under 
conditions agreeable to them", and that, "he may refuse to employ whomever he 
may wish, irrespective of his motive, and x x x has the right to prescribe the 
terms upon which he will consent to the relationship, and to have them fairly 
understood and expressed in advance." (31 Am. Jur., Section 9, p. 837.) To all 
this we agree with counsel for the company, But what we say is that this right 
has its limitations after the relation of labor and capital has been 
established. Once this relationship is established, labor has some rights to 
protect. Thus, it has been held that "The right to labor is a constitutional as 
well as a statutory right. Every man has a natural right to the fruits of his 
own industry. A man who has been employed to undertake certain labor and has put 
into it his time and effort is entitled to be protected. The right of a person 
to his labor is deemed to be property within the meaning of constitutional 
garantee. That is his means of livelihood. He cannot be deprived of his labor or 
work without due process of law." (Philippine Movie Pictures Workers' 
Association <em>v</em>. Premiere Productions, Inc. G. R. No. L-5621, March 25, 
1953.) This is what the court <em>a quo</em> has done. It merely saw to it that 
the right of the laid-off employees be protected and be not the subject of 
discrimination. As a proof that the court <em>a quo</em> acted carefully and 
justly is its finding that three of the laid-off employees deserve alimination.. 
We find that the court <em>a quo</em> did not abuse its discretion in acting on 
the matter.</p>
<p>Another point raised by counsel is the finding that the strike staged by the 
union on January 16, 1953 is legal in spite of the fact that the union knew full 
well that the company was in financial difficulties and in carrying out the 
strike some of its members resorted to acts of violence upon non-striking 
members merely because they refused to join the strike.</p>
<p>In determining whan a strike should be declared legal or otherwise, this 
Court laid down the following ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In cases not falling within the prohibition against strikes, the legality or 
illegality of a strike depends upon the purpose for which it is maintained, and, 
second, upon the means employed in carrying it on. Thus, if the purppse which 
the laborers intend to accomplish by means of a strike is trivial, unreasonable 
or unjust (as in the case of the National Labor Union, Inc. <em>vs</em>. 
Philippine Match Company, supra), or if in carrying on the strike the strikers 
should commit violence or cause injuries to persons or damage to property (as in 
the case of National Labor Union, Inc. <em>vs</em>. Manila Gas Corporation, 40 
Off. Gaz. 37), the strike, although not prohibited by injunction, may be 
declared by the court illegal with the adverse consequences to the strikers." 
(Luzon Marine Department Union <em>vs</em>. Roldan, et al., G.R. No. L-2660, May 
30, 1950.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Was the purpose for which the union struck trivial, unreasonable or 
unjust?</p>
<p>The court a quo did not find it so. It found that the union staged a walk-out 
because it believed, rightly or wrongly, that the lay-off of the nineteen 
employees was illegal as being in violation of an order of the court which 
prohibited the lay-off of any employee without previous authority from the 
court. It likewise believed that said employees were the victims of 
discrimination simply because most of them were members of the union, and 
considering that the management violated a court order which in its opinion was 
still valid and in force the members of the union resorted to the only means 
allowed to them by law: strike. Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion, 
as the court <em>a quo</em> found, that the members of the union struck not for 
a trivial purpose but for one which they honestly believed was necessary to 
protect their interest.</p>
<p>It is true that some of the strikers resorted to violence in an effort to 
make the strike effective and accomplish the purpose for which it was declared, 
but considering that the acts of violence were merely isolated and were 
committed by some members without the knowledge or sanction of the officers of 
the union, the court <em>a quo</em> was right in concluding that the union 
should not be blamed therefor and that only those who have committed them should 
suffer the consequences of their own acts. We agree with tide finding of the 
court <em>a quo</em>.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the portion of the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, 
without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Labrador, Concepcion,</em> and <em>J.B.L. Reyes, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Montemayor, J.</em>, concur in the result.</p>
<p><em>Reyes, J.</em>, in the result.</p></div>
