				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Following the rendition of a money judgment in its favor in Civil Case No. 
1149 of the Court of First Instance of Davao brought by it against the therein 
defendants LVM Transportation Co. and Lorenzo Catalan, now petitioners herein, 
the Standard Vacuum Oil Co. filed a motion for immediate execution on January 3, 
1955. But defendants opposed the motion and took their appeal in due time, 
filing, on January 11, their notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal 
and setting the hearing thereon on January 15. As no one appeared for plaintiff 
at the hearing and no objection to the record on appeal had been filed, the 
court approved the record on that same day. But despite that fact, the court on 
the 28th of that month granted plaintiff's motion for immediate execution 
without even requiring plaintiff to file a bond. On February 10, defendants 
asked for a reconsideration of this order on the ground that, with the approval 
of the record on appeal, the court had no more jurisdiction to issue said order. 
Plaintiff opposed the motion and, in what would appear to be an attempt to 
obviate the objection as to want of jurisdiction, countered with a motion to set 
aside the order approving the record on appeal on the ground that it was 
rendered by mistake, that is, without the court being aware that plaintiff had 
asked for the postponement of the hearing on the record on appeal, to say 
nothing of the fact that the motion for immediate execution was still 
unresolved. In an order dated March 2, 1955, the lower court resolved to let the 
order for immediate execution stand, at the same time setting aside the order 
approving the record on appeal.<p></p>
<p>Alleging that the order for immediate execution was rendered after the lower 
court had already lost jurisdiction over the case and that in authorizing 
immediate execution without bond the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of 
discretion, the defendants came to this Court with the present petition for 
certiorari to have the said order annulled and its enforcement enjoined. <br></p><p>The 
writ must be granted.</p>
<p>Section 9 of Rule 41 provides that "upon the filing of the notice of appeal 
and the approval of the appeal bond and the record on appeal, the appeal is 
deemed perfected <u>and the trial court loses its jurisdiction over the case</u>." 
Excepted from that provision is the authority "to issue orders for the 
protection and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve 
any matter litigated by the appeal"; but an order for immediate execution does 
not come under that exception, for as this Court has already said, "the 
execution of a judgment is a proceeding affecting the rights of the parties, 
which are the subject matter thereof, and from which appeal is taken, and its 
purpose is not to preserve and protect the subject of the litigation," (Syquia 
vs. Goncepcion, 60 Phil. 186.) With, jurisdiction over the case already 
transferred to the appellate court upon the approval of the record on appeal 
(Santiago et al, vs. Valenzuela et al., 76 Phil. 397) that of the trial court is 
necessarily lost or terminated (De la Fuente et al. vs. Jugo et al., 76 Phil. 
262), except the authority "to issue orders for the protection and preservation 
of the rights of the parties which do not involve any fatter litigated by the 
appeal, and to approve compromises offered by the parties prior to the 
transmittal of the record on appeal to the appellate court" as expressly 
provided in section 9 of Rule 41. Subject only to this exception, the cessation 
of the trial court's jurisdiction is not postponed to the day the record is 
actually transmitted to the appellate court.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-respondent complains against the approval of the record on appeal 
despite its motion, for postponement and before the expiration of the five-day 
period allowed by section 7 of Rule 41 for the filing of objections. But the 
mere fact that a party has asked for postponement does not give him the right 
not to appear at the hearing without the request having been granted. And the 
premature approval of the record on appeal would appear to be a harmless error 
as no prejudice caused thereby has been alleged, plaintiff-respondent never 
having formulated any objection to the record on appeal which the premature 
approval of that record has prevented it from filing.</p>
<p>The complaint that plaintiff was not furnished a copy of the appeal bond is 
but a technical objection of little significance, it appearing that the bond was 
actually filed together with the record on appeal and the notice of appeal 
served upon plaintiff makes express reference thereto. Moreover, there is no 
showing that the alleged omission has caused any prejudice.<br>We concur:</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the petition for certiorari is hereby granted and 
the order setting aside the order approving the record on appeal and granting 
immediate execution annulled, with costs against plaintiff-respondent.<br></p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> 
concur.<br></p>
