				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pursuant&nbsp; to the provisions of Circular No. 45 of the Central Bank, Lim Hu applied for license to import certain commodities from Hongkong on the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of the so-called "no-dollar remittance".&nbsp; His&nbsp; application was denied.&nbsp; Thereafter he started in the Manila&nbsp; court&nbsp; of first instance proceedings to compel said&nbsp; institution to&nbsp; issue the license or permit the importation&nbsp; contending that the above-mentioned circular&nbsp; was&nbsp; null and void, said&nbsp; Bank having no legal power to&nbsp; promulgate&nbsp; it.<p>The case was submitted upon&nbsp; a stipulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts, on&nbsp; the strength&nbsp; of which,&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered judgment in accordance with the petitioner's complaint, annulled the circular,&nbsp; and declared that the importation could be made, subject only to customs law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Bank appealed.</p><p>It was stipulated&nbsp; "that on August 3, 1953, Lim Hu filed applications for the importation into the Philippines from Hongkong of fresh garlic, soy sauce, fresh eggs, hams, fresh onions and fresh potatoes *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * on a no-dollar&nbsp; remittance basis, pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; the requirements of&nbsp; Central Bank Circular No.&nbsp; 45".</p><p>It was also&nbsp; stipulated that, to pay for&nbsp; the above consumer goods in Hongkong, Lim Hu stated he would use a credit of $500,000 of John Martin, in&nbsp; said city, with the latter's consent, Martin and Lim&nbsp; Hu&nbsp; having&nbsp; entered into an&nbsp; agreement that the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; would&nbsp; take&nbsp; charge of the importation into and&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in the Philippines&nbsp; of said goods, investing the proceeds in certain kinds of business in this country.</p><p>Circular No. 45 provided in&nbsp; part:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Now therefore,&nbsp; the Monetary Board, in pursuance&nbsp; of Central Bank Circular No. 20 and other circulars&nbsp; and notifications issued in pursuance thereto,&nbsp; hereby requires any person or&nbsp; entity who intends to import or receive&nbsp; goods&nbsp; from any foreign country for which no foreign exchange is&nbsp; required or&nbsp; will be required&nbsp; of the banks, to apply for a license from the Monetary Board to authorize such import."</p></blockquote><p>And Circular No. 20 restricting gold and foreign exchange transactions, subjected&nbsp; to license&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Central Bank the&nbsp; proposed arrangement between Lim Hu&nbsp; and John Martin.</p><p>Defending the validity of its&nbsp; Circular No. 45 the Bank alleges "it has authority to issue such regulation as maybe necessary to exercise its power * * *&nbsp; to&nbsp; license&nbsp; (temporarily) all transactions in gold&nbsp; and foreign exchange" (section&nbsp; 14&nbsp; [a] in connection with section 74 Republic Act No. 265) ; and that the term foreign,exchange is applicable "to foreign currency and notes and coins, letters of credit, drafts, bills of exchange, or other instruments having international&nbsp; financial implications" (section&nbsp; 2 paragraph [i]&nbsp; Central Bank Circular&nbsp; No. 31),&nbsp; And in connection with the proposed transaction, the Bank says, John Martin a non-resident would thereby acquire an interest in Philippine pesos resulting from the sales of&nbsp; the imported goods, and the&nbsp; effect of the operation&nbsp; would be an exchange of John Martin's money in Hongkong with&nbsp; Philippine pesos here.&nbsp; Lim Hu even covenanted to render to John Martin "semi-annual accounting of the moneys and properties" involved&nbsp; in the importation. (Annex C,&nbsp; Motion for New Trial.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it&nbsp; was a transaction in foreign exchange, subject&nbsp; to regulation,&nbsp; concludes the Bank in sustaining this appeal.</p><p>On the other hand Lim Hu's counsel argues that "the application for license&nbsp; by petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; without&nbsp; foreign exchange"&nbsp; and therefore beyond the power&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Bank to regulate.</p><p>Of course, it may readily be seen that, for the purposes of this importation Lim Hu&nbsp; did not have to buy foreign exchange, i. e., did not have to&nbsp; remit&nbsp; money from Hongkong.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; transaction&nbsp; would&nbsp;&nbsp; have "international&nbsp; financial&nbsp; implications"&nbsp; as&nbsp; dealing&nbsp;&nbsp; with foreign&nbsp; drafts or promissory notes—that is&nbsp; the question, which for&nbsp; reasons stated below,&nbsp; we find it unnecessary to decide.</p><p>With&nbsp; the approval of Republic Act No. 1296 effective June 16, 1955&nbsp; and Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1410 effective September 10,&nbsp; 1955 a&nbsp; writ of mandamus may not&nbsp; now&nbsp; be issued to allow this importation, because&nbsp; after June 16, 1955&nbsp; Lim Hu&nbsp; could not be permitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; import onions, potatoes and garlic (Republic Act No. 1296) —with&nbsp; or without foreign&nbsp; exchange—and under Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1410 this importation under the so-called&nbsp; "no-dollar remittance" may not be permitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; If it&nbsp; be argued&nbsp; that Lim&nbsp; Hu's application&nbsp; had been submitted before the passage of the two laws, the&nbsp; reply&nbsp; would be that&nbsp; no saving clause was inserted in said statutes exempting&nbsp; from their prohibition all&nbsp; applications for&nbsp; importation previously filed.</p><p>The resultant situation is that, because this importation can not now be permitted, the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank may not&nbsp; be required&nbsp; to grant&nbsp; petitioner's application for&nbsp; license.</p><p>Wherefore, the lower court's order allowing the importation, should be, as it is hereby,&nbsp; reversed and the&nbsp; petition for mandamus&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; No costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
