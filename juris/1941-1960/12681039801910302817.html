				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to vacate an appointment of a receiver by 
order of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. A preliminary injunction 
has been granted by us restraining the carrying out of the order. The 
appointment would authorize the receiver to take possession of a parcel of land 
and to "preserve and administer the crops or products thereon and to perform all 
acts necessary and incident thereto during the pendency of this case."
<p>None of the pleadings filed in the main case are before us, except a copy of 
a supplemental complaint, and the reference to those pleadings in the proceeding 
at bar furnishes indefinite and scanty information on their contents. However, 
the application for certiorari, the answer, and the various court orders 
relative to the appointment of a receiver afford sufficient data to serve as 
basis for a decision.</p>
<p>It seems that Eugenia Ylarde was the legal or common-law wife of one 
Simplicio Rosario, now deceased. It would also seem that in his life time, 
during his marriage or cohabitation with Eugenia Ylarde, Rosario was granted a 
free patent to a homestead measuring fifteen hectares. This is the land or it is 
a part of this land that is involved in this litigation. According to the 
respondents' answer to the application for certiorari, in 1938, after Eugenia 
Ylarde's legal or common-law husband died, "an extrajudicial partition (was) 
executed" by Eugenia Ylarde "wherein she falsely declared under oath that she 
was the sole heiress of the estate in question." Following that so-called 
extrajudicial partition a transfer certificate of title was issued in Eugenia 
Ylarde's name cancelling the original document.</p>
<p>In September, 1945, Bienvenido Sabado, Magdalena Sabado and Apolinario 
Sabado, apparently Simplicio Rosario's collateral relatives, brought the present 
action against Eugenia Ylarde. The application for certiorari describes the 
action as one "relating to the ownership of a piece of property." The 
respondents in this proceeding brand this statement, in their answer, as 
incorrect, "the true fact being that the action refers (1) to the recovery of 
land * * *, and (2) for the recovery of damages in the amount of P50,000." It 
also appears that during the pendency of the action or before—there is 
uncertainty in the allegations as to the time and the parties—two or three other 
so-called extrajudicial partitions were made whereby a portion of three hectares 
out of the entire tract was allotted to the Sabados. These partitions are 
repudiated and sought to be annulled as fraudulent in a supplemental complaint 
filed by the respondents herein in the principal case.</p>
<p>On December 17, 1946, Eugenia Ylarde died, and she has been substituted as 
party defendant by Rodolfo Ylarde, Flor de Vida Ylarde through a guardian <i>ad 
litem</i>, and Julia Ylarde. The record does not reveal the degree of 
relationship between these new defendants and the deceased Eugenia Ylarde.</p>
<p>The Ylardes, petitioners herein and defendants in the main ease, allege that 
they are and hare been in the possession of the part of the land which 
corresponded to them or to Eugenia Ylarde in the partition while the Sabados 
entered upon the possession of their share upon the signing of the settlements. 
The respondents' (the Sabados') attorney denies in a strong and improper 
language that the petitioners are in "physical" possession of the property in 
dispute. But from the use of the adjective "physical" we are to presume that the 
respondents admit that the Ylardes enjoy some kind of possession, say, 
possession through representatives, croppers or tenants. Be that as it may, from 
the very nature of the remedy of receivership which the Sabados applied for, 
from their claim of P50,000 damages, and from their allegations and arguments we 
cannot avoid the conclusion that their adversaries and their adversaries' 
predecessor in interest do have the possession. The opposite theory would be an 
incongruity.</p>
<p>Upon these facts we shall proceed to state our opinion.</p>
<p>"The appointment of a receiver, because of its drastic nature and of its 
character as a special remedy under our Code of Civil Procedure, is a power 
which should be exercised with great caution." (Philippine Motor Alcohol Corp. 
and Palanca <i>vs</i>. Mapa, 64 Phil., 714.) "Where the effect of the 
appointment of a receiver is to take real estate out of the possession of the 
defendant before the final adjudication of the rights of the parties, the 
appointment should be made only in extreme cases and on a clear showing of 
necessity therefor in order to save the plaintiff from grave and irremediable 
loss or damage." (Mendoza <i>vs</i>. Arellano and B. de Arellano, 36 Phil., 59.) 
Of equal application is "the rule that a court should not, by means of a 
preliminary injunction, transfer property in litigation from the possession of 
one party to another * * * where the legal title is in dispute and the party 
having possession asserts ownership in himself." (Gordillo and Martinez 
<i>vs</i>. Del Rosario, 39 Phil., 829; Evangelista <i>vs</i>. Pedreñas, 27 
Phil., 648; Palafox <i>vs</i>. Madamba, 19 Phil., 444; Devesa <i>vs</i>. Arbes, 
13 Phil., 273; 53 C. J., 26.) If, save in exceptional cases, a preliminary 
injunction is improper where real property is involved, receivership is even 
more so because it is harsher, more drastic and more costly than an injunction. 
It has been said that "of all the extraordinary remedies authorized by law, the 
appointment of a receiver is the most drastic and far-reaching in its effect." 
(Delcambre <i>vs</i>. Murphy, 5 S. W. [2d], 789-791. cited as a footnote in 53 
C. J., 20.)</p>
<p>No special circumstances are present which would take this case out of the 
rule enunciated in the foregoing decisions.</p>
<p>Those decisions are rooted in a positive provision of the former Code of 
Civil Procedure which is now to be found in Section 1 (<i>b</i>), Rule 61, of 
the Rules of Court. According to this Section it is necessary in granting the 
relief of receivership that the "property or fund (be) in danger of being lost, 
removed or materially injured."</p>
<p>The land which is the subject matter of the suit here is not in any danger of 
disappearing or being wasted. There is no pretense that it has any permanent 
improvements or fixtures which produce income, rents or profits to be collected 
or preserved. At the most a bond with sufficient sureties would be adequate to 
protect the plaintiffs from any possible injury consequent upon being deprived 
of the possession of the property.</p>
<p>The fact that there are harvested or standing crops to which the plaintiffs 
lay claim does not improve their position. If anything, the existence of such 
crops adds to the inequity and injustice of the measure. Section 1 (<i>b</i>) of 
Rule 61 requires that the party applying for the appointment of receiver should 
have "an interest in the property which is the subject of the action." We take 
this rule to envision actual, existing interest. Except for the plaintiffs' 
alleged title to the land, (which, as we have pointed out, may not be taken away 
from the defendants), the plaintiffs' relation to the products is that of 
complete strangers. These products are short-time crops which have been planted 
and raised exclusively by the defendants personally or through others. They cost 
painstaking care and diligent industry to raise and, it is said, have exacted an 
investment of P1,000 per hectare. There is no partnership or anything of the 
sort formed between the plaintiffs and the defendants by contract or by 
operation of law in their production. Independent of their pretended ownership 
of the land, the plaintiffs have no title to a single onion or cabbage planted 
on or harvested from it, or to any part of the proceeds of the crops, or to the 
management of the enterprise. Their title to the crops is contingent upon their 
success in proving their asserted title to the soil, which is still to be 
decided. And even if they should ultimately succeed in that, their rights to the 
products would still be dependent upon many factors yet undetermined.</p>
<p>These observations bring to mind another well-recognized principle in matters 
of receivership which has been overlooked. A receiver, it has been repeatedly 
held, should not be granted where the injury resulting therefrom would probably 
be greater than the injury ensuing from leaving the possession of the property 
undisturbed. (53 C. J., 37.)</p>
<p>This doctrine fits into the case at bar. The court would place in the hands 
of a receiver to administer, crops to plant and raise which, as we have seen, 
the defendants have spent considerable money and attention with the plaintiffs 
contributing nothing beyond their allegation that they own the ground. The 
receivership would have the defendants replaced in working or looking after the 
working of the land by a man who is said to live in Manila and whose ability and 
experience in farming is, to say the least, has not been demonstrated. The court 
has not apparently given thought to where the receiver, if he continued the 
planting and raising of onions and other crops, would get the wherewithal. Would 
he sell the crops and use the money realized therefrom to finance the 
enterprise? If that money be insufficient would he borrow—if he could? And the 
Court has not made any provision—if indeed it would be practical to make such 
provision at this stage of the litigation—regarding the distribution of 
profits—or losses which would be the more probable outcome of the intended 
arrangement.</p>
<p>The allegations in the application for an appointment of a receiver reveals, 
in our opinion, additional reasons for denying it. As we have said, we gather 
from these allegations that Eugenia Ylarde had been in possession of the land 
and had been cultivating it and applying its products to her own use to the 
exclusion of the plaintiffs. Judging by the amount of damages asked by the 
plaintiffs, that possession and the enjoyment of the products by Eugenia Ylarde 
must have lasted a long time. If Eugenia Ylarde's possession was tolerated so 
long as to make possible the accumulation of P50,000 damages, we see no special 
reason why the <i>status quo</i> should not be maintained now that the cause, as 
we gather from the pleadings, has entered the trial stage.</p>
<p>It would seem that the application for receivership was motivated by Eugenia 
Ylarde's death; and the burden of the application is that the present defendants 
are not Eugenia's lawful heirs, besides the plaintiffs' claim for enormous 
damages. But receivership is not a legal or proper substitute for an appointment 
of a judicial administrator or for a relief to secure the payment of damages. 
Other remedies are indicated to protect rights based on these considerations. 
And the allegation that the present defendants are not entitled to succeed to 
Eugenia Ylarde's rights and interests in the property in litigation is a matter 
with which the plaintiffs have little to do. Juridically, it concerns Eugenia 
Ylarde's relatives, devisees or legatees alone. The plaintiffs have to rely on 
the strength of their case and not on the weakness of their adversaries'. 
Procedurally, the way is open to the plaintiffs to more for the appointment of 
an administrator of Eugenia Ylarde's estate, or to amend their complaint by 
bringing in as defendants those who, according to them, have a better right to 
inherit from the decedent. As a matter of fact, if the defendants' allegation in 
their application for certiorari is correct—that they have been substituted for 
Eugenia Ylarde—the change must have been accomplished by an amendment of the 
complaint by the plaintiffs themselves. If this be the case, the plaintiffs are 
assuming two inconsistent positions which they are not allowed to do.</p>
<p>Other objections of legal, practical and equitable character might be adduced 
against the receivership in question. What has been said is enough to show that 
the court's discretion, in our opinion, has not been exercised in accordance 
with law and with established principles and practice. It has apparently not 
given a careful and full consideration to all the facts of the case and the 
harmful and serious consequences of its order in contrast to the possible less 
injurious effects on the plaintiffs of a decision to leave matters as they 
are.</p>
<p>The objection that the petitioners have a remedy by appeal is not well taken. 
An appointment of a receiver is an interlocutory matter, and an appeal from an 
order making such appointment can be interposed only after final judgment is 
rendered. In this case an appeal would be of no avail to prevent the enforcement 
of the order before damage which the petitioners seek to avoid had been done. 
(<i>See</i> II Comments on the Rules of Court by Moran, p. 18, and cases 
cited.)</p>
<p>Upon the foregoing considerations, we hold that the court below abused its 
discretion in appointing a receiver. The appointment is revoked, with costs 
against the respondents other than the respondent Judge.</p><i>Moran, C.J., 
Pablo, Perfecto, Hontiveros,</i> and <i>Padilla, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
