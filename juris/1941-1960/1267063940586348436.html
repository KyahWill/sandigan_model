Mangampo was prosecuted in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila charged with a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 303 in relation to Article 315, paragraph 4,&nbsp; sub-paragraph 2&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; It is alleged in the information that on&nbsp; or about&nbsp; and&nbsp; during the period&nbsp; comprised between February 8 and 26,&nbsp; 1952, the said defendant, being an independent contractor engaged in the unloading of cement belonging to the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co., Inc., from the boat&nbsp; ("Banzai Maru"), hired the services of Tomas Carnecete and 35 others whom he employed as foremen, watchmen, signalmen, laborers, etc.,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the daily&nbsp; wages and for the number of days mentioned in the indictment, and that after they had&nbsp; unloaded the&nbsp; same,&nbsp; the defendant with&nbsp; intent to defraud, wilfully&nbsp; and&nbsp; feloniously refused and failed to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; their wages despite repeated demands made upon him to do so, to&nbsp; their damage&nbsp; and prejudice in the respective amounts given in front of their names, to wit:<br><br><table style="width: 589px; height: 918px;" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="75%">Tomas&nbsp;

guilty as charged in the information&nbsp; and sentenced him to&nbsp; suffer an indeterminate penalty of not less than 4 months of <em>arresto&nbsp; mayor</em> and&nbsp; not more than 4 years and 8 months of <em>prision correctional</em>,&nbsp; to the accessory penalties&nbsp; of the law, to indemnify the corresponding laborers in their respective&nbsp; unpaid wages, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</p><p>From this verdict&nbsp; defendant appealed to this Superiority&nbsp; and his&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; maintains in this instance&nbsp; that&nbsp; the lower court erred&nbsp; (1) in not taking into consideration the fact that the defendant-appellant was put in double jeopardy because he has been convicted previously in Criminal Case No. 24569 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XIII;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; in&nbsp; not acquitting&nbsp; the defendant-appellant.</p><p>Sometime&nbsp; in February, 1952,&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; the services of about 286 laborers&nbsp; from Binondo, Manila, and took them to&nbsp; Mariveles, Bataan, to unload cement&nbsp; from the ship <em>Banzai Maru</em>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 36 complainants in this case were among the&nbsp; laborers brought by&nbsp; appellant to Mariveles who worked from February 8 to&nbsp; February 26,&nbsp; 1952, inclusive. The agreement was that appellant was to pay each laborer or stevedore&nbsp; upon completion of the&nbsp; work and at different rates&nbsp; of compensation depending on the nature of the individual work of each laborer.&nbsp; Inspite of the fact that&nbsp; their work had been&nbsp; terminated and&nbsp; notwithstanding their&nbsp; repeated&nbsp; demands&nbsp; for payment,&nbsp; complainants have not as yet been fully&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by appellant. After deducting the small amounts that appellant delivered to complainants at&nbsp; the time they were still in&nbsp; Mariveles, the latter have not yet been paid the balance still due them as listed' above, amounting to the aggregate&nbsp; sum of P4,068.52.</p><p>Appellant told complainants that his failure to pay&nbsp; them in full was&nbsp; due to the fact that the Pan-Philippine Shipping Co., Inc., with whom he had a contract for services (Exhibit A) has&nbsp; not as yet given him&nbsp; the <em>entire payment</em> for the stevedoring services.&nbsp; But upon discovering that appellant was telling a falsehood—because he had received P9,460 from the Pan-Philippine&nbsp; Shipping Co., Inc., and had signed a quit-claim deed&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; C) in favor of the Union&nbsp; Trading Company, Inc.,&nbsp; by virtue of&nbsp; which, and in consideration of the sum of P3,900 he released the said company&nbsp; from any further&nbsp; claim or&nbsp; claim's&nbsp; from&nbsp; any stevedoring&nbsp; services—complainants caused the&nbsp; institution of the&nbsp; present criminal action.</p><p>Forty-five of appellant's&nbsp; laborers&nbsp; preferred&nbsp; charges against him with the&nbsp; City Fiscals Office.&nbsp; According to the defense&nbsp; this office&nbsp; divided the action into 3 cases or groups.&nbsp; The first was filed on November 12, 1953, in the Court of First Instance of Manila against appellant at the instance of 7 of the&nbsp; unpaid complaining laborers (Criminal Case No. 24569)&nbsp; which was&nbsp; assigned&nbsp; to&nbsp; Branch XIII of said court and decided on August 16, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; This case is pending appeal&nbsp; in the Court of Appeals&nbsp; (CA-G. R.&nbsp; No. 13394-R).</p><p>The second case was filed in the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila on November&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended parties allegedly are&nbsp; the complainants herein (36).&nbsp; This case was&nbsp; elevated on&nbsp; appeal to the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila, Branch XIII (Criminal Case No. 27867) and was finally decided against appellant on&nbsp; December 17, 1954, who then took the matter up to the Court of Appeals (CA-G. R. No. 14132-R), where it is&nbsp; now pending.</p><p>Then came&nbsp; the&nbsp; third case&nbsp; which was initiated by&nbsp; the City FiscaFs Office,on August&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1954, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; Branch XVII, and decided&nbsp; by this court on January 24, 1955.&nbsp; This is the case now on appeal before&nbsp; Us.</p><p>Sections 1 and 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 303 which are pertinent to the case at bar, provide the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SECTION&nbsp; 1. Every employer, including the head&nbsp; of every&nbsp; goverment office,&nbsp; whether national, provincial or municipal, shall pay the salaries and wages of his employees and laborers at&nbsp; least once every two weeks or one-half month&nbsp; unless it be&nbsp; impossible to do&nbsp; so&nbsp; due to <span style="font-style: italic;">force majeure</span> or to&nbsp; some other&nbsp; causes beyond his&nbsp; control, or unless he has been previously exempted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Secretary of Labor from this requirement.&nbsp; Exemption may be granted by the Secretary of Labor only if,&nbsp; after&nbsp; the proper inquiry, he becomes convinced that the conditions and&nbsp; exigencies of the business&nbsp; of an employer require less frequent&nbsp; payment of salaries&nbsp; and wages but no&nbsp; employer shall be authorized to make such payment with less frequency than once a month and unless he establishes a&nbsp; store within or near the&nbsp; business premises from which the employees and laborers&nbsp; can conveniently buy foodstuffs and other&nbsp; articles of&nbsp; prime necessity v&nbsp;&nbsp; at cost&nbsp; and&nbsp; on credit, payable at the following pay day.&nbsp; </p><p>* * * SEC.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Failure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; employer to pay his employee or laborer as required by section one of this act, shall <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> he considered a fraud&nbsp; committed by such employer against his employee or laborer by means of&nbsp; false&nbsp; pretenses similar to those mentioned in article three hundred&nbsp; and fifteen, paragraph four, sub-paragraph two (a) of the&nbsp; revised&nbsp; Penal Code&nbsp; and shall be punished&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same manner as therein provided."</p></blockquote><p>Appellant admits that he was&nbsp; not able to pay in full the services of the herein 36 complainants, but he claims that he has been placed in double jeopardy because he had been previously convicted in Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 24569&nbsp; (he must&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 27837&nbsp; decided by&nbsp; the lower court on December 17, 1954) which is now pending before the Court of Appeals (CA—G. R. No. 14132-R).</p><p>We see, therefore, that the only question at issue in this appeal is whether in view of the facts alleged by the defense, appellant's plea of double jeopardy is tenable.&nbsp; An examination of the record&nbsp; shows that on February&nbsp; 13, 1954, appellant filed in the lower court a motion to&nbsp; quash based on 3 grounds, one of which was that "the defendant had been<em> previously convicted</em> and is now in jeopardy of being convicted for the&nbsp; second time of the same&nbsp; crime for which he is actually&nbsp; prosecuted."&nbsp; We do&nbsp; not find in the record the&nbsp; order&nbsp; disposing of said motion to quash, although counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; appellant says in his&nbsp; brief that it was denied.&nbsp; This counsel, however, must be confused because the case docketed as Criminal Case No. 27837&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Manila is not the case at&nbsp; bar which&nbsp; was&nbsp; docketed as Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 28083 of&nbsp; the said court.</p><p>According to the defense, the complainants in the second case (now CA-G. R.&nbsp; No. 14132-R)&nbsp; initiated&nbsp; in the Municipal Court of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; and&nbsp; in the case at bar (CFI— Criminal Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 28083) are the same, but&nbsp; no copy of said second case appears&nbsp; on record and the only document that We find on page&nbsp; 66 thereof that&nbsp; may&nbsp; have some connection with the facts of the present case is a decision rendered by Judge&nbsp; Ramon A. Ycasiano of the Municipal Court&nbsp; dated July 2, 1954 (Criminal Case No.&nbsp; D-10996), convicting&nbsp; the same defendant Venancio Mangampo of&nbsp; a similar violation of Commonwealth Act No. 303 in relation to&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 315 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, wherein&nbsp; the offended party is only one&nbsp; laborer, Bernardo&nbsp; Castillo, to whom he failed to pay the sum of PI 14 and this Bernardo Castillo is&nbsp; not one of&nbsp; the complainants in the case at bar.</p><p>Appellant also contends that although in CFI—Criminal Case No. 24569 (CA-G. R. No. 13394-R of the Court of Appeals)&nbsp; the&nbsp; complainants&nbsp; were&nbsp; only 7&nbsp; and&nbsp; another gr6up of 36 in the case at bar, both cases cover the same offense because the information&nbsp; filed in both cases refer to the same crime committed on the same&nbsp; dates and on the same place.&nbsp; In support of this contention, counsel for the defense cites the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tumlos, 67 Phil. 320, wherein this&nbsp; Court held that the accused performed but one indivisible criminal&nbsp; act in having stolen 13 cows at the same time and&nbsp; in the same place although 8 cows pertained to one owner and 5 to another owner.&nbsp; But the Solicitor General replies&nbsp; that appellant's claim of&nbsp; double jeopardy is not supported by the&nbsp; records, for although he raised the question of double jeopardy in his motion to quash, that was all that he&nbsp; has done.&nbsp; Neither the information nor the sentence&nbsp; in the alleged Criminal Case No. 24569&nbsp; has been submitted in evidence in this case. There&nbsp; is nothing&nbsp; in the&nbsp; record to show that the offense for which&nbsp; he&nbsp; has&nbsp; formerly&nbsp; been&nbsp; charged and convicted is the same offense prosecuted in the instant case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mere mention of criminal case numbers and alleged portions of both informations for&nbsp; which he has supposedly been tried and convicted&nbsp; is&nbsp; not sufficient proof of double jeopardy. Thus, in the case of U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Claveria, 29 Phil. 527-529, this Court held, among other things, that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"In pleading a former&nbsp; jeopardy it&nbsp; is not sufficient that&nbsp; the defendant simply alleged that<em> he had been once in jeopardy; he must both allege and&nbsp; prove specifically that&nbsp; the offense, of which&nbsp; he has been formerly convicted or acquitted, is&nbsp; the same offense for which it is proposed to try him again."</em></p></blockquote><p>The Solicitor General&nbsp; further argues that&nbsp; the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Tumlos, supra, has no bearing on this case because the act of taking in that case of theft, not susceptible of division, was only&nbsp; one, while the&nbsp; acts of appellant in contracting&nbsp; the services of the 286 laborers, 45 of whom (including the complainants&nbsp; herein)&nbsp; were not fully paid. the act of paying their partial wages and the act of non-payment&nbsp; of the salaries due&nbsp; them&nbsp; separately, constitute independent acts of deception.&nbsp; Each laborer had his own contract with&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; and if one&nbsp; laborer&nbsp; was not paid the amount due him&nbsp; on the date agreed upon, then&nbsp; such laborer could&nbsp; file&nbsp; the corresponding action to right the wrong done to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there were as many estafas as there&nbsp; are off ended parties (People&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Buted,&nbsp; 47 Off. Gaz. 6259). In the decision appealed from, the trial court says the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It appears in this case and as admitted by the accused himself, that partial&nbsp; payments had been made by him to said laborers on account&nbsp; of their wages on&nbsp; different dates&nbsp; and occasions,&nbsp; which necessarily gave rise to&nbsp; different transactions."</p></blockquote><p>We&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense of double jeopardy in the case at bar has not been established&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the information that&nbsp; initiated this case&nbsp; charges the defendant with 36 different and distinct violations of Commonwealth Act No. 303, i.e., one for each of appellant's&nbsp; laborers whose wages were not&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; their contractor,&nbsp; and as appellant has not objected to the information&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of multiplicity&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; offenses charged,&nbsp; he is deemed&nbsp; to have&nbsp; waived&nbsp; said defect and may be sentenced for&nbsp; as many&nbsp; crimes as&nbsp; are described in the information and established by the evidence (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Policher, 60 Phil.,.770; U. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Balaba, 37 Phil., 260). This latter conclusion brings to the case two necessary implications, to wit:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp; The imposition upon&nbsp; appellant of the penalty provided in Article 315,&nbsp; 3rd paragraph&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; which is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its maximum to&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span> in its minimum,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of foreman Tomas Carnecete, for his claim of P249.00, which is&nbsp; over&nbsp; P200.00, and&nbsp; the lesser&nbsp; penalty provided in Article 315, 4th paragraph of the same legal body, <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its medium and maximum periods, in each of&nbsp; the 35 other cases in which the claims of the&nbsp; offended parties do not exceed P200.00; and&nbsp; </p><p>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp; The application of the provisions of Article 70 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended by section&nbsp; 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 317,&nbsp; to the 36 eases charged in the&nbsp; information.&nbsp; The&nbsp; pertinent part of said Article 70, as amended, read as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; ARTICLE 70. * * *&nbsp; </p><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the rule&nbsp; next preceding,&nbsp; the maximum duration of the convict's sentence shall not be more than threefold&nbsp; the&nbsp; length of time corresponding to the&nbsp; most severe penalties&nbsp; imposed upon him.&nbsp; No other penalty to&nbsp; which he may be liable&nbsp; shall be inflicted&nbsp; after the sum of those&nbsp; imposed equals the same maximum period.</p><p>Such maximum period shall in no case exceed forty years.&nbsp; </p><p>(S<em>ee</em> People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Garalde, 50 Phil. 823).</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore, upon finding defendant-appellant guilty&nbsp; of 36 violations of Section 4 of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 303 in relation to Article 315, 3rd and 4th&nbsp; paragraphs, sub-paragraph&nbsp; 2 (a) of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code, and there being&nbsp; no&nbsp; modifying&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; liability attending, We sentence him as follows:&nbsp; In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of foreman&nbsp; Tomas Carnecete,&nbsp; to suffer the indeterminate penalty of from 2 months and 1&nbsp; day of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> arresto mayor</span> to" 1 year and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional; </span>and in the&nbsp; 35 other cases of unpaid laborers, to suffer in&nbsp; each of said cases the penalty&nbsp; of 3&nbsp; months and&nbsp; 11&nbsp; days of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; These penalties&nbsp; are subject to&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforequoted provisions of the Code&nbsp; that the duration of&nbsp; the complete sentence herein imposed shall not be more than threefold the&nbsp; length&nbsp; of time corresponding to the case&nbsp; of Tomas Carnecete, or 3 years and 3 days of incarceration.&nbsp;&nbsp; With these modifications, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed&nbsp; in all other respects with costs against appellant. It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.</em>, and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
