				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. GERVASIO ALGER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Gervasio Alger was charged in the Court of First Instance of 
Cebu with illegal possession of a .30 caliber rifle, model 1917, serial No. 
137428 and three rounds of ammunition. When the case was called for trial, 
defendant made an oral motion to dismiss contending that, if it be continued, he 
would be placed in double jeopardy. It appears that defendant has been 
previously accused and convicted of a crime of homicide for the perpetration of 
which he used a weapon which was made the subject of the present charge. After 
the parties had been heard in support of their respective contentions, the court 
issued an order sustaining the plea of jeopardy. Hence this appeal.
<p align="justify">The plea of jeopardy is predicated on section 9, Rule 113, 
which provides:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>"SEC. 9. Former conviction or acquittal or former jeopardy.â€”When a defendant shall have been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him 
dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the defendant, 
by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or 
other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, 
and after the defendant had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal 
of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another 
prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or 
frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is 
necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or 
information".</blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the above-quoted provision that when a 
defendant is convicted of a crime by a court of competent jurisdiction upon a 
valid information, his conviction "shall be a bar to another prosecution for the 
offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, 
or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the 
offense charged in the former complaint or information". In order that a former 
conviction may be a bar to another prosecution, it is, there Core, important to 
determine if the accused is newly prosecuted either for the same offense, or for 
any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense 
charged. Stated in another way, the new charge should refer to the same offense, 
or to any other necessarily included in it. </p>
<p align="justify">This situation does not here obtain. The record shows that the 
defendant has been previously charged and convicted of a crime of homicide 
whereas in the present case he is charged with illegal possession of a firearm. 
The two crimes are distinct from each other. It is true that he crime of 
homicide has been perpetrated with the same weapon subject of the present case, 
but this is of no consequence it appearing that the present offense was not eluded in the case of homicide for the reason that the information does not 
state that such weapon or firearm did not have the permit required by law. The 
gauge to determine if an offense is necessarily included in another offense is 
whether the accused could be held liable and convicted of that offense. The 
defendant in this case could not have been convicted of illegal possession of 
firearm in the homicide case because of the failure to allege therein an 
essential element constituting that offense. </p>
<p align="justify">We have taken notice of the fact that the trial court was 
persuaded to sustain the plea of double jeopardy in view of the ruling laid down 
in two cases previously decided by this Court (U. S. vs. Poh Chi, 20 Phil, 140; 
U. S. vs. Gustilo, 19 Phil., 208). But the ruling enunciated in said cases is 
not on all fours with the present because there the accused committed the acts 
charged with one criminal act and did so impelled by a single criminal intent. 
In the case at bar, the defendant committed two different acts with two separate 
criminal intents, to wit, the desire to take unlawfully the life of a person, 
and the willful violation of the law which prohibits the possession of a firearm 
without the required permit. Under the circumstances of this case, the plea of 
double jeopardy is of no avail. </p>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from is hereby set aside, without costs. The 
Court orders that this case be remanded to the lower court for further 
proceedings. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and
