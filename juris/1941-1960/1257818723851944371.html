				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition to review a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, dated March 10, 
1958, affirming a decision of the Collector of Customs, dated March 18, 1955, 
ordering the confiscation of 180 cases of merchandise covered by Seizure 
Identification Nos. 1956 and 1956-A.
<p>On September 2, 1954, the Philippine Navy vessel RPS Misamis Oriental arrived 
in Manila from Japan carrying, as cargo, 180 packages of various dutiable 
merchandise. The shipment consisted of three groups (1) 137 packages consigned 
to the Philippine Army Post Exchange; (2) 23 packages, to the PNOB commissary; 
and (3) those belonging to individual persons, including officers of the 
Philippine Army and Navy. The customs authorities received no manifest for this 
cargo, and discovered it only when a policeman of the Bureau of Customs 
intercepted the truck carrying the cargo.</p>
<p>The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the merchandise because 
they are unmanifested cargo; were imported without permit from the Central Bank; 
and were not covered by the requisite consular invoice. On appeal to the Court 
of Tax Appeals, this Court sustained the forfeiture only for the reason that no 
consular invoice has been presented, in violation of Sections 17 and 18 of the 
Philippine Tariff Act of 1909. Said court declared, however, that Philippine 
Navy vessels are not required to-present a manifest, but if one is required, the 
RPS Misamis Oriental has substantially complied with the requirements, and that 
there is no violation of Central Bank regulations because the importation did 
not involve sale of foreign, exchange.</p>
<p>Before this Court, the petitioner assails the decision of the lower court on 
the ground that lack or absence of consular invoice is not a cause for 
forfeiture, but that the importer should be given reasonable time to secure the 
consular verification, or to file a bond for the production of the said 
invoice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Solicitor General calls the attention of this Court to 
the error of the lower court in holding that Philippine Navy vessels are not 
required to submit a manifest to the customs authorities.</p>
<p>In Commissioner of Customs <em>vs</em>. Relunia, 105 Phil., 875, and 
Commissioner of Customs <em>vs</em>. Brillo, G. R. No. L-11902, June 29, 1959, 
we declared that merchandise brought from Japan on board RPS Misamis Oriental, a 
Philippine vessel, must be covered by a manifest and that as none was presented, 
the Commissioner of Customs correctly decreed the forfeiture of the goods.</p>
<p>In the first case, this Court thru Mr. Justice Montemayor, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Tax Court took the view that tmder said Article VI of the Customs Law 
including the different sections of the Administrative Code under it, only 
vessels engaged in foreign trade are required to submit manifests upon entering 
any Philippine port. The Tax Court apparently overlooked the reason behind the 
requirement of presenting a manifest and allowed itself to be swayed by the 
title of the law. * * *.</p>
<p>"The Tax Court also overlooked or failed to give due consideration to the 
provisions of Section 1228 which requires that every vessel from a foreign port 
or place must have on board complete written or typwritten manifests of all her 
cargoes. Said provision is quite comprehensive, if not all inclusive, with the 
exception perhaps of vessels mentioned in the second paragraph of Section 1221, 
namely, war vessels or vessels employed by any foreign government. This is 
presumably out of international courtesy. In our opinion all other vessels 
coming from foreign ports, whether or not engaged in foreign trade, arriving or 
touching upon any port in the Philippines should be provided' with a manifest 
which must be presented to the custom authorities. * * *</p>
<p>"We therefore believe and hold that the RPS 'Misamis Oriental' was required 
to present a manifest upon it arrival in Manila on September 2, 1954. * * *.</p>
<p>"In conclusion, we hold that all vessels whether private or government owned, 
including ships of the Philippine Navy, coming from a foreign port, with the 
possible exception of war vessels or vessels employed by any foreign government, 
not engaged in the transportation of merchandise in the way of trade, as 
provided for in the second paragraph of Section 1221 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, are required to prepare and present a manifest to the 
customs authorities upon arrival at any Philippine port."</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in the case at bar is hereby 
affirmed on the ground that the cargo in question is unmanifested. This 
resolution renders unnecessary the determination of the other questions raised 
in the petition. Costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed.</em></p></div>
