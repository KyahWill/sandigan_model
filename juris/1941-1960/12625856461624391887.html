				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by way of certiorari against the judgment of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals denying a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for mandamus to compel the respondent judge of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila to&nbsp; certify the&nbsp; record on appeal in Civil Case No. 21363, entitled&nbsp; "William Golangco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Genoveva S. Villalon and Augusto&nbsp; Villalon.<br><br>The proceedings had in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; mandamus are&nbsp; as follows, . according to the decision of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals:<br><blockquote>"In Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 21363&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, of Manila,&nbsp; in&nbsp; "which herein respondent&nbsp; William Golangco was&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; were&nbsp; defendants, trial&nbsp; was&nbsp; set&nbsp; for March 25,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; When the case was&nbsp; called, defendant's counsel Signified that he&nbsp; was ready and plaintiff forthwith proceeded to present his&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; After plaintiff&nbsp; rested his case&nbsp; it turned&nbsp; out that neither of defendants was present and for the first time their counsel moved for continuance, alleging that he agreed&nbsp; to&nbsp; go to trial&nbsp; in&nbsp; the belief that&nbsp; plaintiff would&nbsp; not be able to finish with his witnesses.&nbsp; The motion was&nbsp; denied and the case was considered submitted for&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; Counsel moved&nbsp; in open&nbsp; Court&nbsp; for.&nbsp; a&nbsp; reconsideration and stated that his client, Mrs. Genoveva S. Villalon, was sick. The motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.<br><br>"The&nbsp; next day, March 26,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954, defendants&nbsp; filed an urgent motion for reopening on the&nbsp; same ground,&nbsp; to wit, that Mrs.&nbsp; Villalon was ill&nbsp; in&nbsp; bed&nbsp; and had been ill for three days, for&nbsp; which reason she was not able to appear at the trial.&nbsp; Plaintiff opposed the&nbsp; motion&nbsp;&nbsp; and the same was&nbsp; subsequently denied, defendants receiving notice of the denial on March 30, 1954.&nbsp; On the following June&nbsp; 10&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; rendered&nbsp;&nbsp; its&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; copy of which was received by the defendants on June 15, 1954.&nbsp; On June 25, 1954, they filed a.motion to set aside the judgment&nbsp; and&nbsp; for a new trial&nbsp; based on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; ground&nbsp; as the previous motions, and again it was denied.1&nbsp; Copy of the order of&nbsp; denial was served&nbsp; on counsel&nbsp; for defendants&nbsp; on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; On July&nbsp; 16;,' 1954,&nbsp; defendants filed a&nbsp; motion of appeal&nbsp; from the&nbsp; judgment of the Court&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as from&nbsp; the order&nbsp; denying the. motion to&nbsp; set aside&nbsp; the judgment and for&nbsp; new trial. An&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bond&nbsp; was filed the&nbsp; same day and the record on appeal the next day, July&nbsp; 17, 1954.&nbsp; Plaintiff opposed the approval of the&nbsp; appeal bond and move to dismiss the appeal on the ground that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was filed out ,of time. * * *"<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>The Court of Appeals&nbsp; ruled that&nbsp; the record on&nbsp; appeal was presented beyond the 30-day period provided by the Rules inasmuch&nbsp; as petitioner's motion dated June 25, 1954 did not&nbsp; suspend the&nbsp; running of the period for&nbsp; the perfection of the appeal.&nbsp; The reason&nbsp; given for&nbsp; this&nbsp; ruling is that the grounds asserted in petitioner's motion of June 25,&nbsp; 1954 had already been previously raised,&nbsp; first&nbsp; in&nbsp; a motion for continuance, then&nbsp; in the motion for reconsideration denying such continuance,&nbsp; and&nbsp; lastly in a motion for reopening, all before the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; was rendered. Cited to support its ruling is Sawit, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rodas, et al., 73 Phil., 310.<br><br>The issue presented to us is as follows:&nbsp; Does a motion for new trial&nbsp; or reconsideration, filed after judgment, on the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; were hot present at the time of the trial because of illness, which reason or ground was presented before judgment first in a motion&nbsp; for continuance, then in a motion for reconsideration, and lastly in a motion for reopening, suspend the 30-day period for perfecting&nbsp; an appeal or not?&nbsp; The trial judge held that such motion was <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> and therefore did not suspend or interrupt the running&nbsp; of the period for perfecting the appeal.&nbsp; While the Court of&nbsp; Appeals also held that the presentation of said motion for new trial did not suspend or interrupt&nbsp; said period for&nbsp; appeal, it did&nbsp; so,&nbsp; not&nbsp; on the ground that the motion for new trial was <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> but on the ground that the&nbsp; said motion was for the purpose of delay.&nbsp; Stated differently, the&nbsp; question is, should the <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> rule&nbsp; be extended to a motion for new trial on the ground,&nbsp; of which has already been raised&nbsp; previously in a motion&nbsp; before judgment?&nbsp; The&nbsp; Rules are silent&nbsp; in this respect.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; have&nbsp; we&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; any decision on the matter.<br><br>Our ruling&nbsp; that a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> motion for new trial does not suspend the&nbsp; running of&nbsp; the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; finds support in&nbsp; an express provision of the Rules&nbsp; requiring the movant for&nbsp; new trial to&nbsp; point&nbsp; out&nbsp; specifically the findings or conclusions of the&nbsp; judgment which&nbsp; are contrary to law,&nbsp; or&nbsp; which are not sufficiently, borne out&nbsp; by the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 2 of Rule 37.)<br><br>Under section&nbsp; 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure (Act No.&nbsp; 190), it was not necessary&nbsp; in a motion for new.&nbsp; trial&nbsp; to point out the&nbsp; specific conclusions&nbsp; or findings of fact which were&nbsp; not supported&nbsp; by the evidence or by the law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; motion entitled the&nbsp; movant or appellant to a review&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; or decision,&nbsp; even if the alleged conclusion&nbsp; of law or&nbsp; finding&nbsp; of act&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; is&nbsp; not specially set forth&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; new trial&nbsp; (provided that an exception to the order denying the&nbsp; motion for new trial above-mentioned was made),&nbsp;&nbsp; So the real purpose of the motion for new trial on the ground of insufficiency of evidence or on the ground that it is contrary to law, under the old Rule, was to secure a review of the decision&nbsp; by&nbsp; the appellate court,&nbsp; not to make&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; rendering the&nbsp; decision re-examine&nbsp; the questioned finding of. fact or conclusion of&nbsp; law&nbsp; with a view to&nbsp; its reconsideration.<br><br>Since the&nbsp; adoption of&nbsp; the new Rules, motions&nbsp; on the ground of insufficiency&nbsp; of evidence or on the ground that the judgment is contrary to law&nbsp; which&nbsp; do not point out the supposed defects in the judgment, permitted under the. Code of Civil .Procedure as above&nbsp; set&nbsp; forth, have&nbsp; been called&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such motions are not permitted under the new Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requires&nbsp; the movant&nbsp; for the new trial based on the ground of insufficiency&nbsp; or contrariness to law to point out the findings of fact&nbsp; or conclusions of law supposed to be insufficiently borne out&nbsp; by the evidence or contrary to law; and we .have held that they do not interrupt the period of'' appeal because they&nbsp; merely cause delay.<br><br>While we feel justified in ruling that a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> motion for new trial does not interrupt the period of appeal, because&nbsp; such a motion is&nbsp; not authorized or permitted by the Rules, we do not feel so as to motions for new trial which may cause delay merely but whose use has net&nbsp; been outlawed&nbsp; by us.&nbsp; We have not prohibited the presentation of a motion for new trial on grounds previously raised in a motion prior to the rendition of the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; A ground may be insufficient for&nbsp; granting a continuance, but it may be&nbsp; sufficient for the setting aside&nbsp; of a judgment rendered after denial&nbsp; of the continuance, as when the judgment is very unjust.or unreasonable and its unreasonableness was not expected at the time the continuance is being prayed for.&nbsp; So it does not&nbsp; follow&nbsp; necessarily that&nbsp; because&nbsp; a motion for continuance had been denied, the ground used for demanding such continuance, like illness, may not be sufficient ground for obtaining a reconsideration or setting aside of a judgment.<br><br>Considering the above possibilities&nbsp; and the general rule that the presentation of&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for new&nbsp; trial after judgment ordinarily suspends the period&nbsp; of appeal,&nbsp; and there being no express prohibition against the presentation of a motion for&nbsp; new trial on grounds already previously raised, we are loathe to penalize a party for taking" advantage&nbsp; of the remedy expressly authorized&nbsp; him by the Rules,&nbsp; even if it may cause some delay, by holding that his motion for new trial does not suspend the period of appeal.&nbsp; Were we to, hold that his motion for new trial did&nbsp; not&nbsp; suspend the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of appeal, we will&nbsp; be depriving him of his day in court, a constitutional right, on a ground of dubious justice, and&nbsp; soundness.&nbsp; We feel that the ends of justice would be better subserved&nbsp; by an opportunity for&nbsp; the&nbsp; review of the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; of the court denying&nbsp; continuance and denying petitioners the&nbsp; right to present their evidence.<br><br>The&nbsp; certiorari prayed for&nbsp; is hereby granted&nbsp; and the order of the Court of Appeals reversed&nbsp; and the record on appeal&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; be certified to the latter court for, proceedings in accordance&nbsp; with the Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
