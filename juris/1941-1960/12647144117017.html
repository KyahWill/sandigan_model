				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from a  judgment of  the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, Hon. Bernabe de Aquino, presiding,  dismissing the  complaint, certified to us  by  the Court of Appeals as only questions of law are involved  in  the appeal.</p>
<p>The facts, according to the court <em>a quo,</em> are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On  April 30, 1949, a  contract of lease  was executed by  the Municipality of Camiling in favor of the defendant, Diego Z. Lopez, leasing to the latter certain fisheries of the Municipality of Camiling for three consecutive years, 1946-1949, for the sum of P9,150,  the rental to be payable in three yearly  installment, each  installment to consist of P3,050.  The defendant had paid all the lease rentals for the first two years of the lease  and part  of  the  rental  for the third year of the  lease, but defendant failed to pay a balance of Pl,779.17 corresponding to the third year.  It is the last amount which  the  Municipality of Camiling seeks to recover by virtue of this  action."  (p. 42,  record on appeal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his answer in the Court of First Instance, because the case originated in the justice of the peace court, the defendant  alleged as special defenses that the contract of lease was  null and void ab initio  and that if there was any valid  or  legal  obligation at all, the  same  had  been condoned and  released.  It appears from a  statement in the decision appealed from that the case was submitted to the court a quo  on  the  legal  point  of  whether or not the lease contract  executed between the municipality  of Camiling and  the defendant is  a valid  contract or a void contract   This is  confirmed in  appellee's brief (pp.  4 and 5).</p>
<p>The trial judge held that the contract of lease on which the action is  based was not approved by the provincial governor in violation of section 2196 of the  Revised Administrative Code,  and, therefore,  the  contract  was  void and non-existent; and that the mere fact that the lessee took possession of the leased property and paid the corresponding rentals for more than two years does not validate the contract of lease.  As authority for this ruling Municipality of Hagonoy  <em>vs</em>. Evangelista, 73 Phil., 586, is  cited.</p>
<p>In the above case, in which the Municipality of  Hagonoy sought to  enforce  a penal clause contained  in  contracts of lease of fishponds, which provided that in  case of  non-fulfillment by the lessee the latter would pay a surcharge of 20  per cent,  the  contracts of lease involved were not approved by the  provincial governor as required by section 2196 of the Eevised Administrative Code.  The court held that the contracts were null and void, because of Article 4 of the old Civil Code which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Son nulos  los  actos ejecutados contra lo dispuesto en la ley, salvo los  casos enque  la tnisma ley ordene su validez."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court also  said  that  as the principal  obligation was void,  its nullity  carried with it that of  the penal clause. (Art-1155, old Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The appellant does not dispute the applicability to the case at bar of Art. 4 of the  old Civil  Code, or of the decision  in the  above case of  Municipality of Hagonoy <em>vs</em>.  Evangelista, nor,the correctness  of the theory or principle enunciated  therein.   We must  in  all frankness state that we doubt if the  theory of said decision  is  in  consonanyce  with the sense or  spirit of the article  cit#d  or of the other principles related to its application.  We will now,  therefore,  proceed  to explain  our  views in  this respect.   What creates our doubt is the incorrect interpretation  given the  term "nulos" in Article 4 of the old Civil Code.  The acts declared void   (actos nulos)  are  those executed  in  violation of the provisions  of  law.  Not all of these  are <em>ipso facto</em> void. They may  be of two kinds, those that are <em>ipso facto</em> void and those which are merely <em>voidable</em>.   (1 Manresa 119).  The approval by the  provincial governor of  contracts entered  into and executed by  a municipal  council,  as required  in  section  2196  of the Revised Administrative Code, is  part of the system of supervision that  the  provincial  government exercises  over the municipal governments.  It is not a prohibition against municipal  councils entering  into  contracts  regarding municipal properties subject of municipal administration  or control.  It does not deny the power, right or capacity of municipal councils to enter into such  contracts; such power or capacity is recognized.  Only the exercise thereof is subject to supervision by approval or disapproval,  i.e., contracts entered in pursuance of the power would ordinarily be approved if entered into in  good faith  and for the  best  interests  of  the municipality; they  would  be denied approval if found  illegal or unfavorable to public or municipal interest.  The absence of  the approval, therefore, does not <em>per  se</em> make the contracts null  and void. In the. case at bar, except for the lack' of said approval, the contract of lease is a perfectly legitimate one.  The subject thereof are fisheries belonging  to the municipality, subject to management and administration by itself.   Neither is there anything in the contract of lease which would taint it with illegality,  like a violation of public order or public morality, or a breach of a declared national policy. 1)he contract is not ipso facto absolutely null and void.  It could have been ratified after its execution in the ordinary course of administration.  It is  merely <em>voidable</em> at  the option of the party who  in law  is granted the right to invoke its invalidity.</p>
<p>On the  one hand,  it should be noted that Article 1302 of the old Civil Code provides that persons capable of entering into a contract may not  invoke  the  incapacity  of  those with whom they contract.  In accordance with  the above provision, the lessee in the case  at bar could not allege that the contract could not be enforced against him because the contract was not approved by the governor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must take into account that the defendant, who was the  lessee, actually entered into the possession of the fisheries subject of  the lease and  paid the rentals for two  years, except the amount of P1,779.17 sought in the action, without questioning the validity of the contract because it was not approved by the governor. The defendant could have  raised  the objection  against the enforceability of the  contract before its terms were carried out.  But he did  not  do  so and actually waived the objection thereto, entering upon the fisheries subject of the lease and  paying the rentals agreed upon for two years.  After he had taken advantage of the contract, entering upon the possession of the fisheries and enjoying its fruits, with knowledge of the existence of a defect in the said contracts,  which knowledge is presumed, he  should not thereafter be permitted to attack it on the ground that the contract did not bear the approval  of the provincial governor as required by law.  (Tuakon <em>vs</em>. Domingo Lim, 10  Phil., 50; PP.  Agustinos  Recoietos <em>vs</em>.  Lichauco, 34 Phil.,  5; Behn, Meyer &amp; Co.  <em>vs</em>.  Rosatzin,  5 PhiL,  660; Chamber of Commerce, <em>vs</em>. Pua Te Ching, 14  Phil., 222.)</p>
<p>From the foregoing considerations, the judgment  appealed from should be reversed and the defendant-appellee ordered  'to pay the  plaintiff municipality  the  sum of Pl,779.17, with costs.                .</p>
