				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff, a corporation engaged in grocery and cold store business, instituted this action&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila, for the&nbsp; purpose of recovering from the defendant Bank&nbsp; certain sums of money&nbsp; allegedly paid twice by it: the&nbsp; first, during the Japanese occupation, and the second, after liberation.<p>There is no dispute&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the facts of the case except on one point which&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; later&nbsp; discussed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record shows that at the time&nbsp; World War II broke out (December 8, 1941),&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; was indebted to&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; for credit facilities and&nbsp; advances the latter had&nbsp; theretofore granted to the former (Exhibit F).&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 29, 1941, plaintiff's debt amounted to the total sum of P44,580.59, plus interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum.&nbsp; During the Japanese occupation plaintiff paid the Japanese Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., its pre-war obligation&nbsp; to defendant.&nbsp; After the surrender of Japan plaintiff, first in 1945, and later in 1947, applied&nbsp; to defendant for additional credit facilities, but plaintiff's request was denied in 1945 because&nbsp; plaintiff refused to make arrangements for the payment of its pre-war obligation (plaintiff's complaint, paragraphs 6 and 7). In the early part of 1947. about the month of April, plaintiff's business was seriously threatened by paralyzation and its previous application for credit facilities was renewed. This time plaintiff was ready to execute,&nbsp; as it did execute a promissory&nbsp; note in favor of defendant&nbsp; for&nbsp; the payment of its&nbsp; pre-war obligation at the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; PI,000 a month, with interest thereon at the rate of 5&nbsp; per cent per annum (<span style="font-style: italic;">instead of the original 8 per cent</span>) from April 29, 1947, until fully paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; By reason of plaintiff's change of attitude defendant agreed in turn to grant, and did grant,&nbsp; plaintiff additional credit facilities up to the sum of P60,000.</p><p>On May 2, 1947, Yap Tak Wing, Joseph&nbsp; Henry Ng, Chui Lim Wu, Lang Sui and&nbsp; Lee Ng solidarity executed an undertaking of suretyship in favor of defendant, guaranteeing payment of loans resulting from&nbsp; said&nbsp; credit facilities (Exhibit D).</p><p>Pursuant&nbsp; to the above mentioned&nbsp; arrangement agreed upon by the parties to this case, and&nbsp; beginning from the month of June, 1947, plaintiff paid&nbsp; defendant the agreed monthly installments of&nbsp; P1,000 on the former's&nbsp; pre-war obligation until the entire amount of plaintiff's promissory note in favor of defendant became fully liquidated&nbsp; in May, 1950 (Exhibits B, B-l to B-30).</p><p>On&nbsp; July 7, 1947, counsel&nbsp; for plaintiff wrote the submanager of defendant Bank a letter (Exhibit I) bringing to his attention&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; suretyship&nbsp; executed on May 2, 1947,&nbsp; by&nbsp; Chui Chiong &amp; Company, Inc., in favor of the&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to the validity of the payments made by plaintiff during the&nbsp; Japanese occupation to the&nbsp; Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., as liquidator of defendant Bank, and based on these premises said counsel demanded the release of the suretyship and the refund of the sum of P50,143.42,&nbsp; plus collected interests which he alleged had been wrongly paid to the&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp; To this letter the Manager of defendant Bank replied on July 16, 1952&nbsp; (Exhibit J), <em>returning the pledge agreement and two undertakings of suretyship</em> furnished by the plaintiff, but declined&nbsp; to refund the sum of P50,143.42.&nbsp; Hence&nbsp; the&nbsp; institution&nbsp; of&nbsp; this action.</p><p>In the complaint plaintiff&nbsp; prays the court&nbsp; to&nbsp; sentence defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P50,143.42, minus the sum of Pl,845.29, the amount not collected from the plaintiff,&nbsp; in addition to the sum of P3,238.78,&nbsp; more or less, for annual interest of 5 per cent, with legal interest on the&nbsp; total amount of the&nbsp; demand from&nbsp; July&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1952, plus P6,000 as attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp; This complaint was predicated on&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of this Court validating payments of pre-war obligations made during the&nbsp; Japanese occupation&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank of Taiwan, Ltd.,&nbsp; which were considered as made to creditor banks, as the defendant herein&nbsp; (Haw&nbsp; Pia&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; The&nbsp; China&nbsp; Banking Corporation, 80 Phil., 604), though it further averred that "the signing&nbsp; (of said&nbsp; promissory note)&nbsp; was premised that when the payment during the occupation by occupation pesos be declared valid by the&nbsp; authorities or by competent&nbsp; courts, then said&nbsp; promissory note be declared void and any amount or amounts paid or deposited pursuant to the promissory note be returned&nbsp; or refunded" (complaint, paragraph 8). At the hearing in the lower&nbsp; court plaintiff contended that the promissory note for&nbsp; P50,143.42 was executed<em> on the understanding had between the plaintiff and the defendant that should payments made during the Japanese occupation be&nbsp; declared valid&nbsp; by the court,&nbsp; any&nbsp; and all payments made on&nbsp; the promissory note&nbsp; would be refunded to the plaintiff.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; This supposed understanding&nbsp; was vigorously denied&nbsp; by defendant Bank,&nbsp; and without questioning the validity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; payments made to&nbsp; the Bank of&nbsp; Taiwan, Ltd.,&nbsp; in turn alleged&nbsp; in its answer that the&nbsp; promissory note in&nbsp; question was&nbsp; executed&nbsp; for&nbsp; valuable consideration and that the&nbsp; additional credit facilities granted to plaintiff after liberation were&nbsp; given by defendant only by reason of the execution by plaintiff&nbsp; of its said&nbsp; promissory&nbsp; note (paragraph&nbsp; IV&nbsp; of the answer).&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; passing&nbsp; upon&nbsp; this point the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; itself as follows:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"The defendant's contention that the promissory note is in consideration of the new credit facilities&nbsp; is&nbsp; entirely unfounded.&nbsp; <p>No businessman would&nbsp; execute a&nbsp; promissory&nbsp; note for&nbsp; P50,143.42 In&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of new&nbsp; credit facilities up&nbsp; to&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of P60,000, which&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; maximum granted&nbsp; by the defendant to&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp; It&nbsp; should be borne in mind that to secure and&nbsp; guarantee these new credit facilities an instrument entitled 'Undertaking&nbsp; of Suretyship'&nbsp; (Exhibit H) was executed by the plaintiff in favor&nbsp; of the defendant on May&nbsp; 2, 1947.&nbsp;&nbsp; This undertaking of suretyship was released in&nbsp; due course upon payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; all the amounts received by the plaintiff from&nbsp; the defendant in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; new credit&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; It would be utterly absurd&nbsp; and preposterous&nbsp; for the plaintiff to have executed the&nbsp; promissory note&nbsp; in&nbsp; question and paid its full&nbsp; amount in order to obtain credit facilities in the&nbsp; sum of P60,000, because then the plaintiff&nbsp; will be paying to the&nbsp; defendant the new&nbsp; advances, loans, credits, etc., up&nbsp; to P60,000 besides paying the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P50,143.42 of the promissory note.</p>&nbsp; In consonance with&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; theory&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff was allowed to obtain loans and advances and bound itself to pay these&nbsp; new loans or advances&nbsp; up to the sum of&nbsp; P60,000, as per its undertaking of suretyship and in&nbsp; addition thereto agreed to pay and paid&nbsp; the additional sum&nbsp; of P50,143.42 represented by the promissory&nbsp; note.&nbsp;&nbsp; No businessman&nbsp; in his sound&nbsp; mind would&nbsp; secure&nbsp; a new indebtedness of P60,000 to guarantee its payment and&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition thereto incur an indebtedness of P50,143.42 represented by the promissory&nbsp; note, payable before&nbsp; the payment of the new obligation.&nbsp; In other words, under&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; theory, the plaintiff contracted an obligation&nbsp; of f60,000 and, in full&nbsp; satisfaction&nbsp; thereof, paid P110,143.42."</blockquote><p>In consonance with these&nbsp; views the trial court rendered decision </p><blockquote>&nbsp;"ordering the defendant to return to the&nbsp; plaintiff all&nbsp; the amounts paid on the promissory note aggregating&nbsp; P48.298.13, together with the sum of&nbsp; P3.238.78&nbsp; representing interests thereon, or a total of P51,536.91, with legal&nbsp; interests&nbsp; thereon from October 29,&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; and to pay to the plaintiff attorney's fees in the&nbsp; sum of P3,000 and costs."</blockquote><p>From this&nbsp; decision the&nbsp; defendant appealed&nbsp; to us setting&nbsp; forth&nbsp; seven assignments&nbsp; of&nbsp; error.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; outset, let&nbsp; it be stated,&nbsp; notwithstanding the views expressed by the trial judge that no businessman in his sound mind would enter into a transaction in which he had to guarantee the payment&nbsp; of a new indebtedness of P60,000 and agree, in addition&nbsp; thereto, to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; before&nbsp; the settlement of the new obligation,&nbsp; an indebtedness of P50,143.42 that he had already paid <em>to&nbsp; the Bank of Taiwom, Ltd., </em>that it is a fact that in the case at&nbsp; bar plaintiff company paid not only&nbsp; the amounts&nbsp; it received&nbsp; from defendant&nbsp; after&nbsp; liberation, but also the additional&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P50,143.42 that represented its pre-war obligation&nbsp; to the defendant.&nbsp; For this reason we think that the&nbsp; questions at issue&nbsp; in this appeal may be reduced to the following propositions:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>Whether or not the evidence on record shows&nbsp; that the promissory note in question was executed on the understanding that if payments made during the Japanese occupation to the&nbsp; Bank of Taiwan, Ltd.,&nbsp; were declared valid, any and all payments made on&nbsp; the said promissory&nbsp; note shall be returned or refunded by the defendant to the plaintiff: and<br></li>&nbsp; <li>In the negative case, whether or not the&nbsp; trial judge&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in not absolving&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; in not&nbsp; sentencing&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; on&nbsp; defendant's counterclaim.</li></ol><p>Anent the first proposition, the best evidence to elucidate&nbsp; the point would&nbsp; have&nbsp; been the&nbsp; promissory note in question, because from&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; taken in conjunction with the&nbsp; undertaking of&nbsp; suretyship&nbsp; dated May 2,&nbsp; 1947 (Exhibit H),&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court could determine whether the parties agreed&nbsp; or not that payments&nbsp; made on said promissory note&nbsp; were to be refunded in case&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts declared valid and in satisfaction&nbsp; of&nbsp; pre-war obligations to the banks in the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; payments made to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., for such an important clause would not have been omitted in the promissory note if the parties really agreed to such refund.&nbsp; Unfortunately said promissory note was not produced in court and secondary evidence had to&nbsp; be offered&nbsp; by both parties because, according to plaintiff's Manager, it&nbsp; was not returned to his&nbsp; company, while defendant in turn alleged that said promissory note was returned after the obligation was&nbsp; satisfied, together with the pledge agreement and two undertakings of suretyship furnished by&nbsp; the plaintiff (referred to in&nbsp; Exhibit J), as is usual banking practices and as&nbsp; we&nbsp; are inclined to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp; This,&nbsp; of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; might&nbsp; imply a&nbsp; suppression of evidence on&nbsp; the part of the plaintiff.</p><p>Coining now to plaintiff's parole evidence on&nbsp; this matter, defendant contends that it is inadmissible&nbsp; for&nbsp; it is an attempt to incorporate in&nbsp; the promissory note&nbsp; a contemporaneous condition&nbsp; that was not therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Yu Tek &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Gonzales, 29 Phil., 384, this Court said:</p><blockquote>"Parties are presumed to have reduced to&nbsp; writing all&nbsp; the essential&nbsp; conditions of their&nbsp; contract.&nbsp; While parole evidence is admissible in a variety of&nbsp; ways to explain the meaning of written contracts, it cannot serve the purpose of incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; which&nbsp; are not&nbsp; mentioned at all in the writing,&nbsp; unless there&nbsp; has been fraud or mistake. In an early case this&nbsp; Court declined to allow parole evidence showing that a party to a written contract was to&nbsp; become&nbsp; a&nbsp; partner in a&nbsp; firm instead&nbsp; of a&nbsp;&nbsp; creditor of the firm (Pastor <em>vs.</em> Gaspar, 2 Phil. 592).&nbsp; Again in&nbsp; Eveland&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Eastern&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Co. (14 Phil. 6C9), a contract of employment&nbsp; provided that the plaintiff&nbsp; should receive from the defendant a stipulated salary and expenses.&nbsp; The defendant sought to&nbsp; interpose&nbsp; as a defense&nbsp; to recovery that the payment&nbsp; of the salary was contingent upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff's employment redounding&nbsp; to&nbsp; the benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendant company.&nbsp; The contract&nbsp; contained no such&nbsp; condition&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Court declined to receive parole evidence&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; <p>In the&nbsp; case at bar,&nbsp; it is sought to show that the sugar was to be obtained&nbsp; exclusively from the crop raised by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; There is no clause in the written contract which even&nbsp; remotely suggests such a condition.&nbsp; The defendant undertook to deliver a specified quantity&nbsp; of sugar within&nbsp; a specified time.&nbsp; The contract placed no restriction upon the&nbsp; defendant on the matter of obtaining the&nbsp; sugar. He was&nbsp; equally&nbsp; at liberty to purchase it in&nbsp; the market or&nbsp; raise it himself. It may be true that&nbsp; defendant owned a plantation and expected&nbsp; to raise the&nbsp; sugar himself, but he did not limit his obligation to his own crop&nbsp; of sugar.&nbsp; Our conclusion is&nbsp; that the condition which the&nbsp; defendant seeks to add to the contract by parole evidence cannot be&nbsp; considered.&nbsp; The rights of the parties must be determined by the writing itself."</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp; III&nbsp; Moran's Notes on the Rules of Court&nbsp; (2nd ed.),. pp. 178-179, it is stated:</p><blockquote><p>"Prior and contemporaneous collateral agreements; general rule.— When an agreement has been reduced to writing, can any of the parties thereto, by parole evidence, prove oral stipulation&nbsp; prior to, or contemporaneous with, such agreement which may in any way affect the writing?&nbsp; Where the&nbsp; parties have reduced&nbsp; their agreement to writing they are presumed to have intended the writing as the only evidence of their agreement, and, therefore,&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; supposed to have embodied therein all the terms of such agreement.&nbsp; Consequently, all prior or contemporaneous&nbsp; collateral stipulations which the parties might have had and do not appear in the&nbsp; writing, are presumed to have been waived or abandoned by them, and, therefore, not provable.&nbsp; The rule is thus stated: 'Where parties merge all prior negotiations and agreements in a writing, intending to make that the repository of their final understanding, evidence of such prior negotiations&nbsp; and&nbsp; agreements&nbsp; will be rejected as immaterial" (Galpin&nbsp; <em>vs </em>Atwater, 29 Conn. 93, 97; Caulfield <em>vs.</em> Hermann, 64 Conn. 325, 327; Brosty <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Thompson, 79&nbsp; Conn. 133).&nbsp; 'What was said&nbsp; during&nbsp; the negotiations of&nbsp; the contract or at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of its execution must be excluded on the grdund that the parties have made the writing; the only repository and memorial of the truth, and whatever is&nbsp; not found in the writing must be understood&nbsp; to have been waived and abandoned' (Van Syckel <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Dalrymple, 32 N.J. Eq. 233)".</p></blockquote><p>Anyway, as counsel for defendant observes, Lee Ng did not go as far&nbsp; as saying that F. C. Bailey bound and committed himself or defendant Bank&nbsp; to&nbsp; make such refund upon&nbsp; the happening of&nbsp; the alleged contemplated&nbsp; events he just stated that it was&nbsp; all a&nbsp; "talk",&nbsp; and&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; he admitted&nbsp; "not to remember if there&nbsp; was a stipulation." In his deposition&nbsp; (Exhibit 37),&nbsp; F. C.&nbsp; Bailey&nbsp; vigorously denied and contradicted the declaration of defendant's submanager and&nbsp; specifically stated:</p><blockquote><p>"I can say positively that there was no&nbsp; talk or discussion between Lee Ngan and&nbsp; me, or between&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; Chiu Chiong &amp; Co., Inc., and&nbsp; the National City&nbsp; Bank, the defendant, as Lee Ngan&nbsp; has testified, that there would be any refund of any of the payments..</p><p>There was no agreement that if the Supreme Court of the Philippines&nbsp; should decide that&nbsp; payments against&nbsp; pre-war obligations in occupation currency were declared valid&nbsp; the note would become null and that all the payments would be refunded.</p><p><em>In addition to my memory regarding this incident I can say that there was&nbsp; no talk or agreement to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that we,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila Branch, would make refund because the policy of&nbsp; the Bank&nbsp; as laid down by our head office and followed by the Manila Branch was that we in the branch were to&nbsp; arrange for a definite and unqualified settlement&nbsp; of the pre-war obligations in every&nbsp; instance."</em></p></blockquote><p>But even if plaintiff's secondary&nbsp; evidence to&nbsp; establish the aforementioned understanding were admissible, yet the circumstances surrounding and&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; to the signing and issuance of the&nbsp; promissory&nbsp; note in question militate against the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; questioned&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; In the first place plaintiff itself admitted in&nbsp; paragraphs 6 and 8&nbsp; of its complaint that&nbsp; in&nbsp; September,&nbsp; 1945:</p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; through&nbsp; its&nbsp; manager&nbsp; went to the office&nbsp; of the defendant and requested the latter that&nbsp; the firm be granted by the defendant&nbsp; new&nbsp; credit facilities but defendant did not accede to the request&nbsp; of the plaintiff unless said&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; (would)&nbsp; submit an&nbsp; up-to-date balance sheet corresponding to its&nbsp; pre-war&nbsp; obligation . . ."</p></blockquote><p>but that&nbsp; late in 1946 or early&nbsp; 1947</p><blockquote><p>"the plaintiff executed and signed a promissory note in favor of the defendant&nbsp; to deposit the total sum of Fifty thousand one hundred forty-three&nbsp; pesos and forty-two centavos&nbsp; (P50,143:42) covering the sum of P46,074.17&nbsp; pre-war obligations&nbsp; of the plaintiff as&nbsp; shown in a&nbsp; statement dated April 29, 1947, a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; which is&nbsp; hereto attached and marked&nbsp; Annex F, plus an additional&nbsp; sum of P4,069.25, as accrued interests covering the period from June 28, 1945, up to April 29, 1947 . . ."</p></blockquote><p>plaintiff&nbsp; giving as cause&nbsp; for executing&nbsp; and&nbsp; signing&nbsp; the promissory note so</p><blockquote><p>"that he be&nbsp; granted new credit facilities by the defendant because without such promissory note said defendant would not grant any credit facilities to the plaintiff and that would paralyze the business of the plaintiff."</p></blockquote><p>The validity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; payments&nbsp; made by plaintiff to the Bank of&nbsp; Taiwan,&nbsp; Ltd.,&nbsp; in settlement of its pre-war obligation to the defendant&nbsp; Bank is not denied or questioned by the latter, but as it did not in fact receive any money thus paid by plaintiff to the Bank of Taiwan, it naturally contends that it suffered&nbsp; thereby the corresponding loss. Consequently, when plaintiff wanted to renew commercial transactions with the defendant the latter refused to grant to the former any credit, facilities unless and until plaintiff would indemnify it for&nbsp; said loss.&nbsp; Of course, plaintiff did not like this but had finally to yield to defendant's demand because that was the only way to secure new credit facilities from&nbsp; defendant and avoid the greater&nbsp; damage that would result from the&nbsp; paralyzation&nbsp; of&nbsp; its business.&nbsp; We can infer from the averments of the complaint that plaintiff preferred to lose something in order to obtain further gains in his business rather than lose everything by having said business paralyzed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus seen that the issuance of the promissory&nbsp; note&nbsp; for the payment of the aggregate sum of P48,298.13&nbsp; plus&nbsp; interests thereon, which amounted to P3,238.78, or a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of P51,536.91, was for a&nbsp; licit and valid consideration.</p><p>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; second place,&nbsp; the&nbsp; act of the plaintiff company in continuing the payment of its pre-war obligation to defendant Bank for nearly two years after the former learned of the&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; laid down&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court in the&nbsp; aforementioned case of Haw Pia, logically leads Us to believe that the story of plaintiff's manager was an eleventh hour attempt to obtain from defendant the refund of the amount they were pressed to pay to the latter&nbsp; in order&nbsp; to avoid paralyzation of their business.&nbsp; Lee Ng testified&nbsp; in&nbsp; court as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table align="center" border="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td><td valign="top" width="95%"><div align="justify">You&nbsp; mentioned the decision of the court validating the payments made during the Japanese occupation of pre-war obligations.

Porter.&nbsp; The complaint set forth that the defendants on the 1st day of June, 1861, made their joint&nbsp; and several bond whereby .they bound themselves to pay to the plaintiff a certain specified sum of money when requested, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was a condition affixed to the bond&nbsp; which was 'That,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 25th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; March, 1861, a writ<em> fieri&nbsp; facias</em> was issued from the clerk's office&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of Porter against one Daniels for a certain sum of&nbsp; money with interest from the 2nd day of June,&nbsp; 1860&nbsp; and costs; if,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Daniels should&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; debt,&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; and costs when the&nbsp; operation of the ordinance before mentioned should cease, then the obligation to be void,&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; to be in&nbsp; full force.&nbsp; In April, 1861, a convention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the State of&nbsp; Virginia passed an ordinance of&nbsp; cessation, and on the&nbsp; 30th of that month a law entitled 'An ordinance&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide against the sacrifice of property&nbsp; and to suspend proceedings in certain&nbsp; cases'.&nbsp; It was under this law or ordinance&nbsp; that the bond sued upon was given.&nbsp; When this suit was brought the defendants pleaded,&nbsp; among&nbsp; other things,&nbsp; the&nbsp; unconstitutionally of that statute&nbsp; and ordinance.&nbsp; This law was held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be directly repugnant to&nbsp; the constitutional provisions&nbsp; which forbid&nbsp; the&nbsp; impairment&nbsp; of contracts&nbsp; by State laws.&nbsp; It&nbsp; also,held that the&nbsp; bond&nbsp; sued&nbsp; upon, as&nbsp; a&nbsp; statutory instrument, was likewise&nbsp; void, but held&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendants were estopped from raising the question of the validity of the statute and bond, the&nbsp; court saying:</p><p>'The principle&nbsp; of&nbsp; estoppel&nbsp; thus applied has&nbsp; its&nbsp; foundation&nbsp; in a wise and&nbsp; salutory&nbsp; policy.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a means of&nbsp; repose. It promotes fair dealing.&nbsp; It cannot be made an instrument of wrong or oppression, and it often gives triumph to right and justice, where nothing else known to&nbsp; our&nbsp; jurisprudence can, by its operation, secure those ends.&nbsp; Like the statute of limitations, it is a conservator,&nbsp; and without&nbsp; it&nbsp; society would&nbsp; not&nbsp; well go on.'"</p></blockquote><p>In this same case of Bismorte <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Aldecoa &amp; Co., supra, the Court stated the following:</p><blockquote><p>"The Court&nbsp; in quoting&nbsp; from the case of Ferguson&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Landram (5&nbsp; Bush-Ky.-230) cited in the above case, said:</p><p>'Upon what&nbsp; principle of exalted equity shall a man be permitted to receive a valuable consideration through a statute, procured by Ms own consent or subsequently sanctioned by him, or from which lie derived an interest and consideration and then keep the consideration, and repudiate the statute?</p><p>It is a principle of&nbsp; law of universal application&nbsp; (and as just as it is general) that admissions, whether of law or of fact, which have been&nbsp; acted upon by&nbsp; others are considered against the party jnaking them, in all cases between him&nbsp; and the&nbsp; person whose conduct he has&nbsp; thus influenced;&nbsp; and the&nbsp; principle is founded upon .grounds of public policy&nbsp; that a&nbsp; man&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not be&nbsp; permitted to repudiate his own representations."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Toppan <em>vs.</em> Cleveland C. &amp; C. R. Co., Fed. Cas.&nbsp; No. 14099—Bismorte <em>vs.</em> Aldecoa &amp;&nbsp; Co., 17 Phil., 486-87.).</p></blockquote><p>We could still adduce many other&nbsp; facts and&nbsp; authorities against plaintiff's&nbsp; theory, but we&nbsp; feel that the foregoing considerations are&nbsp; more&nbsp; than&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; disprove&nbsp; its pretension.</p><p>With regard to the second proposition, we are of&nbsp; the opinion and&nbsp; so hold that&nbsp; defendant's counterclaim in the sum of P6,000 for and as attorney's fees should also be dismissed.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; reversed and judgment is entered dismissing both plaintiff's complaint and defendant's counterclaim, with costs against plaintiff-appelle.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
