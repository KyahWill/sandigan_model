				<H3>VERONICA SANCHEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Veronica Sanchez is the owner of a two-story, four-door 
"accessoria" building at 181 Libertad Street, Pasay City, which she constructed 
in 1947. The building has an assessed value of P21,540 and the land is assessed 
at P7,980, or a total value of P29,540 (Exhibit 2). While appellant lives in one 
of the apartments, she is renting the rest to other persons. In 1949, she 
derived an income therefrom of P7,540 (Exhibit 1). Appellant also runs a small 
dry goods store in the Pasay market, from which she derives an annual income of 
about P1,300 (also Exhibit 1).
<p>In the early part of 1951, the Collector of Internal Revenue made demand upon 
appellant for the payment of P163.51 as income tax for the year 1950, and P637 
as real estate dealer's tax for the years 1946 to 1950, plus the sum of P50. as 
compromise (Exhibt 4). Appellant paid the taxes demanded under protest, and on 
October 16, 1951 filed action in the Court of First Instance of Manila (C. C. 
No. 14957) against the Collector of Internal Revenue for the refund of the taxes 
paid, claiming that she is not a real estate dealer. The lower Court, after 
trial, found appellant to be such a dealer, as defined by section 
194(<em>s</em>) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic 
Act Nos. 42 and 588, and declared the collection of the taxes in question legal 
and in accordance with said provision. Wherefore, Veronica Sanchez appealed to 
this Court.</p>
<p>At the outset, it should be noted that while appellant claims the refund of 
the amount of P825 allegedly paid by her to the Collector of Internal Revenue as 
real estate dealer's tax, it appears that the sum of P163.31 thereof corresponds 
to her income tax for the year 1949 (Exhibit 4), so that the amount of tax 
actually involved herein is only P687, paid by appellant as real estate dealer's 
tax for the years 1946 to 1950. We notice also that the lower Court, in deciding 
this case, applied the definition of "real estate dealer" in section 194 
(<em>s</em>) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Acts 
Nos. 42 and 588. Republic Act No. 588 took effect only on September 22, 1950, 
while the tax in question was paid by appellant1 for the years 1946 to 1950. 
Hence, the law applicable to this case is section 194(s) of the Tax Code before 
it was amended by Republic Act No. 588, which defines real estate dealers as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'Real estate dealers' includes all persons who for their own account are 
engaged in the sale of lands, buildings or interests therein or in leasing real 
estate." (R. A. No. 42)</p></blockquote>
<p>Does appellant fall within the above definition ? We are of the opinion that 
she does. The kind and nature of the building constructed by her—which is a 
four-door "accessoria"—shows that it was from the beginning intended for lease 
as a source of income or profit to the owner; and while appellant resides in one 
of the apartments, it appears that she always rented the other apartments to 
other persons from the time the building was constructed up to the time of the 
filing of this case.</p>
<p>The case of Argellies <em>vs</em>. Meer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> G. R. No. L-3730, promulgated on April 25, 
1952, cited by appellant in support of her appeal, is not in point. In that 
case, Argellies had always resided outside the Philippines, and his properties 
in Manila were administered and managed by a local real estate company. We held 
that Argellies could not be considered as engaged in business of letting real 
estate, because he did not appear to have reinvested the rents received by him 
from this country, nor to have taken part in the management of his local 
holdings. In the case at bar, however, it was appellant who had the apartment in 
question constructed, purposely for lease or profit, and she manages the 
property herself. While she runs a small store in Pasay market, it is unlikely, 
and the evidence does not show, that she devotes all her personal time and labor 
to such store, considering its size and the fact that she derives little income 
therefrom. On the other hand, the work of attending to her leased property and 
her tenants would not take much of her time and attention, especially since she 
lives in the premises herself. And the leasing of her apartment appears to be 
her principal means of livelihood, for the income she derives therefrom amounts 
to more than five times that which she makes from her store.</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, that appellant constructed her four-door "accessoria" 
purposely for rent or profit; that she has been continuously leasing the same to 
third persons since its construction in 1947; that she manages her property 
herself; and that said leased holding appears to be her main source of 
livelihood, we conclude that appellant is engaged in the leasing of real estate, 
and is a real estate dealer as defined by section 194 (s) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 42.</p>
<p>Appellant argues that she is already paying real estate taxes on her 
property, as well as income tax on the income derive therefrom, so that to 
further subject its rentals to the "real estate dealers' tax" amounts to double 
taxation. This argument has already been rejected by this Court in the case of 
People <em>vs</em>. Mendaros, et al., L-6975, promulgated May 27, 1955, wherein 
we held that "it is a well settled rule that license tax may be levied upon a 
business or occupation although the land or property used therein is subject to 
property tax", and that "the state may collect an <em>ad valorem</em> tax on 
property used in a calling, and at the same time impose a license tax on the 
pursuit of that calling", the imposition of the latter kind of tax being in no 
sense a double tax.</p>
<p>The evidence shows, however, that the apartment house in question was 
constructed only in 1947, while the real estate dealer's tax demanded of and 
paid by appellant was for the years 1946 to 1950 (see Exhibit 4). Wherefore, 
appellant is entitled to a refund of the tax paid for the year 1946, amounting 
to P37.50.</p>
<p>With the modification that the appellee Collector of Internal Revenue is 
ordered to refund to appellant Veronica Sanchez the amount of P37,50 paid as 
real estate dealer's tax for the year 1946, the decision appealed from is, in 
all other respects, affirmed. Costs against appellant. So ordered.</p>
