				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Josefina Ruiz de Luzuriaga Blanco is the widow, and the other 
Appellants, except Claudio R. de Luzuriaga-who is the attorney-in-fact of some 
of them-are the children of Eugenio Mas Fernandez who died in Barcelona, Spain, 
in May, 1933, leaving, among other properties, some bonds of Central Azucarera 
de Bais which he had deposited with and entrusted to the care and administration 
of the Compania Gral. de Tabacos de Filipinas-hereinafter referred to as 
Tabacalera. After his death Tabacalera remained in charge of his estate in the 
Philippines- including the bonds aforesaid-the account having been transferred 
in the corporate books in the name of "Herederos de Eugenio Mas". Subsequently, 
said bonds were redeemed and the proceed thereof were invested by Tabacalera, 
as stated hereinafter, in the purchase of bonds issued by Central Azucarera de 
Tarlac-hereafter referred to as the Central.
<p>It appears that on November 15, 1928 the Central issued for sale to the 
public, debenture bonds of Pl,000 each, payable on or before November 15, 1943, 
with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, payable semiannually as per 
interest coupons attached to the bond certificates. Their issuance was in 
accordance with the trust indenture entitled "Escritura de Hipoteca 
Fideicomisaria" now marked as Exhibit "1". Among the purchasers thereof were 
Tabacalera itself which purchased 717 bonds; Tabacalera's affiliate, Tabacalera 
Insurance Company, which purchased 55 bonds; "Tabacalera Caja de Prevision del 
Personal de la Tabacalera", another affiliate of Tabacalera, which purchased 58 
bonds; Antonio V. Correa, Vice Director of Tabacalera, who purchased 19 bonds; 
Federico Perez "Jefe Comercial" of Tabacalera, who purchased 37 bonds, and 
Manuel Perez Rosales, a Director of Tabacalera, who purchased 5 bonds.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1933, appellants purchased 70, and on December 6 of the same 
year they again purchased 45 of the bonds above-mentioned issued by the Central. 
Of the 115 bonds thus purchased by appellants, 41 were redeemed prior to January 
1, 1942, leaving 74 bonds, with a total par value, exclusive of interest, of 
P74,000.00, still outstanding or unredeemed. When the second world war broke out 
in the Pacific area these 74 bonds were still deposited with Tabacalera against 
deposit receipts (Exhibits F and G) reading as follows:</p>

<p>The record further discloses that on October 5, 1939 appellants executed the 
power of attorney Exhibit 4 in favor of Tabacalera, the pertinent portion of 
Which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>".................................................... CONFIERE PODE 
.......................................................<br>a la Compania General 
de Tabacos de Filipinas y por ella a cualquiera de sus Gerentes, apoderados o 
legitimos representantes para que con respecto a los valores y titttlos que las

Fernandez en la propia Compania mandataria en Manila, cobre los cupones

resguardos recibos y cuantos otros documentos sean necesarios, puesto que la 
entidad mandataria queda plenamente facultada para disponer sin limitacion ni 
restriccion alguna de los valores depositados en la propia 
Compania."</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">(Exhibit 4)</p>
<p>Under the trust indenture Exhibit 1, in accordance with which the bonds of 
the Central were issued, the 2,500 bonds still outstanding when the second world 
war broke out in the Pacific area could be redeemed <em>on or before November 
15, 1943</em>. On March 15 of said year the Central gave written notice to 
Tabacalera-who was the trustee of the bondholders under the aforesaid bond 
indenture-of its intention to redeem them. Aside from this notice on May 10, 11 
and 12 of the same year, the required notice calling in the 2,500 outstanding 
bonds was published in the corresponding issues of the Manila Tribune and of La 
Vanguardia.</p>
<p>The evidence likewise shows that on or about April 17, 1943 the Central 
negotiated a loan with the Bank of Taiwan in the sum of P2,500,000.00 for the 
purpose-obviously-of having the required amount with which to redeem the 
outstanding 2,500 bonds. On May 15, 1943 the Central drew a P2,500,000.00 check 
against the Bank of Taiwan, payable to Tabacalera, in the latter's capacity as 
trustee of the iondholders, in full payment or discharge of the aforesaid 
outstanding bonds, said trustee being under obligation to make payments to the 
different owners thereof. Upon receipt of the check aforesaid Tabacalera 
deposited the amount it represented with the Bank of Taiwan in a special account 
entitled "Cuenta Fideicomisaria de la Central Azucarera de Tarlac."</p>
<p>Pursuant to the notices published as mentioned heretofore, a total of 1,987 
bonds were redeemed and paid for-with Japanese Military Notes-on May 15, 1943, 
among them being the 74 bonds of appellants; 717 bonds of Tabacalera; 58 bonds 
of the "Tabacalera Caja de Prevision del Personal"; 55 bonds of Tabacalera 
Insurance Company; 19 bonds of Antonio V. Correa and 37 bonds of Federico Perez. 
On the date of payment, according to the Ballantyne scale of values, the rate of 
exchange was 1.25 Japanese military note to P1.00, Philippine currency. The 
proceeds obtained from the redemption of appellants' bonds, amounting to 
P74,000.00 in Japanese military notes, were placed in the account of Tabacalera 
in its capacity as depositary and trustee appointed by appellants. In fact, it 
remained so deposited with Tabacalera during the whole period of the Japanese 
occupation. In this connection, the lower court found-and we believe its finding 
is duly supported by sufficient evidence-that during the whole period of the 
Japanese occupation and until the liberation of the Philippines in 1945, 
Tabacalera had sufficient funds deposited in Manila banks to cover the aforesaid 
amount of P74,000.00, and that up to December 29, 1944 Tabacalera's special 
bondholders' account with the Bank of Taiwan had more than sufficient to cover 
said amount. The evidence further shows that said special account was closed on 
December 29, 1944 upon demands of the Bank of Taiwan, and the money was 
deposited in Tabacalera's vaults.</p>
<p>The present action was instituted by appellants to question the validity of 
the redemption of their 74 debenture bonds as above-mentioned; the surrender of 
the bond certificates by Tabacalera to the Central, and to recover from both or 
either the value of said bonds. After trial upon the issues raised by appellants 
in their seeond amended complaint (Rec. on Ap. pp. 1-49) and the answers thereto 
filed by Tahacalera (id. pp. 78-112) and the Central (id, pp. 168-186), the 
lower court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs, from which 
appellants interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>Disregarding some questions of secondary importance raised in appellants' 
brief, their main contentions may be reduced to the following propositions:</p>
<p>(1) That Tabacalera-their depositary and trustee-in violation of its trust, 
and the Central, entered into a fraudulent scheme to redeem the outstanding 
bonds of the latter, to the detriment of the interests of the bondholders;</p>
<p>(2) That appellants never ratified the acts of Tabacalera and the Central 
relative to the redemption aforesaid; and</p>
<p>(3) That because of conditions arising subsequent to the execution of the 
power of attorney by appellants in favor of Tabacalera and the latter's 
appointment as trustee under the trust indenture Exhibit 1, Tahacalera had lost 
the right to exercise said power and trust.</p>
<p>In the absence of direct evidence to support their contention regarding the 
fraudulent scheme and breach of trust attributed to Tabacalera and the Central, 
appellants invite our attention to the following facts: that the Central was 
organized in June, 1927 by high executive officials of Tabacalera; that of its 
16,000 shares, 13,000 were subscribed by Tabacalera, 2,000 by its executive 
officers, and only 100 by other persons not known to be connected with 
Tabacalera; that as of December 31, 1941 the Central had 70,000 shares of stock 
outstanding, of which 26,302 were in the name of Tabacalera, 729 in the name of 
"Caja de Prevision del Personal de la Cia. Gral. de Tabacos de Filipinas", 557 
in the name of Tabacalera Insurance Company, while 8,821 were in the name of 
other persons for whom Tabacalera was the attorney-in-fact; that Tabaca-Jera was 
the general manager of, and used to finance the operations of,the Central since 
its organization, and that the majority of the members of the Board of Directors 
of the Central had always been high officials of Tabacalera,;</p>
<p>It is not very hard to perceive that the above facts and circumstances, 
whether singly or collectively, are not sufficient to establish the serious 
charge of fraud made against Tabacalera and the Central; neither would they 
justify our jumping to the conclusion that the said parties had committed fraud, 
one of them committing furthermore a violation of trust.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the bonds in question were escpressly made 
redeemable on or <em>before</em> November 15,1943. To redeem them on or 
<em>before</em> that date was evidently not only the contractual obligation but 
the right of the Central. That it exercised said right six months before 
November 15, 1943 was, therefore, dearly in accordance with the conditions of 
the bonds. Moreover, the redemption of the bonds before November 15, 1943 could 
be said to have been favorable to the bondholders themselves, bearing in mind 
that the Japanese military notes in circulation at the time decreased in value 
as time passed. Upon the facts of record there could have been no such 
fraudulent scheme or intent. If the only bonds redeemed on May 15,1943 had been 
appellants' 74 bonds, there could have been some reason to suspect the good 
faith of the Central and Tabacalera, but 010 truth of the matter regarding this 
fact is that, together with appellants' 74 bonds, many other were redeemed, 
among them, 717 belonging to Tabacalera itself, 58 to "Tabacalera Caja de 
Prevision del Personal", 55 to Tabacalera Insurance Company, 19 to Antonio V. 
Correa and 37 to Federico Perez, both high-ranking officers of Tabacalera. To 
this we must add the consideration that the value of the Japanese military notes 
alt the time,of the redemption had not yet greatly depreciated. In Aurechoechea 
<em>vs</em>. Kabankalan Sugar, Co., Inc., (81 Phil,, 476; 46 Off. Gaz., 258), we 
took judicial notice of the fact that "in October, 1943 they (the Japanese 
military notes) had as much purchasing power as, if not more than,, the Victory 
notes had" in April, 1945. That subsequently, the military notes first 
depreciated in value and finally became worthless was something that Tabacalera 
and the Central could not have foreseen nor prevented.</p>
<p>With particular reference to Tabacalera, we find that, according to the 
facts, it had really no choice but to accept payment of appellants' bonds when 
the same was tendered to it by the issuing Central, because the latter had both 
the duty and the right to call in. its bond for redemption on or <em>before</em> 
November 15, 1943. Upon receipt of payment it was naturally Tabacalera's duty to 
surrender the bond certificates to the Central. For the validity of thid 
surrender and delivery there was no need for Tabacalera neither to obtain the 
previous consent of appellants nor to notify them of the redemption after the 
same had. been made because Tabacalera, as appellants' attorney-in-fact, was 
fully authorized, inter alia, not only to collect the interests, dividends or 
amortizations paid upon the bonds, but also to receive payment of their value, 
to sell them and with the proceeds to buy other bonds. In fact, the power of 
attorney authorized Tabacalera "para disponer sin limi-tacion ni restriccion 
alguna de los valores depositados" (Exh. 4). It must be stated further that the 
trust indenture under which the Central issued the debenture bonds in question 
provide only for notice to the bondholders by means of notices to be published 
in Manila newspapers. On the other hand, the power of attorney executed by 
appellants in favor of Tabacalera does not provide that the latter should give 
notice to its principals of the redemption of the bonds. Consequently, 
Tabacalera's failure to notify appellants regarding of the redemption of their 
bonds and the payment of their value constitutes no violation of trust nor proof 
of negligence.</p>
<p>That Tabacalera was the trustee of the bondholders and was at the same time 
general manager of the Central is of little consequence. The evidence discloses 
in this action that appellants and their predecessor in interest-who resided in 
the Philippines for some time and frequently visited the offices of Tabacalera 
and the Central (Deposition of Eugenio Mas p. 12)-must have been fully aware of 
this circumstance when they appointed Tabacalera as their depositary and 
attorney-in-fact, and received interest payments and amortizations from the 
latter before the war. We, therefore, fail to see how they can now complain 
about this situation.</p>
<p>Appellants' last important contention is that Tabacalera could no longer act 
as their agent after a change of conditions had developed creating conflict of 
interests between them, and that this notwithstanding, it continued to exercise 
its powers as their depositary and attorney-in-fact, to their prejudice. It is 
their contention that, with the occupation of the Philippines by the Japanese 
armed forces, a conflict of interests arose between themselves, on the one hand, 
and Tabacalera, the Central and other bondholders, on the other; that Tabacalera 
and the Central, by agreeing on the redemption of the bonds, squeezed the 
bondholders out of the fair value thereof by paying them with Japanese military 
notes with a depreciated value; that in calling in the bonds for redemption, 
Tabacalera enabled the Central to relieve itself of its prewar obligation to the 
bondholders, while it subrogated itself in the place of said bondholders as 
creditor of the Central by lending to the latter the big amount of money it 
received from the Central in payment of the bonds redeemed on May 15, 1943.</p>
<p>We find appellants' contention to be without merits. In the first place, the 
power of attorney executed by them in favor of Tabacalera does not provide at 
all that in case of any particular change of conditions subsequent to its 
execution, the instrument shall be deemed to have become inoperative, and that 
the attomey-in-fact shall no longer exercise its authority thereunder. In the 
second place, we fail to see how the Japanese ^occupation and the circulation of 
the Japanese military notes in the PhOippinea could have, ipso facto, amounted 
to a virtual cancellation or, at least, suspension of Tabacalera's powers as 
appellants' depositary and attorney-in-fact. </p>
<p>As regards the alleged plan of squeezing the bondholders out of the fair 
value of their bonds, suffice it to say: first, that the Central was bound by 
contract, and had the right, to redeem the bonds on or <em>before</em> November 
15, 1943; second, that Tabacalera, as appellants' attorney-in-fact, was 
authorized to accept payment of such bonds as belonged to its principals; and 
lastly, that at the time of the redemption of the bonds, the Japanese military 
notes were legal tender in the Philippines and their value had not yet greatly 
depreciated. Appellants' predicament, therefore, does not differ substantially 
from that of creditors whose credits were virtually wiped out by payment of said 
debts during the Japanese occupation, thus making the ruling in the Haw Pia case 
applicable to the present. In said case the Bank of Taiwan, as the authorized 
agent of the creditor, received money (payment) from the debtor and the money 
thus paid-which remained deposited with said bank-became of no value. The 
creditor was found not to be entitled to relief (Haw Pia <em>vs</em>. China 
Banking Corp., 80 Phil., 604; 45 Off. Gaz., 9 supp., 229).</p>
<p>Appellants' claim that Tabacalera surrogated itself in the place of the 
bondholders as creditor of the Central, is inaccurate. It was the Bank of Taiwan 
who, in effect, was subrogated as creditor of the Central when the latter 
borrowed money from the former with which to redeem the bonds. Appellants' claim 
that Tabacalera subsequently loaned the money it had received in payment of the 
bonds to the Central so that the latter may, in turn, repay its debt to the Bank 
of Taiwan is not borne out by the evidence. As stated heretofore, during the 
Japanese occupation and until the liberation of the Philippines in 1945, 
Tabacalera not only had sufficient funds in Manila banks to cover the P74,000.00 
it received in payment of appellants' bonds, but also had, during all thai time, 
more than sufficient funds to cover said amount in its special bondholders' 
account with the Bank of Taiwan. This can only mean that Tabacalera had not made 
use of appellants' funds when it loaned money to the Central with which the 
latter paid its indebtedness to the Bank of Taiwan. What Tabacalera did with the 
amounts it received in payment of its own 717 bonds and of others belonging to 
other parties is, of course, not of appellants' concern' at all. Upon the other 
hand, that Tabacalera loaned the necessary amount to the Central for the 
repayment of the Bank of Taiwan's loan, is no indication that the two entities 
had entered into a fraudulent scheme between themselves. Such accommodation was 
not the first nor an isolated case, because appellants themselves claim that it 
was customary for Tabacalera to finance the operations of the Central since the 
tatter's organization.</p>
<p>Finally, considering that what must have caused the commencement of this 
action was the fact that the Japanese military notes paid to redeem applicants' 
bonds became worthless after the war, we deem of particular application to this 
case what was said in the Haw Pia case, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But be that as it may, whatever might have been the intrinsic or extrinsic 
worth of the Japanese war-notes which the Bank of Taiwan has received as full 
satisfaction of the obligations of the appellee's debtors to it, is of no 
consequence in the present case. As we have already stated, the Japanese 
war-notes were issued as legal tender at par with the Philippine peso, and 
guaranteed by the Japanese Government 'which takes full responsibility for their 
usage having the correct amount to back them up (Proclamation of Jan. 8 1942). 
Now that the outcome of the war has turned against Japan, the enemy banks have 
light to demand from Japan, thru their States or Government, payments or 
compensation in Philippine peso or U. S. dollars as the case may be, for the 
loss or damage inflicted on the property by the emergency war measure taken by 
the enemy. If Japan: had won the war or were the victor, the property or money 
of said banks sequestrated or impounded by her might be retained by Japan and 
credited to the respective State of which the owners of said banks were 
nationals, as a payment on account of the sums payable by them as indemnity 
under the treaties, and the said owners were to look for compensation in 
Philippine pesos or U. S. dollars to their respective States. (Treaty of 
Versailles and other peace treaties entered at the close of the first world war; 
VI Hackworth Digest of International Law, p. 232.) And if they cannot get any or 
sufficient compensation either from the enemy or from their States, because of 
their insolvency or impossibility to pay, they have naturally to suffer, as 
everybody else, the losses incidental to all wars."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the view we take of this case we deem it unnecessary to consider other 
secondary points raised by appellants in their brief.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
