				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 1, 1954,  Pedro  Tanap filed,  with the Justice of the  Peace Court of Umingan,  Pangasinan,  a complaint charging Victoriano Bueno,  <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Victor, with the crime of Arson through  Reckless  Imprudence.  The  complaint alleged:<br><blockquote>"That on or about 10:00  a.m.  to 12:00  noon  February 25, 1954, at barrio Malasin, Umingan, Pangasinan,  and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said  accused, being then owner of a parcel of  agricultural  land  still  covered  with rice hays adjoining  the land  of the  herein complainant,  (who) has a hut  of  strong  materials  with  assorted  personal  properties  kept in it consisting of all his farming implements and  fruit trees surrounding the but,  unlawfully  and voluntarily  set fire to  the rice hays on his said  land  (of the  accused),  in  a careless and imprudent manner  without  taking  the necessary  precautions to prevent its  spread to the neighboring properties although the  danger of the  spreading of the fire to the  adjoining  lands and properties and  the  danger  of burning the  properties on  same  is  immediate and  clearly  manifest  causing said  fire  to spread  and burn  or swept the hut, all  the farming implements  and properties kept in it and  surrounding  trees  belonging  to  the  herein   complainant,  causing tho entire loss of said hut and properties in it in the value of five hundred  pesos (P500) Philippine Currency.<br><br>"Contrary to  law."<br></blockquote>After due trial, a decision convicting the  accused as charged, and sentencing him to pay  a  fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment of fifteen (15)  days in the event of insolvency, to indemnify the complainant  in the same amount, without subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay  the costs, was attached to the record of  the case.  On motion of  the defense counsel, the promulgation of said decision was, however,  suspended and the accused  filed  a motion to quash upon  the ground that the maximum  penalty  imposable, pursuant to the third paragraph of Article  365 of the  Revised  Penal Code, is  a P1,500  fine, which is beyond the jurisdiction of said court.  In reply to this motion,  the private prosecutor cited the case of  People vs. Valmonte (CA-G. R. No.  5265-R, July 31, 1950), which held that the  penalty  imposable in a similar case is  <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its minimum  and  medium periods,  pursuant to the first paragraph of said Article  365,  in relation  to  Article 321, subdivision  (5), of said Code. Thereafter, relying upon this precedent, the Justice of the Peace modified his afore-mentioned decision, by eliminating the fine originally imposed therein, and sentencing the accused to one (1)  month and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> to indemnify the complainant in the sum of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment, in case of insolvency, not to exceed one-third  (1/3)  of the principal  penalty,  and to  pay  the  costs.  The accused appealed to  the Court  of  First Instance of  Pangasinan, where an  information  for Arson through Reckless  Imprudence  was  filed alleging: <br><blockquote>"That on or about the 25th day of February,  1954, in the  municipality of  Umingan, province of Pangasinan,  Philippines,  and within  the  jurisdiction of this Honorable  Court,  the  above-named accused, without exercising the necessary  safeguards and precaution to protect the properties of others, did,  then and there,  wilfully,  unlawfully,  and feloniously  set fire  and burn  tho  straw of his rice field  and imprudently, carelessly,  and negligently loft  the fire  he started on Ms field, notwithstanding: the presence of strong winds, which crept, invaded  and burned nearby fields, resulting in  the  burning  and  destruction  of  the  properties  belonging to one  Pedro Tanap, to his damage  and  prejudice in the amount of P600." </blockquote>A motion to quash, analogous  to the one adverted to above,  was denied.   In due  course,  the Court of First Instance subsequently rendered  a judgment of conviction, sentencing the  defendant to  pay  a fine of P170, to indemnify the complainant  in  the  same  amount,  with  the corresponding  subsidiary  imprisonment  in  case of insolvency,  and to  pay the costs.  The defendant appealed to the  Court of Appeals which, later on, certified the record to this Court, upon  the ground  that  the only issue raised in the briefs is one involving the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court. <br><br>Said issue hinges on the penalty for the crime of Arson through Reckless Imprudence which has resulted only in damage to  the  property of another, as in the case at  bar. <br><br>Relying upon the  decision  of the  Court of Appeals  in the  aforementioned  case of People vs.  Valmonte, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, the  Justice of the Peace Court of Umingan held, and  the Solicitor  General maintains, that the provision, applicable is the first paragraph of  Article 365, which reads: <br><blockquote>"Any  person  who, by reckless  imprudence, shall  commit  any act which, had it been intentional, would  constitute grave felony, shall suffer the  penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>  in  its  maximum  period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>  in its  minimum period; if it would have constituted a less grave  felony,  the  penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its minimum and medium periods  shall  be imposed." </blockquote>in relation to paragraph 5 of Article 321, which provides: <br><blockquote>"When  the arson consists in the burning of  other property and under the circumstances  given hereunder,  the offender shall  be punished: </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">******* <br></div><blockquote>"By <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>in  its medium period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> in its minimum period, when the damage caused is over 200 pesos but does not exceed 1,000 pesos, and  any of the property referred to in paragraphs (a)  and (b)  of the  next preceding subdivision is set on fire; but when the value  of such property does not exceed 200 pesos, the penalty next lower in degree  than that prescribed in this  subdivision shall be imposed  when the property burned  is a building  used as a dwelling  in  an uninhabited place, and the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> and a fine ranging from fifty to one hundred per  centum  of the  damage  caused shall  be imposed, when the property burned  consists of  grain fields, pasture lands, forests  or plantations.." </blockquote>and that, pursuant to these  provisions, the  penalty imposable  in the case at bar, as held in the  Valmonte case, is arresto mayor in its  minimum and medium  periods, which  is within  the jurisdiction  of  the  Justice of the Peace Court. The  third  paragraph of  Article 365,  however, reads: <br><blockquote>"When the  execution  of the  act covered by this article  shall have only resulted in  damage to the property of another,  the offender shall  be  punished by a fine ranging from an  amount  equal  to the value of said damages to three times  such  value, but which shall in no case be less  than 25  pesos."</blockquote>It is obvious, that  the  case at bar falls squarely under this  provision.   Neither the  prosecution nor the Valmonte case, has given,  or  even  attempted  to  give,  a single reason to the  contrary.   In  fact, in  its resolution  certifying the record to this Court, <span style="font-style: italic;">the very  Court  of  Appeals declared, that the Valmonte  case "is seemingly not applicable here, as the issue of jurisdiction was not touched therein</span>." Moreover,  the  applicability  of the  third paragraph of said Article 365 was <span style="font-style: italic;">not considered</span> in said case. In any event, the first paragraph of Article 365, pursuant to which "any person who,  by reckless imprudence shall commit  any  act  which,  had  it been intentional, * * * would have constituted a less grave felony,"  shall suffer the penalty of "<span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>  in its minimum  and  medium periods," merely establishes a <span style="font-style: italic;">general rule</span>.  The  same  is subject to the  exception found in the third paragraph of the  same article, namely, when the execution of  said act "shall have  only resulted in  damage  to the  property of another, the offender shall be punished by a fine ranging from an  amount equal to the  value of  said  damage to three times such value,  but which shall in no case be  less than  25 pesos."  The present ease  is precisely the  one contemplated  in said exception. <br><br>Inasmuch as  the  reckless and  imprudent  act of herein accused-appellant has "only resulted in damage to  property,"  worth, according to the  complaint and  the information, P500, the maximum penalty imposable is, therefore,  a fine  of P1,500,  which ia beyond  the jurisdiction of the  Justice  of the  Peace Court.  As a  consequence, neither was  the Court of  First Instance, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, competent to  hear  and decide this  case  on  its merits,  particularly,  over  defendant's objection.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby  set aside and this case  is dismissed, without prejudice to  the institution of another criminal action in the proper court of first instance.  Without special  pronouncement  as to costs.  It is  so ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, </span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br></div>
