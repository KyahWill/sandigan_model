				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources and his subordinates from proceeding further in the case 
pending before that Department wherein Marciana Duran and other are contesting 
the homestead application of Custodio Mari, the herein petitioner.
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Facts</span>. On March 12, 1946 Custodio Mari applied for homestead 
patent over a parcel of land of about six hectares in Mangatarem, Pangasinan. On 
June 12, 1946 such application was preliminarily approved by the Director of 
Lands. But opposition having been submitted by Marciana Duran, Maximiano 
Asuncion and Francisco Asuncion (herein respondents) the Director of Lands 
assigned Public Lands Inspector De Guzman to make the necessary investigation. 
This officer conducted an ocular inspection and reported that portions of the 
land applied for were occupied and cultivated by Bonifacio Mari, Custodio Mari, 
Francisco Asuncion, Maximiano Asuncion and others. </p>
<p align="justify">After several postponements, the examination of the witnesses 
was had on August 8, 1946, in the absence of the oppositors. The applicant 
Custodio Mari presented his evidence. Thereafter, based on the proofs adduced, 
the Director of Lands overruled the oppositions and adjudged the land to 
Custodio Mari. A motion to reconsider was denied. On March 30, 1950, a document 
purporting to be an appeal to the Department of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources was filed with said Department. Afterwards Custodio Mari questioned 
the appeal, alleging that the signature and thumbmark affixed to such "appeal" 
were spurious and forged. At the request of the Department, the National Bureau 
of Investigation scrutinized the document, and confirmed the allegations of 
forgery. Consequently on October 11, 1950 the Department dismissed the appeal 
and the protest, and approved the order awarding the land to Custodio Mari. </p>
<p align="justify">Several months later, in their communication dated May 15, 
1951, the protestants requested that said last order be set aside and that they 
be given "an opportunity to prove their claim to the land in question on the 
grounds (1) that the said order of this Office dismissing their appeal was based 
on the technicality that the signature of the claimants were forged by Attorney 
Bugayong who, instead of signing the said appeal in his own name as attorney of 
the said claimants, unlawfully forged their signature and thumbmarks thereon for 
one reason or another" which the said attorney only knows, and that as a result 
of such: unlawful act a criminal complaint has been filed against Attorney 
Bugayong which is now pending investigation in the Fiscal's Office of 
Pangasinan; (2) that the claimants believe that there was connivance between 
their attorney and the son of the respondent; (3) that the failure of the 
claimants-protestants to appear at the investigation of the case which resulted 
in their being non-suited and the investigation of the case being conducted 
ex-parte without their appearance was due to the misrepresentation of their 
aforesaid attorney, who told them that this case would be heard in Mangatarem, 
Pangasinan and that it was not necessary for them to go to Dagupan, Pangasinan, 
the place of the investigation; (4) that they have been in possession of the 
land for more than 30 years as shown by their improvements thereon; and (5) that 
the lease contract supposed to havo been signed by them (claimants) was secured 
by fraud and deceit, as they were made to sign it while under the influence of 
liquor." </p>
<p align="justify">Finding favorably to the protestants, the respondent Head of 
Department, on June 20, 1951, set aside his aforesaid order of October 11, 1950 
and reinstated the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">Subsequently, on March 29, 1952, he decided the appeal as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Considering (1) that the appealed decision of the Director of 
Lands in the above-entitled case dated November 14, 1949 dismissing the claim of 
the protestants-appellants to the land covered by Homestead Application No. V-8P 
(E-86) of Custodio Mari was based upon an ex-parte investigation; (2) that the 
claim of the appellants to the said land is based upon their alleged ownership 
and possession thereof for more than 30 years; (3) that the said 
claimants-appellants have already been relieved from the effects of the order of 
this Office of October 11, 1950 dropping their appeal in the order of this 
Office of June 20, 1951; and (4) that the motion of the counsel for the 
applicant-appellee for the reconsideration of the said order of June 20, 1951 
had already been denied on September 19, 1951, this office believes that in 
order to avoid any possible miscarriage of justice this case should be 
investigated in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of Lands Administrative Order 
No. 6 by the District Land Officer himself of Pangasinan. </p>
<p align="justify">"WHEREFORE, this case should be, as hereby it is, remanded to 
the Bureau of Lands; the decision of the Director of Lands dated November ,14, 
1949, set aside; and said official directed to have this case investigated in 
accordance with the aforesaid Lands Administrative Order No. 6 and to decide the 
case anew on the basis of the result of the formal investigation as herein 
directed.'"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Discussion</span>. The petitioner contends that the respondent 
official was "without jurisdiction or exceeded his jurisdiction, or committed 
abuse of discretion" in promulgating his orders of June 20, 1951 and March 29, 
1952. Various reasons are explained in his several pleadings before this court. 
Considering them as in relation with the answers and memoranda of the 
respondents, we do not think that the peticion should be granted. </p>
<p align="justify">The administration and distribution of public lands is 
committed by law to the Director of Lands primarily, and ultimately to the 
Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In the 
exercise of such power they have to determine the conflicting claims of 
applicants and occupants of disposable lands of the public domain. To regulate 
the procedure of adjudication the head of department saw fit to promulgate rules 
and regulations, one of which prescribes the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Relief from effect of decisions and orders of the Secretary 
or of the Director of Lands</span>.—Upon such terms as may be considered just, the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, the Undersecretary or the Director of 
Lands may relieve a party or his legal representative from a decision, order, or 
other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, 
default or excusable neglect; <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> that application therefor be made within 
a reasonable time but in no case exceeding one (1) year after such decision, 
order or proceeding was taken."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There is neither constitutional nor legal objection to the 
validity of the above regulation. Neither may its equitable feature be assailed 
for it is a counterpart of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court affording relief 
against fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, as we read the record, we see that the official acts of 
the respondent Secretary come within the purview of the above-quoted rule. And 
we are not convinced that he has acted clearly with abuse of that discretion 
which he necessarily has in affording relief. For one thing his findings of 
facts are final. (Julian vs. Apostol, 52 Phil., 422).</p>
<p align="justify">Anyway—and this is the main ground of our decision—the 
petitioner knows, or ought to know, that when relief is granted under Rule 38 by 
an inferior court, no appeal lies to this court, (Samia vs. Medina, 56 Phil., 
613) nor is certiorari permissible (Mendoza vs. Montesa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> L-4159, Dec. 28, 1951) 
inasmuch as the aggrieved party may still appeal should he finally lose in the 
new hearing which the order granting relief directs or allows. In other words, 
such aggrieved party has another remedy. With reference to the instant case, the 
"other" remedy of petitioner is to appear at the reinvestigation, protect his 
interests therein, and thereafter, if the Director of Lands decides against him, 
to appeal to the Department—of course, provided the circumstances disclosed at 
such reinvestigation justify his claim to preference over the land.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment</span>. Wherefore this petition will be dismissed, with costs 
against petitioner. </p>
