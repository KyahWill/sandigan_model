				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> An appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the 
dispositive part of which reads:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the 
defendant and against the plaintiff, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint, and 
ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendant the amount of P67,374.39 as damages 
for repairs made on the three vessels due to the typhoon; the amount of 
P47,905.59 as damages for salaries of officers and crews of the three vessels 
while tied up in the port of Cebu; the amount of P6,104.20 as damages for 
steward expenses for the food of said officers and crews while the vessels were 
tied up in the port of Cebu; and the amount of P3,000.00 as attorney's fees, 
plus the costs of this action."</p></blockquote>
<p>Early in August, 1950, K.H. Hemady, then president of plaintiff Juan Ysmael 
&amp; Co., Inc., asked Nicolas Y. Orosa, of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking 
Corporation, to look for steam vessels available for sale to the Indonesian 
Republic. After making some inquiries, Mr. Orosa found, soon thereafter, that 
defendant William Lines, Inc. had three such vessels, namely, s/s Cebu s/s 
Luzon and s/s Panay. Thereupon, he asked and obtained from the defendant an 
option to buy said vessels within fifteen (15) days (Exhibit S), which was 
extended for another fifteen (15) days. Then Orosa contacted Hemady and arranged 
a meeting between himself, Hemady and James Chiongbian, defendant's executive 
director, at which meeting Orosa advised Chiongbian that plaintiff was 
interested in said vessels, for the purpose of selling the same to the 
Indonesian Government. Thereafter, Hemady dealt directly with Chiongbian.</p>
<p>According to plaintiff's evidence, defendant's price for the three (3) 
vessels was P1,800,000, on which plaintiff wanted a 5% commission, or 
P90,000.00. Although agreeable thereto, defendant was unwilling to have the 
commission deducted from said price. Hence, the commission was added to the 
latter, and the price for the Indonesian Government was fixed at P1,890,000, 
Hence, on August 25, 1950, plaintiff wrote the letter Exhibit 2-W.L. 
reading:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On August 26, 1950, plaintiff wrote the communication Exhibit 3-W.L. (also 
Exhibit G), which is of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>

ourselves are tho- <br>roughly convinced that since these ships were built in 
late 1946, they have been kept and are in the best operatable condition 
possible.</p>
<p>In the event the Indonesian Government advises that these ships must be 
delivered to an Indonesian port, it is, therefore, necessary that an additional 
sum of P45,000.00 be advanced so as to pay for the cost of delivering these 
ships to an Indonesian port. Naturally,it depends upon the length of time 
involved in the delivery, etc. We shall calculate closely what the actual 
expenses involved would be and if we have any amount left over, we shall 
immediately return the amount to the Indonesian Government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a commission of agents of the Indonesian Government had come to 
the Philippines, upon representations made by the plaintiff and at its expense, 
to inspect the vessels and negotiate preliminarily the purchase thereof. The 
commission contacted Hemady and Chiongbian, with whose permission the technical 
advisers of the commission inspected the s/s Luzon in Manila and the s/s Cebu 
and the s/s Panay in Cebu. The result of the inspection was, in genera 
satisfactory, except that the crankshaft of the s/s Cebu required repairs. 
Hence, on October 19, 1950, plaintiff wrote the letter Exhibit B, which is as

<p>At a conference held in plaintiff's office, on October 20, 1950, 
representatives of both.parties herein and those of the Indonesian Republic 
agreed, upon the latter's request, that the price be reduced by P20,000, for the 
repair of the crankshaft o the s/s Cebu; that the net price for the Indonesian 
Republic would be P1,870,000, of which P70,000 shall be for the plaintiff and 
the balance of P1,800,000 for the defendant; and that said sum of P1,870,000 
shall be paid thru E.M. Grimm, President of Luzon Stevedoring Co., which had 
undertaken to handle the delivery of the vessels to the Indonesian Government. 
Conformably with this agreement, the latter's representative prepared, on that

<p>While tied up in Cebu, for delivery to the party concerned, the vessels were 
damaged by a typhoon that passed by on November 20, 1950. Said craft had, 
therefore, to undergo repairs. For this reason, and because one of the technical 
advisers of the Indonesian Government submitted thereto a report adverse to tho 
purchase of the vessels, contradicting his previous advice thereon, said 
Government became hesitant,on whether to acquire said vessels. After a trip of 
Chiongbian to Indonesia to ascertain the cause for such hesitation, on January 
8, 1951,defendant wrote the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces - for 
which the vessels were seemingly intended - a letter "asking an immediate 
decision" on the matter. The Indonesian Shipping Commission replied on January 
13, stating that, inasmuch as defendant was "asking for an immediate decision x 
xx this leads to the decision that the Government of the Republic of Indonesia 
will not buy th aforementioned ships" and that the negotiation was thereby 
"considered closed" (Exhibit 1). Chiongbian made another trip to Indonesia, and 
eventually, on March 8, 1951, defendant and the<br>Indonesian Republic executed the corresponding "agreement to buy and 
sell" said vessels for the aggregate price of $935,000, U.S. currency (Exhibit 
5-W.L.). Subsequently, the vessels were delivered to the Indonesian Government 
and the agreed price was paid to the defendant. Thereafter, plaintiff demanded 
its alleged commission thereon (Exhibits L and M), and, upon defendants failure 
to heed the demand, the former instituted the present action in the Court of 
First Instance cf Manila to recover the sum of P70,000, plus P25,000, 
representing expenses allegedly incurred for the promotion of the sale, and 
P7,000, as attorney's fees. <br></p><p>In its answer, the defendant alleged that 
plaintiff had "completely" failed either to sell or to buy the vessels above 
referred to; that said vessels were finally sold to the Indonesian Government 
through the efforts of the defendant alone; that plaintiff's alleged expenses in 
the sum of P25,000 were incurred on its account and at its own risk, and without 
defendant's knowledge or consent; and that plaintiff had never been authorized 
to act as an agent or representative of the defendant. The latter, likewise, set 
up a counterclaim cf P82,163.80 for the re pairs of the damages suffered by the 
vessels in November, 1950, plus P300,000 for unrealized profits, P50,000 for 
damages to its business reputation and P10,000 as attorney's fees. In 
defendant's amended answer, the counterclaim for compensatory damages was 
Increased to P120,853, and that for unrealized profits was reduced to 
P186,000.00.</p>
<p>In reply, plaintiff averred that it was defendant's agent In the sale to the 
Indonesian Government; that plaintiff was to be paid a commission for its 
services as such agent; that defendant usually tied up its vessels in Cebu, 
which is the home port of its vessels and where it has its main offices; that no 
demand had ever been made by the defendant for the repairs mentioned in its 
counterclaim; and that it has not suffered the damages therein alleged. After 
appropriate proceedings, the lower court rendered a decision rejecting 
plaintiff's pretense, accepting defendant's contention and sentencing the latter 
as above stated. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The main question for determination in this appeal is the if, nature of the 
relation between plaintiff and defendant herein, under the above mentioned 
transactions which culminated in the sale of s/s Cebu, s/s Luzon and s/s Panay 
to the Indonesian Government. Plaintiff maintains that it was defendant's agent. 
Defendant denies said agency and asserts that plaintiff undertook to buy the 
vessels f son the defendant with a view, in turn, to selling the vessels, at its 
(plaintiff's) own risk and account, to the Indonesian Government; and that, this 
proposed sale to the latter by the plaintiff having failed completely, the 
defendant "alone" sold the vessels to the Indonesian Government, without 
plaintiff's intervention.</p>
<p>Upon a review of the record, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that 
plaintiff acted merely as a broker or intermediary between the defendant and the 
Indonesian Government, Our main reasons therefor are?</p>
<ol><li>Plaintiff's representations to the Indonesian Government were <u>approved</u> by 
the defendant and such approval was <u>transmitted</u> and made known to the Indonesian 
Government. If the plan was for the defendant to sell the vessels of the 
plaintiff, in order that the latter could dispose of the vessels,acting in its 
own behalf, it would have been unnecessary to secure defendant's approval to 
said representations by the plaintiff. What is more defendant's pretense is 
refuted by said approval, which indicates that the source of plaintiff's 
authority was the very defendant. Defendant says that its aforesaid approval 
meant only that it had no objection to the resale of the vessels by the 
plaintiff at an overprice. If, however, plaintiff were buying the vessels from 
the defendant - which expected payment in cash - the latter would have had no 
interest in what the former did or intended to do with the vessels, and no right 
whatsoever to interfere in the overprice that plaintiff may wish to put should 
it sell the vessels to a third party. Much less would defendant's approval have 
been transmitted to this third party.<br><br>
</li><li>The original inducement for plaintiff's intervention in the above mentioned 
transactions was computed at five per centum (5%) of the net price fixed by the 
defendant. This is, precisely, how the compensation of agents or brokers is 
generally fixed, Had plaintiff not acted in such capacity, it could, and, 
probably, would, have added P100,000 or P200,000 to plaintiff's net price, and 
charged the Indonesian Government either P1,900,000 or P2,000,000 in round 
figures. The fact that plaintiff did not do so and that it had to obtain 
defendant's approval to the amount of the over-price included in plaintiff's 
offer to the Indonesian Government cannot be reconciled with defendant's theory 
to the effect that plaintiff had acted on its own account and at its own risk, 
and, hence, independently of the defendant.<br><br>
</li><li>When, after inspection by technicians of the Indonesian Government, the s/s 
Cebu appeared to require some repairs, a conference was held between 
representatives of the plaintiff, of the defendant and of said Government. They 
agreed then that the cost of said repairs (P20,000) be deducted from plaintiff's 
compensation; that the Indonesian Government would pay, therefore, P1,370,000, 
instead of P1,890,000; and that said sum of P1,870,000 would be divided as 
follows: P70,000 for the plaintiff, and P1,800,000 for the defendant. Had their 
understanding been that the vessels would be bought by the Indonesian 
Government, from the plaintiff, not from the defendant, through plaintiff, 
defendant would not have participated in said conference, and its approval to 
the reduction asked by said Government would have been unnecessary, inasmuch as 
plaintiff's price was not affected thereby. <br><br>
</li><li>On January 8, 1951, defendants manager wrote to the Chief of Staff, Armed 
Forces of the Republic of Indonesia, "asking for an immediate decision whether 
to buy or not the three Canadian Coasters, s/s Luzon, s/s Cebu and s/s Panay". 
If the Indonesian Republic was buying the vessels from plaintiff, not through 
plaintiff, from the defendant, the latter would not have dared write said 
communication to the Indonesian Government, much less ask an "Immediate 
decision" on the matter of the purchase of said vessels. Indeed, the "immediate 
decision" given by the Indonesian Government as requested by defendant, instead 
of telling the latter that it had no business asking said decision - which would 
be the case if defendant's pretense were true - indicates clearly that even the 
Indonesian Government understood that the defendant was the seller and that 
plaintiff was only a go-between. This is borne out by the fact that, in the 
letter of the Indonesian Government to the defendant, dated January 13, 1951 
(Exhibit 1), the former stated that "there was an understanding between your 
Company and the Indonesian Shipping Commission that the buying of the three (3) 
above mentioned vessels will take place after inspection by the two nautical 
technical advisers of said Shipping Commission." The "your Company" referred to 
in this communication is its addressee, defendant herein. </li></ol>
<p>We have not overlooked the circumstances relied upon "by the defendant, and 
the lower court, in support of the farmer's pretense, such as Orosa's option to 
buy the vessels from the defendant and the statement in plaintiff's letter 
Exhibit 4-W.L. (quoted in full hereunder) to the defendant, to the effect that 
"we contemplate in the very near future in being in a position to pa you cash 
for the above mentioned three vessels". The role play a by plaintiff must be 
deduced, however, from the whole transaction not from isolated acts or 
expressions. In this connection, Atty Orosa testified that, although, plaintiff 
had originally thought of buying the vessels, it eventually was satisfied with 
getting a commission as an intermediary. Contrary to defendant's pretense, the 
testimony of Orosa is straightforward, impartial and trustworthy. Besides, it is 
strongly corroborated by the fact that plaintiff advised the representative of 
the Indonesian Government and, also, the Luzon Stevedoring Go. (see Exhibit F, 
supra) that the owner of the vessels was the defendant. In short, plaintiff 
never represented to anybody that it owned the vessels or would own the 
same.</p>
<p>It is urged by the defendant that plaintiff had been guilty of undue delay in 
taking delivery of the vessels; that in its letter of October 18, 1950, Exhibit 
J, plaintiff assured the defendant that the negotiations would be brought to a 
conclusion and payment would be made "within the next few days", and neither was 
effected by November 20, 1950; that, in view of said delay, the damage then 
suffered by the vessels in consequence of a fortuitous event should be at 
plaintiff's risk; that plaintiff's intervention ceased completely thereafter, 
particularly when, on January 13, 1951, the Indonesian Republic announced its 
decision not to buy the vessels in question and declared the negotiations for 
the acquisition thereof "closed"; and that the sale to the Indonesian Government 
was perfected and consummated through the efforts of defendant "alone", without 
plaintiff's assistance.</p>
<p>The argument, based upon plaintiff's alleged delay in taking delivery of the 
vessels, is predicated upon the premises that plaintiff was supposed to buy the 
vessels from the defendant, which is false. In fact, not a single written demand 
was ever made by the defendant upon the plaintiff, either for the latter to take 
delivery of the vessels, or for the payment of the price thereof. Neither was 
any similar demand made by the defendant upon the plaintiff for indemnity of the 
damages - aggregating over P300,000, according to defendant's counterclaim - 
allegedly imputable to the plaintiff. We cannot believe that a matter as 
important as this would have been the object merely of oral representations by 
the defendant, as contended by the latter, even after plaintiff's formal written 
demand, which per sa indicated the possibility of litigation. Said omissions 
strongly suggest that defendant did not regard the plaintiff as buyer or 
prospective buyer of the vessels and that the present theory of the defense does 
not dovetail with defendant's understanding of the juridical relation between 
the parties when the events that led to this litigation took place.</p>
<p>With respect to the alleged delay, defendant's pretense is based upon Exhibit 
J (also Exhibit 4-W.L.) reading:<br></p>

<p>This communication contains, however, no <u>assurance</u> either as to the 
consummation of the sale or as to the payment of the prior Plaintiff merely 
stated therein "that the information now in hand strongly indicates that within 
the next few days, we can bring to a conclusion the <u>negotiations</u> (not the sale 
or delivery) between our firm and your company in reference to the three 
vessels, Cebu Panay and Luzon". Furthermore, the very defendant alleged in its 
counterclaim that "plaintiff requested the defendant to have tho said vessels 
tied up and ready for delivery at the port of Cebu <u>by November, 1950</u>", without 
specifying the date on which delivery would. be effected. What is mere, 
defendant was apparently agreeable to the delivery being made sometime in 
"November, 1950". It is clear, therefore, that there was no default or delay on 
plaintiff's part when a typhoon damaged the vessels on November 20, 1950. 
Thereafter, the vessels had to be sent to drydocks for repairs, although these 
were net seemingly made right away. For one thing, the s/s Luzon was partially 
repaired in Cebu and later sent to Hongkong, where the repairs appear tc have 
been completad early in May, 1951. The records dc not show the date of 
completion of the repairs of s/s Cebu and s/s Panay. In any event, prior thereto 
defendant was not in a position to deliver the vessels, and, hence, plaintiff 
should not be blamed for the consequent delay in the negotiations with the 
Indonesian Government, which were practically complete when force majeure 
interfered on November 20, 1950.<br><br>As regards the communication of the 
Indonesian Government of January 13, 1951, announcing its decision not to buy 
the vessels, it should be noted that the same was prompted by defendant's 
request for an "immediate decision" thereon. Inasmuch as it was not in a 
position, at that time, to settle an internal conflict that developed between 
two branches of its service in connection therewith, the Indonesian Government 
felt that said request left it no choice but to say that it would not buy the 
vessels. That the tenor of defendant's request was responsible for this answer, 
despite the fact that the Indonesian Government really wanted to buy the 
vessels, although it could not say sc as yet, is apparent when we consider that 
two (2) months later (March 8, 1951), it did formally agree to buy the vessels 
at substantially the same terms and conditions negotiated prior to January 13, 
1951, when said answer was given. Indeed, it would seem, also, that the request 
for an "immediate answer" had hurt the sensibility of the Indonesian Government, 
for which reason it said that said request led "to the decision x x x not to buy 
the ships" and that the negotiation was thereby "considered closed". Obviously, 
plaintiff should not be made to suffer for the consequences of the defendant's 
lack of tact in handling the situation.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is clear from the record before us that the sale to the Republic 
of Indonesia was not consummated by the defendant "alone", without plaintiff's 
intervention. Plaintiff looked for and found the vessels for the Indonesian 
Government. Through its friend Atty. Orosa, plaintiff got an option for the 
vessels. Plaintiff settled with the defendant the price of the vessels. 
Plaintiff contacted the Indonesian Republic and negotiated with the same for the 
sale of said vessels. Plaintiff defrayed the expenses of the Indonesian mission 
that came to the Philippines, examined the vessels and arranged the details of 
the transaction. Needless to say, the sale would not have taken place without 
such inspection. Again, the expenses for the repair of the crankshaft of s/s 
Cebu were deducted from plaintiff's share in the proceed; of the sale. 
Plaintiff, likewise, arranged with the Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc., for the 
delivery of the vessels and the manner in which its price would be paid by the 
Indonesian Government.</p>
<p>It is true that Chiongbian went to Indonesia in 1951, and finally got the 
signature of the Indonesian Government to the "agreement to buy and sell" the 
vessels. However, except for Chiongbian1s testimony to the effect that he had to 
avail himself of the good offices of a nephew of President Sukarno, the record 
is absolutely silent on what he had done to bring the sale to a successful 
conclusion. Upon the other hand, the terms and conditions of the transaction 
appear to be in substance, those arranged by the plaintiff. The price was 
$1,870,000. And the vessels were to "be taken "as is" and "where is". Hence, 
the head of the aforementioned Indonesian Commission, that came to the 
Philippines and dealt with plaintiff and the defendant, has made the following 
statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"Djakarta, Java, Indonesia. <br>12th November 1951</p>
<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN<br><br>THIS IS TO CERTIFY, that I, K. Rachman Masjhur, 
Major of the Army, Republic of Indonesia, do hereby state that the business firm 
of Juan Ysmael &amp; Co., Manila, and their representative in Indonesia, Mr. 
Frank C. Starr, were the sole parties responsible for first advising about and 
making the first firm offer of the three (3) vessels known as the CANADIAN 
COASTERS', namely the' SS LUZON', 'SS CEBU' &amp; 'SS PANAY' said vessels, at 
that time owned and operated by the WILLIAM LINES INC. of Manila, P.I. Said 
offer being made to our Army.</p>
<p align="center">and furthermore</p>
<p>that due to the sincere efforts of JUAN YSMAEL &amp; CO., Manila, together 
with their Indonesian representative, Mr. Frank C. Starr, was in fact a direct 
cause that a Commission was formed, of which I was in command, to visit Manila 
for the sole purpose to inspect and examine the above mentioned vessels and that 
said inspection &amp; examination was carried out and a due report was made 
thereof and forwarded to my government and that based on the findings of this 
report the purchase by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia of the above 
mentioned vessels was effected in due time.</p>
<p align="center">and that</p>
<p>this declaration is given, by me, of my own free will and sincere belief that 
the above mentioned firm of Juan Ysmael &amp; Company, Manila, and their 
Indonesian representative, Mr. Frank C. Starr, are justly due recognition by all 
and soy interested parties concerned herewith.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) K. Rachman Masjhur <br>K. Rachman Masjhur <br>Major, 
T.N.L. </p>
<p>(Sgd.) F. Lease<br>Frank C. Lease<br>Ministry of Information<br>Republic of 
Indonesia.<br>as Witness to signature<br>of Major K. Rachman Masjhur. Djakarta 
Nov 12,1951</p></blockquote>
<p>Chiongbian's trip to Indonesia seemed, however, successful one respect - he 
managed to iron out the evil effects of defendant's ill advised letter of 
January 8, 1951 asking an "immediate decision". Evidently, defendant should not 
be allowed to avail itself of the consequences of its aforementioned wrong move 
in order to defeat plaintiff's claim.</p>
<p>In short, the sale to the Indonesian Government was, in effect, the product 
of plaintiff!s intervention, so that it is entitled to the P70,000 commission 
agreed upon as compensation for its services in connection therewith. For this 
reason, plaintiff should not recover its alleged expenses during the 
negotiations, such expenses having been incurred at its own risk and in 
consideration of the aforementioned compensation it expected to collect. Upon 
the other hand, it is apparent that plaintiff is not liable, either for the 
damages caused to the vessels by the typhoon on November 20, 1950, or for the 
repair of said damages, or for the salaries and expenses of the crew during said 
repairs the ultimate cause thereof being a fortuitous event.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and another 
one.-Will be entered sentencing defendant William Lines, Inc., to pay to 
plaintiff Juan Ysmael &amp; Co., Inc. the sum of P70,000.00 with interest 
thereon, from December 17, 1953, the date of institution of this case, at the 
rate of 6% per annum, besides the costs.</p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia, </i>and <i>Felix, JJ., 
</i>concur.<br></p>
