				<H3>THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. CONSUELO L. VDA. DE  PRIETO, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ  DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals reversing the decision  of  the  Commissioner  of Internal Revenue which held herein respondent  Consuelo L. Vda. de Prieto liable  for the payment of  the sum of P21,410.38  as deficiency  income tax,  plus  penalties and monthly interest.</p>
<p>The case was submitted for  decision in the  court below upon  a  stipulation  of  facts, which for brevity  is summarized as follows: On December 4, 1945, the respondent conveyed by way of gifts to  her four  children, namely, Antonio, Benito,  Carmen  and Mauro, all surnamed  Prieto, real  property with  a total assessed value  of  P892,497.50. After the  filing of the gift tax  returns on or about February 1, 1954,  the petitioner Commissioner  of  Internal Revenue appraised the real property donated  for gift  tax purposes at Pl,231,268.00,  and assessed the total sum of PI 17,706.50 as donor's  gift tax, interests and compromises due thereon.  Of the total sum of PI 17,706.50  paid  by respondent on April 29,  1954, the sum  of P55,978.65   represents the  total  interest on  account of  delinquency. This  sum  of P55,978.65 was claimed as deduction,  among others,  by respondent in  her  1954  income  tax  return. Petitioner, however, disallowed  the claim and as  a consequence of such disallowance assessed respondent for 1954 the total sum of P21,410.38 as deficiency income tax  due on the aforesaid  P55,978.65, including interest  up to March 31, 1957, surcharge and compromise for the late  payment.</p>
<p>Under the law, for interest to be deductible, it must be shown that there be an indebtedness,  that there  should be interest upon it, and that what  is claimed as an  interest deduction should  have  been paid  or accrued within  the year.  It  is here  conceded that  the  interest paid  by respondent  was  in consequence  of  the late  payment of  her donor's tax, and the same was paid within the year it is sought to  be deducted.   The only  question to  be determined,  as stated  by the  parties, is  whether  or  not such interest was  paid upon an indebtedness  within the contemplation of  section  30 (b)  (1)  of the Tax  Code,  the pertinent part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 30. <em>Deductions from  gross income.</em>—In  computing net  income there shall be allowed as deductions—</p>
</blockquote><p align="center"> * * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(b)  Interest:</p>
  <p>"(1)  In general.—The amount of interest paid within the taxable year on indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry  obligations the interest upon which  is exempt from taxation as income under this Title."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term "indebtedness" as used  in  the Tax  Code  of the United States  containing  similar provisions as in the above-quoted section has been defined as an unconditional and legally enforceable  obligation  for  the  payment  of money.  (Federal  Taxes  Vol. 2,  p.  13,019, Prentice-Hall, Inc.;  Mertens' Law  of  Federal Income  Taxation, Vol.  4, p. 542.)  Within the meaning of that definition,  it is apparent that a tax may be considered an  indebtedness.  As stated by this  Court in  the case of Santiago Sambrano <em>vs</em>. Court  of  Tax  Appeals  and  Collector of  Internal  Revenue (101 Phil.,  1;  53 Off. Gaz., 4839)—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Although  taxes already due   have not,  strictly  speaking,  the same concept as debts,  they are, however, obligations that may  be considered as such.</p>
  <p>" 'The term "debt"  is properly used  in a comprehensive sense  as embracing not merely money due  by contract  but whatever  one is bound to render  to another, either for  contract, or the requirement of the law.   (Camben <em>vs</em>.  Fink Coule &amp; Coke  Co.  61  LRA 584).</p>
  <p>"Where statute imposes a personal liability for a tax, the tax becomes, at least in a board  sense, a debt.  (<em>Idem</em>).</p>
  <p>"'A tax is a debt for which a  creditor's bill may be brought in a proper case.'  (State <em>vs</em>. Georgia Co., 19  LRA  485)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  follows that the interest paid by herein  respondent for the late payment of her  donor's  tax is deductible from her gross income under  section 30 (b)  of  the  Tax Code above quoted.</p>
<p>The above conclusion finds support  in the established jurisprudence in  the United  States after whose laws  our Income Tax  Law has been patterned.  Thus,  under  sec. 23 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, which contains similarly worded provisions as sec. 30 (b) of our  Tax  Code, the uniform ruling is that interest on taxes is interest on indebtedness and is deductible.   (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Jaffray,  306 U.S. 276.  See also  Lustig <em>vs</em>.  U.S.,  138 F. Supp. 870; Commissioner of Internal Revenue  <em>vs</em>. Bryer, 151 F. 2d 267, 34 AFTR 151; Penrose <em>vs</em>. U.S.  18 F. Supp. 413, 18 AFTR 1289; Max  Thomas Davis, et al. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 46, U.S. Board of Tax  Appeals Reports, p.  663, citing U.S. <em>vs</em>. Jaffray, <em>supra</em>, Smith <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,  6  Tax Court of United  States Reports,  p. 255; Armour <em>vs</em>.  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6  Tax Court  of  the United States Reports, p. 359;  The Koppers  Coal  Co. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 7  Tax Court  of  United States  Reports, p. 1209; Toy <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Lucas <em>vs</em>. Comm., 34 U.S. Board of  Tax Appeals Reports. 877; Evens &amp; Howard Fire Brick Co. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 U.S. Board of  Tax Appeals Reports, 867; Koppers  Co. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Tax Court of  United States  Reports, p. 62).  The rule applies  even though the tax  is  nondeductible.   (Federal Taxes,  Vol. 2,  Prentice Hall,  sec.  163, 13,022;  see also Mertens' Law of  Federal Income Taxation,  Vol.  5,  pp. 23-24.)</p>
<p>To sustain the proposition that the interest payment in question is not deductible for  the purpose of computing respondent's net  income, petitioner  relies  heavily on section  80 of Revenue Regulation No.  2   (known as Income Tax  Regulation)  promulgated  by  the Department  of  Finance, which provides that "the word 'taxes' means taxes proper  and no deductions should be allowed for amounts representing interest, surcharge, or penalties incident to delinquency."  The court below, however,  held section  80 as inapplicable to the instant  case  because while it  implements sections 30 (c)  of the  Tax Code governing deduction  of  taxes,  the  respondent taxpayer  seeks  to  come under  section 30 (b) of the same Code providing for  deduction of interest on  indebtedness. We  find the  lower court's  ruling  to  be  correct.  Contrary  to  petitioner's belief, the portion  of  .section  80  of Revenue Regulation No.  2 under consideration  has been part  and  parcel  of the development to the law on deduction  of taxes in  the United  States.   (See  Capital  Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn.  <em>vs</em>. Comm., 23 BTA  848.  Thus, Mertens in his treatise says : "Penalties  are to  be distinguished  from taxes  and they are not deductible under the heading of taxs."  *  * *  Interest on state taxes is not deductible as taxes."   (Vol. 5, Law on Federal  Income  Taxation, pp.  22-23, sec.  27.06, citing cases.)   This notwithstanding,  courts in that jurisdiction, however,  have invariably held that  interest on deficiency taxes are  deductible,  not  as  taxes,  but as interest.  (U.S. <em>vs</em>.  Jaffray, et al., <em>supra</em>; see also Mertens, sec. 26.09,  Vol,  4, p. 552, and cases  cited  therein.)  Section 80 of Revenue  Regulation  No.  2,  therefore,  merely incorporated  the  established application of the  tax  deduction statute  in the United Stated, where deduction of "taxes" has always been  limited to taxes proper and has never included interest on delinquent taxes, penalties and surcharges.</p>
<p>To give to the  quoted portion of section  80  of our Income Tax Regulations  the meaning that the petitioner gives it  would  run  counter  to  the  provision of   section 30 (b)  of the  Tax  Code and the  construction  given to it by  courts  in the  United  States.  Such  effect  would  thus make the regulation invalid for a "regulation  which operates to create a rule out of  harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity."   (Lynch <em>vs</em>. Tilden Produce Co., 265 U.S. 315; Miller <em>vs</em>.  U.S., 294 U.S.  435.)  As  already  stated, section 80 implements only section 30 (c) of the Tax Code, or the provision allowing deduction of taxes, while herein respondent seeks  to  be allowed deduction  under   section 30(b), which provides for  deduction of   interest  on indebtedness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we  are  of  the opinion and so hold that although  interest  payment  for  delinquent taxes  is not deductible  as  tax  under  Section  30 (c)  of the Tax Code and  section 80  of the  Income Tax Regulations, the taxpayer is  not precluded thereby from claiming said  interest payment as deduction  under section  30 (b) of the same Code.</p>
<p>In  view of the foregoing,  the decision  sought to be reviewed is affirmed, without pronouncement  as to costs.</p>
