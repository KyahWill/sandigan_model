				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal taken by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government from&nbsp; a decision of the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila, ordering the respondents to refund and deliver&nbsp; to the&nbsp; petitioners the sum of P10,000 deposited with the Government for the temporary stay of petitioner&nbsp; Ly Giok Ha alias Wy Giok&nbsp; Ha,&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as to pay&nbsp; the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; dispute about the facts, the case having been submitted for decision upon a stipulation of facts.<br><br>Ly Giok Ha, et al. vs. GcUa,ng, et al. On May 14, 1955, petitioner Ly Giok Ha, alias Wy Giok Ha, entered the Philippines as a citizen of the Nationalist Republic of China and a temporary visitor for a period of three (3) months, expiring on August 24, 1955, which was extended&nbsp; up to March&nbsp; 14, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make said entry feasible, her sister, and co-petitioner Wy Hong Bng, had, on March 28, 1955, made with the Bureau of Immigration, a cash deposit of P10,000, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an instrument, entitled "Cash Bond for Temporary Stay", copy of which has been marked as Annex B.&nbsp; On&nbsp; March 8, 1956, Ly Giok Ha, <i>alias</i> Wy Giok Ha, married Eeatituto Lacasta, a Filipino. The next day the former&nbsp; wrote respondent Emilio L.&nbsp; Galang, as Commissioner of Immigration,&nbsp; advising&nbsp; him of the said&nbsp; wedding and requesting that her alien immigration papers and said cash bond deposit be&nbsp; cancelled, and&nbsp; that the amount thereof be refunded, upon the ground that, by virtue of her&nbsp; marriage, she became a citizen of&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; This notwithstanding, on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 16, 1956,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Galang declared said cash deposit forfeited.&nbsp; He having subsequently refused to reconsider this action, Ly Giok Ha, alias Wy Giok&nbsp; Ha, her husband&nbsp; Restituto Lacasta, the former's sister, Wy Hong Eng,&nbsp; and the latter's husband, Ngo In, instituted the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action against&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Galang, as&nbsp; Commissioner of&nbsp; Immigration,&nbsp; Enrique&nbsp; Zapanta,&nbsp; as Accounting Officer of the Bureau of Immigration, Manuel Agregado, as Auditor General, and Vicente Gella, as Treasurer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines, upon the ground that the confiscation of said deposit is illegal&nbsp; and unjust, it&nbsp; having been ordered by respondent Galang without and in excess of his jurisdiction, and with grave abuse of discretion, and that the amount&nbsp; of said deposit had been turned over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Zapanta, under&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; Galang,&nbsp; to the Treasurer&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; through&nbsp; the Auditor&nbsp; General, and praying that&nbsp; judgment be&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; annulling&nbsp; the aforementioned order of forfeiture&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Galang,&nbsp; and&nbsp; directing&nbsp; the refund&nbsp; of said sum&nbsp; of Ly Giok JIat et al. vs. Gadwtig, el al. P10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment for the petitioners, as&nbsp; prayed for.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; this appeal. <br><br>Appellants&nbsp; urge a&nbsp; reversal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; the conditions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bail bond in question had&nbsp; been violated because:&nbsp; (a) requests for extension&nbsp; of the period of the original authorized&nbsp; stay had been made; and&nbsp; (6) Ly Giok Ha, alias Wy&nbsp; Giok Ha had failed to leave the Philippines on or before March 14, 1956,&nbsp; date of expiration&nbsp; of the last extension granted to said petitioner. The provisions of the bond in question, pertinent to the first count, read as follows: <br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; That the undersigned,&nbsp; with full&nbsp; knowledge that Ly&nbsp; Giok Ha, a temporary visitor&nbsp; whose authorized stay in this&nbsp; country&nbsp; is limited only up to and including August&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; do&nbsp; hereby undertake that&nbsp; said Ly&nbsp; Giok&nbsp; Ha will actually&nbsp; depart from the Philippines on or before said&nbsp; date so specified, or within such period as in his discretion the Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; or his authorized&nbsp; representative&nbsp; may&nbsp; properly&nbsp; allow; <br><br>"(a-<i>1</i>)&nbsp; That the undersigned hereby guarantee that no extension of the&nbsp; original&nbsp; authorized stay&nbsp; of three&nbsp; (3) months of Ly&nbsp; Giok Ha will be requested."&nbsp; (See Annex E to&nbsp; the petition, p. 7, rec.) <br></blockquote>Appellants maintain that the&nbsp; above-quoted paragraph a—1&nbsp; had been infringed&nbsp; by the requests for&nbsp; extension— allegedly filed&nbsp; by Ly Giok Ha, through her counsel—of the period of&nbsp; her stay as a&nbsp; temporary visitor.&nbsp; Apart from the fact that the alleged requests by said petitioner do not appear in&nbsp; the stipulation of facts&nbsp; already adverted to, we do not believe that said requests constituted a violation of the bond or sufficed to warrant its forfeiture, for: <br><br>(1)&nbsp; Competent&nbsp;&nbsp; authorities&nbsp;&nbsp; granted&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; requests. Having thus, in effect, been found to be meritorious&nbsp; and <i>justified</i>,&nbsp; said requests cannot&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; violative of the contract in&nbsp; question. <br><br>(2)&nbsp; Paragraph&nbsp; (a) thereof&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; indicates&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration,&nbsp; or his authorized representative, may properly allow an extension of the&nbsp; period fixed therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the ordinary&nbsp; course of&nbsp; events,&nbsp; such extension would not be allowed&nbsp; without a corresponding request therefor, it&nbsp; follows that the very bond&nbsp; under consideration countenances and sanctions such&nbsp; request. (3)&nbsp; Said bond must&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; required and&nbsp; given, pursuant to section&nbsp; 40 (a) of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 61S ("The Philippine Immigration Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1940") reading: <br><br>"The Commissioner of Immigration shall have the&nbsp; power to- exact bonds&nbsp; in such&nbsp; amounts and containing such&nbsp; conditions as he&nbsp; may prescribe: <br><blockquote>"(1)&nbsp; To control and regulate&nbsp; the admission into, and departure from, the Philippines of aliens applying for&nbsp; temporary admission; <br>"(2)&nbsp; To insure against aliens passengers liable to be excluded as likely&nbsp; to&nbsp; become&nbsp; public charges, from&nbsp; becoming public&nbsp; charges; <br>"(3)&nbsp; To insure the&nbsp; appearance of aliens&nbsp; release from custody during:&nbsp; the&nbsp; course of&nbsp; deportation&nbsp; proceedings instituted against them." <br></blockquote>The requests for extension involved in the case at bar do not, in any manner&nbsp; whatsoever, run counter to any of the purposes sought to be served by&nbsp; the bond in question, as set forth in the above&nbsp; provision, and,&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; were not meant by the lawmaker to constitute&nbsp; a violation of said bond. <br><br>(4)&nbsp; Respondent Galang did not regard said requests for extension as a breach of said undertaking, the only reason given&nbsp; in his communication&nbsp; of&nbsp; March 16, 1956,&nbsp; declaring the bond forfeited,&nbsp; being "the failure of&nbsp; Ly&nbsp; Giok Ha, <i>alias</i> Ky Giok Ha, to depart&nbsp; upon expiration of the period granted her." &nbsp;<br><br>The next and most important question for determination is whether her marriage to a Filipino justified or, at&nbsp; least, excused the aforesaid failure of Ly Giok Ha to depart from the Philippines on or before .March&nbsp; 14, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; In maintaining the affirmative view, petitioners allege that,&nbsp; upon her marriage to a Filipino,&nbsp; Ly Giok Ha became, also, a citizen&nbsp; of the Philippines.&nbsp; Indeed, if this conclusion&nbsp; were correct, it would follow that, in consequence of her marriage, she had been naturalized as&nbsp; such citizen, and, hence, the decision appealed from would.have to be affirmed, for section 40 (e)&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act No. 613 provides that "in the event&nbsp; of the naturalization as a Philippine citizen&nbsp; * *&nbsp; * of&nbsp; the alien on whose&nbsp; behalf the&nbsp; bond&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; is&nbsp; given, <i>the bond shall be cancelled or the&nbsp; sum. deposited shall be returned</i> to&nbsp; the&nbsp; depositor or&nbsp; his legal&nbsp; representative.'^/ Thus the issue boils down to whether an&nbsp; alien female who marries a male citizen of the Philippines follows ipso facto his political&nbsp; status. The pertinent part of section&nbsp; 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, upon which petitioners rely, reads: <br><blockquote>"Any woman who is now&nbsp; or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; and&nbsp; who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the Philippines." <br></blockquote>Pursuant thereto, marriage to a&nbsp; male Filipino does not vest Philippine citizenship to his foreign wife, unless she "herself may be&nbsp; lawfully naturalized."&nbsp; As correctly held in&nbsp; an&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; of the Secretary of Justice (Op.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 52, series&nbsp; of 1950) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; this limitation of&nbsp; section 15&nbsp; excludes, from&nbsp; the benefits of&nbsp; naturalization&nbsp; by&nbsp; marriage,&nbsp;&nbsp; those disqualified from being naturalized&nbsp; as citizens of&nbsp; the Philippines under section 4 of said&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 473, namely: <br><blockquote>" (a)&nbsp; Persons opposed to&nbsp; organized&nbsp; government or&nbsp; affiliated with any association or group of persons who&nbsp; uphold and teach doctrines opposing&nbsp; all&nbsp; organized governments; <br>(b)&nbsp; Persons&nbsp; defending or teaching&nbsp; the necessity or propriety of violence, personal assault, or assassination for the success and predominance of their&nbsp; ideas; <br>(c) Polygamists or believers&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of&nbsp; polygamy;<br>(d)&nbsp; Persons convicted&nbsp; of&nbsp; crimes involving moral' turpitude; <br>(e)&nbsp; Persons&nbsp; suffering&nbsp; from&nbsp; mental&nbsp; alienation&nbsp; or incurable contagious diseases; <br>(f) Persons&nbsp; who,&nbsp; during the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; residence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the ,&nbsp; Philippines, have not mingled socially with the Filipinos, or who have not evinced a sincere desire to&nbsp; learn and embrace the customs, traditions, and ideals of&nbsp; the Filipinos; <br>(g) Citizens&nbsp; or&nbsp; subjects of nations with whom the * * * Philippines&nbsp; are at&nbsp; war,&nbsp; during the&nbsp; period of such war; <br>(h) Citizens&nbsp; or&nbsp; subjects&nbsp; of&nbsp; a foreign country&nbsp; other than&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; whose laws do&nbsp; not&nbsp; grant&nbsp; Filipinos&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to become&nbsp; naturalized citizens&nbsp; or subjects&nbsp; thereof." <br></blockquote>In the case at bar, there is neither proof nor allegation in the&nbsp; pleadings that Ly Giok Ha does not fall under any of the&nbsp; classes disqualified by law.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; as the parties&nbsp; who claim that,&nbsp; despite her failure to depart from the Philippines within the period specified in the bond in question, there has been no breach thereof, petitioners have the burden of proving her alleged change of political status, from alien to citizen.&nbsp; Strictly&nbsp; speaking,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; have not made out, therefore,&nbsp; a case against the respondents-appellants. <br><br>Considering, however, that neither in the&nbsp; administrative proceedings, nor in the lower court, had the parties seemingly felt that there was an&nbsp; issue on whether Ly Giok Ha may "be lawfully&nbsp; naturalized,"&nbsp;&nbsp; and this being a case&nbsp; of first impression in our courts, we are of the opinion that, in the&nbsp; interest of equity and&nbsp; justice, the parties herein should&nbsp; be given&nbsp; an opportunity to&nbsp; introduce evidence, if they have any, on said issue." <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set aside and let&nbsp; the records of&nbsp; this case be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings, not inconsistent&nbsp; herewith,&nbsp; without special&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="right" width="100%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 1 See, also, Ops., Sec. of&nbsp; Jus.,&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 28, s. 1950; No. 96,&nbsp; s. 1949; Nos.*43, %8, "98 and* 281, s.&nbsp; 1948; No. 95, s. 1941; Nos.&nbsp; 79 and 168, s. 1940.</div>
