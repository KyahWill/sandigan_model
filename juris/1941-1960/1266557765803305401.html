				<H3>MERCEDES CASTRO, EXEQUIEL CASTRO, MARIANO G. SISON AND GERARDO S. SISON, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. LUIS CASTRO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiffs-appellees sued Luis Castro for actual partition of a parcel of 
land in Bugallon, Pangasinan, in the following proportion: 7/14 to Mariano and 
Gerardo Sison; 3/14 to Mercedes Castro; 2.5/14 to Exequiel Castro and 1.5/14 to 
defendant.
<p>Resisting the demand, Luis Castro interposed, in the form of a counterclaim, 
his right to repurchase from Mariano and Gerardo Sison, alleging that the latter 
had bought their part from one of his co-heirs (co-owners according to 
plaintiffs).</p>
<p>After hearing the parties, and after several proceedings unnecessary to 
relate, the court of first instance of Pangasinan, Hon. Segundo M. Martinez, 
sustained the plaintiffs, overruled defendant's counterclaim and approved the 
report of partition dated August 11, 1953 prepared by Commissioner Norberto 
Castro, finding it to be reasonable and agreeable to the parties concerned.</p>
<p>The defendant has appealed solely from that portion dismissing his 
counterclaim.</p>
<p>The property originally pertained to Francisco Castro; and in proceedings to 
settle his estate in Pangasinan, it was finally awarded (in 1921) pro-indiviso 
to his children as follows: To Mercedes and Vicente—undivided 4.5/14 each; to 
Exequiel, Emiliano, Luis, Ildefonso and Antonio 1/14 each.</p>
<p>When Vicente Castro died about the year 1938, intestate proceedings were 
instituted and in consequence of certain agreements therein the same property 
was adjudicated in August 1939 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>a</em>) Maura Repato, widow of the deceased, 7/14;</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) Exequiel, Luis, Emiliano, Ildefonso and Antonio, brothers 1/14 
each; and</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) Mercedes Castro 2/14.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereafter Exequiel and Luis purchased from Emiliano, and inherited from 
Ildefonso and Antonio their respective portions, so that the property was owned 
in March 1944 by the following: Maura Repato 7/14; Mercedes Castro 3/14; 
Exequiel Castro 2.5/14; and Luis Castro 1.5/14.</p>
<p>On March 31, 1944 Maura Repato sold her share of the property to Mariano G. 
Sison and Gerardo S. Sison by a Deed of sale which was duly registered in the 
Registry of Deeds on April 1, 1944.</p>
<p>Having been informed of the conveyance on or about May 15, 1944, Luis Castro 
immediately offered to repurchase Maura Repato's share, but Mariano and Gerardo 
declined to sell.</p>
<p>In this litigation Luis Castro rests his case on Article 1067 of the Civil 
Code providing that "if either of the heirs should sell his hereditary rights to 
a stranger before the partition, any or all of his co-heirs may be subrogated to 
the rights of the purchaser by reimbursing him for the purchase price, provided 
it be done within the period of one month, to be counted from the time they were 
informed thereof." He says he came to know the sale on May 15, 1944 and 
immediately offered to buy.</p>
<p>On the other hand the plaintiffs cite articles 1522 and 1524 of the Civil 
Code prescribing that any co-owner of a thing held in common may redeem the 
share of any co-owner that is sold to a third person, provided such right is 
exercised <em>within nine days</em> from the date of the record of the transfer 
in the Registry of Deeds * * *. And there is no question that the sale by Maura 
Repato ta Mariano and Gerardo Sison was registered on April 1, 1944 and the 
offer to buy was made after May 15, 1944.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs argue that when, after 1938, the property was adjudicated 
pro-indiviso to Maura Repato (7/14), Exequiel and his brothers (5/14) and 
Mercedes Castro (2/4), their abstract hereditary rights became determinate and 
therefore they ceased to be co-heirs and became co-owners. Hence the sale by 
Maura was a sale by a co-owner, governed by Articles 1522 and 1524.</p>
<p>The trial judge ruled that Article 1067 applies only where a co-heir sells 
his share before partition or distribution or before the determination of the 
portion to which each heir is entitled. Once the portion corresponding to each 
heir had been fixed—as in this case—the co-heirs turned into co-owners, and 
their right of legal redemption should be governed by Articles 1522 and 
1524.</p>
<p>His Honor adopted the correct view. There was already a partition, or 
adjudication of the respective shares; wherefore article 1067 does not 
apply,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. The sale to sent respondent Justina S. Vda. de Manglapuz of the two 
parcels of land in question by Sixto de Jesus and Natalia Alfonga took place 
after the project of partition had been approved by the court (order of the 
probate court of March 11, 1946, in civil case No. 3960, the legal redemption 
case, Appendix 1 of respondents' answer), on account of which article 1067 of 
the Civil Code cannot support petitioners' claim, said article referring to a 
sale by any of the heirs of his hereditary right to a stranger before 
partition." (De Jesus <em>vs</em>. Daza, 43 Off. Gaz., 2055, 
2060.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, disregarding the partition for the moment, Maura Repato was not, 
strictly speaking, the co-heir of Luis Castro with regard to Francisco Castro 
(she was not heir of Francisco). Neither was she a co-heir of Luis Castro with 
regard to Vicente Castro, for the obvious reason that Luis inherited nothing of 
this land from his brother Vicente. It is true that upon the death of Vicente 
Castro this property was "adjudicated" to Maura Repato, and his brothers 
Exequiel, Luis etc. But these brothers, specially Luis got the same portion they 
had already received from their father Francisco—namely 1/4 of the property. 
Luis therefore has not inherited any portion of this property from Vicente 
Castro, and may not be considered as "co-heir" of Maura Repato.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment will therefore be affirmed, with costs against 
appellant. So ordered.</p>

Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
