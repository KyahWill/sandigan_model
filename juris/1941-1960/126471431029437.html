				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appellant Augusto  C.  de la  Paz  is a reserve  officer in the Philippine Navy, Armed Forces  of the  Philippines. Prior  to February,  1954, he  was in  the  active service of the Philippine, Navy, being  the  Naval  Commanding Officer  of  Philippine  Chaser   P-49,  RPS  Cavite.  On November  16, 1953,  however, his  superior  officer,  Commander  Ramon A.  Alcaraz, recommended his immediate reversion to inactive status on the ground of inefficiency; and acting on  such recommendation,  the Chief of Staff of  the Armed  Forces,  on February  5, 1954,  issued  an, order  reverting  appellant to  inactive  status effective March 4,  1954.</p>
<p>Upon  his reversion to  inactive  status,  appellant  obtained and was given full  arid complete ship's  clearances of  all  government properties, funds, and money account abilities  covering  his  former  command.  But  shortly thereafter,  charges were lodged  against him for misappropriation of  government property allegedly  committed while  he  was  still  in  active military service.  Wherefore, the Headquarters of the Philippine Navy summoned appellant to appear for an investigation into the charges with a view to  bringing  him before a  General  Navy, Court  Martial.  Appellant  refused to  submit to  the  investigation, claiming that having been  reverted to civilian status, he was  no longer within  the  jurisdiction of  the Philippine Navy;  then on August 7, 1954, he  filed  a petition  before  the  Court  of  First Instance of  Manila to enjoin respondents Commander Ramon A. Alcaraz and Major Serafin  C.  Dizon of  the  Philippine Navy,  from subjecting  him  into the  aforesaid  investigation.   The lower  court found  his  petition without  merit and dismissed the same;  hence, his present appeal.</p>
<p>There is no question that although  appellant  had been reverted to inactive (civilian) status in the reserve  force of the Philippine Army, he is still amenable to investigation  and court-martial under, the Articles of War by the Philippine  Navy  for  alleged acts of misappropriation of government funds  committed  while  he  was still in the  active military service.  As correctly held by the Court below, appellant's case falls within  the provisions of  Article 95 of the Articles a£ War (Commonwealth Act No.  408, as amended), which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 95. <em>Frauds against the Government  affecting matter and equipments.</em>—Any  person  subject to military law  who, having charge, possession, custody, or  control of  any  money or other property. of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, furnished  or intended for the military  service  thereof, knowingly delivers,  or causes  to  be delivered,  to  any person having  authority  to  receive the same, any amount  thereof  less than that for which  he receives a  certificate  or receipt or</p>
  <p align="center">*         *       *       *       *       *       *</p>
  <p>Who steals, embezzles, knowingly and  willfully misappropriates, applies to  his own use or  benefit,  or wrongfully  or  knowingly sells or disposes of an ordinance, arms, equipments, ammunition, clothing, subsistence stores, money, or other property of the Commonwealth  of the Philippines furnished or intended for  the military service thereof;  or</p>
  <p align="center">*         *       *       *       *       *       *</p>
  <p>* * * And  if any  person,  being  guilty of any of the offenses aforesaid while in the military service of  the Philippines, receives his discharge or is dismissed from the service, he shall  continue to be liable to  be arrested and held  for trial and sentence by  a court-martial  in the  same  manner and  to the same  extent as if he had not received such discharge  nor  been dismissed.   *  *  *" (Appellees brief, pp.  5-6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  lower  Court  did  not, therefore, err  in  refusing to enjoin  appellant's  investigation by the naval  authorities on charges  that he had misappropriated  public  property while he was still  in the service of the Philippine Navy, specially since petitioner admits that  he  is still a member of the  Reserve  Force.</p>
<p>But  appellant   insists  that  the Court  below should have admitted  his amended petition,  which  included  a prayer for  a writ of  certiorari  to review the  order  reverting him to inactive (civilian) status, and should have annulled said order because it constituted his  summary dismissal from service without due process of law.</p>
<p>The  argument is untenable for several  reasons. In the first place,  appellant was ordered reverted from active status  to civilian or inactive status in  the Reserve Force, not by  the  respondents Commander  Ramon  A. Alcaraz and  Major  Serafin  C.  Dizon of  the Philippine Navy,  but  by the chief  of Staff  of the  Armed  Forces, upon order of the Secretary  of National Defense based on a directive of the President of the Philippines.  The Court below could not, therefore,  in any case have nullified and set aside said order of reversion because the real party in  interest  had not  been impleaded and made  a party to the petition.</p>
<p>In the  second  place, appellant's reversion  to inactive status in the reserve force  is not, as he claims,  a dismissal from the service.  Although he had ceased  to  be in the active service of  the Philippine Navy,  appellant nevertheless remain an officer of the Army reserve  force. Officers in  the  naval reserve  may be transferred  from active to inactive service as the  army authorities may see fit (cf.  6 C. J. S. 17, citing Denby vs. Berry,  44 S. Ct. 74, 263 U. S.  29, 68  L.  Ed. 148), and appellant can not  rightly complain that  he had  been  dismissed  or discharged without due process, because mere transfer from active to inactive service in the army is neither dismissal nor  discharge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the matter  of transfer from one  status to another, or even the dismissal or discharge of officers and  servicemen in the armed forces, is a matter entirely within the  realm of the  military.   If  petitioner felt  aggrieved  by the  recommendation  made by his  superior officer of his  reversion  to inactive status without proper hearing  and investigation of his  alleged inefficiency,  he should have sought  redress by appeal to the  President of the Philippines, who is the  Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces,  through  the  proper  military  channels. As provided by Article  120 of the Articles of  War,  as amended by Republic Act No.  242:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 120. <em>Complaints  of  Wrongs.</em>—Any member of  the  Armed Forces of the Philippines or  Philippine Constabulary who believes himself wrong by his commanding  officer, and, upon due application  to such  commander, is  refused redress, may complain  to  the area  or zone commander or the next superior officer in the area or zone where the officer against whom the complaint  is made is stationed.  The area or  zone commander  or next superior officer shall  examine into said  complaint  and  take proper  measures  for redressing  the wrong complained of;  and  he  shall,  as  soon  as possible,  transmit to Headquarters, Armed  Forces of the Philippines,  a  true statement of said complaint, with the proceedings had thereon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not having  exhausted all administrative remedies, appellant  can not  seek  relief  in  the courts  of  justice Miguel, et al.<em> vs. </em>Vda. de Reyes, 93  Phil.,  542).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is affirmed, with  costs  against appellant Augusto C.  de la Paz.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angela, Labrador,  Concepcion,</em> and  <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
