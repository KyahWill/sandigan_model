				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an&nbsp; action for mandamus to compel respondent Manuel M. Villanueva, "in his&nbsp; capacity as Acting Mayor of&nbsp; the City of Bacolod," to&nbsp; reinstate petitioners&nbsp; Jesus Quiatchon, Jose T. Real, Manuel Cabiles&nbsp; and Alfredo&nbsp; T. Schwab,&nbsp; as members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; police force of the City&nbsp; of Bacolod,&nbsp; as well as to&nbsp; recover their salaries during the period of their ouster, in addition to moral and exemplary damages.<br><br>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no dispute about the&nbsp; facts,&nbsp; the case having been&nbsp; submitted for decision upon an agreed stipulation&nbsp; of facts.&nbsp; It appears that Ignacio or Engracio Manguin, Melanio&nbsp; Quizon, Democrito&nbsp; Nanta and Bonifacio Ormeo, none of whom is a&nbsp; civil service eligible, were&nbsp; temporarily appointed" as members of the&nbsp; police force of the City&nbsp; of Bacolod,&nbsp; on August 30,&nbsp; 1946, March 10,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; March&nbsp; 6, 1952&nbsp; and August 15, 1951, respectively (Exhibits 1 to 4). Owing to the criminal action filed against them&nbsp; (Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 4262 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; "People&nbsp; vs. Jose&nbsp; Grandeza"),&nbsp; these members&nbsp; of the police force&nbsp; were, on August&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1954, suspended from the service pursuant to section 4 of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 557 (Exhibits&nbsp; 5 and 5-A to&nbsp; 5-C).&nbsp; Two weeks later, or on August 31,&nbsp; 1954, the then Acting&nbsp; Mayor&nbsp; of the City&nbsp; of Bacolod&nbsp; addressed to them&nbsp; identical&nbsp; communications, the pertinent part of which reads: <br><blockquote>"Sir:<br><br>In view of tile filing of criminal&nbsp; case against you by the City Fiscal and of the temporary nature of your appointment which, under the law will in no case exceed three months, and in accordance with the opinion of the Commissioner of Civil Service dated August 18, 1954,&nbsp; concurred&nbsp; in by the Assistant Executive Secretary in a 1st Indorsement&nbsp; dated August 25, 1954, and by the Technical&nbsp; Assistant Incharge of&nbsp; Civil Affairs and&nbsp; Chairman, Provincial, City and Local Governments Division, Malacañang, in a telegram dated August 27, 1954, and in order not to unduly adversely affect public service, I am hereby informing&nbsp; you of your separation from the service effective on the date&nbsp; of your suspension. <br><br>Very respectfully, <br><br><div style="margin-left: 320px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; JOSE V. CORUÑA <br></div><div style="margin-left: 360px;">Acting City&nbsp; Mayor" <br></div><br>(Exhibits 6 and 6-a to 6-c.)</blockquote>Early in September, 1954, said&nbsp; Acting City Mayor&nbsp; appointed petitioners herein, who are&nbsp; civil service eligibles (Exhibits&nbsp; A and A-1), as second&nbsp; (2nd) class patrolmen of said police force, with an annual&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; of&nbsp; P1,50O each, to fill the positions vacated by Manguin, Quizon, Nanta and&nbsp; Ormeo, as above stated&nbsp; (Exhibits B and B-1l to B-3), and&nbsp; soon thereafter, said&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; assumed their respective offices and discharged the duties&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; On or about December&nbsp; 20, 1954, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rendered judgment in the aforementioned criminal case,&nbsp; acquitting the&nbsp; defendants therein (Exhibit&nbsp; 8). Thereupon, or on December 21,1954, the then Acting Mayor of the City of Bacolod, Manuel M. Villanueva, removed the petitioners from&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; offices&nbsp; and&nbsp; appointed thereto&nbsp; the aforementioned Engracio Manguin, Melanio Quizon,&nbsp; Democrito Nanta and Bonifacio&nbsp; Ormeo&nbsp; (Exhibit 15), although the&nbsp; latter still lack civil service qualifications, and&nbsp; no&nbsp; administrative investigation had been&nbsp; conducted, or administrative charges filed, against&nbsp; said&nbsp; petitioners. Hence, the present action for mandamus against Manuel M. Villanueva, in&nbsp; his capacity as Acting Mayor of the City of Bacolod.&nbsp;&nbsp; After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rendered a decision, the&nbsp; dispositive part of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the writ of mandamus prayed for is hereby&nbsp; granted and judgment rendered ordering&nbsp; the respondent Acting City Mayor of&nbsp; Bacolod City, to forthwith reinstate&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; in their former positions, declaring&nbsp; the petitioners with the right to collect their&nbsp; salaries corresponding to the period&nbsp; from the day they were illegally ousted from their positions, up to&nbsp; the time when they shall be actually reinstated,&nbsp; further ordering the respondent to pay the petitioners&nbsp; out of his personal funds and by way of moral damages the amount ot P5,000 to each of the petitioners, and by way of exemplary damages, the further sum of P2,500&nbsp; also to each of the petitioners. The&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of these proceedings shall be taxed against the respondent." (Original Record, pp. 180-181.)</blockquote>Manuel M. Villanueva, in Ms&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; as&nbsp; acting Mayor of&nbsp; the City of Bacolod&nbsp; and&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of Eacolod filed&nbsp; a "joint notice of&nbsp; appeal."&nbsp; However&nbsp; separate briefs were submitted by Villanueva, "in his capacity&nbsp; as&nbsp; Acting Mayor of Bacolod, as well as his&nbsp; capacity as private individual," and by the City of Bacolod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Brief&nbsp; for the appellant City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bacolod" is entitled "Jesus Quiatchon, Jose&nbsp; T. Real, Manuel Cabiles and Alfredo T.&nbsp; Schwab, Petitioners- Appellees vs.&nbsp; City of Baeolod,&nbsp; Appellant,"&nbsp; whereas, the brief for Villanueva is entitled "Jesus&nbsp; Quiatchon, Jose&nbsp; T. Real, Manuel Cabiles and Alfredo T.&nbsp; Schwab, Petitioners- Appellants vs.&nbsp; Manuel M. Villanueva,&nbsp; Respondent-Appellant."<br><br>Meanwhile, petitioner&nbsp; Alfredo T.&nbsp; Schwab&nbsp; died and&nbsp; was substituted, as petitioner-appellee, by&nbsp; Ms&nbsp; widow, Anunciacion Flores Schwab and their four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; minor children, Mary&nbsp; Cathy,&nbsp; Marie&nbsp; Ingrid, Alfredo Jr. and Maria Jugie, all&nbsp; surnamed&nbsp; Schwab.<br><br>Appellants maintain: (1) that the appointments of petitioners herein, as members of the police force of the. City of Bacolod, were&nbsp; illegal,&nbsp; for pursuant to&nbsp; Executive Order No. 175, series&nbsp; of 1938, of the. Office of the President, "in no&nbsp; case shall the position of a suspended&nbsp; policeman *&nbsp; * *' be&nbsp; filled without previous authority from&nbsp; the President of the Philippines;"&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; although&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; herein were given permanent appointments, the same merely had a temporary or provisional nature, said petitioners having failed to file competent proof of their&nbsp; physcial fitness;&nbsp; (3) that, having been acquitted in the criminal case instituted against them, Engraeio Manguin, Melanio Quizon, Democrito Nanta and Bonifacio Ormeo, who had been suspended upon the institution of said case, were entitled, as a matter of right, to reinstatement to their former positions; and (4) that, pursuant to section 5, of the&nbsp; Charter of the&nbsp; City of Bacolod, the same is exempt from any liability for damages arising from the acts of its officers.<br><br>Executive Order No. 175,&nbsp; series of 1938&nbsp; refers to the position of a "suspended" policeman and, hence, it is inapplicable to the case at bar,&nbsp; for petitioners' predecessors in office were not merely suspended, but, also, <i>removed</i> from their respective offices.&nbsp; The right of the Mayor of Baeolod to make such removal is indubitable, it being&nbsp; admitted that the officers removed had merely "temporary"&nbsp; appointments and were, and still are, not civil service eligibles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, said temporary appointments were authorized by the Commissioner of Civil Service "under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code <i>to continue&nbsp; only until replaced by an eligible but not beyond thirty (30)&nbsp; days from the date of receipt of&nbsp; the certificate of eligibility."</i>&nbsp; What is more, said removal was&nbsp; made in accordance with an opinion of the Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Service dated August 18, 1954, concurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Assistant&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; on August 25, 1954, and&nbsp; by the Technical Assistant Incharge of Civil Affairs and Chairman&nbsp; of the Provincial, City and Local&nbsp; Governments Division, Malacañang, in&nbsp; a telegram dated August 27, 1954&nbsp; (Exhibits 6 and 6-A to 6-C).&nbsp; Thus, regardless&nbsp; of the&nbsp; authority of the President to limit, by virtue of&nbsp; said Executive&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp; 175,&nbsp; the power of municipal or city mayors, to&nbsp; make valid appointments—on which&nbsp; we need not, and&nbsp; do not,&nbsp; express any opinion—the removal&nbsp; above referred to, and&nbsp; the appointment of petitioners herein, have been, in effect approved by the Office of the&nbsp; President.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the latter, in a 5th Indorsement, to the&nbsp; Mayor of Bacolod City, dated November 4, 1954—in conformity with the views expressed by the Commissioner of Civil Service, in&nbsp; a 4th Indorsement dated October&nbsp; 11, 1954—<i>requested, the reinstatement</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; several members of the police&nbsp; force&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bacolod,&nbsp; as&nbsp; of February&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1952— including petitioners herein, Jesus&nbsp; Quiatchon and Jose T. Real—who had been separated from the service, without the notice&nbsp; and hearing provided&nbsp; for in&nbsp; Republic Act No. 557, despite their civil service eligibility, and replaced&nbsp; by non-eligibles.<br><br>Appellants'&nbsp; second argument assumes&nbsp; that the appointments in favor of petitioners herein, though purporting to be permanent in&nbsp; nature, did not acquire said&nbsp; status and were merely temporary in character, said petitioners having failed to submit competent proof&nbsp; of their physical&nbsp; fitness. The argument is based, however, upon a predicate which has not been&nbsp; established.&nbsp; This&nbsp; case&nbsp; was submitted&nbsp; for decision upon an agreed stipulation of facts, which is silent on whether said&nbsp; proof of physical fitness of&nbsp; petitioners herein had&nbsp; been submitted or not.&nbsp; Inasmuch as&nbsp; their appointments&nbsp; are in terms permanent in character, it must be assumed that everything necessary to give such effect thereto&nbsp; has been complied with, it being presumed&nbsp; "that the ordinary course of business has been followed" and "that the law has been obeyed"&nbsp; (Rule&nbsp; 128,&nbsp; section 69 [q] and [ee], Rules&nbsp; of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof to the contrary, if any, was incumbent upon respondent-appellant,&nbsp; who should not&nbsp; be allowed, therefore, to profit by his own omission.&nbsp; In fact, there are strong indications that such proof does not exist, for: (1) the order of removal of petitioners herein (Exhibit&nbsp; 15) made no reference&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; despite the&nbsp; efforts exerted therein to justify said removal;&nbsp; and (2) Exhibits B and B-1&nbsp; to&nbsp; B-3 specifically state that the appointments&nbsp; of herein petitioners were in the nature of&nbsp; "reinstatement", thus showing clearly&nbsp; that they had already been regular members of the police force of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bacolod and complied with all the prerequisites to the&nbsp; acquisition of a permanent status, including the presentation of proof of physical fitness.<br><br>The third (3rd) argument advanced by appellant herein assumes that the decision of&nbsp; acquittal above referred to ordered the reinstatement of the&nbsp; accused as members of the police force, but this is <i>not </i>a fact.&nbsp; Again, section 4 of Republic Act No. 557, cited by the&nbsp; appellants herein granting to a member of the police force, who has been acquitted of the criminal charges against him, the right "to payment of the entire salary he&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; receive during his <i>suspension</i>",&nbsp; refers to policemen who had merely&nbsp; been "suspended", without being legally <i>dismissed</i> from the service. It does not apply to said defendants in Criminal Case No. 4262 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, for&nbsp; they were legally <i>separated</i> from&nbsp; the service, because, being "temporary" members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; police force, without civil service eligibility,&nbsp; their right to hold office&nbsp; could&nbsp; be terminated by the City Mayor, at any time, with or without cause.<br><br>What is more,&nbsp; in view of&nbsp; their lack of&nbsp; civil service eligibility&nbsp; and the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of civil service&nbsp; eligibles for the&nbsp; police&nbsp; force, the&nbsp; City Mayor&nbsp; had no choice but&nbsp; to remove&nbsp; said accused&nbsp; policemen, pursuant to the&nbsp; aforementioned section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, under which their&nbsp; temporary appointments had been authorized.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in Orais vs. Ribo&nbsp; (93 Phil.,&nbsp; 385, 49 Off. Gaz., 5386,&nbsp; 5392-5393),&nbsp; we held:<br><blockquote>"Petitioners invoke in support of their claim section 682 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code, as&nbsp; amended&nbsp; by Commonwealth&nbsp; Acts Nos. 177 and 281.&nbsp; Said section provides:<br><blockquote>"Temporary&nbsp; appointment without&nbsp; examination and&nbsp; certification by the Commissioner of Civil Service or his local&nbsp; representatives shall not be made to a competitive position in&nbsp; any case, except when the public interests so&nbsp; require, and then, only&nbsp; upon the prior authorization of the Commissioner of Civil&nbsp; Service;&nbsp; and&nbsp; any temporary appointment&nbsp; so&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; shall continue&nbsp; only&nbsp; for&nbsp; such period not exceeding: three&nbsp; months&nbsp; as may be necessary to make appointment through&nbsp; certification of eligibles, and in no case shall extend&nbsp; beyond thirty&nbsp; days from&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; by the&nbsp; chief of&nbsp; the bureau or office of the Commissioner's certification of eligibles; * * *.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>"Appointments made under the section are <i>temporary</i>, when the public interests to require&nbsp; and only upon the prior authorization of the commissioner of civil service, not to exceed three months and in no case&nbsp; shall extend "beyond thirty days from receipt by the chief of the bureau or office of the commissioner's certification of eligible. The fact that the petitioners held the positions for more than three months does <i>not</i> make them&nbsp; civil service eligibles.&nbsp; Also&nbsp; the fact that the acting' commissioner of civil service&nbsp; authorized their&nbsp; appointments 'under section&nbsp; 682&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code to continue&nbsp; only until replaced by an eligible'&nbsp; does not make them eligibles.&nbsp; The holding of a position by&nbsp; a temporary&nbsp; appointee&nbsp; until replaced by an eligible in disregard of the time limitation of three months is <i>unauthorized and illegal</i>.&nbsp; The temporary appointment of other non-eligihles to replace those whose term have expired is&nbsp; not prohibited.&nbsp; Hence the replacement of Teodulo T. Orais, David Lim, Domingo&nbsp; Saligo and Eulalio Bernades, who&nbsp; are non-eligibles, by Isidro Magallanes,&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Flores, Francisco&nbsp; Tavera&nbsp; and&nbsp; Narciso Ravago,&nbsp; who are eligibles,&nbsp; is in accordance with law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; replacement of&nbsp; non-eligibles by non-eligihles&nbsp; is lawful&nbsp; under and pursuant to section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)</blockquote>This&nbsp; view was reiterated&nbsp; in&nbsp; Pana&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; City&nbsp; Mayor (94 Phil., 103, 50&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 146, 147-148).&nbsp;&nbsp; We said therein:<br><blockquote>* * * In accordance with&nbsp; section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, when&nbsp; a position in the&nbsp; classified&nbsp; service&nbsp; is filled by one who is not a&nbsp; qualified civil service eligible, his appointment is limited to the period necessary to enable the&nbsp; appointing&nbsp; officer to secure a civil service&nbsp; eligible, qualified for the position, and&nbsp; in no&nbsp; case is such&nbsp; temporary appointment&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; longer&nbsp; period&nbsp; than&nbsp; 3&nbsp; months.&nbsp; As petitioners herein were not civil service eligibles at the time of their&nbsp; appointment, and&nbsp; it docs not appear that they&nbsp; have since then&nbsp; qualified for the positions they are holding, their respective appointments were only for periods of 3 months and&nbsp; not more.</blockquote>With respect&nbsp; to the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; exemption&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City of Bacolod from any liability for damages, under section 5 of Commonwealth Act 326, suffice it to say that in the City of Bacolod. and Manuel Villanueva vs. Hon. Eduardo D. Enriquez,&nbsp; supra, p.&nbsp; 644)&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; parties&nbsp; to the present appeal, and&nbsp; involving the&nbsp; execution of the aforementioned&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Enriquez&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; during the&nbsp; pendency&nbsp; of this&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; we declaimed:<br><blockquote>"It is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that section&nbsp; 2 of Rule 39&nbsp; allows execution&nbsp; to issue pending appeal.&nbsp; But such&nbsp; execution can only be issued against one who is a party to the action and not against one who, not being a party in the case,&nbsp; has not yet had his day in court&nbsp; (Tayson and Angeles vs. Ycasiano, et al., G. R; No: L-2283, May 31,&nbsp; 1949; Manza vs. Santiago, etc., .G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-7830, April&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1955; An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs Gorospe,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., G.&nbsp; R. L-9230, April&nbsp; 22, 1957).&nbsp; The&nbsp; recor that the city of Bacolod was not made a party to the&nbsp; case damus filed&nbsp; against its acting&nbsp; mayor.&nbsp; True, the order of execute is specifically directed to the acting mayor and&nbsp; the city treasurer, and not&nbsp; to&nbsp; the city itself, but there&nbsp; is no denying that the&nbsp; said order means to have the back&nbsp; salaries of the respondents policemen paid from city funds, so that in the last analysis, it is&nbsp; the city that is&nbsp; being&nbsp; made to satisfy that part&nbsp; of the judgment in the case."</blockquote>Accordingly, the&nbsp; aforementioned writ of execution was annulled and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court&nbsp; in said case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-9775 was made&nbsp; permanent. Modified, in the sense that the award for salaries corresponding to the period&nbsp; of the ouster of petitioners herein shall be understood to bind exclusively respondent Manuel Villanueva, in his&nbsp; private capacity, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; therefore, in&nbsp; all&nbsp; other respects, with costs&nbsp; against said respondent.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
