				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a decision&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac dated January 7, 1954, setting aside the previous Order dated December 16, 1953, which had admitted a contingent&nbsp; claim filed by petitioners-appellants but&nbsp; denied a petition to set aside&nbsp; an&nbsp; amount to answer for the contingent claim.<br><br>The record discloses that on December 15, 1953, petitioners&nbsp; herein filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; contingent&nbsp; claim for more than P500,000 against the intestate estate of the deceased spouses Florencio P.&nbsp; Buan and Rizalina Paras Buan.&nbsp; The contingent claim was based on the fact that on August 3, 1952, a Philippine Rabbit&nbsp; Bus, owned and operated by the deceased spouses Buan, collided with a car in which Juan C. Laya, Bodolfo Escosa, Jose S. Palma,&nbsp; and Juan&nbsp; de Leon, were&nbsp; riding; that the collision was caused by the fact that the driver of the bus managed and drove the vehicle in a negligent manner;&nbsp; that as a consequence of the collision Juan&nbsp; C. Laya was&nbsp; killed and&nbsp; his companions suffered physical injuries.&nbsp; The&nbsp; driver of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bus&nbsp; was Ernesto Triguero, and he was charged with homicide and serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence and was sentenced therefor.&nbsp; The heirs of Juan C. Laya, petitioners herein,&nbsp; reserved the&nbsp; civil action for damages, and on October 12, 1953, they filed an independent civil action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the administrator of the deceased spouses&nbsp; Buan.&nbsp; The petition for the admission of a contingent claim was acompanied with a copy of the&nbsp; complaint filed in&nbsp; the civil&nbsp; case above-mentioned (No.&nbsp; 20867,&nbsp; CFI Manila)&nbsp; and a sentence in the criminal case filed&nbsp; against Ernesto Triguero, driver of the Philippine Rabbit Bus.<br><br>When the&nbsp; administrators learned of&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of the contingent claim in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, they filed&nbsp; an opposition thereto on the ground that the game was&nbsp; not filed before the death of the spousea Florencio Buan and Rizalina Paras Buan,&nbsp; which&nbsp; took place on January 3, 1953, and that it was also not filed within the period prescribed by Rule 89, Section&nbsp; 4&nbsp; of the Rules of Court. The Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Tarlac admitted the claim in an order dated December 16, 1953, but denied the prayer that a portion of the estate be set aside to&nbsp; respond for the amount of the contingent.&nbsp; Counsel for the administrators then moved&nbsp; to&nbsp; set aside the order.&nbsp; In an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated November 25, 1953, Judge Agustin P.&nbsp; Montesa, sitting as Judge for the Court of First Instance of Manila, held that the civil action filed in Manila by&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of Laya, petitioners herein, Civil Case&nbsp; No. 20867,&nbsp; was&nbsp; premature because the sentence of&nbsp; conviction of the driver of the bus had not become final.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court also ordered the plaintiffs to amend&nbsp; their complaint within 10 days.&nbsp; Thereupon, the plaintiffs in said civil case (C.F.I. Manila, No. 20867) filed an amended&nbsp; complaint, dated December 18, 1953.<br><br>In the meantime and on January 7, 1954, the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, on a motion for reconsideration filed by the administrators dated January 2, 1954, set aside its previous&nbsp; order of&nbsp; December 16, 1953,&nbsp; admitting the contingent claim of petitioners.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason for the admission of the claim,&nbsp; according to the court,&nbsp; had ceased to exist and&nbsp; even if plaintiffs had filed the amended complaint in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila, the same has not yet been acted upon by&nbsp; the said court.&nbsp; A motion to reconsider this, order of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Tarlac having been denied, petitioners have prosecuted this appeal to&nbsp; Us.<br><br>A consideration of&nbsp; the facts and the proceedings set forth above will readily show that the order of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Tariac dismissing the contingent claim is based on incorrect and erroneous conception of a contingent claim.&nbsp; A contingent claim ia one which, by its nature, is necessarily dependent upon an&nbsp; uncertain event for its existence or validity.&nbsp; It may or&nbsp; may not&nbsp; develop into&nbsp; a valid enforceable claim, and its validity and enforceability depending&nbsp; upon&nbsp; an&nbsp; uncertain event.&nbsp;&nbsp; (E.&nbsp; Gaskell &amp;&nbsp; Co. vs. Tan Sit, 43&nbsp; Phil. 810, 813; 2 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court,&nbsp; 1957 edition, pp. 425-426.)<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; contingent claim' against an&nbsp; estate within&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute providing for the settlement hereof, as one where the absolute&nbsp; liability depends on some future event which may never happen, and which therefore renders such liability&nbsp; uncertain and indeterminable. * *&nbsp; *! It is where the liability depends on some future event&nbsp; after the debtor's death which may or may not happen, and therefore makes Words&nbsp; and Phrases, p. 113.)<br><br>"A 'contingent claim' against an estate is one in which liability depends on some future event which may or&nbsp; may not occur, so that duty to pay may&nbsp; never become absolute."&nbsp;&nbsp; (In&nbsp; Re Flewell,&nbsp; 276 N. W.&nbsp; YS2, 733;&nbsp; 9 Words and Thrases, p. 114.)</blockquote>Whether or not the heirs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased, Juan C. Laya, would succeed in the action brought in Manila against the administrators of the estate of the deceased&nbsp; spouses Florencio Buan and Rizalina P. Buan, is the uncertain event or contingency upon which the validity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim presented in the administration proceedings depends.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the said action&nbsp; has not yet been finally decided or determined to the effect that the&nbsp; petitioners herein, heirs of the deceased Juan C. Laya, have no right of action against the estate of the deceased spouses Florencio P.&nbsp; Buan and&nbsp; Rizalina P. Buan, the contingent claim that petitioners have filed in the Court of First Instance of Tariac&nbsp; in the proceedings for the administration of the deceased&nbsp; spouses Florencio P. Buan and Rizalina P. Buan, may not be dismissed. The order of the court dismissing&nbsp; the claim and declaring that the same&nbsp; may again be entertained if&nbsp; another valid complaint by the petitioners herein is filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, is inconsistent with the nature and character of a contingent claim.&nbsp; A&nbsp; contingent claim does not follow the temporary orders of dismissal of an action upon which it is based; it awaits the final outcome thereof and only said final result can cause its termination. The rules provide that a contingent claim is to tie presented in the&nbsp; administration proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; same manner&nbsp; as any ordinary claim,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that when&nbsp; the contingency arises which&nbsp; converts the&nbsp; contingent claim&nbsp; into a&nbsp; valid claim, the&nbsp; court should then be&nbsp; informed that the claim had already matured.&nbsp; (Secs. 5,&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 87.)&nbsp; The order of the court subject of&nbsp; the appeal should,&nbsp; therefore, be set aside.<br><br>The first order of the court admitted the claim but denied the petition for&nbsp; the setting aside of a certain amount from the estate 'to respond therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The validity of the&nbsp; contingent claim is apparent; as the driver of the bus belonging to the deceased spouses, Florencio P. Buan and Rizalina P. Buan, was found guilty of negligence, as a&nbsp; result of which Juan C. Laya died,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said deceased&nbsp; spouses—the employers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; driver—can&nbsp; be&nbsp; made&nbsp; responsible, as masters of&nbsp; a&nbsp; servant, for damages for the death of the petitioner's father.&nbsp;&nbsp; A portion of the estate should, there- fore,&nbsp; be set aside to respond for sued damages as&nbsp; petitioners herein may subsequently recover in the action&nbsp; that they have brought in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; This amount should&nbsp; be fixed in the court below.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the order of&nbsp; the.court dismissing&nbsp; the contingent claim filed by petitioners is hereby set aside.&nbsp; It is hereby ordered that the claim be allowed to continue, and it is further&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court fix an amount that may be set aside to respond for the damages that the petitioners herein may ultimately recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against the respondents.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
