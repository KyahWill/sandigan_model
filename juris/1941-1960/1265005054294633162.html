				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals affirming an order of the respondent&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue requiring the petitioner to pay deficiency amusement taxes, including surchages and&nbsp; real estate&nbsp; dealer's fixed tax, in the aggregate sum of P61,586.85.<br><br>Petitioner is a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines, operating jai alai games (Pelota Basca) with betting in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; provisions of Commonwealth Acts Nos. 485 and&nbsp; 601.&nbsp;&nbsp; It began&nbsp; operating sometime in 1940,&nbsp; and in accordance&nbsp; with said Acts&nbsp; the land on which the building is erected and the buildings thereon shall become the property of&nbsp; the Government of the Philippines&nbsp; after 25 years of&nbsp; operation.<br><br>On&nbsp; October&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; an examiner of the respondent Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue&nbsp; made an&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; of amusement tax on&nbsp; gross receipts derived from admissions to the Jai Alai from June 18,1949 to the end of December, 1954, totalling P62,586.85.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; contests the assessment on various grounds, the first of&nbsp; which&nbsp; is,&nbsp; that it is exempt from&nbsp; any&nbsp; and all&nbsp; taxes not&nbsp; embraced in&nbsp; Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 485,&nbsp; and the imposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the taxes against it violates&nbsp; the provisions of the Constitution impairing&nbsp; the obligation of&nbsp; contracts.&nbsp; This contention&nbsp; is based on the theory that Commonwealth Act 485, as implemented by&nbsp; Executive Orders Nos.&nbsp; 135 and 168, both series of&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; has&nbsp; created&nbsp; a&nbsp; contractual&nbsp; relationship between the Government and the&nbsp; petitioner, and the imposition of taxes&nbsp; other than&nbsp; those&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; said statutes is&nbsp; unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Section one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Commonwealth Act 485 provides as follows :<br><blockquote>"Any provision of existing law to the contrary notwithstanding1, it shall be permissible in the game of Basque pelota, a game&nbsp; of skill&nbsp; (including games of pala, raqueta, cestapunta,&nbsp; remonte and mano), in which professional&nbsp; players&nbsp; participate, to make&nbsp; either direct bets or bets&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of a totalizer; Provided That no operator or maintainer of a Basque&nbsp; Pelota court shall collect&nbsp; as commission a fee in excess of twelve per centum on such bets,&nbsp; or twelve per centum of the&nbsp; receipts of the totalizer, and of such per centum there shall be paid&nbsp; to the Government of the Philippines, for distribution in equal shares between the General Hospital and the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society."<br></blockquote>Executive Order No. 135, s. of 1948, regulates the establishment, maintenance and operation&nbsp; of Basque pelota games.&nbsp; The executive order provides that city or municipal&nbsp; mayors shall&nbsp; supervise the establishment, maintenance and&nbsp; operation of such games within their respective jurisdictions&nbsp; (sec. 2); that said mayors shall enforce laws, as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; regulations, regulating&nbsp; jai alai games and the construction and maintenance of buildings where the games are played, etc.&nbsp; (Sec. 3); prohibits operation of such games without&nbsp; a permit from&nbsp; the mayor&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 4); imposes a license fee of P500 annually for each basque pelota fronton and P18.00&nbsp; each annually for pelotaris, judges, or&nbsp; referees and&nbsp; superintendents (Sec. 5); prohibits&nbsp; persons under 16 year&nbsp; of&nbsp; age from&nbsp; carrying firearms or deadly weapons inside any basque pelota fronton (Sec. 9); prohibits card games&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; of the&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; games&nbsp; within&nbsp; the premises of any fronton (Sec. 10); fixes the days and hours of operation (Sec. 14); requires the licensing of pelotaris, judges, referees, etc. (Sec. 15); requires the&nbsp; installation of an automatic electric totalizator in the premises where the games are played&nbsp; (Sec. 16); fixes the face value of wager tickets in an amount not exceeding P5.00 for each, and requiring that said face values be the basis of the&nbsp; payment of dividends after eliminating fractions of P0.10 (Sec. 18); regulates the participation of the corporation in the dividends and the share of the National Treasury&nbsp; therein, thus: 10-½% commission on the total bets,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the operator; 4-½% of&nbsp; such bets, for the National Treasury; 85% of the total bets,&nbsp; to be distributed in the form of dividends among&nbsp; holders of winning&nbsp; numbers or&nbsp; combinations; a" tax of ½% of the total bets&nbsp; (to be taken&nbsp; from the&nbsp; 10 ½% of the operator) to cover the expenses of&nbsp; the personnel assigned to supervise the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; games (Sec. 19);&nbsp; and provides&nbsp; supervision over the conduct of the games&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 20).&nbsp; Executive Order&nbsp; No. 168,&nbsp; dated August 25, 1948, amends the above executive order on the days and hours of operation and on the distribution of wager funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with this executive order, the commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; operators is 11-½%&nbsp; of the total bets,&nbsp; the share of the National Treasury is 3%; the expenses of personnel supervising operation of games is&nbsp; ½% of total bets, and 85%&nbsp; of the total bets is&nbsp; retained for distribution as dividends among the holders of numbers or combination of numbers.<br><br>We find no&nbsp; provision in&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 485 supporting the theory that petitioner is a franchise holder and is not responsible for any&nbsp; tax or assessment&nbsp; not enumerated in the said act.&nbsp; The practice heretofore adopted by the&nbsp; National Legislature is&nbsp; to&nbsp; enact a special law, if it decides to create a special franchise for a corporation, and insert in the franchise an express provision that taxes or assessment&nbsp; included in the&nbsp; franchise shall be "in lieu of taxes."&nbsp;&nbsp; These common features of a special franchise are absent&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case at bar.&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; there is no special law creating the Jai Alai Corporation, neither is there&nbsp; a provision that&nbsp; such&nbsp; corporation is free from payment of taxes other than those enumerated in Commonwealth Act No. 485.<br><br>It has also been the practice&nbsp; to grant a franchise only to public utilities,&nbsp; in which capital requirements are enormous and returns slow.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; of the franchises granted by the Government are those given the Manila Railroad Company, the Manila Electric Company and the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.&nbsp; The Jai Alai is not a public service or a public utility.&nbsp; The Corporation is organized under a general&nbsp; act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions in the law and in the executive orders implementing it giving a share in the bets to the National&nbsp; Treasury is in consonance with the policy of&nbsp; requiring games&nbsp; of a gambling&nbsp; nature to contribute funds for. charitable&nbsp; institutions.&nbsp; Unless such a share for charitable institutions is&nbsp; given, such&nbsp; games, which are strictly a form of gambling, would have&nbsp; no justification for their existence or maintenance.&nbsp; But such authority to conduct gambling games, where bets are made, is no reason or argument for the claim that such gambling institutions may not&nbsp; be subject&nbsp; to the ordinary fees collected from&nbsp; other&nbsp; gambling establishments.<br><br>Neither is the provision that after 25 years&nbsp; the&nbsp; building and&nbsp; land belonging to the&nbsp; corporation shall become properties of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; a&nbsp; ground&nbsp; or reason for relieving the Jai Alai Corporation of the ordinary taxes. The&nbsp;&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; game or amusements&nbsp; tax also find's&nbsp; no similarities&nbsp; between the case of the petitioner with the Manila Railroad Company, the Manila Electric Company, because the said&nbsp; companies were taxed&nbsp; at the rate&nbsp; of from 1-½% of their gross earnings "in lieu of all taxes", which is&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; as in the case before us.&nbsp; We, therefore, find no merit in the first claim of petitioner-appellant.<br><br>The second&nbsp; question&nbsp; raised in the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is, whether or not petitioner&nbsp; is liable&nbsp; for the 20% deficiency amusement tax on unclaimed dividends, differences or breakages, management fees, and&nbsp; admission fees from May 4, 1948 to June 17,1949,&nbsp; It is to be noted in connection with this question that wager funds,&nbsp; management&nbsp; fees, differences or breakages and unclaimed dividends all go to the corporation&nbsp; and&nbsp; form part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gross receipts&nbsp; of the petitioner.&nbsp; There is no valid reason for not&nbsp; including these&nbsp; in the gross receipts and therefore subject to tax.<br><br>The third question relates to&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim from absolute exemption from&nbsp; the graduated&nbsp; percentage taxes, because of&nbsp; the amendment of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 39 by Republic Act No.&nbsp; 418.&nbsp; Third paragraph of&nbsp; Section 8 of Republic Act No. 39&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; contains the word&nbsp; "Jai Alai"&nbsp; as liable&nbsp; to 20 of&nbsp; the gross receipts, together with race tracks.&nbsp; Said third paragraph reads as follows:<br><blockquote> "In the case of cockpits, cabarets,&nbsp; and night clubs, there shall be collected from the proprietor,&nbsp; lessee or operator a tax equivalent to ten&nbsp; per centum,&nbsp; and in the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; race-tracks and Jai alai, twenty per centum&nbsp; of the gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any&nbsp; amount is charged&nbsp; or paid&nbsp; for admission:&nbsp; <i>Provided, however,</i>&nbsp; that&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of race-tracks, this tax is in&nbsp; addition to the&nbsp; privilege tax&nbsp; prescribed in section one hundred and ninety-three.&nbsp; For the purpose of amusement tax, the term gross receipts' embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee, or operator of the&nbsp; amusement place."&nbsp; </blockquote>In Republic Act No. 418,&nbsp; said third&nbsp; paragraph was amended, and the&nbsp; words "and Jai Alai" were eliminated, so that only race tracks&nbsp; are subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; 20%&nbsp; of the gross receipts, thus:<br><blockquote>"In the case of cockpits, cabarets, and night-clubs, there shall be collected from the proprietor, lessee, or operator a tax equivalent to ten&nbsp; per centum, and in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; race-tracks, twenty per centum of the gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is charged or paid for admission: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>.&nbsp; That in the&nbsp; cave of race-tracks,&nbsp; this tax is in addition to the privilege tax prescribed in section one hundred ninety-three.&nbsp; For the purpose of amusement tax, the term "gross receipts" embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, lessee, or operator of the amusement place." (Sec. 2, par.&nbsp; 3 of Republic Act No. 418).<br></blockquote>It is contended that the Jai. Alai is exempt from payment of&nbsp; the other amusement taxes, graduated according to the amount of receipts and specified in sub-paragraphs a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h and i of paragraph 1 of Section 260, C.A. 466. No stretch of the imagination&nbsp; or amount of&nbsp; reasoning can produce the conviction that the change which, exempts&nbsp; the Jai Alai from the 20 % of gross receipts imposed&nbsp; by said paragraph 3, had the&nbsp; effect of exempting said Jai&nbsp; Alai from&nbsp; the graduated taxes specified in paragraph one of Sec. 260, G.A. 466, and in its sub-paragraphs. The records&nbsp; of the proceedings show that the original House bill No. 1461, which was later promulgated&nbsp; into Republic Act No. 418, did not contain&nbsp; said&nbsp; elimination, but said elimination was made in the&nbsp; Senate, without explanation of any kind.&nbsp; We can not go beyond the actual terms of the statutes to determine what the legislative intent was.&nbsp; If such intention had been&nbsp; to&nbsp; exempt&nbsp; the Jai Alai&nbsp; from payment of the graduated scales of taxes contained in paragraph 1&nbsp; of Section&nbsp; 260, the exemption should also have been expressly stated in the amendatory law.<br><br>Prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 39, the Jai Alai&nbsp; was liable to graduated&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; under paragraph 1 of Section 260 of&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; By Republic Act&nbsp; No. 39, the tax was&nbsp; changed from such graduated taxes to 20% of the gross receipts.&nbsp; But when Republic Act No. 418&nbsp; was passed on June 18, 1949, and Jai Alai&nbsp; was suppressed from those that should be liable to the 20%&nbsp; on gross receipts, the apparent intention of the Legislature was&nbsp; to make the Jai&nbsp; Alai&nbsp; responsible as previously, that is before Republic Act No. 39 took effect. The theory raised&nbsp; on petitioner's&nbsp; behalf, that it ceased to be responsible for the graduated taxes, under paragraph 1 of Section 260 is not&nbsp; supported by the records of the proceedings in relation to the enactment of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 418.&nbsp; Exemptions&nbsp; are&nbsp; never&nbsp; presumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; They must&nbsp; be&nbsp; expressed in the clearest and most unambiguous language, and not left to mere implication.&nbsp; (N.Y. ex rel Schrurz, et al., <i>vs.</i> Cook,&nbsp; 148 U.S. 397; Govt. of P.I.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Monte de Piedad, 35 Phil., 42; Asiatic Petroleum Co.,<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>, Llanes, 49 Philippines 466;&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue <i>vs.</i> Manila Jockey Club,&nbsp; Inc., 98 Phil.,&nbsp; 670).&nbsp; The only reasonable inference to be derived from Republic Act No. 118 is to revert the Jai Alai to its former status as a place of amusement, subject to tax under paragraph 1 of Section 260,&nbsp; as it had&nbsp; always been prior to the enactment&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 39.<br><br>It is claimed under the fourth assignment of error that the petitioner cannot be&nbsp; held liable for the payment of the real estate dealer's&nbsp; fixed tax because a real estate dealer includes only persons engaged&nbsp; in the business of letting or renting&nbsp; property&nbsp; on their own account and holding themselves&nbsp; as dealers in real estate, and it is claimed that the Jai Alai is&nbsp; not such&nbsp; business.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioner, however, has overlooked or ignored the last part of the law, that is, Section 194&nbsp; (s),&nbsp; C.A. No. 466, as amended by Republic Act No.&nbsp; 588, which took effect&nbsp; on September 22, 1950, in which it provides:<br><blockquote>" * * * 'Real estate&nbsp; dealer' includes&nbsp; any person engaged in&nbsp; the business of&nbsp; buying, selling, exchanging, leasing, or renting property on his own account as principal and holding himself out as a full or part-time dealer in real estate or as an owner of rental property or properties rented or offered to rent for an aggregate, amount of three thousand pesos or more a year."<br></blockquote>It is true that the Jai&nbsp; Alai is not engaged in the real estate business, but it is an owner&nbsp; of a rental&nbsp; property or property offered&nbsp; for rent for more than P30,000 a year, because the&nbsp; "Keg&nbsp; Room,"&nbsp; the "Bamboo&nbsp; Bar"&nbsp; and&nbsp; the "Popular&nbsp; Bar," are leased to&nbsp; Joaquin Lopez&nbsp; for P2,500 a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that this rented property is part of the Jai Alai building, but&nbsp; it is not&nbsp; directly or indirectly connected with the Jai Alai games.&nbsp; The petitioner is not made to pay the taxes because of operating the Jai Alai "Sky Room," which overlooks the floor used for the "pelota" games.&nbsp; The "Keg&nbsp; Room," and "Popular Bar,"&nbsp; are separated from the floor&nbsp; used for the&nbsp; "pelota" games. In&nbsp; short it is&nbsp; true the&nbsp; Jai Alai&nbsp; is&nbsp; not engaged in the business of real estate, but it falls&nbsp; under the last provision of the law because it is an owner of&nbsp; rental property, and this rental property&nbsp; is not connected with the&nbsp; premises used for the Jai Alai games.<br><br>In its fifth assignment of error, it is claimed that petitioner herein is entitled&nbsp; to the return of P75,000&nbsp; deposited on various dates by installments to prevent distraint and levy during&nbsp; the pendency, reinvestigation and reconsideration of the&nbsp; case in the Bureau of Internal&nbsp; Revenue.<br><br>The court below&nbsp; found that this amount was&nbsp; paid in installments "in&nbsp; partial payment of taxes&nbsp; due&nbsp; from&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; The&nbsp; accountant of the petitioner on January 25, 1953, stated thus:&nbsp; "We hereby certify that the following payments&nbsp; were made on our amusement taxes and obligations with the Bureau of Internal Revenue."&nbsp; The Collector of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue applied the said amounts on the deficiency amusement tax&nbsp; on&nbsp; gross receipts from May 4, 1948 to&nbsp; June 17,&nbsp; 1949, amounting to P73,879.89. Note that the&nbsp; other deficiency taxes&nbsp; were due on admission fees collected from June 18, 1949 to December, 1954, amounting to P59,969.44, on the operation of the Sky Room, amounting to P1,875.02,&nbsp; and real&nbsp; estate dealer's&nbsp; fixed tax for the period from the second quarter of&nbsp; 1949 to the 4th quarter, 1954,&nbsp; amounting to P862.50.<br><br>There is no&nbsp; merit in&nbsp; petitioner's claim for the&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; amount of P75,000 deposited&nbsp; with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, for the reason that this amount was paid by the petitioner expressly for the purpose&nbsp; of covering the deficiency taxes&nbsp; due from it.<br><br>For all the foregoing considerations, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is hereby affirmed <i>in toto.</i><br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Gutierrez&nbsp; David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
