				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Shigenori Kuroda, formerly a Lieutenant-General of the Japanese Imperial Army and Commanding General of the Japanese Imperial Forces in the Philippines during a period covering 1943 and 1944, who is now charged before a Military Commission convened by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, with having unlawfully disregarded and failed "to discharge his duties as such commander to control the operations of members of his command, permitting them to commit brutal atrocities and other high crimes against noncombatant civilians and prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Forces, in violation of the laws and customs of war"—comes before this Court seeking to establish the illegality of Executive Order No. 68 of the President of the Philippines; to enjoin and prohibit respondents Melville S. Hussey and Robert Port from participating in the prosecution of petitioner's case before the Military Commission; and to permanently prohibit respondents from proceeding with the case of petitioner.<br><br>In support of his case, petitioner tenders the following principal arguments:<br><br><i>First</i>.—"That Executive Order No. 68 is illegal on the ground that it violates not only the provisions of our constitutional law but also our local laws, to say nothing of the fact (that) the Philippines is not a signatory nor an adherent to the Hague Convention on Rules and Regulations covering Land Warfare and, therefore, petitioner is charged of 'crimes' not based on law, national and international." Hence, petitioner argues—"That in view of the fact that this commission has been empanelled by virtue of an unconstitutional law and an illegal order, this commission is without jurisdiction to try herein petitioner."<br><br><i>Second</i>.—That the participation in the prosecution of the case against petitioner before the Commission in behalf of the United States of America, of attorneys Melville Hussey and Robert Port, who are not attorneys authorized by the Supreme Court to practice law in the Philippines, is a diminution of our personality as an independent state, and their appointments as prosecutors are a violation of our Constitution for the reason that they are not qualified to practice law in the Philippines.<br><br><i>Third</i>.—That Attorneys Hussey and Port have no personality as prosecutors, the United States not being a party in interest in the case.<br><br>Executive Order No. 68, establishing a National War Crimes Office and prescribing rules and regulations governing the trial of accused war criminals, was issued by the President of the Philippines on the 29th day of July, 1947. This Court holds that this order is valid and constitutional. Article 2 of our Constitution provides in its section 3, that—<br><blockquote>"The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, and adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the nation." </blockquote> In accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law of the present day, including the Hague Convention, the Geneva Convention and significant precedents of international jurisprudence established by the United Nations, all those persons, military or civilian, who have been guilty of planning, preparing or waging a war of aggression and of the commission of crimes and offenses consequential and incidental thereto, in violation of the laws and customs of war, of humanity and civilization, are held accountable therefor. Consequently, in the promulgation and enforcement of Executive Order No. 68, the President of the Philippines has acted in conformity with the generally accepted principles and policies of international law which are part of our Constitution.<br><br>The promulgation of said executive order is an exercise by the President of his powers as Commander in Chief of all our armed forces, as upheld by this Court in the case of Yamashita vs. Styer (L-129, 42 Off. Gaz., 664)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; when we said—<br><blockquote>"War is not ended simply because hostilities have ceased. After cessation of armed hostilities, incidents of war may remain pending which should be disposed of as in time of war. 'An important incident to a conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military command not only to repel and defeat the enemies but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war.' (<i>Ex parte</i> Quirin, 317 U. S., 1; 63 Sup. Ct., 2.) Indeed, the power to create a military commission for the trial and punishment of war criminals is an aspect of waging war. And, in the language of a writer, a military commission 'has jurisdiction so long as a technical state of war continues. This includes the period of an armistice, or military occupation, up to the effective date of a treaty of peace, and may extend beyond, by treaty agreement.' (Cowles, <i>Trial of War Criminals</i> by Military Tribunals, American Bar Association Journal, June, 1944.)"<br></blockquote>Consequently, the President as Commander in Chief is fully empowered to consummate this unfinished aspect of war, namely, the trial&nbsp; and punishment of war criminals, through the issuance and enforcement of Executive Order No. 68.<br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent Military Commission has no jurisdiction to try petitioner for acts committed in violation of the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention because the Philippines is not a signatory to the first and signed the second only in 1947. It cannot be denied that the rules and regulations of the Hague and Geneva conventions form part of an are wholly based on the generally accepted principles of international law. In fact, these rules and principles were accepted by the two belligerent nations, the United States and Japan, who were signatories to the two Conventions. Such rules and principles, therefore, form part of the law of our nation even if the Philippines was not a signatory to the conventions embodying them, for our Constitution has been deliberately general and extensive in its scope and is not confined to the recognition of rules and principles of international law as contained in treaties to which our government may have&nbsp; been or shall be signatory.<br><br>Furthermore, when the crimes charged against petitioner were allegedly committed, the Philippines was under the sovereignty of the United States, and thus we were equally bound together with the United States and with Japan, to the rights and obligations contained in the treaties between the belligerent countries. These rights and obligations were not erased by our assumption of full sovereignty. If at all, our emergence as a free state entitles us to enforce the right, on our own, of trying and punishing those who committed crimes against our people. In this connection, it is well to remember what we have said in the case of Laurel vs. Misa (76 Phil., 372):<br><blockquote>"* * * The change of our form of government from Commonwealth to Republic does not affect the prosecution of those charged with the crime of treason committed during the Commonwealth, because it is an offense against the same government and the same sovereign people * * *."<br></blockquote>By the same token, war crimes committed against our people and our government while we were a Commonwealth, are triable and punishable by our present Republic.<br><br>Petitioner challenges the participation of two American attorneys, namely, Melville S. Hussey and Robert Port, in the prosecution of his case, on the ground that said attorneys are not qualified to practice law in the Philippines in accordance with our Rules of Court and the appointment of said attorneys as prosecutors is violative of our national sovereignty.<br><br>In the first place, respondent Military Commission is a special military tribunal governed by a special law and not by the Rules of Court which govern ordinary civil courts. It has already been shown that Executive Order No. 68 which provides for the organization of such military commissions is a valid and constitutional law. There is nothing in said executive order which requires that counsel appearing before said commissions must be attorneys qualified to practice law in the Philippines in accordance with the Rules of Court. In fact, it is common in military tribunals that counsel for the parties are usually military personnel who are neither attorneys nor even possessed of legal training.<br><br>Secondly, the appointment of the two American attorneys is not violative of our national sovereignty. It is only fair and proper that the United States, which has submitted the vindication of crimes against her government and her people to a tribunal of our nation, should be allowed representation in the trial of those very crimes. If there has been any relinquishment of sovereignty, it has not been by our government but by the United States Government which has yielded to us the trial and punishment of her enemies. The least that we could do in the spirit of comity is to allow them representation in said trials.<br><br>Alleging that the United States is not a party in interest in the case, petitioner challenges the personality of attorneys Hussey and Port as prosecutors. It is of common knowledge that the United States and its people have been equally, if not more greatly, aggrieved by the crimes with which petitioner stands charged before the Military Commission. It can be considered a privilege for our Republic thft a leader nation should submit the vindication of the honor of its citizens and its government to a military tribunal of our country.<br><br>The Military Commission having been convened by virtue of a valid law, with jurisdiction over the crimes charged which fall under the provisions of Executive Order No. 68, and having jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner by having said petitioner in its custody, this Court will not interfere with the due processes of such Military Commission. For all the foregoing, the petition is denied with costs de oficio.<br><br><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> 75 Phil., 563.<br><br> <hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><i>DISSENTING</i><br></div><br>PERFECTO. <i>J.</i>:<br><br>A military commission was empaneled on December 1, 1948, to try Lt. Gen. Shigenori Kuroda for violation of the laws and customs of land warfare.<br><br>Melville S. Hussey and Robert Port, American citizens and not authorized by the Supreme Court to practice law, were appointed prosecutors representing the American CIC in the trial of the case.<br><br>The commission was empaneled under the authority of Executive Order No. 68 of the President of the Philippines, the validity of which is challenged by petitioner on constitutional grounds. Petitioner has also challenged the personality of Attorneys Hussey and Port to appear as prosecutors before the commission.<br><br>The charges against petitioner has been filed since June 26, 1948, in the name of the People of the Philippines as accusers.<br><br>We will consider briefly the challenge against the appearance of Attorneys Hussey and Port. It appearing that they are aliens and have not been authorized by the Supreme Court to practice law, there could not be any question that said persons cannot appear as prosecutors in petitioner's case, as with such appearance they would be practicing law against the law.<br><br>Said violation vanishes, however, into insignificance at the side of the momentous questions involved in the challenge against the validity of Executive Order No. 68. Said order is challenged on several constitutional grounds. To get a clear idea of the questions raised, it is necessary to read the whole context of said order which is reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 68<br><br>"ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL WAR CRIMES OFFICE AND PRESCRIBING RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE TRIAL OF ACCUSED WAR CRIMINALS.<br></div><br>"I, Manuel Roxas, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the Philippines, do hereby establish a National War Crimes Office charged with the responsibility of accomplishing the speedy trial of all Japanese accused of war crimes committed in the Philippines, and prescribe the rules and regulations governing such trial.<br><br>"The National War Crimes Office is established within the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army of the Philippines and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Judge Advocate General.

(Section 1, Article VI.)<br></blockquote>While there is no express provision in the fundamental law prohibiting the exercise of legislative power by agencies other than Congress, a reading of the whole context of the Constitution would dispel any doubt as to the constitutional intent that the legislative power is to be exercised exclusively by Congress, subject only to the veto power of the President of the Philippines, to the specific provisions which allow the President of the Philippines to suspend the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas curpus</i> and to place any part of the Philippines under martial law, and to the rule-making power expressly vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court.<br><br>There cannot be any question that the members of the Constitutional Convention were believers in the tripartite system of government as originally enunciated by Aristotle, further elaborated by Montesquieu and accepted and practiced by modern democracies, especially the United States of America, whose Constitution, after which ours has been patterned, has allocated the three powers of government—legislative, executive, judicial—to distinct and separate departments of government.<br><br>Because the powers vested by our Constitution to the several departments of the government are in the nature of grants, not a recognition of pre-existing powers, no department of government may exercise any power or authority not expressly granted by the Constitution or by law by virtue of express authority of the Constitution.<br><br>Executive Order No. 68 establishes a National War Crimes Office, and the power to establish government office is essentially legislative.<br><br>The order provides that persons accused as war criminals shall be tried by military commissions. Whether such a provision is substantive or adjective, it is clearly legislative in nature. It confers upon military commissions jurisdiction to try all persons charged with war crimes. The power to define and allocate jurisdiction for the prosecution of persons accused of any crime is exclusively vested by the Constitution in Congress.<br><br>It provides rules of procedure for the conduct of trials. This provision on procedural subject constitutes a usurpation of the rule-making power vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court.<br><br>It authorizes military commissions to adopt additional rules of procedure. If the President of the Philippines cannot exercise the rule-making power vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court, he cannot, with more reason, delegate that power to military commissions.<br><br>It appropriates the sum of P700,000 for the expenses of the National War Crimes Office established by the said Executive Order No. 68. This constitutes another usurpation of legislative power as the power to vote appropriations belongs to Congress.<br><br>Executive Order No. 68, is, therefore, null and void, because, through it, the President of the Philippines usurped powers expressly vested by the Constitution in Congress and in the Supreme Court.<br><br>Challenged to show the constitutional or legal authority under which the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 68, respondents could not give any definite answer. They attempted, however, to suggest that the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 68 under the emergency powers granted to him by Commonwealth Act No. 600, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 620, and Commonwealth Act No. 671, both of which are transcribed below:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> "COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 600<br><br>"AN ACT DECLARING A STATE OP EMERGENCY AND AUTHORIZING THE PRESIDENT TO PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF THE PHILIPPINES AND TO INSURE THE TRANQUILITY OF ITS INHABITANTS.<br></div><br>"<i>Be it enacted by the National Assembly of the Philippines</i>:<br><br>"SECTION 1. The existence of war in many parts of the world has created a national emergency which makes it necessary to invest the President of the Philippines with extraordinary powers in order to safeguard the integrity of the Philippines and to insure the tranquility of its inhabitants, by suppressing espionage, lawlessness, and all subversive activities, by preventing or relieving unemployment, by insuring to the people adequate shelter and clothing and sufficient food supply, and by providing means for the speedy evacuation of the civilian population, the establishment of an air protective service, and the organization of volunteer guard units, and to adopt such other measures as he may deem necessary for the interest of the public. To carry out this policy the President is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations which shall have the force and effect of law until the date of adjournment of the next regular session of the First Congress of the Philippines, unless sooner amended or repealed by the Congress of the Philippines. Such rules and regulations may embrace the following objects: (1) to suppress espionage and other subversive activities; (2) to require all able-bodied citizens (<i>a</i>) when not engaged in any lawful occupation, to engage in farming or other productive activities or (<i>b</i>) to perform such services as may be necessary in the public interest; (3) to take over farm lands in order to prevent failure or shortage of ci;pps and avert hunger and destitution; (4) to take over industrial establishments in order to insure adequate production, controlling wages and profits therein; (5) to prohibit lockouts and strikes whenever necessary to prevent the unwarranted suspension of work in productive enterprises or in the interest of national security; (6) to regulate the normal hours of work for wage-earning and salaried employees in industrial or business undertakings of all kinds; (7) to insure an even distribution of labor among the productive enterprises; (8) to commandeer ships and other means of transportation in order to maintain, as much as possible, adequate and continued transportation facilities; (9) to requisition and take over any public service or enterprise for use or operation by the Government; (10) to regulate rents and the prices of articles or commodities of prime necessity, both imported and locally produced or manufactured; and (11) to prevent, locally or generally, scarcity, monopolization, hoarding, injurious speculations, and private controls affecting the supply, distribution, and movement of foods, clothing, fuel, fertilizers, chemicals, building materials, implements, machinery, and equipment required in agriculture and industry, with power to requisition these commodities subject to the payment of just compensation.

Any person, firm, or corporation found guilty of the violation of any provision of this Act or of any of the rules or regulations promulgated by the President under the authority of section one of this Act shall be punished by imprisonment of not more than ten years or by a fine of not more than ten thousand pesos, or by both. If such violation is committed by a firm or corporation, the manager, managing director, or person charged with the management of the business of such firm, or corporation shall be criminally responsible therefor.<br><br>"SEC. 4. The President shall report to the National Assembly within the first ten days from the date of the opening of its next regular session whatever action has been taken by him under the authority herein granted.<br><br>"SEC. 5. To carry out the purposes of this Act, the President is authorized to spend such amounts as may be necessary from the sum appropriated under section five of Commonwealth Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-eight.<br><br>"SEC. 6. If any provision of this Act shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional and void, such declaration shall not invalidate the remainder of this Act.<br><br>"SEC. 7. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.<br><br>"Approved, August 19, 1940."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"COMMONWEALTH ACT No. 671<br><br>"AN ACT DECLARING A STATE OF TOTAL EMERGENCY AS A RESULT OF WAR INVOLVING THE PHILIPPINES AND AUTHORIZING THE PRESIDENT TO PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MEET SUCH EMERGENCY.<br></div><br>"<i>Be it enacted by the National Assembly of the Philippines</i>:<br><br>"SECTION 1. The existence of war between the United States and other countries of Europe and Asia, which involves the Philippines, makes it necessary to invest the President with extraordinary powers in order to meet the resulting emergency.<br><br>"SEC. 2. Pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, section 16, of the Constitution, the President is hereby authorized, during the existence of the emergency, to promulgate such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out the national policy declared in section 1 hereof. Accordingly, he is, among other things, empowered (<i>a</i>) to transfer the seat of the Government or any of its subdivisions, branches, departments, offices, agencies or instrumentalities; (<i>b</i>) to reorganize the Government of the Commonwealth including the determination of the order of precedence of the heads of the Executive Departments; (<i>c</i>) to create new subdivisions, branches, departments, offices, agencies or instrumentalities of government and to abolish any of those already existing; (<i>d</i>) to continue in force laws and appropriations which would lapse or otherwise become inoperative, and to modify or suspend the operation or application of those of an administrative character; (<i>e</i>) to impose new taxes or to increase, reduce, suspend, or abolish those in existence; (<i>f</i>) to raise funds through the issuance of bonds or otherwise, and to authorize the expenditure of the proceeds thereof; (<i>g</i>) to authorize the National, provincial, city or municipal governments to incur in overdrafts for purposes that he may approve; (<i>h</i>) to declare the suspension of the collection of credits or the payment of debts; and (<i>i</i>) to exercise such other powers as he may deem necessary to enable the Government to fulfill its responsibilities and to maintain and enforce its authority.<br><br>"SEC. 3. The President of the Philippines shall as soon as practicable upon the convening of the Congress of the Philippines report thereto all the rules and regulations promulgated by him under the powers herein granted.<br><br>"SEC. 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval, and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be in force and effect until the Congress of the Philippines shall otherwise provide.<br><br>"Approved, December 16, 1941."<br></blockquote>The above Acts cannot validly be invoked, because they ceased to have any effect much before Executive Order No. 68 was issued on July 29, 1947. Said Acts had elapsed upon the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese forces or, at the latest, when the surrender of Japan was signed in Tokyo on September 2, 1945.<br><br>When both Acts were enacted by the Second National Assembly, we happened to have taken direct part in their consideration and passage, not only as one of the members of said legislative body but as chairman of the Committee on Third Reading, popularly known as the "Little Senate." We are, therefore, in a position to state that said measures were enacted by the Second National Assembly for the purpose of facing the emergency of an impending war and of the Pacific War that finally broke out with the attack of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. We approved said extraordinary measures, by which, under the exceptional circumstances then prevailing, legislative powers were delegated to the President of the Philippines, by virtue of the following provisions of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>"In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may by law authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out a declared national policy." (Article VI, section 26.)<br></blockquote>It has never been the purpose of the National Assembly to extend the delegation beyond the emergency created by the war, as to extend it farther would be violative of the express provisions of the Constitution. We are of the opinion that there is no doubt on this question; but if there could still be any, the same should be resolved in favor of the presumption that the National Assembly did not intend to violate the fundamental law.<br><br>The absurdity of the contention that the emergency Acts continued in effect even after the surrender of Japan can not be gainsaid. Only a few months after liberation and even before the surrender of Japan, or since the middle of 1945, the Congress started to function normally. In the hypothesis that the contention can prevail, then, since 1945, that is, four years ago, even after the Commonwealth was already replaced by the Republic of the Philippines with the proclamation of our Independence, two distinct, separate and independent legislative organs,—Congress and the President of the Philippines—would have been and would continue enacting laws, the former to enact laws of every nature including those of emergent character, and the latter to enact laws, in the form of executive orders, under the so-called emergency powers. The situation would be pregnant with dangers to peace and order, to the rights and liberties of the people, and to Philippine democracy. Should there be any disagreement between Congress and the President of the Philippines, a possibility that no one can dispute, the President of the Philippines may take advantage of the long recess of Congress (two-thirds of every year) to repeal and overrule legislative enactments of Congress, and may set up a veritable system of dictatorship, absolutely repugnant to the letter and spirit of the Constitution.<br><br>Executive Order No. 68 is equally offensive to the Constitution because it violates the fundamental guarantees of the due process and equal protection of the laMr. It is especially so, because it permits the admission of many kinds of evidence by which no innocent person can afford to get acquittal, and by which it is impossible to determine whether an accused is guilty or not beyond all reasonable doubt.<br><br>The rules of evidence adopted in Executive Order No. 68 are a reproduction of the regulations governing the trial of twelve criminals, issued by General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief, of the United States Armed Forces in Western Pacific, for the purpose of trying, among others, Generals Yamashita and Homma. What we said in our concurring and dissenting opinion to the decision promulgated on December 19, 1945, in the Yamashita case, L-129,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and in our concurring and dissenting opinion to the resolution of January 23, 1946, in disposing the Homma case, L-244,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> are perfectly applicable to the offensive rules of evidence embodied in Executive Order No. 68. Said rules of evidence are repugnant to conscience as under them no justice can be expected.<br><br>For all the foregoing, conformably with our position in the Yamasita and Homma cases, we vote to declare Executive Order No. 68 null and void and to grant the petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> 75 Phil., 563.<br><br><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font> Not Reported.</div>
