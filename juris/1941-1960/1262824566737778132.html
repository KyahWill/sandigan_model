				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Defendant-appellee Dominador&nbsp; Sanchez&nbsp; y&nbsp; Aglibut&nbsp; was charged&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; violation of Circulars&nbsp; Nos. 20 and&nbsp; 45, as amended by Circular No. 55,&nbsp; all of the Central Bank of the Philippines, in relation to Section 34 of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 265, alleged to have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows: <br><blockquote>"That on or about the&nbsp; 20th day of December,&nbsp; 1954, in the City of Manila, Philippines,&nbsp; the said&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; having in his possession the amount of $400.00,&nbsp; did then and there wilfully and unlawfully fail and refuse to&nbsp; declare the same&nbsp; with&nbsp; any authorized agent of the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines upon&nbsp; his&nbsp; arrival&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines as prescribed by Circulars 20 and 42 as amended&nbsp; by Circular 55 of the Central Bank.</blockquote>" When&nbsp; first arraigned, he entered the&nbsp; plea of not guilty. Later on, however,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; allowed by the&nbsp; court&nbsp; on&nbsp; re-arraignment to change his former plea&nbsp; to that&nbsp; of guilty, on the basis of which, he was&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; thus: <br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE,&nbsp; upon recommendation of&nbsp; Asst. Fiscal Jose T. M. Mayo,&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; Dominador Sanchez is&nbsp; hereby sentenced to pay a fine of FIFTY (P50.00)&nbsp; pesos and five (5) days imprisonment, and to pay the costs.<br><br>"The $400.00 taken from the accused, referred to in the aforecited information, are hereby&nbsp; ordered to&nbsp; be&nbsp; exchanged at the&nbsp; Central Bank of&nbsp; the Philippines with&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Currency and delivered to Dominador Sanchez, the owner of said money". </blockquote>Defendant&nbsp; Sanchez did&nbsp; not&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; the decision.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; through the Solicitor&nbsp; General, took an appeal from&nbsp; it, particularly, the&nbsp; last paragraph&nbsp; of&nbsp; the dispositive portion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision aforequoted,&nbsp; claiming that&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as under the&nbsp; provisions of Article 10&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, the said code&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be supplementary to special laws punishing offenses, unless such laws specially provide&nbsp; otherwise;&nbsp; that&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no such special provision&nbsp; in the law violated&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that the Revised Penal Code should&nbsp; not be considered supplementary to it;&nbsp; that consequently,&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the Penal Code are applicable, particularly, the provisions&nbsp; of Article 45&nbsp; of&nbsp; said code, referring to&nbsp; confiscation&nbsp; and forfeiture of the proceeds&nbsp; of the crime&nbsp; and the instruments with&nbsp; which the crime was&nbsp; committed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Government counsel believes that since the&nbsp; $400.00&nbsp; involved in the offense can clearly be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as proceeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; or an instrument in committing the offense, inasmuch&nbsp; as without said money, there&nbsp; would have been&nbsp; no&nbsp; violation of the law, then said amount should&nbsp; have&nbsp; been forfeited to the Government instead of&nbsp; having&nbsp; been ordered&nbsp; returned to defendant-appellee&nbsp; after&nbsp; exchanging it at the Central Bank with Philippine&nbsp; pesos. <br><br>The Solicitor&nbsp; General cites a long line&nbsp; of&nbsp; decisions in support&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; contention&nbsp; and&nbsp; we are inclined to agree with&nbsp; him.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for defendant-appellee says that the appealed decision is already final and&nbsp; conclusive, for the reason that the terms thereof&nbsp; had been&nbsp; satisfied and&nbsp; complied with&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; he having not only paid&nbsp; the fine&nbsp; of P50.00, but also served the&nbsp; five-day imprisonment.&nbsp; This claim of&nbsp; service&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sentence by the accused is&nbsp; not only not refuted by the Solicitor&nbsp; General, but would appear to&nbsp; be borne&nbsp; out by the&nbsp; certificate of Police Sergeant Ruflno&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Mendoza of&nbsp; the Manila City Jail where the defendant was confined for five days and later released&nbsp; after serving his sentence.&nbsp; We also agree with defendant's counsel who&nbsp; cites several decisions of this Tribunal to the effect&nbsp; that a sentence in&nbsp; a criminal case in this jurisdiction may become&nbsp; final in&nbsp; two ways: First,&nbsp; by the lapse of fifteen days after rendition thereof; and second, by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; complying&nbsp; with the terms of the&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S. vs.&nbsp; Hart,&nbsp; 24 Phil.&nbsp; 278;&nbsp; People vs. Quebral,&nbsp; 76 Phil. 294;&nbsp; Gregorio vs. Director of Prisons, 43&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 650).&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; under&nbsp; Section 7&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule 116, Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court, a judgment&nbsp; in a criminal&nbsp; case becomes final after the lapse of the period for perfecting an&nbsp; appeal, or when the sentence has been partially or totally satisfied or served or the defendant has expressly waived in writing his right&nbsp; to appeal.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the circumstances, the sentence having become final, no&nbsp; court, not even this high Tribunal, can modify it even if erroneous, as claimed by the Solicitor General. <br><br>Furthermore, and this is&nbsp; equally important, in a&nbsp; similar case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; involving a violation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; circulars&nbsp; of the Central&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; where&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court in sentencing the accused failed to provide for the disposition of the amount ill. dollars&nbsp; involved,&nbsp; but&nbsp; by&nbsp; a subsequent resolution, it provided&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; confiscated&nbsp; but should be exchanged with pesos at&nbsp; the Central Bank and then delivered to the accused, from which resolution the Government tried to appeal, we said: <br><blockquote>"With the view we take of'&nbsp; the&nbsp; propriety and&nbsp; legality&nbsp; of the appeal,&nbsp; we find it unnecessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; go into the&nbsp; merits of the con- tention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; although it&nbsp; may&nbsp; not be out&nbsp; of place to state that&nbsp; according&nbsp; to the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; June&nbsp; 10,1955,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; resolution, the penalty&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; which&nbsp; did not include&nbsp; the confiscation of the amount&nbsp; of 83,140.00, was upon the recommendation of the prosecution itself. In the first place, the confiscation&nbsp; or&nbsp; forfeiture of&nbsp; the&nbsp; above mentioned sum&nbsp; would be an&nbsp; additional&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; and&nbsp; would&nbsp; amount to&nbsp; an increase of the penalty already imposed upon the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp; To reopen the case for the&nbsp; purpose of increasing the penalty, as is&nbsp; sought in the Government's appeal, would be&nbsp; placing the accused in double jeopardy, and under Rule 118, Section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, the Government cannot appeal&nbsp; in a&nbsp; criminal case if the defendant would be placed thereby in double jeopardy.&nbsp; (People vs.&nbsp; Cornelio&nbsp; Ferrer, G. R. No. L-9072, October 23, 1.906; People&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Ang Cho Kio, G. R. No. L-6687-88, 50&nbsp; Off Gaz. No. 8, p.&nbsp; 3563; People vs. Luis M. Taruc, G.R. No. L-8229, November&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1955.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the present case, the defendant-appellee&nbsp; did not file any&nbsp; brief, .naturally, this&nbsp; point of the legality of the appeal of the Government is not raised;&nbsp; even so, this Tribunal feels it is its duty&nbsp; to apply the law, specially when it favors the accused in a criminal&nbsp; case.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second&nbsp; place, the&nbsp; record shows that at the time the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; resolution was issued on July 30, 1955, the decision&nbsp; of June 10, 1955 had already become final&nbsp; and no longer subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; modification&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that the accused had&nbsp; already served&nbsp; the&nbsp; sentence, not partially but totally." </blockquote>In&nbsp; view of the foregoing&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal is hereby dismissed, with&nbsp; costs de oficio. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
