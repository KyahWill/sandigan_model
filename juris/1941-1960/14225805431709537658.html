				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant&nbsp; Daniel Jaynie seeks to reverse the decision of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations,&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; his motion for&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars as&nbsp; improperly&nbsp; taken and denying the same, and granting appellee Melchor Maniego'a authority to&nbsp; dispossess the appellant of his landholding at Parang Manga, San Jose, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija.<br><br>It appears that on February 27,&nbsp; 1954, appellee Melchor Maniego filed a complaint before the Nueva Ecija branch of the Court of Industrial Relations to eject the appellant from his&nbsp; landholding.&nbsp; At the hearing&nbsp; set for March 9, 1954,&nbsp; the appellant did&nbsp; not&nbsp; appear and was declared&nbsp; in default.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellee Maniego was forthwith allowed by&nbsp; the court&nbsp; to&nbsp; present his evidence.&nbsp; On March 31, 1954,&nbsp; the appellant moved for the lifting&nbsp; of the order&nbsp; of default which was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated April 30,&nbsp; 1954, requiring him to&nbsp; file his answer to the complaint within five&nbsp; days from notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellee Maniego,&nbsp; on his&nbsp; part, moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reconsideration of the&nbsp; resolution lifting the order of default but the&nbsp; court&nbsp; denied said&nbsp; motion on July 2, 1954.&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to the&nbsp; order of April 30,&nbsp; 1954 the hearing was&nbsp; set for September&nbsp; 21, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; June 23,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant filed a&nbsp; motion for bill of particulars&nbsp; and&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; asked&nbsp; for a&nbsp; continuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; hearing set for&nbsp; September- 21,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; On the latter&nbsp; date, the&nbsp; appellant did&nbsp; not appear&nbsp; for&nbsp; trial. Appellee Maniego was&nbsp; present.&nbsp; On March 11,&nbsp; 1955, the court issued&nbsp; an order&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; bill of particulars copy of which was received&nbsp; by the appellant on March 19, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, or on March 29,&nbsp; 1955, the court rendered its decision awarding&nbsp; relief to appellee Maniegoâ€”granting him authority to dispossess the appellant of his&nbsp; landholding at Parang Manga, San Jose, Nueva Ecija.<br><br>The&nbsp; questions of law&nbsp; raised by the&nbsp; appellant are as follows:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) Was it legal for&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; to hear the case on September 21,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; although on that date it had not yet resolved&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; bill of&nbsp; particulars, and much. less&nbsp; had answer&nbsp; been filed;&nbsp; hence the issues had not yet been joined?<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Was it legal for&nbsp; the lower court to revoke its order of April 30,&nbsp; 1954, and revive both its&nbsp; verbal order of default&nbsp; and&nbsp; the evidence taken pursuant to said order which had&nbsp; already been set aside?<br><br>(<i>c</i>) Did&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court act within the proper exercise of judicial discretion when it deprived&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant in its order of March 11, 1955 of the right to file his&nbsp; answer and the right to a hearing by considering the case submitted on the <i>ex parte</i> evidence aforementioned?<br><br>(<i>d</i>) Is the decision of March 29, 1955, based on the order of March 11, 1955, and aforementioned&nbsp; ex parbe evidence&nbsp; or appellee Maniego valid?<br><br>(<i>e</i>) Did&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court act within the proper exercise of sound discretion when by&nbsp; its&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; June 15, 1955, it denied to&nbsp; reconsider its aforesaid decision?<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; argues (<i>a</i>) that the case was not yet ready for hearing when the court&nbsp; proceeded to hear the same<i> ex parte</i> on September 21, 1954, inasmuch as the appellant had not yet filed his answer, for which&nbsp; he could not be blamed as his motion for bill of particulars legally stopped the running&nbsp; of&nbsp; the period of five&nbsp; days to answer,&nbsp; and said motion was not yet resolved;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; that when the lower court issued its order of March 11, 1955, the only matter submitted&nbsp; to it for consideration was that raised in the motion for bill of particulars; and the order of April 30, 1954 was&nbsp; not brought before&nbsp; it for resolution;&nbsp; (<i>c</i>) that while&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; could perfectly deny appellant's&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of particulars, it could not&nbsp; deprive him of the right to file an&nbsp; answer&nbsp; within the five&nbsp; days granted&nbsp; by the order ,of April 30, 1954;&nbsp; and if there was delay in the filing of said&nbsp; answer, it was due&nbsp; to the failure of the court to resolve the motion for bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars;&nbsp; (<i>d</i>) that the decision of March&nbsp; 29, 1955,&nbsp; being based&nbsp; on&nbsp; incompetent&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and&nbsp; irregular proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp; held&nbsp; on September&nbsp; 21, 1954, is not&nbsp; valid and legal.<br><br>The records reveal that inasmuch as the appellant did not&nbsp; appear for trial on&nbsp; March 9, 1954,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; declared in default while the appellee&nbsp; was allowed to present his evidence; that on March&nbsp; 81,&nbsp; 1954, the appellant moved for the lifting of the order of default and that acting on said motion, the lower court&nbsp; issued the&nbsp; order dated April 30, 1954,&nbsp; providing&nbsp; that:<br><blockquote>"In the interest&nbsp; of justice&nbsp; and in order&nbsp; to give the respondent-tenant another chance to present his evidence, said respondent is hereby ordered to file his answer to the complaint within five days from&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; of this order.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; had filed&nbsp; his answer, Atty. Marta Dallo,&nbsp; Commissioner of this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in Nueva Ecija, is directed to set again this&nbsp; case for hearing and receive the evidence of&nbsp; the respondent,&nbsp; giving him the opportunity&nbsp; to cross examine the&nbsp; petitioner and his&nbsp; witness."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is noteworthy that&nbsp; this order&nbsp; did&nbsp; not declare the proceedings during the hearing on March&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1954, void. It merely&nbsp; ordered the appellant to file his answer and&nbsp; to appear for hearing to present his&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and&nbsp; to cross examine appellee's&nbsp; witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; An&nbsp; order setting aside a judgment&nbsp; by&nbsp; default shall&nbsp; not disturb&nbsp; the proceedings already&nbsp; taken,&nbsp; except that&nbsp; the defendant who&nbsp; did not answer and appear for trial shall by opening said judgment be&nbsp; given the right&nbsp; to file his answer and&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear for trial&nbsp; to present&nbsp; his evidence as well as&nbsp; to&nbsp; cross&nbsp; examine complainant's witnesses.<br><blockquote> "Merely opening&nbsp; a judgment or setting aside a final judgment by default,&nbsp; does not necessarily&nbsp; vacate prior proceedings&nbsp; in the case except such as are dependent upon&nbsp; the judgment."&nbsp; (34 C. J. 386.) "Upon the entry of an&nbsp; order opening a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; by default, defendant should serve or file his plea or answer, in pursuance of leave&nbsp; granted in the order, or on&nbsp; being ruled so to&nbsp; do, the case should be placed on the calendar or set for trial, and should there upon&nbsp; be&nbsp; proceeded with&nbsp; as&nbsp; if no&nbsp; default&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; entered." (<i>supra, </i>431.) </blockquote>The decision under consideration&nbsp; (order, of&nbsp; March&nbsp; 29,. 1955) based&nbsp; its findings&nbsp; of facts&nbsp; on the evidence presented by appellee&nbsp; Maniego at&nbsp; the hearing held&nbsp; on March 9, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; This hearing&nbsp; was never set aside by&nbsp; the order of April 30, 1954,&nbsp; lifting the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; default.&nbsp; It was proper for&nbsp; the lower court to&nbsp; have utilized the evidence presented at such hearing as the basis for its order&nbsp; under appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the appellant did not appear on September 21, 1954, which was fixed for the&nbsp; only purpose of&nbsp; receiving&nbsp; his evidence and&nbsp; giving him the&nbsp; opportunity to cross&nbsp; examine&nbsp; appellee Maniego's witnesses, there was no need&nbsp; for said&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; to&nbsp; reintroduce his&nbsp; evidence.<br><br>We cannot understand why the appellant filed a motion for bill&nbsp; of particulars when in his motion for lifting the order of default,&nbsp; he had set forth clearly his defenses and set-offs.&nbsp; For cause and effect, it is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; assumed that when&nbsp; one is definite in&nbsp; his defense, he is fully&nbsp; aware of the exact&nbsp; claims against&nbsp; him. Moreover,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; had pointed&nbsp; out,&nbsp; inasmuch as the particular&nbsp; averments of appellee Maniego could be determined&nbsp; from&nbsp; the evidence already&nbsp; submitted and shown in the records, and if the appellant was really interested in&nbsp; the adjudication of his case, he could easily have examined said&nbsp; records and there was no&nbsp; need for any bill of&nbsp; particulars.&nbsp; By several motions for continuance, motion&nbsp; for bill&nbsp; of particulars," and .subsequently blaming the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; for delayed&nbsp; action on said&nbsp; motions, the&nbsp; appellant in&nbsp; effect had tried&nbsp; to&nbsp; avert due administration&nbsp; of justice.<br><br>Granting that&nbsp; appellant's motion for bill of particulars was not immediately&nbsp; resolved, and that in the&nbsp; meantime the five-day period within which&nbsp; to answer was suspended, there was still time to file the required answer after the appellant&nbsp; had received the order&nbsp; denying his&nbsp; motion&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; Within&nbsp; five days&nbsp; from the latter date, he had ample opportunity to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did not.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J,&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L. </i>and<i> Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
