  <br>
  <em>G. R. No. L-13389 </em></p>
<p>On  10  April  1957, the  Capitol  Subdivision, Inc.  and Montelibano Subdivisions filed a  motion in the above mentioned  court  and  cadastral case  alleging that  Lot  No. 21 of subdivision plan No;  Psd-12392, a part of Lot No. 77  of the Silay Cadastre,  registered in  the names of Alfredo Mohtelibano and Alejandro M. Hontelibano, share and share alike, covered by TCT No. T-5979, was sold to Corazon J. Lacson of Silay,  Occidental Negros, payable by installment; that prior to the sale, sometime in August 1947, the vendors mortgaged the said parcel of land together with other properties  of the  petitioners  to  the Philippine National Bank, Bacolod Branch, to secure the payment of an obligation, which mortgage was duly noted at the back of  TCT No. T-5979 under entry No.  4999; that on 24 September  1954 the vendee paid in full the agreed price of the parcel of land and on the same date the vendors executed the deed of sale in her favor; that on 29 January 1957 the mortgagee executed a deed of release of real estate mortgage on the parcel of land in'question; that on 12 March 1957 Alfredo L. Montelibano and Concepcion Montelibano  Ho j ilia brought  an action  against Alfredo Montelibano in the Court  of First Instance of Occidental Negros (civil case  No.  4274) and, pursuant to the provisions of section 79, Act  No. 496, as amended, and section 24,  Rule 7, of the Rules  of Court, caused  a notice of <em>lis pendens</em> to be  annotated in the  title  to all the realties of the defendant in the province of Occidental Negros, including that sold to Corazon J. Lacson; and that the vendee was  an innocent purchaser.   They prayed that the Register of Deeds of the province of Occidental Negroa be  directed to cancel the notice of <em>lis  pendens</em> annotated on  the back of TCT No. T-5979, insofar as  it affects Lot No. 21, and  issue the corresponding transfer  certificate of title in favor  of Corazon J. Lacson free from the annotation of the notice  of Us pendens.  On 10 May 1957 the Court, presided over by Hon. Jose F. Fernandez, entered an order dated 27 April 1957 granting the petitioners' motion. On 22 May 1957 the oppositors  Alfredo L. Montelibano and Concepcion Montelibano Hojilla filed a motion for reconsideration.  On  3 June  1957 the petitioners filed an  objection thereto.  On  11  November  1957 the Court  denied their motion.  Hence this appeal interposed by  the oppositors.</p>
<p><em>G. R. No. L-13390 </em></p>
<p>On 6 May 1957 the same petitioners filed a motion in the same court  and cadastral case alleging that Lot  No. 28  of the same subdivision plan, registered  also  in  the names of Alfredo Montelibano and  Alejandro  M.  Montelibano, share and share alike, covered by TCT No. T-5986, was sold to Marcelino  Lalantakan of  Silay,   Occidental Negros, payable by installment; that on 29 of  June 1936 the vendee paid in full the agreed price of the parcel of land and on the same  date the vendors executed the deed of sale in his favor; that the said parcel of land together with  other  realties of the  petitioners  was among those mortgaged by the vendors to the Philippine Natibnal Bank to secure the payment of a loan  of P81,900; that on 17 January  1957 the mortgagee executed  a deed  of  release of real estate mortgage on the parcel of land in question; that on 12 March 1957 Alfredo L. Montelibano and Conception Montelibano  Hoj ilia  brought an  action  against Alfredo Montelibano in  the Court of  First Instance of Occidental Negros  (civil case No. 4274), and cause a similar notice of <em>lis pendens</em> mentioned in the first  case to be annotated in the title to  all the realties of the defendant in the province  of Occidental Negros,  including that sold to Marcelino Lalantakan; and  that  the vendee was  an innocent  purchaser.  The petitioners  prayed   the  same relief as that asked in the first case.   On 24 May 1957 the same  oppositors  filed an  objection  to the motion to cancel the notice of <em>lis  pendens.</em> On 30 May 1957 the petitioners filed an answer thereto";  On 14 November 1957 the Court, presided  over by  Hon.  Jose  S. de  la  Cruz, entered  an order granting the petitioners motion.  Hence this appeal interposed by the  oppositors.</p>
<p>In the first case, the deed of sale in favor of Corazon J. Lacson, executed by the vendors on 24 September 1954, was registered in  the  office of the Register of Deeds on 9 May 1957 (entry No. 48590),  after  the notice of  <em>lis pendens</em> had  been  noted on the back of  the title  to the property  on  12  March  1957.  In the  second case,, the deed of  sale  in favor  of Marcelino  Lalantakan execute by the vendors on 29 June 1936 was  not registered at all.</p>
<p>The parcels  of land in  question  covered by transfer certificates of title Nos. 5979  and 5986 were registered in the names of  Alfredo Montelibano  and Alejandro M. Montelibano, share and  share alike.</p>
<p>In the brief filed jointly in these two  cases,  counsel for the appellants quotes the prayer of  their complaint in civil case No. 4274, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a) Declaring  null  and  void  the Project  of Partition, "Annex "B", and  the order approving the same, Annex "C",  hereof, and ordering a new  partition,  among  the plaintiffs  Concepcion Montelibano and Alfredo L.  Montelibano, and  the defendant Alfredo M. Montelibano, on the  basis  of  Â½%  each,  of the  properties  left by the deceased  spouses  Alejandro  Montelibano  and  Gliceria Montelibano, as listed and specified on  pages  1  to  3 of the Project of Partition, Annex "B"  hereof,  minus the  share already given to Alejandro M. Montelibano;</p>
  <p>b) In the alternative,  for the plaintiff  Concepcion  Montelibano, ordering the defendant  to transfer to her (Concepcion Montelibano) in full ownership of one-fourth of the urban lots which he received as his share under the Project of Partition,  Annex "B" hereof;</p>
  <p>c)  In the  alternative,  also,  ordering the  herein defendant to transfer  in full  ownership  one-half of all the properties which he received under the  Project of Partition, Annex  "B" hereof, and specified  on pages 3 to 6 thereof,  to  the plaintiff Alfredo L. Monteirbano;</p>
  <p>d) Sentencing  the defendant  to pay  the  plaintiffs Concepcion Montelibano and  Matias Hojilla damages in the sum  of  not less than P100,000.00, and the plaintiff Alfredo  L. MonteUbano  damages in the sum of not less than P200,000.00, both with the legal  rate of  interest from  the  time of the filing of  this  complaint  until full payment; and</p>
  <p>e) Sentencing  the defendant to  pay the  herein   plaintiff as attorney's fees, the sum of f50,000.00   (Pp. 2-3, appellants' brief.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although an unrecorded sale of a  parcel  of  land registered  under the  Torrens  System  is binding  upon  the parties, yet "The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the land * * *."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Such being the law any acquired right in a registered land is effective as between and binding upon the parties and their privies but not  as to third parties.  The sale made of the  two lots by the registered  owners to Corazon J. Lacson  and Marcelino  Lalantakan, respectively, not haying been registered, such sales do  not affect  third  parties.   The  lots continue or remain the property of Jbhe registered owners. And  when the latter  are sued by a party concerning or involving or affecting the lots thus sold by the  registered owners and the suing party causes a notice of Us pendens to be noted  on the back of the certificates of title to the lots  sold,  such notice cannot be cancelled upon  motion of the vendors or vendees predicated  upon the  fact that the vendees had acquired the lots prior to the noting of the notice of <em>lis pendens.</em> If judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiffs m the action brought against  the registered owners, the unrecorded right acquired by the vendees in the lots sold to them is subject or subordinate to the right of the  plaintiffs in whose favor judgment is rendered.  If judgment is  rendered against the plaintiffs in the action, the notice of <em>lis pendens</em> noted on the certificate of title to the lots loses its efficacy or is <em>ipso facto</em> cancelled.</p>
<p>The orders appealed from are reversed, with costs against the petitioners and appellees.</p>
