				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for certiorari to revoke&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of the respondent judge cancelling his previous order of execution. For the reasons stated hereinafter, it should be denied.<br><br>It appears that in Civil Case No. Q-2664 of Quezon City Court of First Instance, the parties submitted on December 9, 1957, a compromise&nbsp; agreement whereby, referring&nbsp; to the sale by installment of a&nbsp; parcel of land made&nbsp; by plaintiffs&nbsp; Pacita&nbsp; V. de los Santos and Jose V.&nbsp; de los Santos to defendant Francisco Mendonez, they asked the court to render a judgment subject to the following conditions:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>. On or before December&nbsp; 26, 1957,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; shall&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to plaintiffs the amount of P1,000.00;<br><span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>. Defendant shall pay P300.00 monthly installment within the first&nbsp; five days&nbsp; of every month beginning January, 1958, until the balance shall have been paid in&nbsp; full;<br><span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>. The&nbsp; balance&nbsp; shall bear&nbsp; interest at 10% per annum;<br><span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. That failure of defendant to pay P1,000.00 on or before December 26, 1957 and/or any two (2) successive monthly installments shall be cause for plaintiffs to demand&nbsp; of defendant to immediately vacate the premises&nbsp; with&nbsp; forfeiture&nbsp; in plaintiffs&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of all previous payments made; that if defendant will refuse to voluntarily vacate, plaintiffs can ask for execution of judgment against the&nbsp; defendant;<br><span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>. That plaintiffs&nbsp; shall&nbsp; execute the&nbsp; necessary absolute deed&nbsp; of sale of the lot,&nbsp; Lot No. 4, Block No.&nbsp; 13&nbsp; C of T.C.T.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 25094, Quezon City Registry, in favor of defendant upon&nbsp; payment in full of the balance."<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the court issued on December 10, 1957, a decision approving the agreement, and saying "judgment is hereby rendered in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein, for the parties to comply therewith * * *."<br><br>On&nbsp; March 10,&nbsp; 1958,&nbsp; plaintiffs in the same&nbsp; case filed a motion for execution, because defendant had&nbsp; allegedly neglected to&nbsp; pay monthly installments since January 1958. Plaintiffs set the&nbsp; motion for hearing on March&nbsp; 15, 1958. However, on March 14, 1958, defendants moved (with the conformity&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiffs'&nbsp; counsel)&nbsp; for&nbsp; postponement. to March&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1958 "to give the&nbsp; parties sufficient time to come to a more&nbsp; just, fair and equitable agreement."&nbsp; (Annex "E")&nbsp; And the&nbsp; judge postponed, as requested.<br><br>It is not clear what happened at the hearing on March 22, 1958.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to plaintiffs, Mendoñez admitted he violated the&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; asked&nbsp; for,&nbsp; and was granted, two days to settle&nbsp; with&nbsp; plaintiffs, but' he&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so.<br>According to defendant&nbsp; there was a misunderstanding at that hearing. The fact&nbsp; is, the court issued on March 25, 1958, an&nbsp; order&nbsp; of execution.&nbsp; However, defendant Mendoñez filed on April 17,&nbsp; 1958, an urgent motion&nbsp; to quash the writ of execution, asserting under oath that "immediately&nbsp; after the execution of&nbsp; the compromise agreement *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Pacita V.&nbsp; de&nbsp; los Santos&nbsp; and defendant Francisco&nbsp; Mendoñez entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a verbal&nbsp; agreement whereby the&nbsp; former assured&nbsp; and led defendant to believe that provided he could pay&nbsp; in&nbsp; full&nbsp; and at one&nbsp; time&nbsp; the balance of his indebtedness to her through a GSIS&nbsp; (Government Service Insurance System) loan which she is willing to facilitate for defendant, she would execute the necessary deed of absolute sale in favor of the defendant for Lot No.&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; Block No.&nbsp; 13-C, Pcs-3312-AMD&nbsp; of T.C.T. No. 25094 of Quezon City and would consider&nbsp; the terms and conditions favorable to her in their compromise agreement unenforceable against defendant. *&nbsp; * *."<br><br>Defendant further alleged, also under oath, among other things, that he&nbsp; applied for and secured the necessary loan from&nbsp; the GSIS;&nbsp; that plaintiffs had been so&nbsp; advised&nbsp; on March 28, 1958;&nbsp; but plaintiff&nbsp; Pacita V. de&nbsp; los&nbsp; Santos "arbitrarily and illegally demands and continuous demanding of defendant that before she complies with the content of said&nbsp; (verbal)&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; should pay&nbsp; her Pl,000.00 by way of attorney's fees plus the balance of defendant's indebtedness computed by her in the amount of P14,363.00, excluding&nbsp; interest yet, all to be taken from defendant's GSIS loan as approved, and that the P1,000.00 already paid by defendant to her as stated in paragraph 4, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, is considered by her forfeited in her favor. * *&nbsp; *.'<br><br>This&nbsp; urgent&nbsp; motion was taken up on April 19, 1958. After listening to the parties,&nbsp; the judge in&nbsp; open court ordered;&nbsp; "In view of the statement of counsel for plaintiffs that they are still open to an amicable settlement, action on the&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; quash writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution of the defendant&nbsp; is held in&nbsp; abeyance for&nbsp; two (2) weeks during which period they can settle the case amicably and report to the Court whatever agreement they may have reached."<br><br>On April&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1958, defendant&nbsp; manifested in writing that&nbsp; he conferred with plaintiff Pacita V. de&nbsp; los Santos on&nbsp; April 22, 1958, that he made known to her "that he is ready to pay and is&nbsp; offering&nbsp; her the sum of P13,563,&nbsp; his balance indebtedness to her, in&nbsp; accordance with their verbal&nbsp; agreement on&nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp; 9,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1957 * * *.&nbsp; Plaintiff Pacita&nbsp; V. de los&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; brushed&nbsp; aside&nbsp; defendant's offer of&nbsp; payment, and&nbsp; instead,&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that she will abide by their said agreement only&nbsp; if&nbsp; she&nbsp; will&nbsp; be paid P14,500.00. She added that she is demanding now, P14,500.00 after she has forfeited the Pl,000.00 already paid by&nbsp; defendant to her,&nbsp; and that she can not allow the P1,000.00 be deducted from the remaining balance&nbsp; of P14,563.00."<br><br>The&nbsp; judge called the parties to a pre-trial or conference on June 2, 1958.&nbsp; Noting&nbsp; defendant's insistance on&nbsp; non-violation of the&nbsp; compromise agreement, he&nbsp; set the&nbsp; case for hearing on June 3, 1958.&nbsp; On said date according to the&nbsp; Judge, Atty.&nbsp; Bernardo&nbsp; (for plaintiffs)&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to attend the hearing, and&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; proved the material allegations of his urgent motion as herein-above set forth.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; convinced&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; no&nbsp; justification for the issuance of the writ of execution, the Hon. Nicasio Yatco, Judge, quashed it by his order of June 4, 1958.<br><br>Hence this petition&nbsp; for certiorari to revoke&nbsp; that particular order,&nbsp; which&nbsp; petition&nbsp; must&nbsp; necessarily be based on&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction or&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>There is no question in this country that a&nbsp; judge has jurisdiction to quash a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution issued&nbsp; by him, particularly where&nbsp; it was improvidently issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dimayuga <i>vs.</i> Raymundo, 76 Phil., 143, 42 Off. Gaz., 2121). See also Garcia <i>vs.</i> Muñoz, 103 Phil., 628.<br><br>Was there abuse of discretion?&nbsp; We think not.&nbsp; In the first place, there being opposition on the part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendant, who alleged and proved a subsequent verbal agreement amending the&nbsp; compromise, execution could not validly be&nbsp; decreed without a hearing.&nbsp; As we said&nbsp; in Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Lucero, 100 Phil., 160, 52 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; (17), 7255,&nbsp; when under similar circumstances&nbsp; a&nbsp; breach of the compromise agreement is&nbsp; alleged, "there arises a&nbsp; cause of action&nbsp; which must be&nbsp; passed upon by&nbsp; the court requiring&nbsp; a hearing to determine whether such breach had really taken, place."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [2]</sup><br><br>In the second&nbsp; place, the allegations proved by Mendoñez about their verbal&nbsp; agreement, his having&nbsp; secured a loan from the&nbsp; GSIS and his consequent ability to discharge his&nbsp; obligation seemingly justified the&nbsp; court's&nbsp; refusal to eject defendant from the premises (on&nbsp; execution) with the consequent forfeiture in favor of the plaintiffs of more than P12,000.00 already paid by defendant as previous instalments of the purchase price,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> not to mention the loss of defendant's use of the&nbsp; house and theatre erected&nbsp; on that parcel of land.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the respondent judge's action&nbsp; caused no&nbsp; irreparable or undue harm&nbsp; to plaintiffs, because the latter still have&nbsp; the judgment that may&nbsp; be enforced upon any further default of defendant Mendoñez.&nbsp; Note&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; that their&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; credit continuous to earn 10%&nbsp; interest.<br><br>Wherefore, as the&nbsp; court&nbsp; had jurisdiction and has committed no&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion, the writ of certiorari may&nbsp; not be issued.<br><br>Petition denied, with&nbsp; costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The corollary request for mandamus to compel execution depends upon the petition for certiorari.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>[2]</sup> A further issue might possibly be tendered concerning the effect of
plaintiffs' repeated&nbsp; readiness "to&nbsp; come&nbsp; to a more just, fair and
equitable agreement" (Annex&nbsp; E)&nbsp; or&nbsp; an&nbsp; "amicable settlement" (Annex
X). Did this amount to&nbsp; a&nbsp; waiver of the right to demand execution as a
condonation of the default? Cf. Dimayuga <i>vs.</i>
