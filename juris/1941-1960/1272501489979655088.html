				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 30, 1941, plaintiff-appellee filed a miscellaneous 
sales application for a parcel of land known as cadastral lot No. 2777 situated 
at Elang, Kidapawan, Cotabato, and paid a deposit of P5 therefor (Exhibit F). 
The Bureau of Lands acknowledged receipt of his application on November 22, 1941 
(Exhibit E), and informed that it had been referred to the district land office 
of Cotabato, Cotabato. Upon receipt of his acknowledgment he started the 
construction of a small house on the lot, but the same was not finished because 
of the outbreak of the war. In 1946 he had another house constructed on the lot, 
which he used both as a clinic (he is a dentist) and as a residence. He 
introduced other improvements on the land and these, together with the house, he 
declared for tax purposes (Exhibit B), paying taxes thereon in 1947 and 1948 
(Exhibits C and D). He placed one Cacayorin in charge of the house, but 
Cacayorin left it on December 13, 1948. Thereupon defendant-appellant herein 
demolished the house and built thereon one of his own. On December 17, 1948, 
plaintiff went to defendant and asked the latter why he had constructed a 
building on the land, and the latter gave the excuse that there was no sign of 
interest on the part of the one who had applied for it. 
<p align="justify">On March 9, 1949, plaintiff-appellee instituted this action of 
forcible entry in the justice of the peace court, praying that defendant be 
ordered to vacate the lot usurped and remove the construction he had made 
thereon, with monthly damages at P10. Thereupon defendant filed a motion to 
dismiss the action on two grounds, namely, (1) that the court has no 
jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the same falls under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands, and (2) that the action is barred by a 
prior judgment, because a previous criminal action for usurpation of real 
property filed by plaintiff against him had been dismissed. The justice of the 
peace court denied the motion on the ground that the issue involved is as to who 
was in the actual possession of the lot in question on December 14, 1948, which 
issue can be resolved only after the presentation of evidence (Record on Appeal, 
pp.26-27). Thereupon defendant filed an answer denying plaintiff's possession 
since 1946, and alleging as special defenses (1) that the lot is an unawarded 
public land, which is already under investigation by the Bureau of Lands, and 
(2) that defendant was already acquitted of a criminal charge filed by plaintiff 
against him for usurpation of real property. By way of counterclaim he demanded 
P2,800 from plaintiff (Record on Appeal, pp. 27-33). On June 4, 1949, the 
justice of the peace court declared itself without jurisdiction to try the case 
for the reason that the subject matter of the action is the subject of an 
administrative investigation (Ibid., p. 39). Against this judgment plaintiff 
appealed to 'the Court of First Instance. At first this court refused to take 
cognizance of the case, but upon the authority of the case of Mago vs. Bihag, 44 
Off. Gaz., (12) 4934, decided by the Court of Appeals, it proceeded to try the 
case on the merits. After trial it found the facts already set forth above, and 
sentenced the defendant to vacate the land and indemnify the plaintiff in the 
sum of P100, with costs. Against this judgment this appeal has been presented, 
the defendant-appellant making the following assignments of error in his brief: 
</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote><ol><li>The lower Court erred in trying the case when the land involved is a public land and jurisdiction of which belong to the Land Department 
of the Philippines. <p></p>
<p align="justify"></p></li><li>The lower Court erred in trying the case when prior to the 
commencement of this action an administrative case was (is) pending between the 
parties over the same land in the Bureau of Lands and, as such, the latter has 
acquired first jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action, <p></p>
<p align="justify"></p></li><li>The lower Court erred in trying the case when the cause of 
this action is barred by a prior judgment. <p></p>
<p align="justify"></p></li><li>The lower Court erred in trying the case and rendering a 
decision on the merits when its duty after it had determined that the Justice of 
the Peace Court has jurisdiction is to reverse the order of dismissal of the 
inferior court and remand to it for further proceedings.</li></ol></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">Under the facts and circumstances of the case the question now 
before us is as follows: Do courts have jurisdiction to entertain an action of 
forcible entry instituted by a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> applicant of public land, who is in 
occupation and peaceful possession thereof and who has introduced improvements, 
against one who deprives him of the possession thereof before award and pending 
investigation of the application? Defendant-appellant contends that as the 
administrative disposition and control of public lands is vested exclusively in 
the Lands Department, cognizance of the forcible entry action or of any 
possessory action constitutes a "prejudicial interference" with the said 
administrative functions, because there is an administrative case pending in 
the Bureau of Lands between the same parties over the same land. The record 
contains a certificate of a land inspector to the effect that the investigation 
of the conflict between plaintiff-appellee herein and the defendant-appellant 
has been suspended because of the trial of the criminal case for usurpation 
filed by plaintiff against defendant-appellant. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Record on Appeal, pp. 
25-26.) We note from the certificate, however, that while plaintiff's 
application is registered as MSA 9917, defendant-appellant does not appear to 
have made any formal application at all. </p>
<p align="justify">It must be made clear at the outset that this case does not 
involve a situation where the Bureau of Lands has already made an award of, or 
authorized an entry into, the public land. It is purely a possessory action by a 
<span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> applicant who has occupied the land he has applied for before the 
outbreak of the war under the ostensible authority of his application, which was 
given due course for investigation, but as to which no approval has been given 
because investigation has not yet been finished. </p>
<p align="justify">An ideal situation in the disposition of public lands would be 
one wherein those alienable and disposable are yet unoccupied and are delivered 
to the applicants upon the approval of their application, free from other 
occupants or claimants. But the situation in the country has invariably been the 
opposite; lands are occupied without being applied for, or before the 
applications are approved. In fact, the approval of applications often takes 
place many years after the occupations began or the application was filed, so 
that many other applicants or claimants have entered the land in the meantime, 
provoking conflicts and overlapping of applications. For some reason or other 
the Lands Department has been unable to cope with the ever increasing avalanche 
of applications, or of conflicts and contests between rival applicants and 
claimants. </p>
<p align="justify">The question that is before this Court is: Are courts without 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of possessory actions involving these public 
lands before final award is made by the Lands Department, and before title is 
given any of the conflicting claimants? It is one of utmost importance, as there 
are public lands everywhere and there are thousands of settlers, especially in 
newly opened regions. It also involves a matter of policy, as it requires the 
determination of the respective authorities and functions of two coordinate 
branches of the Government in connection with public land conflicts.</p>
<p align="justify">Our problem is made simple by the fact that under the Civil 
Code, either in the old, which was in force in this country before the American 
occupation, or in the new, we have a possessory action, the aim and purpose of 
which is the recovery of the physical possession of real property, irrespective 
of the question as to who has the title thereto. Under the Spanish Civil Code we 
had the action interdicted, a summary proceeding which could be brought within 
one year from dispossession (Roman Catholic Bishop of Cebu vs. Mangaron, 6 Phil. 
286, 291); and as early as October 1, 1901, upon the enactment of the Code of 
Civil Procedure (Act No. 190 of the Philippine Commission) we implanted the 
common law action of forcible entry (section 80 of Act No. 190), the object of 
which has been stated by this Court to be "to prevent breaches of the peace and 
criminal disorder which would. ensue from the withdrawal of the remedy, and the 
reasonable hope such withdrawal would create that some advantage must accrue to 
those persons who, believing themselves entitled to the possession of property, 
resort to force to gain possession rather than to some appropriate action in the 
courts to assert their claims." (Supia and Batioco vs. Quintero and Ayala, 59 
Phil. 312, 314.) So before the enactment of the first Public Land Act (Act No. 
926) the action of forcible entry was already available in the courts of the 
country. So the question to be resolved is, Did the Legislature intend, when it 
vested the power and authority to alienate and dispose of the public lands in 
the Lands Department, to exclude the courts from entertaining the possessory 
action of forcible entry between rival claimants or occupants of any land before 
award thereof to any of the parties? Did Congress intend that the lands applied 
for, or all public lands for that matter, be removed from the jurisdiction of 
the Judicial Branch of the Government, so that any troubles arising therefrom, 
or any breaches of the peace or disorders caused by rival claimants, could be 
inquired into only by the Lands Department to the exclusion of the courts? The 
answer to this question seems to us evident. The Lands Department does not have 
the means to police public lands; neither does it have the means to prevent 
disorders arising therefrom, or contain breaches of the peace among settlers; or 
to pass promptly upon conflicts of possession. Then its power is clearly limited 
to <span style="font-style: italic;">disposition and alienation</span>, and while it may decide conflicts of possession 
in order to make proper award, the settlement of conflicts of possession which 
is recognized in the courts herein has another ultimate purpose, i.e., the 
protection of actual possessors and occupants with a view to the prevention of 
breaches of the peace. The power to dispose andalienate could not have been 
intended to include the power to prevent or settle disorders or breaches of the 
peace among rival settlers or claimants prior to the final award. As to this, 
therefore, the corresponding branches of the Government must continue to 
exercise power and jurisdiction within the limits of their respective functions. 
The vesting of the Lands Department with authority to administer, dispose, and 
alienate public lands, therefore, must not be understood as depriving the other 
branches of the Government of the exercise of their respective functions or 
powers thereon, such as the authority to stop disorders and quell breaches of 
the peace by the police, and the authority on the part of the courts to take 
jurisdiction over possessory actions arising therefrom not involving, directly 
or indirectly, alienation and disposition. </p>
<p align="justify">Our attention has been called to a principle enunciated in 
American courts to the effect that courts have no jurisdiction to determine the 
rights of claimants to public lands, and that until the disposition of the land 
has passed from the control of the Federal Government, the courts will not 
interfere with the administration of matters concerning the same. (50 C. J. 
1093-1094.) We have no quarrel with this principle. The determination of the 
respective rights of rival claimants to public lands is different from the 
determination of who has the actual physical possession or occupation with a 
view to protecting the same and preventing disorder and breaches of the peace. A 
judgment of the court ordering restitution of the possession of a parcel of land 
to the actual occupant, who has been deprived thereof by another through the use 
of force or in any other illegal manner, can never be "prejudicial interference" 
with the disposition or alienation of public lands. On the other hand, if courts 
were deprived of jurisdiction of cases involving conflicts of possession, that 
threat of judicial action against breaches Of the peace committed on public 
lands would be eliminated, and a state of lawlessness would probably be produced 
between applicants, occupants or squatters, where force or might, not right or 
justice, would rule.</p>
<p align="justify">It must be borne in mind that the action that would be used to 
solve conflicts of possession between rivals or conflicting applicants or 
claimants would be no other than that of forcible entry. This action, both in 
England and the United States and in our jurisdiction, is a summary and 
expeditious remedy whereby one in peaceful and quiet possession may recover the 
possession of which he has been deprived by a stronger hand, by violence or 
terror; its ultimate object being to prevent breach of the peace and criminal 
disorder. (Supia and Ba'cioco vs. Quintero and Ayala, 59 Phil., 312, 314.) The 
basis of the remedy is mere possession as a fact, of physical possession, not a 
legal possession. Mediran vs. Villanueva, 37 Phil., 752.) The title or right to 
possession is never in issue in an action of forcible entry; as a matter of 
fact, evidence thereof is expressly banned, except to prove the nature of the 
possession. (Section 4, Rule 72, Rules of Court.) With this nature of the action 
in mind, by no stretch of the imagination can the conclusion be arrived at that 
the use of the remedy in the courts of justice would constitute an interference 
with the alienation, disposition, and control of public lands. To limit 
ourselves to the case at bar can it be pretended at all that its result would in 
any way interfere with the manner of the alienation or disposition of the land 
contested? On the contrary, it would facilitate adjudication, for the question 
of priority of possession having been decided in a final manner by the courts, 
said question need no longer waste the time of the land officers making the 
adjudication or award. </p>
<p align="justify">The original Public Land Law (Act 926) was drafted and passed 
by a Commission composed mostly of Americans and as the United States has had 
its vast public lands and has had the same problems as we now have, involving 
their settlement and occupation, it is reasonable to assume that it was their 
intention to introduce into the country these laws in relation to our problems 
of and settlement and disposition. The problem now brought before us was 
presented in an analogous case in the year 1894 before the Supreme Court of 
Oklahoma in the case of Sproat vs. Durland, 2 Okl. 24, 35 Pae. 682, and said 
court made practically the same solution as we have, thus:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>* * *. This question is one of vital importance in Oklahoma. 
All our lands are entered, and title procured therefor, under the homestead 
laws of the United States. The question arising out of adverse possession, as 
between homestead claimants, daily confront our courts. To say that no relief 
can be granted, or that our courts are powerless to do justice between litigants 
in this class of cases, pending the settlement of title in the land department, 
would be the announcement of a doctrine abhorrent to a sense of common justice. 
It would encourage the strong to override the weak, would place a premium upon 
greed and the use of force, and, in many instances, lead to bloodshed and crime. 
Such a State of affairs is to be avoided, and the courts should not hesitate to 
invoke the powers inherent in them, and lend their aid, in every way possible, 
to prevent injustice, by preventing encroachments upon the possessory rights of 
settlers, or by equitably adjusting their differences. In the ease under 
consideration, no adequate remedy at law is provided for relief. Ejectment will 
not lie. Adams vs. Couch, 1 Okl. 17, 26 Pac. 1009. And, at the time this 
proceeding was instituted, the forcible entry and detainer act was insufficient 
in its provisions to afford a remedy. The appellee was entitled to speedy 
relief, and ought not to be compelled to await the final and tedious result of 
the litigation in the interior department, before obtaining that which he 
clearly shows himself entitled to have.</blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">The action of forcible entry was then deemed insufficient in 
that state to prevent acts of trespass interfering with an applicant's 
possession, so that the court ordered the issuance of an injunction. The main 
issue involved, however, was whether pending final investigation and award the 
occupant should be protected in his possession, and the Supreme Court of 
Oklahoma said it should, issuing an injunction to protect said possession. </p>
<p align="justify">The same conclusion was arrived at by the Supreme Court of 
Washington in the case of Colwell vs. Smith, 1: Wash. V. 92, 94, when it 
held:</p>
<p align="justify">We will not decide between two conflicting claimants, both of 
whom are actually in possession of certain portions of the claim in dispute, who 
is in the right, so far as to dispossess one or the other from the entire claim, 
which would render it impossible for him to prove that residence the law 
requires, and thus contest his claim before the register and receiver; we can 
and must protect either party from trespass by the other, upon such portion of 
the claim as may be in the actual exclusive possession of such party.</p>
<p align="justify">Resuming the considerations we have set forth above, we hold 
that the grant of power and duty to the Lands Department to alienate and dispose 
of public lands does not divest the courts of their duty or power to take 
cognizance of actions instituted by settlers or occupants or applicants against 
others to protect their respective possessions and occupations, more especially 
the actions of trespass, forcible entry and unlawful detainer, and that the. 
exercise of such jurisdiction is no interference with the alienation, 
disposition, and control of public lands. The question we have proposed to 
consider must be answered is the affirmative. </p>
<p align="justify">Our resolution above set forth answers defendant-appellant's 
contention. We have, however, to go further and explore another fundamental 
question, i.e., whether a public land applicant, such as the plaintiff-appellee 
herein, may be considered as having any right to the land occupied, which may 
entitle him to sue in the courts of justice for a remedy for the return of the 
possession thereof, such as an action of forcible entry or unlawful detainer, or 
any other suitable remedy provided by law. In the United States a claim "is 
initiated by an entry of the land, which is effectual by making an application 
at the proper land office, filing the affidavit and paying the amounts required 
by * * * the Revised Statutes. (Sturr vs. Beck, 133 U. S. 541, 10 S. Ct. 350, 33 
L. Ed. 761.) "Entry" as applied tp appropriation of land, "means that act by 
which an individual acquires an inceptive right to a portion of the 
unappropriated soil of the country, by filing his claim." (Ibid., citing Chotard 
vs. Pope, 25 U. S. 12 Wheat, 586, 588.) It has been held that entry based upon 
priority in the initiatory steps, even if not accompanied by occupation, may be 
recognized as against another applicant. </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>In Hastings &amp; Dakota E. v. Whitney, <span style="font-style: italic;">ubi supra</span>, an affidavit 
for the purpose of entering land as a homestead was filed on behalf of one 
Turner, in a local land office in Minnesota, on May 8, 1865, Turner claiming to 
act under section 1 of the Act of March 21, 1864 (13 Stat. 35), now section 2293 
of the Revised Statutes of the United States. As a matter of fact, Turner was 
never on the land, and no member of his family was then residing, or ever did 
reside, on it, and no improvements whatever had ever been made thereon by 
anyone. Upon being paid their fees, the register and receiver of the land office 
allowed the entry, and the same stood upon the records of the local land office 
and upon the records of the General Land Office, uncanceled, until September 30, 
1872. Between May, 1865, and September, 1872, Congress made a grant to the State 
of Minnesota for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from 
Hastings, through certain countries, to a point on the western boundary of the 
State, which grant was accepted by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota and 
transferred to the Hastings and Dakota Railroad Company, which shortly 
thereafter definitely located its line of road by filing its map in the office 
of the commissioner of the General Land Office. All these proceedings occurred 
prior to the 30th of September, 1872. This Court declared that the almost 
uniform practice of the Department has been to regard land upon which an entry 
of record, valid upon its face, has been made, as appropriated and withdrawn 
from subsequent homestead entry, preemption, settlement, sale or grant, until 
the original entry be cancelled or be declared forfeited, in which case the land 
reverts to the government as part of the public domain, and becomes again 
subject to entry under the Land Laws; and it was held that whatever defects 
there might be in an entry, so long as it remained a subsisting entry of record, 
whose legality has been passed upon by the land authorities and their action 
remained unreversed, it was such an appropriation of the tract as segregated it 
from the public domain, and therefore precluded it from subsequent grant; and 
that this entry on behalf of Turner "attached to the land" in question, within 
the meaning of the Act of Congress making the grant (14 Stat. 87), and could not 
be included within it. And as to mere settlement with the intention of obtaining 
title under the Preemption Law, while it has been held that no vested right in 
the land as against the United States is acquired until all the prerequisites 
for the acquisition of title have been complied with, yet rights in parties as 
against each other were fully recognized as existing, based upon priority in 
this initiatory steps, when followed up to a patent. "The patent which is 
afterwards issued relates back to the date of the initiatory act, and cuts off 
all intervening claimants." Shepley vs. Cowan, 91 U. S. 330, 337 (23: 424, 
426).</blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">There are compelling reasons of policy supporting the 
recognition of a right in a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> applicant who has <span style="font-style: italic;">occupied</span> the land 
applied for. Recognition of the right encourages actual settlement; it 
discourages speculation and land-grabbing. It is in accord with well established 
practices in the United States. It prevents conflicts and the overlapping of 
claims. It is an act of simple justice to the enterprise and diligence of the 
pioneer, without which land settlement can not be encouraged or emigration from 
thickly populated areas hastened. </p>
<p align="justify">Our answer to the second problem is also in the affirmative, 
and we hold that even pending the investigation of, and resolution on, an 
application by a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> occupant, such as plaintiff-appellee herein, by the 
priority of his; application and record of his entry, he acquires a right, to 
the possession of the public land he applied for against any other public land 
applicant, which right may be protected by the possessory action of forcible 
entry or by any other suitable remedy that our rules provide. </p>
<p align="justify">Having disposed of the most important questions raised on this 
appeal, we will next consider the procedural question, i.e., that the Court of 
First Instance, after deciding the question of jurisdiction of the justice of 
the peace favorably, should have remanded the case to that court for trial. The 
record discloses that upon the docketing of the case in the Court of First 
Instance on appeal, defendant-appellant filed a motion to dismiss, which the 
Court of First Instance granted. However, upon motion for reconsideration filed 
by plaintiff, the trial court vacated this order of dismissal, and thereupon the 
defendant presented his answer. There was no need of remanding the case to the 
justice of the peace court for trial, because this court had already 
heard and tried the case evidently on the merits. The case was, 'therefore, 
brought before the Court of First Instance on appeal and for a new trial, not 
only on the question of jurisdiction but on the merits also. </p>
<p align="justify">The claim of bar by a prior judgment, because the action for 
usurpation of real property instituted by plaintiff-appellee against 
defendant-appellant was dismissed, can not be sustained, for not only are the 
parties in the previous criminal action and in this action of forcible entry not 
identical, but the causes of action involved are also different.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bautista
