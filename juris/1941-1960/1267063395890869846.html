				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 22 November 1955 the plaintiff brought&nbsp; an action in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Camarines Norte to collect from the defendant the sum of P5,000, the balance of an account due for export logs purchased by the latter from&nbsp; the former, P1,500 as attorney's fee, P3,000 as moral damages, P2,000 as exemplary damages and costs, and to obtain any other just and equitable relief&nbsp; (civil No. 750).<br><br>On 7 January 1956 the defendant filed an&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; On 25 September 1956 the parties, assisted by their respective counsel, entered into a stipulation of facts and submitted it to the Court.&nbsp; The terms of the stipulation are:<br><blockquote>That the defendant admits in open court its obligation to the plaintiff in the amount of FIVE&nbsp; THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00), Philippine Currency,&nbsp; plus interest thereon from December 8,&nbsp; 1955 and costs;<br><br>That the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; mutually&nbsp; agreed to submit to the Court&nbsp; a fixed date when the&nbsp; defendant should pay the plaintiff the above obligations, the&nbsp; submission&nbsp; of&nbsp; which date&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; mutually agreed to be up to not later&nbsp; than November 6, 1956;<br><br>That for failure of the parties to submit to the Court the agreed date of payment on November 6, 1956,&nbsp; they mutually agreed&nbsp; that the Court shall have the full power&nbsp; to fix a reasonable time when the defendant should pay,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a judgment therefor&nbsp; shall issue based upon this stipulation of facts.<br></blockquote>The parties failed to submit to the Court the date when the defendant&nbsp; had to pay its debt&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; On 6 November 1956 the plaintiff filed an ex-parte motion praying that&nbsp; judgment be rendered upon the stipulation of facts and that the Court fix the time within which the defendant should pay the sum due to the plaintiff.&nbsp; On 28 November 1956&nbsp; the Court rendered&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; as prayed for&nbsp; ordering defendant to pay the plaintiff within thirty days&nbsp; from receipt of&nbsp; notice of judgment the sum of P5,000 with legal interest&nbsp; thereon from 8&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; until fully paid and to pay the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 21 January 1957 the Court denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration dated 12 January 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant has appealed.<br><br>The appellant admits that it owes the appellee the sum of P5,000.&nbsp; Under the second paragraph of the stipulation of facts, they agreed to set a date for the appellant to pay the appellee, to be submitted to the Court&nbsp; not later than 6 November 1956 and under the third paragraph of&nbsp; the same stipulation, should they fail to set&nbsp; a date for payment on 6 November 1956, the Court may set a reasonable&nbsp; time for the appellant to pay the appellee.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they failed to set a date for payment and submit it to the Court, on motion of the appellee, the Court&nbsp; rendered judgment&nbsp; upon the stipulation of facts&nbsp; and ordered the appellant to pay the appellee within thirty days from receipt of notice of judgment.&nbsp; The judgment rendered by the Court was but in pursuance of the compromise agreement&nbsp; embodied in the stipulation of facts&nbsp; entered freely and voluntarily by the parties with the assistance of their respective counsel.<br><br>The appellant cannot now&nbsp; claim and complain&nbsp; that the period fixed by&nbsp; the Court is unreasonable.<br><br>Citing article 1196 of the new&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; in&nbsp; support of its appeal, which provides that:<br><blockquote>Whenever in an obligation a&nbsp; period is&nbsp; designated, it is presumed to have&nbsp; been established for the benefit of&nbsp; both the&nbsp; creditor and the debtor, unless from the tenor of the same or other circumstances it should appear that the&nbsp; period has been established in favor of one or of the&nbsp; other;<br></blockquote>the appellant claims that the period&nbsp; of thirty days&nbsp; fixed by the Court redounded to&nbsp; the benefit only of the creditor, the&nbsp; appellee, and not mutually to the creditor and the debtor.&nbsp; In&nbsp; its&nbsp; brief, the appellant prays&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; be granted at least a year within which to pay the appellee. The article cited by&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant cannot be applied to the case at bar where the parties entered into a compromise agreement ending a controversy and authorizing the Court to fix a reasonable time within which the appellant should pay its debt to the appellee, if they fail&nbsp; to agree upon a date for payment and submit it to the Court.&nbsp; It applies where&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties to a contract themselves&nbsp; have fixed a period.<br><br>The&nbsp; appeal interposed by the appellant is manifestly to delay but not to evade payment of&nbsp; its debt.&nbsp; Nothing has been agreed upon by the parties in their stipulation on that contingency.&nbsp; Hence the collection or recovery of the sums of P1,800&nbsp; as attorney's fee, P3,000 as moral damages and P2,000 as exemplary damages&nbsp; sought by the appellee in its motion dated 6&nbsp; May 1957 filed in this Court cannot be&nbsp; granted.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with treble costs&nbsp; against the appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
