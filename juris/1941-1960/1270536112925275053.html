				G.R. No. L-1461, November 29, 1947</h4>
				<H3>GAW SIN GEE, PETITIONER, VS. EMILIO PEÑA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Except for some legal issues which the industry of petitioner's counsel 
uncovered, this case presents the same material features as others recently 
disposed of. The dispute concerns the occupation of market stalls of the 
Divisoria Market, City of Manila.
<p>Alleging that, without valid cause, the master of the Divisoria Market had 
required him to vacate stalls Nos. 1420-1423, which he had leased from the city, 
herein petitioner Gaw Sin Gee filed in the court of First Instance of Manila a 
petition for injunction. The respondent officer answered that he was acting upon 
orders of the Mayor, who had found, upon investigation, that Gaw Sin Gee had 
violated the terms of the lease, and therefore had forfeited his right to 
continue occupying the said market places.</p>
<p>Fortunata M. Torres, the other respondent herein, joined the defendant market 
master, supporting his allegations of violation of the conditions of the lease 
and cancellation thereof. And averring that the said stalls had been duly 
awarded to her, and that under Republic Act No. 37 she had preference as a 
Filipino citizen, she asked for judgment sustaining her right as occupant and 
lessee of said market places.</p>
<p>The court, Judge Emilio Peña presiding, tried the issues, and in due course, 
promulgated a decision, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Having arrived at the conclusion that the revocation of the lease was 
justified by the circumstances and no evidence having been presented to prove 
that the adjudication of stalls Nos. 1420-1423 to the defendant, Fortunata M. 
Torres, was irregular, it must be presumed that the provisions of the Market 
Code were followed in said adjudication.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendant, Fortunata 
M. Torres, and against the plaintiff, declaring the former the lawful occupant 
of stalls Nos. 1420-1423 of the Divisoria Market, Manila, and ordering the 
latter to vacate said stalls, with the costs of the proceedings taxed against 
him. The order of preliminary injunction is hereby lifted."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereafter the aforesaid respondents filed an "urgent motion for immediate 
execution" alleging the rendition of the judgment and the inability of the city 
authorities to eject Gaw Sin Gee and his agents unless authorized to do so. Over 
plaintiff's opposition, and notwithstanding his appeal, the court directed the 
issuance of execution.</p>
<p>Hence this petition for certiorari and allied remedies, principally to annul 
the order of execution. It is based on alleged excess of jurisdiction and grave 
abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>We have recently denied petitions to impede similar "execution" of judgment 
on the right to hold market stalls. We made these remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The decision in civil case No. 971 set aside the writ of preliminary 
injuction issued at its commencement. Under section 4 of Rule 39 of the Rules of 
Court, unless otherwise ordered by the trial court, a judgment dissolving or 
denying an injunction shall not be stayed after its rendition and before an 
appeal is taken or during the pendency of an appeal, although said court, in its 
discretion may restore such injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon 
such terms as to bond or otherwise as it may constitute proper for the security 
of the rights of the adverse party. In the instant case, the respondent judge 
not only did not restore the writ of preliminary injunction dissolved in his 
decision, but expressly ordered its execution and refused to allow the herein 
petitioner to file a supersedeas bond. In the absence of such injunction, the 
defendant city officials in civil case No. 971 could have proceeded, with the 
ouster of the petitioner from the stalls in question. Indeed, there is really 
nothing to be executed under the decision which merely determined who has a 
better title to said stalls; and the order of the respondent judge now 
complained of, can only be interpreted to mean as an authorization for the city 
authorities to carry out, with the aid of the sheriff, the said ouster." 
(Buenaventura <i>vs</i>. Peña, 78 Phil., 795.)</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the above is conclusive against petitioner 
herein.</p>
<p>It may be noted, in connection with his point that the lower court lacked 
jurisdiction to order the ejectment because none of the parties had asked for 
such remedy, that respondent Fortunata M. Torres as intervenor, had in effect 
solicited analogous relief. As to the other objection, vigorously pressed here, 
that the occupant of a market stall may not, summarily and administratively, be 
deprived of his lawful privilege without due process of law and all its 
applicable connotations, it is enough to state that this aspect of the 
litigation should be taken up when the appeal is considered on the merits.</p>
<p>The petition is denied, with costs. So ordered.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria,</i> 
and <i>Pablo, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
