				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Executive Orders Nos. 400 and&nbsp; 58 issued by the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and made effective January 1, 1942, and August 1, 1945, respectively, created the City of Greater Manila1 whereby Quezon City was absorbed by and became a part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City of Greater Manila. <br><br>On&nbsp; August&nbsp; 8, 1946, an&nbsp; information for murder&nbsp; committed in&nbsp; Quezon City, then a part of the City of Greater Manila, was filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; and docketed therein as Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 221, against petitioner Eulogio Mill,&nbsp; which information&nbsp; reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"That on&nbsp; or about the 8th day of June, 1946, in&nbsp; the City of Manila, Philippines,&nbsp; the said accused, with&nbsp; intent to&nbsp; kill and&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of treachery, did&nbsp; then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon one Iluminada&nbsp; Cabio by then and there stabbing&nbsp; her with a knife on the breast&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; parts&nbsp; of&nbsp; her body, thereby&nbsp; inflicting upon her mortal wounds which wore .the&nbsp; direct and immediate cause of her instantaneous death."</blockquote>Upon being&nbsp; arraigned on <i>December 14, 1955</i>, in Branch VIII of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila, defendant pleaded "not guilty" to this information.&nbsp; The delay in the arraignment of&nbsp; the defendant for&nbsp; 8 years&nbsp; since the filing of the information&nbsp; until his arraignment therefor,&nbsp; was due to his success in&nbsp; evading arrest. <br><br>On <i>October 10, 1946</i>, that is, before the arraignment of the&nbsp; defendant in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned case, Republic Act No. 54 was enacted by Congress, expressly repealing said Executive Orders Nos. 400, and&nbsp; 58 and restoring Quezon City to its former status as .a distinct&nbsp; and separate chartered&nbsp; city.&nbsp; On January 3, 1956, after&nbsp; the&nbsp; passage&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 54, counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Eulogio Mill riled&nbsp; with the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; a motion to quash the&nbsp; information in&nbsp; said case and in an- other case in which the same defendant was charged&nbsp; with the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; frustrated&nbsp; murder&nbsp; (not involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; these proceedings),&nbsp; apparently&nbsp; committed at the same occasion, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the Court had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to&nbsp; take cognizance thereof, which motion&nbsp; was granted&nbsp; by order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; January 16, 1956,&nbsp; worded as follows: <br><blockquote>"Wherefore, these&nbsp; two&nbsp; eases are dismissed, with costs <i>de oficio</i>. The Clerk of Court is&nbsp; directed&nbsp; to forthwith&nbsp; send a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of this order to the Prison&nbsp; Officer,&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Police&nbsp; Department, for his information, and another copy&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quezon City, together with copies of the informations, for such action as he may deem proper to take in the premises.&nbsp; If no new informations are&nbsp; filed by him in the Court&nbsp; of First 3instance, Quezon City, within five days from receipt of&nbsp; a copy of this&nbsp; order, the Prison&nbsp; Officer, Manila&nbsp; Police Department, shall forthwith release the.&nbsp; defendant from custody."&nbsp; (Section 7, Rule 113, Rules of Court.) </blockquote>This&nbsp; motion was predicated on the&nbsp; assumption that the Court "had lost jurisdiction to try these two cases as of the date&nbsp; of the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 54&nbsp; and&nbsp; the revival of Quezon&nbsp; City on October&nbsp; 10, 1946." <br><br>On January&nbsp; 21, 1956, the&nbsp; City Attorney of Quezon&nbsp; City filed an information with&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City&nbsp; Branch), docketed&nbsp; as Criminal Case No. Q-1907, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; amended&nbsp; on&nbsp; January 26, 1956, accusing the petitioner Eulogio Mill of the same crime of murder for which he had&nbsp; been&nbsp; previously&nbsp;&nbsp; charged&nbsp; in Criminal Case No. 221 of the Court of First Instance of Manila., and to said amended information the defendant pleaded "not&nbsp; guilty"&nbsp; upon&nbsp; arraignment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; amended information was of the following tenor: "<br><blockquote>The undersigned City Attorney of Quezon&nbsp; City accuses Eulogio Mill <i>alias</i> "Oloy" of the crime of murder, committed as follows: <br><blockquote>That&nbsp; on&nbsp; or about the 8th day of June, 1946, in&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City, Philippines, the above&nbsp; named accused, with intent to kill and without any justifiable motive, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with treachery, with evident premeditation and by taking- advantage of&nbsp; superior strength,&nbsp; attack,&nbsp; assault and&nbsp; stab one Iluminada&nbsp; Cabio by then and there striking her with an open knife, hitting her&nbsp; on the breast,&nbsp; back and on different parts of her&nbsp; body, thereby&nbsp; inflicting upon her&nbsp; serious&nbsp; and mortal&nbsp; stab wounds&nbsp; on said parts of her body, which were the&nbsp; direct and immediate cause of her death.&nbsp; That by reason of the death of said Iluminada Cabio, her heirs suffered actual,&nbsp; moral and other damages under the Civil Code." </blockquote></blockquote>Sometime thereafter, or on February 21, 1956, and upon learning that the offense with which he stands charged in Criminal Case No. Q-1907,&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VII,&nbsp; Quezon City, is&nbsp; one for which' he had&nbsp; allegedly been in&nbsp; jeopardy in&nbsp; Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 221 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, which had been dismissed, defendant Eulogio Mill&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion to&nbsp; with- draw&nbsp; his plea of not&nbsp; guilty and to allow him to submit a&nbsp; motion to quash.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion was set for hearing and after the parties were&nbsp; heard in oral argument, respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco issued in open&nbsp; court the following order: "<br><blockquote>For lack of sufficient merits, the motion to quash filed by counsel for the accused dated February 21, 1956, is hereby denied.",</blockquote> against which defendant filed a motion for reconsideration on the ground&nbsp; that said order is contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; law&nbsp; and established jurisprudence.&nbsp; But the respondent Judge&nbsp; after hearing&nbsp; anew the parties in oral argument on March 10, 1956, denied the motion for reconsideration in the following&nbsp; language: <br><blockquote>"There being no valid and convincing reasons alleged in the motion for reconsideration of counsel for the accused to disturb the order of this Court dated February 25, 1&amp;56, the same is hereby denied." </blockquote>It is to be stated at this juncture that the&nbsp; hearing of this&nbsp; case had been set for&nbsp; March&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1956, at&nbsp; 8:30 in the&nbsp; morning, and alleging&nbsp; that he has&nbsp; no other&nbsp; plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law for the protection of his fundamental right not to be put twice in&nbsp; jeopardy for the same offense, on March 15, 1956, petitioner herein filed in this Court the present certiorari and&nbsp; prohibition proceedings&nbsp; with preliminary&nbsp; injunction, praying&nbsp; that: <br><blockquote><ol><br><li> Upon the filing of this petition&nbsp; a writ of perliminary injunction&nbsp; issue against the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Court from&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; Criminal Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Q-1907 which&nbsp; it set for March 22, 1956.<br></li><li>&nbsp; An&nbsp; order issue&nbsp; annulling' and reversing the orders.&nbsp; of&nbsp; the respondent Court denying' the motion to quash and the motion&nbsp; for the reconsideration and ordering the respondent (Judge)&nbsp; to desist from further proceeding in Criminal Case No. Q-1907.<br></li><li>&nbsp; Petitioner further prays for&nbsp; such other measures&nbsp; or&nbsp; reliefs that&nbsp; this Honorable&nbsp; Court may&nbsp; deem just&nbsp; and equitable&nbsp; in&nbsp; the premises." </li></ol></blockquote>This petition was given due course by this Court&nbsp; which provided by resolution&nbsp; of March 19,&nbsp; 1956, to let the writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; prayed for&nbsp; in the petition&nbsp; be issued upon the filing by the&nbsp; petitioner of&nbsp; a bond&nbsp; in the sum of&nbsp; P200, and this&nbsp; requisite having been fulfilled the corresponding writ of preliminary injunction was issued. <br><br>On the facts just narrated, the main question that&nbsp; comes up for Our determination is whether or not the&nbsp; remedies of certiorari&nbsp; and prohibition lie in this case.&nbsp; Before engaging,&nbsp; however, in this task,&nbsp; it wiIl not be amiss to take up first&nbsp; the&nbsp; side issue&nbsp; of whether an&nbsp; accused&nbsp; may, as a matter of right, withdraw his plea of&nbsp; "not&nbsp; guilty"&nbsp; to file a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to quash.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 113&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, prescribes: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. <i>Time to move&nbsp; to quash or plead</i>.—Upon&nbsp; being&nbsp; arraigned the defendant shall immediately, unless the court grants him further time, either move&nbsp; to quash the complaint&nbsp; or information or plead thereto, or do both.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he moves to quash, without pleading, and the motion is withdrawn or overruled he shall immediately plead." </blockquote>This section&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; upon arraignment&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; shall <i>immediately</i> either move to quash the complaint or information&nbsp; or plead&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; or to&nbsp; do&nbsp; both. Under the&nbsp; old&nbsp; procedure a&nbsp; defendant who desired&nbsp; to "demur" (a plea now substituted by the&nbsp; "motion to quash") to the&nbsp; complaint or&nbsp; information must do&nbsp; so before&nbsp; he pleads thereto,&nbsp; and it&nbsp; was held&nbsp; that while&nbsp; he&nbsp; could demur as a matter of right <i>before</i> he entered&nbsp; his plea, once he had pleaded <i>not&nbsp; guilty</i>, his&nbsp; withdrawal of such plea, in order to "demur", became a matter of&nbsp; judicial discretion. This&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; applies to a motion&nbsp; to quash.&nbsp;&nbsp; (2&nbsp; Koran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952&nbsp; ed.,..p. .780).<br><br>In U. S. vs.&nbsp; Schneer, 7 Phil.&nbsp; 523,&nbsp; a case of <i>estafa</i>, the&nbsp; defendant, represented&nbsp; by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the information.&nbsp; He&nbsp; afterwards asked permission of the court to&nbsp; withdraw the&nbsp; plea and demur to the complaint. The denial thereof was assigned as error by the defendant on his appeal from the judgment&nbsp; of conviction. <br><br>"Held: In this ruling the court committed no error. The defendant has a right to demur to a complaint before he pleads thereto, but he has no right after&nbsp; he has pleaded not guilty to&nbsp; withdraw that pica&nbsp; and&nbsp; present&nbsp; a&nbsp; demurrer.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; within the discretion of the court below to grant or deny him permission to do so." <br><br>The information in&nbsp; the case at bar&nbsp; appears to be on its face&nbsp; a sufficient&nbsp; information,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; U. S, vs. Baluyot, 40 Phil. 385, permission&nbsp; to withdraw&nbsp; the plea of not guilty in order to interpose a&nbsp; demurrer to the&nbsp; information in a prosecution for murder was properly denied where the information appeared to be sufficient.&nbsp; In that case&nbsp; this Court reiterated its ruling that the withdrawal of a plea of not guilty in order to demur became a matter of judicial discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no showing&nbsp; that the respondent&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; his&nbsp; discretion in not allowing the petitioner&nbsp; to withdraw his former plea&nbsp; of not guilty. <br><br>Coming now to the main question at issue, We may say the following:&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 67&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of Court prescribes: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. <i>Petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari</i>.—When&nbsp; any&nbsp; tribunal,&nbsp; board, or&nbsp; officer&nbsp; exercising judicial&nbsp; functions,&nbsp; has acted&nbsp; without&nbsp; or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion and <i>there is no appeal, nor&nbsp; my plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law</i>, a person aggrieved thereby may file a&nbsp; verified petition in the&nbsp; proper court alleging the facts "with certainty and praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board, or officer, as the law&nbsp; requires, with costs."</blockquote>In People&nbsp; vs. Manuel, G.&nbsp; Pv.&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; L-6794 and&nbsp; L-6795, promulgated&nbsp; on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 11, 1954, the&nbsp; accused was&nbsp; charged under two separate&nbsp; informations, one for illegal possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; firearms&nbsp; and&nbsp; another&nbsp; for&nbsp; frustrated&nbsp;&nbsp; murder.<br><br>Subscribed before the District Judge, both informations certified that the corresponding&nbsp; preliminary investigation and examination of witnesses had been&nbsp; conducted.&nbsp; Accused submitted a motion to quash in both&nbsp; cases contending that the Fiscal had no authority to&nbsp; formulate the charges nor to conduct&nbsp; preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Upon denial&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; quash accused appealed: <br><blockquote>"Held: Under section 1&nbsp; (Rule 118), in order that a judgment may be appealed from, it is necessary that it be final in the sense that&nbsp; it completely disposes of&nbsp; the cause,&nbsp; so that no further questions affecting the merits remain&nbsp; for adjudication.&nbsp; An&nbsp; order overruling a motion to dismiss presented by the defendant against the information does not dispose of the cause upon its merits and is thus merely interlocutory and not a final order within the meaning&nbsp; of the above section."&nbsp; (Moran's&nbsp; Comments&nbsp; on the Rules&nbsp; of Court—1952 Ed., Vol. 2 p. 880, citing Fuster vs.&nbsp; Johnson, 1 Phil.&nbsp; 670). </blockquote>In line with the above view, the Rules specifically direct that if&nbsp; the defendant moves to quash before pleading, and the motion is&nbsp; overruled,&nbsp;&nbsp; "he&nbsp; shall&nbsp; immediately&nbsp; plead" (section 1, Rule 113); <i>which means,&nbsp; obviously, that trial should&nbsp; go&nbsp; on</i>.&nbsp; As stated in Collins vs. Wolfe, 4 Phil. 534, the appellant Domingo Manuel, after the denial of his motion, "should have proceeded with the trial of the causes in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below, and&nbsp; if final&nbsp; judgment is&nbsp; rendered against him,&nbsp; he&nbsp; can then&nbsp; appeal, and&nbsp; upon such appeal present the question which he&nbsp; is now&nbsp; seeking to&nbsp; have decided."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Padilla's Criminal Procedure, 1955 ed., p. 396). <br><br>In People vs. Aragon* G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5930,&nbsp; February 17, 1954, the Supreme Court, among others, said: "There is no reason&nbsp; for dismissing the&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; The order&nbsp; appealed from is one&nbsp; denying a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss and&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a final judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; not&nbsp; appealable.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rule 118, sections 1 and 2)." <br><br>Although in the light of the foregoing decisions an order denying a motion to quash is not appealable because the order is merely interlocutory, yet, that does not mean that the final judgment that may be rendered in the case could not be appealed, and that is why in the case of Arches vs. <br><br>Beldia, et al.,&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R. No. L-2414, promulgated on May&nbsp; 27, 1949, this Court held "that neither certiorari nor prohibition lie against an order of the court granting or denying a motion to&nbsp; quash&nbsp; an information.&nbsp; If the courts&nbsp; have jurisdiction to take cognizance of the cases and to decide the motion to quash, <i>appeal in due time is the obvious and only remedy</i> for the public prosecutor or the accused,&nbsp; as the case may be."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See the case of Fernando E.&nbsp; Ricafort, petitioner, vs.&nbsp; Hon. Wenceslao&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Fenian,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; et al., <i>supra</i>, p.-&nbsp; 575). <br><br>In view of the foregoing, we&nbsp; hold that&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; at bar the writs of certiorari and prohibition applied for&nbsp; do not lie, for the order objected to&nbsp; is only interlocutory, and petitioner can&nbsp; in due time&nbsp; appeal from the final judgment that the Court of First Instance of Rizal may render&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; if it were adverse to&nbsp; him. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; this case is dismissed and the writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction issued herein is set aside and left without force&nbsp; and&nbsp; effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; With costs against petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Actg.&nbsp; C.
