				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Negros&nbsp; Occidental, Hon.&nbsp; Jose Teodoro,&nbsp; Sr., presiding, dismissing plaintiff's complaint on&nbsp; the grounds specified in a motion presented by defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main grounds are that the cause of action&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in the complaint is barred&nbsp;&nbsp; by a&nbsp; prior&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; and&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp; statute&nbsp; of limitations.<br><br>The present&nbsp; case is an offshoot of&nbsp; G. R. No.&nbsp; L-6158<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> (March 11, 1954), entitled&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; Portland Cement Company <i>vs.</i> The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) and Philippine Land Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU), decided by this Court, affirming a decision of the Court of Industrial relations holding that the separation of plaintiff herein, Felix V. Valencia, from his position as general superintendent in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; Portland&nbsp; Cement Company,&nbsp; Cebu, was unjustifiable because no valid reasons existed for said removal.&nbsp; The decision of the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations, affirmed by this&nbsp; Court, ordered that Felix V. Valencia be reinstated&nbsp; from May 1, 1949 to&nbsp; November 16, 1950, with all the privileges and emoluments attached to said petition.<br><br>The present complaint was filed on&nbsp; June 22, 1956, and alleges that plaintiff's separation from the Cebu Portland Cement Company on&nbsp; June 16,&nbsp; 1950, was caused&nbsp; by the concerted individual acts of the defendants, which are unreasonable, unjust and illegal.&nbsp; It further alleges that in procuring plaintiff's dismissal through&nbsp; malicious, illegal, unjust,&nbsp; oppressive and high-handed acts, plaintiff and his family have been terribly humiliated and have suffered an irreparable injury to their good name, reputation, honor, social dealings and prestige.&nbsp; So it is prayed that actual or&nbsp; compensatory damages, exemplary damages, nominal or temperate damages, attorney's fees and contingent fees, all&nbsp; amounting to P299,509.00, be&nbsp; granted&nbsp; plaintiff- appellant.<br><br>Plaintiff-appellant claims that the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations case presented by&nbsp; him&nbsp; against the defendant Cebu&nbsp; Portland Cement Company is not a bar to the present action because the said court has no jurisdiction over his present claim.&nbsp; We find this&nbsp; contention to be without merit.&nbsp; The removal of plaintiff from&nbsp; his position as general superintendent, which removal was held by the Court of Industrial Relations and by us to be illegal, up to November 16,&nbsp; 1950, is the cause or reason for the present action for nominal, exemplary&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; As claimed by defendant-appellees in the lower&nbsp; court,&nbsp; a party to an action cannot split his cause of&nbsp; action into many causes.&nbsp; (Rule 2, section 3.)&nbsp; When, therefore, the plaintiff-appellant filed his action for reinstatement, he should have included in said action the supposed damages that he now claims in his complaint in this case.&nbsp; It is well settled that a party, after presenting an action, cannot by a subsequent proceeding or suit recover other damages or remedies to which he was entitled in the former action, which is, in this case, the alleged unlawful dismissal of the plaintiff.<br><br>The action is also barred by the statute of limitations.<br><br>The cause of action&nbsp; arose upon plaintiff's separation from the service on November 16, 1950.&nbsp; When he filed&nbsp; the action on June 22, 1956, more than the four years prescribed by&nbsp; Article 1146 the Civil Code has already elapsed.<br><br>The present action is one for injury to the rights&nbsp; of the plaintiff.&nbsp; It is not, as claimed by plaintiff-appellant, an action based on a former judgment.&nbsp; A previous judgment declared his separation from May 31, 1949 to November 16, 1950, illegal, and consequently, the court ordered payment of his services for that period of time.&nbsp; If he claims any injury caused to him by the supposed illegal acts of the defendants by his&nbsp; separation on November 16, 1950, he should have filed his action within four years from that date.&nbsp; Hence, we are constrained to hold that the action which he now institutes is barred by the provisions of said Article 1146 of the Civil Code.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against plaintiff-appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ., </i>concur. <br><i>Gutierrez David, J., </i> concurs&nbsp; in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> 94&nbsp; Phil., 509.<br></div>
