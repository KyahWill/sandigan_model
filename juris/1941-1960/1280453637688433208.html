</style><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed for and in behalf of 
Olimpio Landicho, who, according to the allegations in the petition, on 27 May 
1943 was convicted of the crime of "robbery in band with serious physical 
injuries and arson" and sentenced to suffer from 10 years and 1 day to 17 years, 
4 months and 1 day and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the offended party 
in the sum of P15,000 (Criminal Case No. 175).
<p>It is contended that the sentence imposed upon the prisoner during the enemy 
occupation is null and void, because the Court of First Instance of Batangas was 
not a competent Court under the laws of the Commonwealth and the Constitution of 
the Republic of the Philippines; that the penalty meted out to him is 
inconsistent with the present laws of the country after liberation; and that his 
confinement is illegal, arbitrary, and constitutes a flagrant violation of the 
Constitution of the Commonwealth and of the Republic of the Philippines, for he 
was sentenced without due process of law.</p>
<p>In the answer filed in behalf of the respondent, it is alleged that on 3 June 
1943, the prisoner was sentenced by a final valid judgment rendered by the Court 
of First Instance of Batangas for the crime of robbery in band with frustrated 
homicide, physical injuries, and arson, to suffer from 10 years and 1 day of 
<i>prision mayor</i> to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of <i>reclusion 
temporal</i>, with the accesories of the law, to indemnify, jointly and 
severally, the offended party in the sum of P15,000, and to pay 1/19 of the 
costs; that pursuant thereto, the Court of First Instance of Batangas issued an 
order committing the person in whose behalf the petition is filed to the custody 
of the Director of Prisons; that on 6 June 1943, such person was actually 
committed to the custody of and received by the Director of Prisons; and that as 
the prisoner's confinement is by virtue of a valid sentence rendered by a 
competent Court which convicted him of an offense not political in nature, the 
writ prayed for does not lie.</p>
<p>According to a copy of the record of the prisoner attached to the answer, 
with good conduct allowance his minimum term will expire on 21 April 1951 and 
his maximum term will expire on 5 June 1956 (Annex 3). The penalty imposed upon 
him was for a crime not political in nature but one that would have been 
punished anytime, anywhere. And, lastly, it appearing in the judgment rendered 
by the Court of First Instance of Batangas on 3 June 1943 attached to the answer 
(Annex 1) that on 27 May 1943, the prisoner, assisted by his counsel, was 
arraigned, and that he pleaded guilty to the information, he cannot justly 
complain or be heard to say that he was sentenced without due process of 
law.</p>
<p>The petition is dismissed, without costs.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, 
Pablo, Bengzon, Hontiveros,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in this case by Cresencia 
Landicho, in behalf of prisoner Olimpio Landicho, prays for the latter's release 
from the custody of the Director of Prisons, upon the fact that said Olimpio 
Landicho is deprived of his liberty in virtue of a sentence, handed down on May 
27, 1943, during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.</p>
<p>There is no question that the sentence was rendered by one of the tribunals 
established by the invaders and not by one created and functioning under our 
laws and Constitution, it appearing that, according to respondent's answer, the 
decision was rendered by a judge of Batangas where the Commonwealth Government 
has completely ceased to function during the enemy occupation.</p>
<p>For the reasons we have already stated in our opinions in Co Kim Cham 
<i>vs</i>. Valdes, L-5, we do not recognize any validity in the judicial 
processes had under the authority of the Japanese during the occupation of the 
Philippines. Consistent with this theory we are of opinion that petitioner 
Olimpio Landicho is entitled to be immediately released from prison, and that 
said release be ordered by this Court.</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>I concur in this dissent.</div>
