				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Angat&nbsp; River&nbsp; Irrigation System is&nbsp; a Division or Section of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Public Works engaged in the maintenance and operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; irrigation systems in Bulacan&nbsp; and nearby provinces, the appropriation for which&nbsp; project is included in the yearly General Appropriations Act being passed by&nbsp; Congress.<br><br><i>Case G. R. No. L-10943</i>.—On January 5, 1956, the Acting Prosecutor&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial Relations filed, on behalf of the Angat&nbsp; River Irrigation System Workers' Union (PLUM), whose&nbsp; members were actually employed in&nbsp; said project, a complaint with said&nbsp; Court, docketed as Case No. 814-ULP,&nbsp; making the&nbsp; Angat&nbsp; River Irrigation System and its&nbsp; supervising engineer as party respondents. The complaint alleged, among other things,&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondents committed&nbsp; unfair labor practices by&nbsp; interfering with, restraining&nbsp; or coercing&nbsp; the employees&nbsp; in the exercise of the Iatter's&nbsp; right to&nbsp; self-organization;&nbsp; by practicing discrimination in the hiring or tenure&nbsp; of employment of said employees in order to&nbsp; discourage&nbsp; membership with the union, and&nbsp; by&nbsp; refusing to&nbsp; bargain collectively with the representatives of the employees.&nbsp; As basis for the charge, the complaint stated that on August 3,&nbsp; 1955, the union presented a statement of&nbsp; proposals to the employer&nbsp; consisting of 15 demands.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the latter failed to act on the same, the union president sent&nbsp; a&nbsp; letter to the supervising engineer&nbsp; and also saw him personally for the purpose of inquiring on the stand&nbsp; of the Angat River&nbsp; Irrigation System as regards their demands, but that official intimated that they will all be fired instead if they do not desist from their union activities because their organization was illegal; that a certain Feliciano Clements was demoted from the position of water master&nbsp; to that of a collector, and&nbsp; that on September 20,&nbsp; 1955, Ceferino Roque, Tomas Palileo and Abelardo&nbsp; Crisostomo, officers and active&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the union, were dismissed from the service.&nbsp; It was, therefore, prayed that respondents&nbsp; be ordered&nbsp; to refrain from further committing the unfair labor practice complained of;&nbsp; to reinstate&nbsp; Ceferino Roque, Tomas Palileo, Abelardo Crisostomo and Feliciano Clemente to&nbsp; their respective former positions with back wages from the time of their dismissal or transfer to the time of their&nbsp; actual reinstatement, and for such&nbsp; other relief as&nbsp; the court may deem just and&nbsp; equitable&nbsp; in the&nbsp; premises.<br><br><i>Case G. R. No. L—10944.</i>—It also appears on record that on January&nbsp; 9, 1956, the Angat River Workers'&nbsp; Union (PLUM)&nbsp; filed with&nbsp; the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations a petition for certification as the majority union (Case No. 813-MC)&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions of the Indus- trial&nbsp; Peace Act contending, among others, that it was a legitimate labor union&nbsp; duly permitted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Department of Labor to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; under Permit No. 1424-IP;&nbsp; that&nbsp; it consisted&nbsp; of at least 95% of the total number&nbsp; of ordinary employees in said project; and that&nbsp; there was an urgent need&nbsp; for&nbsp; said&nbsp; union&nbsp; to be immediately certified because the employer&nbsp; refused to bargain&nbsp; with the union and instead resorted&nbsp; to&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practices.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; thus prayed that after due&nbsp; notice&nbsp; or hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioning union be&nbsp; certified as&nbsp; the sole and exclusive collective&nbsp; bargaining representative of the&nbsp; employees of the unit.<br><br>When required by the Industrial Court to file its answer to the complaint, respondents opposed by filing&nbsp; a motion to dismiss arguing that&nbsp; the Angat River Irrigation System being an&nbsp; entity under the&nbsp; Bureau of Public Works,&nbsp; which is an instrumentality&nbsp; of the Government, cannot be drawn into that proceeding in virtue of the fundamental principle that the&nbsp; State&nbsp; cannot be sued by private persons without its consent.&nbsp; The Court of Industrial Relations,&nbsp; by order of June 29, 1956, deferred action&nbsp; on this motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss until after the presentation of evidence&nbsp; by the parties and&nbsp; directed&nbsp; therein&nbsp; respondents to&nbsp; file their answer in 5 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the motion filed by respondents to reconsider said&nbsp; order was denied by the Court on the alleged ground that&nbsp; the order was "interlocutory" in nature, the&nbsp; Angat River Irrigation System and its supervising engineer instituted this action for prohibition and in accordance with :&nbsp;&nbsp; their prayer,&nbsp; this Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Industrial Court from&nbsp; enforcing its order of June 29, 1956, in Case No. 814-ULP and from proceeding with the hearing of Case No. 313-MC, upon the filing by&nbsp; petitioners of a bond&nbsp; tor P200.00.<br><br>Asserting&nbsp; that the Angat River Irrigation&nbsp; System, as an agency of the Government&nbsp; is immune from suit, petitioners question&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations to entertain the complaint for unfair labor practice and the petition for certification election filed by the Angat River Irrigation System Workers' Union&nbsp; (PLUM) and to require&nbsp; them to appear before said Court to answer the same.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; controversy that the Angat River Irrigation&nbsp; System is a Section&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Division of Irrigation of the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Public Works falling under the direct supervision of the President through the Pepartment of Public&nbsp; Works and&nbsp; Communications,&nbsp; created pursuant to Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2152, known as the Irrigation Act approved on February 6,&nbsp; 1912,&nbsp; the&nbsp; expenditures&nbsp; of which are taken care&nbsp; of&nbsp; by the National Government.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appropriation Act&nbsp; No. 1600&nbsp; (Appropriations Act&nbsp; for&nbsp; the fiscal year for the said&nbsp; project appears on p. 626-627&nbsp; of Republic 1956-1957) under the Special Fund covering the National Irrigation System and on p.&nbsp; 625 of the 1957-1958 Budget, Republic Act No. 1800,&nbsp; an itemized appropriation for the salaries and wages of positions in said system, in the same manner as the itemized appropriations for the payment of salaries and wages of officials and employees&nbsp; of the Bureau of Public Works.&nbsp; Consequently, it&nbsp; being an instrumentality of the Government, the employees working thereunder and receiving compensation from the amount appropriated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Legislature for&nbsp; its operation are&nbsp; government employees.<br><br>Therefore, the issues presented before Us in these cases are;&nbsp; (1) whether government employees may validly organize&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; into&nbsp; a union&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative, whether it may demand&nbsp; that the Government enter&nbsp; into collective bargaining agreements with said union; and (2) whether the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations acquired jurisdiction over the person of defendants in Cases Nos. 814- ULP and 313-MC of that Court.<br><br>I. Section 11 of the Industrial Peace Act (Rep. Act No. 875)&nbsp; provides the following:<br><blockquote>SEC.&nbsp; 11. PROHIBITION AGAINST STRIKES IN THE GOVERNMENT.—The terms and conditions of employment in the Government, including any political subdivision&nbsp; or&nbsp; instrumentality thereof,&nbsp; area governed by law and it is declared to be the policy of this Act that employees therein&nbsp; shall not strike&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of securing&nbsp; changes or modification in&nbsp; their&nbsp; terms&nbsp; and&nbsp; conditions of employment.&nbsp; Such employees may&nbsp; belong to any labor organization&nbsp; which, doss not impose the obligation to strike or to join in strike: <i>Provided,&nbsp; however</i>, That this&nbsp; Section shall apply only to employees employed in governmental functions and&nbsp; not to those employed in&nbsp; proprietary functions of the Government including but not limited to&nbsp; government corporations.</blockquote>It is apparent from the foregoing provision that the law does&nbsp; not intend to curtail absolutely the right of government&nbsp; employees to self-organization or be affiliated with any labor organization, subject only to the limitation&nbsp; that such organisation does not impose the obligation to strike or&nbsp; to join in strike if said employees are&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; governmental functions.<br><br>The employees involved in these cases are employed in the aforementioned&nbsp; Division&nbsp; of Irrigation,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was created in virtue of Act 2152 (The Irrigation&nbsp; Act)&nbsp; providing for the establishment of a council that would appropriate&nbsp; our public waters; that would determine all existing rights&nbsp; in connection thereto; that would construct, maintain and operate irrigation systems for the Government.&nbsp; This undertaking of&nbsp; regulating the&nbsp; use and&nbsp; appropriation&nbsp; of our&nbsp; public waters by the&nbsp; Government, in&nbsp; turn,&nbsp; arose out of the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; of the State to supervise the&nbsp; disposition and use&nbsp; of&nbsp; our&nbsp; natural resources and&nbsp; the correlated exhortation by the&nbsp; Constitution as regards&nbsp; its conservation and utilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; applying&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Section 11 of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875, We have to draw the distinction between&nbsp; <i>governmental</i>&nbsp; from&nbsp; <i>proprietary</i>&nbsp; functions of the Government and in this&nbsp; connection We&nbsp; deem it proper to cite the&nbsp; following authorities&nbsp; that&nbsp; are enlightening on&nbsp; the point:<br><blockquote>As ordinarily&nbsp; constituted, municipal corporations&nbsp; (and&nbsp; this may be said&nbsp; of&nbsp; the National Government) have dual character, the one governmental, legislative, or public; the other, proprietary or private. In their public capacity <i>a responsibility exists in the performance of acts&nbsp; for the public&nbsp; benefit, and in, this respect their are "merely a part of the, machinery of government of,&nbsp; the sovereignty creating them, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority of the stats is supreme</i>.&nbsp; But in their PROPRIETARY or private&nbsp; character their powers&nbsp; arc supposed to be conferred not from, considerations of state, but for the <i>private advantage of the particular corporation as a distinct legal personality</i> (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 3rd Revision, Vol. II, 2270).<br><br>In its governmental or public character,&nbsp; the corporation is made, by the state, one of its instruments, or the local depository of certain limited and prescribed political powers, to be exercised for the public good in&nbsp; behalf of the state rather than for itself.&nbsp; But in its proprietary&nbsp; or private&nbsp; character,&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; is that&nbsp; the&nbsp; powers are supposed not to be&nbsp; conferred primarily or chiefly from considerations connected with the government of the&nbsp; state at&nbsp; large, but for the private&nbsp; advantage&nbsp; of the compact community which&nbsp; is incorporated as a distinct legal personality or&nbsp; corporate individual;&nbsp; and as to such powers, and&nbsp; to property&nbsp; acquired and contracts made&nbsp; there- under, the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; is frequently&nbsp; regarded&nbsp; as&nbsp; having the&nbsp; rights find&nbsp; obligations of&nbsp; a private rather than those of a public,&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; (Trenton vs.&nbsp; New Jersey, 262&nbsp; US&nbsp; 182, 67 L ed 937,&nbsp; 29 ALE, 1471).<br><br>The governmental&nbsp; functions of a&nbsp; municipal corporation are those conferred or imposed upon&nbsp; it as a&nbsp; local agency, to be exercised not only in&nbsp; the interest of&nbsp; its inhabitants, but&nbsp; also in the advancement of the&nbsp; public good&nbsp; or&nbsp; welfare as&nbsp; affecting&nbsp; the public&nbsp; generally (37&nbsp; Am. Jur.&nbsp; 727)'.<br><br>The distinction between acts in the performance of a governmental function and those in the performance of a corporate or proprietary function is that in the case of the former, the municipal corporation is executing the legislative mandate with respect to a public duty generally, while in the other, it is exercising its private rights as a corporate body&nbsp; (Loeb vs. Jacksonville, 101 Fla. -129,&nbsp; 69 ALR 459).</blockquote>In the light&nbsp; of the authorities&nbsp; aforecited, the&nbsp; Angat River Irrigation&nbsp; System unmistakably&nbsp; exercises governmental functions,&nbsp; not only because it falls under the direct supervision of the President&nbsp; of the Philippines, through the Department of&nbsp; Public Works&nbsp; in&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 87 giving&nbsp; the President&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to administer the irrigation systems constructed by the Government pursuant to Act 2152,&nbsp; as amended, but also because the nature of the duties&nbsp; imposed on said agency and performed by it does not reveal that it was intended to bring to the Government any special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Irrigation Act (No. 2152), as amended, does&nbsp; not create or establish&nbsp; irrigation systems for the private&nbsp; advantage&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Government, but primarily and chiefly for considerations connected with&nbsp; the general welfare of the people; and&nbsp; in so far as the determination of claims for the appropriation of public waters is concerned, the Irrigation&nbsp; Act&nbsp; places the Director&nbsp; of Public Works on equal footing with the&nbsp; Director of Lands with&nbsp; respect to applications for the appropriation of disposable public lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the employees working therein do not fall within the exception of Section 11&nbsp; of the Industrial Peace&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; But&nbsp; even conceding, for&nbsp; the sake&nbsp; of argument only,&nbsp; that&nbsp; government employees, like petitioner's employees, are not prohibited by&nbsp; law to associate&nbsp; themselves and form part of a labor union, may said organization demand that&nbsp; the Government negotiate and enter&nbsp; into agreement with the&nbsp; union in connection with the wages, hours&nbsp; of work and other conditions of employment of its members which are proper&nbsp; subjects of collective&nbsp; bargaining?<br><br>Collective bargaining has been denned as:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; looking toward&nbsp; making of collective&nbsp; agreements between&nbsp; employer and accredited representatives of employees concerning' wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, and requires that parties deal with each other with open and fair minds and sincerely endeavor to overcome obstacles existing between them to the end that employment relations may be stabilized and obstruction&nbsp; to free&nbsp; flow of commerce prevented"&nbsp; (Rapid Roller Co. vs. National Labor Relations Board, CCA. 7, 126 P. 2d 452);<br><br>"The term 'collective bargaining'&nbsp; denotes, in common&nbsp; usage as well as in legal terminology, negotiations looking toward a collective agreement"&nbsp; (Pampanga Bus Co. vs.&nbsp; Pambusco Employees' Union, 68 Phil. 611), and the Industrial Peace Act, giving&nbsp; a&nbsp; more comprehensive definition, states that it is "the meeting and conferring promptly and expeditiously and in good faith, tot&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; of negotiating&nbsp; an agreement with respect to wages, hours, and/or other terms and conditions of employment, and of&nbsp; executing a written&nbsp; contract&nbsp; incorporating such agreement if requested by either party, or for the purpose of adjusting any&nbsp; grievances or question arising under such agreement"&nbsp; (Sec. 13, Rep. Act No. 875).</blockquote>Collective bargaining,&nbsp; which the&nbsp; Industrial Peace Act aims to utilize as one of the means of insuring harmonious labor-management relationship is imposed as an obligation not only on the employees but also on the employer (Sec. 13, Rep. Act No.&nbsp; 875; Isaac Peral Bowling Alley vs. United Employees Welfare&nbsp; Association et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> G. E. No. L-9831, Oct.&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1957),&nbsp; in the expectation that with this method or device, the employer and the labor organization designated&nbsp; or&nbsp; selected by the majority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; to represent them, may freely discuss&nbsp; and enter into agreement on matters relative to rates&nbsp; of pay,&nbsp; wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment of the workers.<br><br>It is not controverted that respondent Union has&nbsp; been permitted by the Bureau of Labor to operate and that the members of the&nbsp; Union constitute the&nbsp; majority of the employees of the Angat River Irrigation System.&nbsp; Hence, had the present cases' involved ordinary&nbsp; industrial employees, there would be no doubt that the respondent Union could lawfully claim the rights allowed by law to a labor organization and&nbsp; properly represent its members in collective bargaining contracts with the employer.<br><br>An "employer" is defined&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>An employer is one who employs the services&nbsp; of others; one for whom employees work and who pays their wages or&nbsp; salaries (Black's Law&nbsp; Dictionary, 4th ed., p.&nbsp; 618).<br><br>A n employer includes any person acting in the interest of&nbsp; an employer, directly or indirectly (Sec. 2-c,&nbsp; Rep. Act 875). </blockquote> In the United&nbsp; States, parallel legislation&nbsp; excludes from said definition "the United States or&nbsp; any State or political subdivisions thereof&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> Levine vs. Farley, 107 F.&nbsp; 2d 186;&nbsp; 184 L,. Ed. 519—1940),&nbsp; but our law&nbsp; contains no specific provision exempting the Government from the ordinary&nbsp; acceptation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; word "employer".&nbsp; Notwithstanding this omission, We believe&nbsp; that if&nbsp; it were the intent of the law to relegate the&nbsp; Government to&nbsp; the&nbsp; position of an ordinary employer and equally impose on the same the duty to enter into collective&nbsp; bargaining agreements with its employees, there&nbsp; would be&nbsp; no reason for the&nbsp; statement in Section&nbsp; 13 of the&nbsp; Industrial Peace Act to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that "the&nbsp; terms and conditions&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment in the Government,&nbsp; including&nbsp; any political&nbsp; subdivision or instrumentality thereof,&nbsp; are governed by law", instead of leaving them to be the subject of proper bargaining contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, in making this declaration and the pronouncement&nbsp; that it would be the policy of said Act to prohibit&nbsp; strikes against the&nbsp; Government for the purpose of securing changes or modifications in their terms and conditions of employment, Republic Act No. 875 exempts the&nbsp; Government from the operation of its provision on&nbsp; collective bargaining because conditions of employment in&nbsp; the&nbsp; government&nbsp; service&nbsp; can no longer be&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject of agreements of contracts&nbsp; between&nbsp; the employer and the employed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is noteworthy to remember that&nbsp; these matters are fixed, not by any private person, but by Congress, and that appointments and promotions in the government&nbsp; service are&nbsp; determined by&nbsp; merit&nbsp; and&nbsp; fitness, subject to the regulations issued and adopted by the Bureau&nbsp; of Civil&nbsp; Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, appropriations for the operation of the entire machinery of the Government are prepared and disbursed not out of motive to profit or gain, as in&nbsp; an industrial or business concern, but in the furtherance&nbsp; of the policies of government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it is&nbsp; clear to our mind that in view&nbsp; of the special&nbsp; characteristic of an employment&nbsp; with the government,&nbsp; there is&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; unreasonable in the mandate of the law limiting the activities of a&nbsp; union of its employees&nbsp; and depriving the same of some&nbsp; rights allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; an ordinary labor organization. <br><br>II. Although none&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties has&nbsp; raised&nbsp; the question that the petitioners in the above entitled cases are not the real parties in interest.&nbsp; We deem it proper to say&nbsp; a few words&nbsp; on this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines vs. Cesareo de Leon et al., 101 Phil., 773,&nbsp; 54 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [3]&nbsp; 663, We held that:<br><br>In contemplation of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Act (and in the same thing may be said of the Industrial Peace Act—R.A.&nbsp; 875),&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau of Public Works cannot&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; the <i>employer</i> of those working- thereunder, for it is merely a part of the machinery of&nbsp; the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Commission has no&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; adjudge&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Bureau liable and to require it&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the claim of a laborer who had ren- dered&nbsp; services in said Bureau without notifying the Government of&nbsp; said&nbsp; claim&nbsp; through&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General, because the case, which necessarily involves a liability to the national funds, is an action against&nbsp; the Government and, therefore, the latter&nbsp; is an indispensable party to&nbsp; the case.<br><br>Paraphrasing&nbsp; what is&nbsp; said in the foregoing doctrine, We can&nbsp; state&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the cases at bar the petitioner Angat River&nbsp; Irrigation System (respondent in the lower Court), as&nbsp; an entity&nbsp; under the Bureau of Public Works,&nbsp; has&nbsp; no personality to sue or be sued.&nbsp; And this is also true with regard to&nbsp; the Bureau of Public Works which is merely a part of the machinery of the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; In lieu of said entity and Bureau&nbsp; it is&nbsp; the Republic of the Philippines, if at all, that should have been sued,&nbsp; because these cases affect&nbsp; the&nbsp; policy of&nbsp; the Government towards its&nbsp; employees as&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; in Section&nbsp; 11 of the Industrial Peace Act. Consequently,&nbsp; the action of the respondent Union should have been directed&nbsp; against&nbsp; the State.<br><br>On the other hand,&nbsp; it is a basic and fundamental principle of the law that the&nbsp; Government cannot be sued before courts of justice without its consent, a principle that springs from&nbsp; the theory&nbsp; that there can be&nbsp; no legal right against the authority&nbsp; that makes the&nbsp; law on which that right depends&nbsp; (Kawananakao vs. Polybank, 205 U.S. 349, 51&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Ed. 834).&nbsp; Just like&nbsp; any other privilege or right, this immunity may be waived and the&nbsp; Government can&nbsp; be brought in as&nbsp; a party defendant only in those cases wherein it expressly consents to be sued, as in the case of moneyed claim&nbsp; arising&nbsp; from&nbsp; contract which could be the basis&nbsp; of civil action between private parties (Sec. 1, Act 3083).<br><br>There can be no&nbsp; argument on the&nbsp; point that&nbsp; although not the Government itself, this privilege&nbsp; of non-suability of the Government extends to the Angat River Irrigation System,&nbsp; it&nbsp; being&nbsp; an entity of&nbsp; the former.&nbsp; And this&nbsp; is logical, because any suit, action or proceeding against an agency of the government&nbsp; would in practice be a&nbsp; suit, action or&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; against&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; of "which&nbsp; said agency is a mere office (METROPOLITAN&nbsp; TRANSPORTATION SERVICE (METRAN) vs.&nbsp; Paredes et al.,&nbsp; 79 Phil. 819; 45 Oft. Gaz., No. 7, p. 2835. The rationale for this principle of government immunity from suit is laid down in the same case of&nbsp; METRAN vs. Paredes, <i>supra</i>, when this Court&nbsp; fittingly said:<br><blockquote>"In a republican state, like the Philippines, government immunity from suit without its consent is derived from the will of the people, themselves&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; freely&nbsp; creating"&nbsp; a&nbsp; government&nbsp; of&nbsp; tile&nbsp;&nbsp; people, by&nbsp; the&nbsp; people,&nbsp; and for the people—a&nbsp; representative&nbsp; government through which they have agreed to&nbsp; exercise the powers and&nbsp; discharge tho duties of their&nbsp; sovereignty for the common good&nbsp; and general welfare.&nbsp; In so agreeing, the citizens have solemnly undertaken to surrender&nbsp; some of their private rights and interests which were calculated to conflict with the higher rights and larger interests of the&nbsp; people as a whole, represented&nbsp; by the government thus established&nbsp; by them all.&nbsp; One of those 'higher rights',&nbsp; based upon those 'larger&nbsp; interests' is that government immunity.&nbsp; The members of the respondent Labor Union themselves are part of the people&nbsp; who have freely formed that government and participated in that solemn undertaking.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; sense—and a very real one it&nbsp; is—they&nbsp; are. in effect attempting to <i>sue themselves</i> along- with the rest of the people&nbsp; represented by their common government—an anomalous&nbsp; and absurd situation indeed."</blockquote>As&nbsp; only natural or juridical persons may&nbsp; be parties in an action (See. 1, Rule 3, Rules&nbsp; oi Court)&nbsp; and as the Angat River Irrigation System, as an agency of the Government,&nbsp; cannot be sued without its consent&nbsp; much less over its objection, it is obvious that the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; did not&nbsp; acquire jurisdiction&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons of herein petitioners&nbsp; and&nbsp; thus devoid of any power to take cognizance&nbsp; of the cases at&nbsp; bar.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; requiring petitioners in&nbsp; both cases to answer the&nbsp; petition and to enter trial in cases Nos. 313-MC and 814-ULP of the respondent Court, is hereby set aside&nbsp; and&nbsp; said cases are dismissed. The&nbsp; preliminary injunction&nbsp; issued is hereby&nbsp; made&nbsp; permanent.&nbsp; Without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is. so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C J., Bengzon, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">* </sup>Supra, P. 219<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCEPCION, J</span>.: <br><br>These two&nbsp; (2) cases&nbsp; are&nbsp; interrelated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Case G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-10943 involves&nbsp; a&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; against the&nbsp; Angat&nbsp; River Irrigation&nbsp; System and&nbsp; its&nbsp; Supervising Project Engineer,<br><br>Vicente R. Cruz, for alleged unfair labor practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was filed with the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations, on or about January 5, 1956, by an acting prosecutor of said Court, on behalf of the Angat&nbsp; River&nbsp; Workers' Union&nbsp; (PLUM),&nbsp; a legitimate&nbsp; labor organization,&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of which are employees of said System.&nbsp; Said complaint was docketed as Case No. 814-ULP of said Court.&nbsp; Case G. R. No. L-10944 refers to' a petition filed, by the same labor&nbsp; organization, with said Court, on January 9, 1956, and docketed therein as Case No. 313-MC, for certification of said union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees in the aforementioned System.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; being required&nbsp; to answer&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint in the first case, the respondents therein filed a motion to dismiss upon the ground of lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction, because the Angat River Irrigation System is allegedly "an entity under the Bureau of Public Works, Department of Public Works and Communications," and the State cannot be sued without its consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The System, likewise,&nbsp; opposed the&nbsp; certification prayed&nbsp; for&nbsp; in the second&nbsp; case, for the same reason.&nbsp; In both cases, the system filed manifestations containing arguments in support of the&nbsp; motion to dismiss and the opposition to the petition for certification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, thereafter, by an&nbsp; order dated June 29, 1956,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations deferred the resolution of the&nbsp; motion to dismiss "until presentation of evidence of the parties" and directed "the respondent to file its answer in the two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; cases" within five&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; days&nbsp; from notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reconsideration of this order having&nbsp; been denied, the System and its supervising project engineer instituted&nbsp; the present special&nbsp; civil actions for prohibition, against the said labor organization and the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; Upon the filing of the requisite bond, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Court of Industrial Relations from requiring petitioners herein to answer the complaint and to enter trial in said cases,&nbsp; until further orders from&nbsp; this Court.<br><br>Section 2 of Rule 67, of the Rules of Court reads:<br><blockquote>"When the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; of&nbsp; any tribunal, corporation,&nbsp; board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or ministerial, are "without or&nbsp; in excess of its or&nbsp; his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion,&nbsp; and there is no appeal or&nbsp; any other plain,&nbsp; speedy,&nbsp; and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,&nbsp; a&nbsp; person&nbsp; aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in&nbsp; the proper court&nbsp; alleging' the facts&nbsp; with certainty and praying&nbsp;&nbsp; that judgment&nbsp; be rendered commanding the&nbsp; defendant to desist&nbsp; from further proceedings in the action&nbsp; or matter specified therein, with costs."</blockquote>Has the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; acted without or in excess of&nbsp; its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of&nbsp; discretion,&nbsp; in deferring the resolution&nbsp; of the motion&nbsp; to dismiss of&nbsp; petitioners herein,&nbsp; until&nbsp; after the presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; in the cases&nbsp; under&nbsp; consideration?&nbsp;&nbsp; To my mind, the answer should be in the negative,&nbsp; for the order complained of is specifically authorized&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Rules of Court Referring to&nbsp; motions to dismiss,&nbsp; section 3, Rule 8, of said Rules, provides:<br><blockquote>"After hearing the court may deny or&nbsp; grant the motion or allow amendment of pleading, or may defer&nbsp; the hearing and determination of the&nbsp; motion until the trial if the ground alleged therein does not appear to&nbsp;&nbsp; be indubitable."</blockquote>In fact, the ground upon which petitioners' motion to&nbsp; dismiss relies is not indubitable.&nbsp; The very lack of unanimity among the members of this Court, on the issue thus&nbsp; raised, is the best proof thereof.&nbsp; Besides, the status of the Angat River Irrigation System is not clear from the record before us.&nbsp; Petitioners allege&nbsp; that the System is&nbsp; "an entity <i>under</i> the Bureau of Public Works, Department of Public&nbsp; Works and Communications."&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not claimed that the System is a division or section of said Bureau&nbsp; or Department, or otherwise forms <i>part</i> of either.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; very term "entity" used to describe the System, denotes an "individuality" or "unit," which is complete in itself and hence&nbsp; capable of standing&nbsp; <i>alone</i>.<br><br>What is more, the allegation to the effect that the System is "under" the Bureau of Public Works tends to show that the former is not part of the latter.&nbsp; The divisions or sections of said Bureau are&nbsp; constituent portions&nbsp; thereof, but not under the same, for one cannot be either over or under itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; All private educational&nbsp; institutions&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines are subject to&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of, and, therefore, under, the Department of Instruction, and yet said institutions are not part either of said&nbsp; Department&nbsp; of the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, too,&nbsp; all&nbsp; government&nbsp; owned and&nbsp; controlled corporations are&nbsp; subject to, and, consequently, <i>under</i> the authority of the Auditor General, and yet such corporations are not part of the Government, in&nbsp; a&nbsp; political&nbsp; sense.<br><br>Again,&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 2152 authorizes the&nbsp; majority of all the appropriators of any&nbsp; Irrigation System to organize themselves&nbsp; into association for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; maintaining and&nbsp; operating&nbsp; said&nbsp; System,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; incorporate&nbsp; said association under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp;&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; these circumstances, I am not prepared to&nbsp; say&nbsp; that the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relation had exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion in issuing&nbsp; the order complained&nbsp; of,&nbsp; or that the Government is the real party in interest in&nbsp; these cases, not petitioners herein, or that the Angat River Irrigation System has no judicial personality of its own.&nbsp; Indeed, <i>how could it have filed the&nbsp; present actions for prohibition if it did not have&nbsp; such 'personality</i>?<br><br>Independently of the foregoing, section 11 of Republic Act No. 875, provides:<br><blockquote>"The terms and&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; employment&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government, including- any political subdivision or instrumentality thereof, are governed by law and it is declared to be the policy of&nbsp; this Act that employees&nbsp; therein&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not strike&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; securing changes or modification in their terms and conditions of employment. Such employees may belong to any labor organization which does not impose&nbsp; the obligation to&nbsp; strike&nbsp; or to join&nbsp; in&nbsp; strike; <i>Provided, however</i>, That this section shall apply only&nbsp; to employees employed in governmental functions and not to those employed in proprietary functions of the Government including hut not limited&nbsp; to govern- mental corporations."</blockquote>Are the members of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Union "employed&nbsp; in governmental functions" or&nbsp; "in&nbsp; proprietary functions&nbsp; of the Government?"&nbsp; It cannot be denied, and it would seem to be conceded, that if the Angat River Irrigation System were engaged in proprietary functions of the Government, the Court of Industrial Relations would have, under section 11, jurisdiction over the&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; of the cases under consideration.<br><br>In this&nbsp; connection, it appears that Act No. 2152 governs the appropriation of the "public waters" of the Philippines. Pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; section 1 of Article XIII of the Constitution, such waters&nbsp; "<i>belong</i> to&nbsp; the&nbsp; State."&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, the title of the State to said waters is that of <i>owner</i> thereof. As such, the authority of the State to dispose of said waters and to regulate the&nbsp; appropriation thereof&nbsp; springs, <i>not</i> from its sovereignty, but from its <i>dominical</i> rights.&nbsp; Consequently, the System established to&nbsp; administer said waters and attend to its distribution is engaged, not in political&nbsp; or governmental functions,&nbsp; but in purely "proprietary&nbsp; furictions."&nbsp; Thus, the overwhelming&nbsp; weight of authority is&nbsp; to the effect "that insofar as a city undertakes to sell water for private consumption it is engaged in a <i>commercial</i> venture, as to which, <i>it functions as any other business corporation</i>, and&nbsp; for negligence in connection therewith is&nbsp; liable as a private corporation&nbsp; would be in&nbsp; performing"&nbsp; a similar service"&nbsp; (The Law of&nbsp; Municipal Corporations, McQuillin, 3rd ed., Vol.&nbsp; 18, pp. 423-424).<br><blockquote>"In undertaking&nbsp; to supply water at&nbsp; price, municipality&nbsp; is&nbsp; <i>not performing governmental functions</i> but is engaged in trade, and is liable just as private, company would be for any negligence in&nbsp; laying out of its pipes, In&nbsp; keeping them&nbsp; in repair, or in furnishing potable water through&nbsp; them. Harvard Furniture Co.,&nbsp; Inc. vu. City of Cambridge, 320 Mass. 227,&nbsp; 68 N.K (2d) 684.<br><br>"Municipality in&nbsp; contracting to provide water supply&nbsp; acts&nbsp; under its <i>proprietary</i> power and not under its legislative, public or govern- mental powers.&nbsp; Farmers' State Bank vs. Conrad, 100 Mont. 415,&nbsp; 47 P.&nbsp; (2d)&nbsp; 853."&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Law of&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Corporations, McQuillin, 3rd ed., <i>supra</i>;&nbsp; italics ours.)</blockquote>Referring1 to irrigation&nbsp; districts&nbsp; in&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States, which&nbsp; are basically&nbsp; identical&nbsp; to&nbsp; our&nbsp; irrigation&nbsp; systems, under Act No. 2152, the Supreme Court of Idaho said:<br><blockquote>"An irrigation district is a public quasi corporation,&nbsp; organized, however,&nbsp; to conduct&nbsp; a business for the private benefit of the owners of land within its limits.&nbsp; They are the&nbsp; members of. the corporation, control its affairs, and alone are benefited by its operations.&nbsp; It is, in the administration&nbsp; of its business, the <i>owner</i> of its&nbsp; system in a proprietary&nbsp; rather than a&nbsp; public capacity, and&nbsp; must&nbsp; assume&nbsp; and bear the burdens of <i>proprietary ownership</i>." <br>(Nampa&nbsp; vs. Nampa &amp; M. Irrig. Dist. 19&nbsp; Idaho, 779, 115 Fac. 979; italics ours.)</blockquote>On the question whether or not an irrigation district is an&nbsp; agency of the State, as&nbsp; a&nbsp; sovereign political unit, and, as such, enjoys the immunities accorded to the Government, in the performance of its political&nbsp; functions, the case of E.W. Stephenson vs. Pioneer Irrigation District (288 Pac. 421), is specially&nbsp; in point.&nbsp;&nbsp; A synthesis of the issue raised and the decision rendered&nbsp; in said case is made in the ALR, from which the&nbsp; following is quoted:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * * the plaintiff sought&nbsp; damages&nbsp; for injuries to&nbsp; crops on his land during 1923, 1024, 1925, and 1926,&nbsp; caused&nbsp; by water&nbsp; seeping, percolating,&nbsp; and escaping from the defendant's canal.&nbsp; <i>The defendant contended that&nbsp; irrigation&nbsp; districts&nbsp; were&nbsp; agencies of the state</i>, and&nbsp; were,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; not liable for&nbsp; the&nbsp; negligent construction or operation of their&nbsp; canals&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; ditches.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court,&nbsp; after a&nbsp; careful review of the&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; defining an&nbsp; irrigation district,&nbsp; conceded that such a quasi&nbsp; public corporation possessed&nbsp; some governmental powers&nbsp; and exercised some governmental functions, but held&nbsp; that <i>the construction and&nbsp; operation of Us irrigation canals and ditches was a proprietary&nbsp; rather than a governmental function</i>,&nbsp; and hence the district was responsible in&nbsp; damages for the negligent construction or operation of its canal system." (69 A.L.E., p. 1233;&nbsp; italics ours.)</blockquote>Even, however,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; Angat&nbsp; River Irrigation&nbsp; System were a&nbsp; division or section of&nbsp; the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Works, or otherwise formed part&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; it would not follow that the functions of the&nbsp; System are governmental, not proprietary in nature.&nbsp; The Government discharges functions of a dual character.&nbsp; Some functions&nbsp; involve&nbsp; the exercise of sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Others imply merely the exercise of proprietary&nbsp; powers,&nbsp; like&nbsp; those&nbsp; of&nbsp; private&nbsp; corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very often, the latter are assigned&nbsp; to organs&nbsp; or bodies separate and distinct&nbsp; from the Government, as a political&nbsp; organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, sometimes, such proprietary functions are entrusted to a section or division of a Department, Bureau or Office of&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; proper.&nbsp; Such fact does not affect&nbsp; the character&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; functions&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; which depends upon its nature, not upon the officer" or body which exercises it.<br><br>With&nbsp; particular&nbsp; reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; irrigation&nbsp; systems&nbsp; or irrigation&nbsp; districts, it can&nbsp; not&nbsp; be denied&nbsp; that,&nbsp; at&nbsp; times, the magnitude characterizing&nbsp; the same, the big number of people directly affected thereby and the effect thereof upon the community or the nation,&nbsp; in general, have some&nbsp; points of&nbsp; analogy&nbsp; with&nbsp; the consequences&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of sovereign functions of the State.&nbsp; The same magnitude, number and&nbsp; effect may be found, however, in the&nbsp; operation of some enterprises, such as those engaged in the production and&nbsp; supply of&nbsp; electric power, or in furnishing telephonic, telegraphic and radio&nbsp; communication, or transportation, or in the production&nbsp; and distribution of&nbsp; prime necessities, and&nbsp; the like.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp; there could be&nbsp; no&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; that the functions performed by&nbsp; these enterprises&nbsp; are exclusively&nbsp; proprietary in&nbsp; nature.&nbsp; As held in Holderbaum&nbsp; vs. Hidalgo County Water Improvement District (297 S.W. 865, aff'd in 11 S. W. [2d]&nbsp; 506) ;<br><blockquote>" * * * Primarily, a water&nbsp; improvement district is in no&nbsp; better position than a city is when&nbsp; exercising its purely local powers and duties.&nbsp; Its&nbsp; general&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; are <i>not essentially public</i> in&nbsp; their nature, but are only <i>incidentally</i> so; those purposes may be&nbsp; likened to those of a&nbsp; city which is operating a waterworks system, or an irrigation&nbsp; system. * * *&nbsp; A&nbsp; water&nbsp; improvement&nbsp; district&nbsp; can do nothing, it has and furnishes no facilities, for the administration of the sovereign government. Its officers have no power or authority to exercise any of the&nbsp; functions of the general government, or to enforce any of&nbsp; the laws of the, state or any of its other&nbsp; subdivisions, or collect taxes other than those&nbsp; assessed by the district.&nbsp; <i>They have no rrwre power or authority than that of the officers of a private corporation&nbsp; organized for like 'purposes</i>.&nbsp; As a practical matter, the primary objects and purposes of such district&nbsp; are of a '<i>purely local nature</i>, for the&nbsp; district is created and&nbsp; operated for the sole benefit of <i>its own members</i>, and&nbsp; an&nbsp; analysis of those&nbsp; objects and purposes discloses that <i>they directly benefit only&nbsp; the&nbsp; landowners who&nbsp; reside within and whose&nbsp; lartns form a&nbsp; part, of the district,&nbsp; to the exclusion of all&nbsp; other residents therein</i>.&nbsp; It is true,&nbsp; of course, that the&nbsp; state and the general public are greatly benefited by the&nbsp; proper operation of the&nbsp; district, and to that extent its objects and accomplishments are public&nbsp; in their nature,&nbsp; but <i>this&nbsp; characteristic&nbsp; is only incidental to the primary and chief object of&nbsp; the corporation, which is the irrigation of lands forming a part of the district</i>.&nbsp; It is obvious, then, that the purposes and&nbsp; duties of such districts do&nbsp; not come within the the definition&nbsp; of public&nbsp; rights,&nbsp; purposes,&nbsp; and&nbsp; duties which&nbsp; would entitle the&nbsp; district to the&nbsp; exemption raised by the common&nbsp; law as a protection to corporations having a purely public purpose and performing essentially public&nbsp; duties. (To the same effect,&nbsp; see&nbsp; Hidalgo County Water&nbsp; Control&nbsp; &amp; Improv.&nbsp; Pist.&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Cannaway&nbsp; [1928, Tex. Civ.&nbsp; App.]&nbsp; 13&nbsp; S.&nbsp; W.&nbsp; [2d]&nbsp; 204.)"&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br><br>Thus, in Metropolitan Water District vs. Court of Industrial&nbsp;&nbsp; Relations,&nbsp;&nbsp; (91&nbsp; Phil,&nbsp; 840)&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; speaking through Chief&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Paras,&nbsp; with the concurrence&nbsp; of Justices&nbsp; Pablo,&nbsp;&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Fadilla,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo&nbsp; and Labrador, held:<br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; the effect&nbsp; that in&nbsp; determining the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; labor courts, the term 'industrial relation' refers&nbsp; 'to affairs&nbsp; relating to industry <i>and involving government&nbsp; departments devoted to&nbsp; public&nbsp; service.</i>'&nbsp; (State vs. Howat, 198&nbsp; Pae. 080, 693.) <i>The business of&nbsp; providing water supply and sewerage&nbsp; service may for all practical purposes&nbsp; be likened to the industry&nbsp; engaged by coal companies,&nbsp; gas companies, power plants, ice plants, and the like.</i>" (Italics ours.)</blockquote></blockquote>The majority opinion declares, in effect, that&nbsp; petitioners herein are not&nbsp; the&nbsp; "real parties&nbsp; in interests;"&nbsp; that the Angat River&nbsp; Irrigation&nbsp; System has no personality to sue; and that, in&nbsp; lieu of said System, respondent Labor Union should have&nbsp; directed its&nbsp; action against the&nbsp; State,&nbsp; which cannot be sued,&nbsp; however, without its consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; cannot see my way clear to&nbsp; adhering to this view, for the following1 reasons,&nbsp; namely:<br><blockquote><ol><li> The records do not&nbsp; show,&nbsp; as yet, the&nbsp; status of&nbsp; the Angat River Irrigation System.&nbsp; As above stated, not even petitioners herein allege that it is&nbsp; part of the Government. That is&nbsp; why&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court was justified in not passing upon this question and in deferring action thereon, until after the presentation of the evidence for both parties.<br><br></li><li> The certification case is not&nbsp; a suit against&nbsp; anybody.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; the&nbsp; System nor&nbsp; its supervising&nbsp; project engineer has&nbsp; been named as respondents, in the petition for certification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; system&nbsp; and the&nbsp;&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; officer sought to intervene therein&nbsp; of their own volition and free will.<br><blockquote>"A 'certification proceeding* is not a&nbsp; '<i>litigation</i>' in the sense&nbsp; that the latter term&nbsp; is commonly understood but a mere investigation of a non-adversary, fact-finding character&nbsp; in&nbsp; which the&nbsp; investigating agency plays the part of a disinterested investigator seeking merely to ascertain the desires of the employees as. to&nbsp; the matter of their representation.&nbsp; * * *."&nbsp; (The&nbsp; Law Governing Labor Disputes in the Philippines, Francisco, 3rd&nbsp; ed., Vol. I, p. 457; italics ours.)</blockquote></li></ol></blockquote> Indeed, section 12(b) of Republic Act No. 875, provides:<br><blockquote>"Whenever&nbsp; a&nbsp; question&nbsp; arises concerning the representation of employees, the&nbsp; Court may investigate such controversy and certify to the parties&nbsp; in&nbsp; writing" the name of the labor organization&nbsp; that has been&nbsp; designated or selected for the appropriate bargaining unit. In any such investigation, the: Court shall provide for a speedy and appropriate hearing upon due notice&nbsp; and if there is any reasonable doubt as&nbsp; to whom the employees&nbsp; have chosen as&nbsp; their representative for purpose of collective bargaining,&nbsp; the Court shall order a secret ballot election&nbsp; to be conducted&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Department of Labor, to ascertain who is the&nbsp; freely chosen representative of the employees, under such rules and regulations&nbsp; as the&nbsp; Court may&nbsp; prescribe, at which balloting&nbsp; representatives of the contending parties shall have the right to attend as inspectors.&nbsp; Such a balloting&nbsp; shall be known as a 'certification election'&nbsp; and the Court shall not order&nbsp; certifications in&nbsp; the same unit more&nbsp; than&nbsp; once in twelve months.&nbsp; The organization receiving the majority votes cast in such&nbsp; election shall be certified as&nbsp; the exclusive&nbsp; bargaining&nbsp; representative&nbsp; of&nbsp; such employees."</blockquote>Paraphrasing Rothenberg on Labor Relations (pp. 514- 515),&nbsp; Francisco in his work on the&nbsp; Law Governing Labor Disputes in the Philippines (Vol. I, p.458), says:<br><blockquote>"Proceedings for certification under this section&nbsp; must he distinguished from 'complaint' proceedings under Section 5 of the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter are adversary proceedings and 'litigation' in the sense that a charge of misconduct (unfair labor practices) is made which, when supported by proof, may&nbsp; result in the entry of a remedial&nbsp; order. In 'complaint' proceedings the Board&nbsp; (Court)&nbsp; acts as a quasi-judicial body in receiving and&nbsp; weighing1 evidence, making1 findings of fact, and rendering&nbsp; redress.&nbsp; However, 'certification* and&nbsp; 'de-certification' proceedings&nbsp; under this section&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Act are of a non-adversary nature.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; proceedings are not&nbsp; predicated upon an allegation of misconduct requiring,relief, but, rather, are merely of an inquisitorial nature.&nbsp; The Board's (Court's)&nbsp; functions are not&nbsp; judicial in nature, but&nbsp; are merely&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; investigative&nbsp; character.&nbsp; The&nbsp; object of the proceedings is&nbsp; not the decision, of any alleged commission of wrongs nor asserted deprivation of' rights but is merely the determination of proper&nbsp; bargaining units and the ascertainment of the&nbsp; will and choice of the employees in respect of the selection of a bargaining representative.&nbsp; The&nbsp; determination of the&nbsp; proceedings does not&nbsp; entail the entry of remedial wears Co redress&nbsp; rights but culminates solely in an official&nbsp; designation of bargaining units and&nbsp; an&nbsp; affirmation of the employees' expressed choice of bargaining&nbsp; agent.<br><br>"Proceedings&nbsp; under this section&nbsp; of the-&nbsp; Act are commenced&nbsp; by a 'Petition'&nbsp; which is filed&nbsp; with the Board&nbsp; (Court)&nbsp; by the seeking party.&nbsp; Actions&nbsp; charging an&nbsp; employer with&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; an 'unfair labor practice' and looking&nbsp; towards the entry&nbsp; of a remedial order are instituted by the filing of a&nbsp; 'Complaint'&nbsp; by the Board (Court) against the offending party, following the filing with the Board&nbsp; (Court&nbsp; of a&nbsp; 'Charge' by the&nbsp; aggrieved party.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 'certification'&nbsp; proceedings the 'Petition1&nbsp; is the initial process.&nbsp; In 'Complaint' proceedings&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board's (Court's)&nbsp; 'Complaint' and&nbsp; not the party's 'Charge' is the process commencing the action." (Italics ours.)</blockquote><blockquote><ol><li> Insofar as the case&nbsp; for alleged&nbsp; unfair labor practices is concerned,&nbsp; the following facts&nbsp; are worthy&nbsp; of notice,&nbsp; to wit:&nbsp; (a) "It is a well-established doctrine that when the Government&nbsp; engages in business, it&nbsp; abdicates part of its sovereign prerogatives and descends to the level of a citizen, and&nbsp; thereby subjects&nbsp; itself to&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws and&nbsp; regulations governing the relation&nbsp; of labor and management."&nbsp; (Price Stabilization Corporation vs. Court of Industrial Relations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> G.
