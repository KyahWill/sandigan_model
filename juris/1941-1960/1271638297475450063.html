				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 20, 1955, Artemio&nbsp; Barron, hereinafter referred to as respondent, filed an action for injunction in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Cavite against Carmen&nbsp; D.&nbsp; de Cruz, hereinafter referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; as petitioner,&nbsp; together with&nbsp; two other persons not&nbsp; herein involved, to&nbsp; enjoin&nbsp; them "from operating their motorboats as a ferry service between Calapan&nbsp; (Mindoro) and Batangas (Batangas)&nbsp; via&nbsp; Lobo."&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 10, 1955, petitioner sought to dismiss the&nbsp; case on the ground, among&nbsp; others, of lack of jurisdiction&nbsp; over&nbsp; her person and the subject matter involved, which&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was denied on June&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; Copy of the order denying the motion was served&nbsp; petitioner on June&nbsp; 14, 1955.<br><br>Prior to the expiration of the&nbsp; reglementary period to answer, petitioner&nbsp; asked&nbsp; for an additional period of ten days within which to file the answer, which was granted on June 16, 1955.&nbsp; The ten-day period of extension expired on June 27, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this same date,&nbsp; petitioner filed with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari with prohibition and&nbsp; preliminary injunction&nbsp; impugning the jurisdiction of the trial court to take cognizance of the case, serving a copy thereof on the trial court on June 28, 1955, together with a&nbsp; manifestation praying that the proceedings&nbsp; had therein be held in abeyance until the Supreme&nbsp; Court shall have finally determined her petition for certiorari.&nbsp; This petition was denied on the ground that appeal&nbsp; in due time was&nbsp; the proper&nbsp; remedy, as well as the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner in connection with said denial. The&nbsp; resolution of the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; denying the motion was&nbsp; received by petitioner on July 22, 1955.<br><br>On the next day, July 23, petitioner filed&nbsp; her answer with a counterclaim in the main&nbsp; case which&nbsp; was served on respondent in due time.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 30, ^955, respondent moved to&nbsp; strike out the answer and to declare petitioner in default on the ground&nbsp; that the answer was&nbsp; filed out of time, and after this motion&nbsp; was heard ex&nbsp; parte, in view of the inability of petitioner's counsel&nbsp; to appear, the same was&nbsp; granted,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; declaring petitioner&nbsp; in default. A motion to set aside the order immediately followed, but the same&nbsp; was denied for lack of merit,&nbsp; whereupon petitioner interposed the present petition&nbsp; for certiorari.<br><br>While this petition was pending consideration by&nbsp; this Court, petitioner filed an amended petition for certiorari stating, among other things that, "in order to forestall the loss of a valid cause of action", should this Court declare that appeal in due course is the proper remedy, she filed with the trial court a notice of appeal, an appeal bond, and a request to file the record on appeal after the termination of these proceedings, but the trial court denied the right of petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; has&nbsp; already&nbsp; become&nbsp; final&nbsp; and&nbsp; executory. Hence,&nbsp; she now prays that, should these proceedings fail, the trial court be ordered to approve her appeal and give due course to&nbsp; said appeal.<br><br>The question to be determined is&nbsp; whether the answer filed by petitioner in the main case can be considered as having been filed within the reglementary period considering the different steps taken by her in an effort to impugn the jurisdiction of the trial court and the period that had transpired in&nbsp; relation thereto.<br><br>To determine&nbsp; this issue, it&nbsp; is important to take&nbsp; note of the different pleadings that had been filed by the parties as well as the dates&nbsp; they were received by them since the filing of the complaint to the filing of the answer of petitioner which culminated&nbsp; in the issuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order declaring her&nbsp; in default which is now subject of the present petition for certiorari.&nbsp; In this connection,&nbsp; we will state hereunder the recount made by petitioner in tabulated form of the sequence of pertinent events which, in our opinion, appears to be borne out by the&nbsp; record:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="14%"><div align="center">Date</div></td> <td valign="top" width="3%">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top" width="67%"><div align="center">Nature of Pleading/Order</div></td> <td valign="top" width="2%">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top" width="14%"><div align="center">Manner of <br> Filing/Receipt</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">April 27</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Complaint and Summons received</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Registered Mail</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">May 10</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Motion To Dismiss</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Registered Mail&nbsp; (Reg.&nbsp;&nbsp; Receipt Nos.&nbsp; 44200&nbsp; &amp; 39729-Exh.&nbsp;&nbsp; K)</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">June 14</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Order of Denial of Motion to&nbsp; Dismiss received</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Registered Mail</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">June 15</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Motion and Order granting:&nbsp; Extension of ten&nbsp; (10) days to Answer ............</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Personal</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">June 27</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with&nbsp; Preliminary Injunction.</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">June 28</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Copy&nbsp; of the Petition for Certiorari was served on respondent court by petitioner with a Manifestation&nbsp; that&nbsp; proceedings thereon be held&nbsp; in abeyance pending&nbsp; Resolution of aforesaid Petition</div></td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Personal</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">July 22</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Resolution&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-9295 denying&nbsp; Petition</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Registered Mail</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">July 23</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Answer with Counterclaim</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Registered Mail (Reg.

Because of this belief, petitioner thought it wise and proper to come to the&nbsp; Supreme Court for redress when her motion to dismiss was denied, and this she did after requesting the trial&nbsp; court to suspend all proceedings until after the Supreme Court shall have finally passed upon&nbsp; the question&nbsp; of jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would therefore appear that, taking into account the time spent for this special remedy, petitioner can still be considered as having submitted her answer on time.&nbsp; These circumstances, in our opinion,&nbsp; justify a deviation from the ruling we have heretofore adhered to considering that&nbsp; the rules shall be&nbsp; liberally construed "not to hinder and delay but&nbsp; to facilitate&nbsp; and&nbsp; promote the administration of justice"&nbsp; {Manila&nbsp; Railroad&nbsp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.
