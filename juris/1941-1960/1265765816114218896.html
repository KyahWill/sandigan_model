				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is now before this Court on a petition for 
reconstitution, the record of the case having been destroyed as a result of the 
military operations for the liberation of the City of Manila. At the time of the 
destruction of the record, the case was pending in the Court of Appeals upon 
appeal by both parties from a decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila.
<p align="justify">In the proceeding for reconstitution conducted by the 
commissioner appointed by this Court (the Court of Appeals not being then in 
existence), the only portions of the record the parties were able to reconstruct 
were the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. Petition dated October 27, 1944, filed by Atty. Antonio 
Carrascoso, Jr., for the defendant-appellant in this case, wherein the 
defendant-appellant seeks to consign to the Clerk of Court of Appeals the sum of 
P23,489.35, in satisfaction of the judgment which had been rendered in the lower 
court in favor of the plaintiff-appellant and prays for the withdrawal of his 
appeal;</p>
<p align="justify">"2. Notice of consignation, dated October 26, 1944, signed by 
Atty. Antonio Carrascoso, Jr., for and in behalf of the defendant-appellant, 
sent to the China Insurance Surety Co., Inc.;</p>
<p align="justify">"3. Notice of the resolution of the Court of Appeals of 
November 2, 1944, to the parties in this case;</p>
<p align="justify">"4. The pleading of plaintiff-appellee in this case, bearing 
the following headings: (1) Opposition to the petition of defendant-appellant; 
(2) Motion asking triple cost and damages against said defendant; and (3) Motion 
of Reconsideration in case the said petition has been granted before this 
opposition has been received by the Court of Appeals (this last item consisting 
only of two pages, the third page thereof having been lost.)"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">No copy of the pleadings, evidence, decision, and briefs was 
available. The record could not, therefore, be fully or even substantially 
reconstituted. But notwithstanding this state of affairs, plaintiff-appellant 
asks that the case be declared reconstituted, and, on the theory that by 
defendant-appellant's offer of consignation contained in his petition of October 
27, 1944, he should be deemed to have recognized the validity of the judgment 
rendered against him in the lower court and, consequently, estopped from 
prosecuting his appeal, plaintiff-appellant further prays to order 
defendant-appellant to pay the amount of the judgment below.</p>
<p align="justify">Defendant-appellant objects to both of the above prayers and, 
on his part, asks that the case be declared reconstituted "in so far only as it 
refers to defendant's petition of October 27, 1944," and, once that is done, his 
offer of consignation declared valid and his obligation to plaintiff fully paid 
and discharged.</p>
<p align="justify">With nothing but papers relating to defendant-appellant's 
consignation of P23,489.35 in military notes with the clerk of the Court of 
Appeals, it is obvious that the appeal can not be decided on the merits. Missing 
are the pleadings, evidence and decision below and the briefs presented on 
appeal. This Court is, therefore, not sufficiently informed about the issues of 
fact and law involved to enable it to arrive at a correct decision of the case. 
The petition to have the record of the case declared completely reconstituted 
must, therefore, be denied.</p>
<p align="justify">This leaves the other question of whether or not the record may 
be deemed reconstituted in so far only as it refers to defendant's petition of 
October 27, 1944, with the object in view of determining whether the 
consignation made by the defendant-appellant was valid or not. On this point, 
the reconstituted documents show that, while the consignation was really made 
and the adverse party notified thereof, the same has neither been accepted by 
the latter nor approved by the court, and in any event there is no clear proof 
before us that the essentials of a valid consignation are here present, 
specially the conformity of the proffered payment to the terms of the obligation 
which is to be paid. It should be remarked in this connection that strict 
conformity in that regard is required, for, as Manresa says, "* * * el acreedor 
tan solo, y no el juez, puede autorizar la variacion que para los derechos de 
aquel suponga la que se intente en el objeto, cuantia o forma de las 
obligaciones." (8 Manresa, 312.) Since the appealed decision is not before us 
and there is no certain proof of the amount. and terms of the obligation which 
defendant-appellant is required to discharge under the judgment, it is not 
possible for this Court to pass upon the validity of the consignation in 
question. Consequently, defendant-appellant's suggestion to have the case 
declared partially reconstituted for the specific purpose he has in view cannot 
be entertained.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the question of whether or not defendant-appellant is now 
estopped from prosecuting his appeal on the theory that his offer of 
consignation amounts to a recognition of the validity of the judgment against 
him, it appears that the consignation was made at a time (October 27, 1944) when 
the Japanese military notes were already, to use counsel's own phrase, "almost 
worthless." Rather than a recognition of the validity of the judgment appealed 
from, the consignation made in this case may, pending its acceptance by the 
adverse party or a court declaration that it was properly made (Art. 1180, Civil 
Code), be regarded as a mere attempt at compromise without prejudice to the 
prosecution of the appeal if no settlement is effected.</p>
<p align="justify">Our conclusion, therefore, is that, on the basis of the 
documents presented, the record of this case can not be declared reconstituted 
either fully, as plaintiff-appellant asks, or partially, as defendant-appellant 
suggests, so that, in default of agreement to take the place of vital documents 
essential to a correct determination of the case on appeal as contemplated in 
section 60 of Act No. 3110, the proper remedy is for plaintiff-appellant to file 
its action anew in accordance with section 30 of the same act.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the petition to have the record of the case declared 
reconstituted either fully or partially and the petition to order 
defendant-appellant to pay the amount of the judgment appealed from are hereby 
denied.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon,
