				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On December 16, 1944, Vicente Barredo and his wife Tomasa  Marquinez executed in favor of Isaac Navarre a deed of mortgage on a parcel of land,  together with  the improvements thereon, situated in Makati, Rizal, to secure the payment of a loan of P30,000.  This deed was ratified before a notary public on December 18, 1944 and registered in the  Office of the  Register of Deeds  on  December 20, 1944.</p>
<p>On the same day of the execution of the mortgage, that is, on  December 18, 1944,  the spoustes signed in favor of the mortgagee a promissory note for the amount of P3,000 payable in "either Philippine Silver (metal)  Pesos, or Philippine  Treasury  Notes  without  interest, *  * * within two  years after the end of war  in the  Philippines", and providing therein that upon payment of said amount,  "the real  estate mortgagee covering my one parcel of land, together with the building and other improvements thereon— which  mortgage  I  have executed in favor of  Mr. Isaac Navarre  is thereby  cancelled  and  declared  void of  no further force and effect."</p>
<p>On January 20, 1954, the present action  was instituted by Isaac Navarre against the spouses Vicente Barredo and Tomasa Marquinez alleging that the loan of P3,000  was long overdue but  said  spouses have refused to pay  the same and praying that judgment be rendered for  said amount of P3,000, plus  P500 as attorney's fees, and other incidental expenses in the amount of P120 and that,  in default of payment,  the mortgage be ordered  foreclosed in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Defendants answered the  complaint alleging that  the loan  sought to be collected was. not yet due for the reason that  the  Philippines  is still at  war with  Japan, there being no peace  treaty signed between the two countries. No trial was  held of the case because the parties agreed to submit it for decision on the pleadings.  So on July 7, 1954, the  lower court rendered judgment finding that  the war  in the  Philippines ended  "when Japan surrendered unconditionally to the  Allied Powers on September 2, 1945" and,  consequently, ordered that defendants pay the amounts claimed and, in default thereof, that the mortgage be foreclosed in accordance with law.  Defendants appealed from this decision.</p>
<p>The main error assigned by appellants refers to the finding of the lower court to  the effect that war in the Philippines ended "when  Japan surrendered unconditionally to the  Allied  Powers  on September 2,  1945  and that the obligation in Question became due and payable two years thereafter."  It is contended that this finding is erroneous because it contravenes the ruling laid down by this Court in several  cases involving the meaning of the phrase "termination  of war", one of which being De la Paz,  Fabie <em>vs.</em> Court of Appeals, et al., 96 Phi]., 683, wherein  it was held that "war terminates when peace  is formally proclaimed, except where the parties have intended otherwise and meant  merely cessation of hostilities—in which case their intention must be given effect."</p>
<p>We have  no quarrel with this contention of counsel as regards  the correct interpretation that should be placed on the phrase "termination of war" or "end of war" which has  been used  by the parties in several private  contracts as an incidence of  the last war in the  Pacific.  Indeed, in the case above-cited,  this  Court has stated that, as a general  rule,  "war  terminates  when peace is formally proclaimed, except when  the  parties have intended otherwise and meant merely cessation of hostilities—in  which case their intention must be  given effect"  and that, "an exception to the general rule  must be proven by adequate circumstances,  facts, declaration, etc."   In other  words, the question is one  of intent  and if such is not manifest it should be presumed tyat the parties meant a termination of war  by formal proclamation of  peace.</p>
<p>But we differ with counsel  in  the application  of the rule to the present case.   It should be stated that when the parties executed the contract  in question, and made reference therein to the  phrase "end of war", they could not have had in mind the war then raging between the Philippines  and Japan but the one declared between the latter country and the United States because at that time the Philippines was still  a  dependency of  the United States and  if it was  dragged into  war  it was merely  because of the involvement of the United  States.   It is therefore erroneous to hold  that  in contemplation of law the war between  the  Philippines and Japan  has  not  yet ended simply because no  peace treaty has so far  been concluded between the two countries.</p>
<p>While  counsel may be correct  in his stand  that war with Japan has not legally been terminated when said country surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers on September 2, 1945, we may say however that, in the legal sense, war formally ended in  the Philippines the moment President Harry S. Truman officially issued a proclamation of peace on December 31, 1946 upon the theory that the. Philippines, even if already independent, was an ally of the United States because, according to this Court "war terminates when  peace is formally proclaimed"  (De  la Paz, Fabie <em>vs.</em> Court of Appeals, supra). And if counsel meant that there should be a formal  treaty of peace, we may say that this  purpose  has also  been  accomplished  when the treaty of peace with,Japan had been signed in San Francisco, California on September 8, 1951 by the United States and the Allied Powers, including the Philippines.  Indeed, the parties could  not have  referred to any other treaty when they executed the contract in question because the war that was then going on was the one declared between the United States and the Allied Powers on one hand and Japan on the other.</p>
<p>It appearing that the present action was initiated by the plaintiff in 1954, it follows that more than two years had  elapsed since  the end  of the war whether  this be computed from the date of  the  proclamation of peace by President Truman (December  31, 1946), or from the signing of the treaty of peace with Japan on September 8, 1951.  Consequently,  the action taken by  the  plaintiff is no longer premature as claimed by "appellants.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J,, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
