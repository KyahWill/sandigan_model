				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><i>Certiorari </i>and <i>mandamus </i>to annul an order of the respondent judge denying the 
admission of the testimony of new witnesses and to order him to admit said 
testimony and render a new decision in civil case No. 7637 of the Court of First 
Instance of Laguna.
<p>In the early part of 1943 said civil case was commenced by Luis D. Almario 
against Manuel Pagkalinawan and others to annul a certain deed of sale of a 
parcel of land executed by the former in favor of the latter and to recover 
damages. After due trial, and on January 28, 1944, Judge Felix Bautista Angelo 
rendered judgment dismissing the complaint with costs against the plaintiff. The 
plaintiff appealed the case to the then Court of Appeals for Southern Luzon, and 
pending the filing of the briefs the battle for the liberation of the 
Philippines supervened. After the liberation, and before the re-creation of the 
Court of Appeals, the case reached this court, which on July 15, 1946, ordered 
that a new trial in the lower court be held in view of the loss of the 
stenographic notes and the statement of counsel for both parties that they would 
raise factual issues in their briefs.</p>
<p>In the meantime the plaintiff Luis D. Almario having disappeared during the 
latter part of the war, he was declared an absentee and trusteeship proceedings 
of his estate were instituted. His wife, the herein petitioner Demetria Obien de 
Almario, was appointed trustee and substituted as party plaintiff in said. 
case.</p>
<p>When the case was called for new trial as ordered by this court, the 
plaintiff offered as part of her evidence the testimony of new witnesses who did 
not testify during the original trial but whom the plaintiff sought to present 
in lieu of the original plaintiff, Luis D. Almario, who had disappeared. Upon 
the objection of counsel for the defendants, the respondent judge refused to 
admit the testimony of the said witnesses on the ground that the new trial 
ordered by this court "is only for the purpose of enabling 'the parties, thru 
their counsel, to discuss in their briefs the facts proven in the former trial 
and [that] the original decision of this court from which appeal has been taken 
has not been vacated." In other words, the respondent judge took the view that 
his task was only to retake the testimony of the witnesses who testified during 
the original trial and forward it to the appellate court without rendering a new 
decision.</p>
<p>Was that view of the respondent judge correct? The question involves an 
interpretation of the pertinent provisions of Act No. 3110, which provides an 
adequate procedure for the reconstruction of the records of pending judicial 
proceedings destroyed by fire or other public calamities. Sections 6, 7, 30, and 
64 of said Act provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 6. Testimony of witnesses taken in civil cases shall be reconstituted 
by means of an authentic copy thereof or a new transcript of the stenographic 
notes. If no authentic copy can be obtained and the stenographic notes have also 
been destroyed, the cases shall be tried <em>de novo</em> as if called for trial 
for the first time.</p>
<p>"SEC. 7. If a civil case has already been decided, the decision shall be 
reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. In case an authentic copy cannot be 
found, the Court shall make a new decision, as if the case had never been 
decided."</p>
<p>"SEC. 30. When it shall not be possible to reconstitute a destroyed judicial 
record by means of the procedure established in this Act or for any reason not 
herein provided for, the interested parties may file their actions anew, upon 
payment of the proper fees, and such actions shall be registered as new actions 
and shall be treated as such."</p>
<p>"SEC. 64. If an authentic copy of the transcript of the stenographic notes of 
the testimony taken cannot be filed, the Supreme Court shall direct the proper 
stenographer to make another transcription. And if the stenographic notes taken 
by the stenographer has also been destroyed, the Supreme Court shall direct the 
proper Court of First Instance to proceed to hear the case anew, which shall 
then be considered as ready for a hearing in said Court of First 
Instance."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Madalang <em>vs.</em> Court of First Instance of Romblon 
(1926), 49 Phil. 487, the entire record was destroyed by fire after the case had 
been decided by the Court of First Instance and while a motion for new trial was 
pending therein. The record was reconstructed in accordance with the provisions 
of Act No. 3110 by means of authentic copies of the pleadings, of the 
documentary evidence, and of the decision of the trial court, "minus the 
transcript of the stenographic notes of the testimony of the witnesses for both 
parties, the flame having been destroyed by fire, together with the original 
stenographic notes. In view of the impossibility of reproducing said oral 
evidence, the court ordered a new trial for the presentation and reception of 
the testimony of the witnesses." During the new trial fhe defendant Madalang, 
after having introduced the same witnesses who had testified in the original 
trial, attempted to present additional witnesses. The adverse party objected to 
the admission of the testimony of the additional witnesses and the trial court 
sustained the objection.</p>
<p>In denying the petition for mandamus in that case, this court applied 
sections 6 and 7 of Act No. 3110. It will be recalled that section 6 provides 
that if no authentic copy of the transcript of the stenographic notes can be 
obtained and the stenographic notes have also been destroyed, the case shall be 
tried <em>de novo</em> as if called for trial for the first time; and section 7 
provides that if the case has already been decided, the decision shall be 
reconstituted by means of an authentic copy, and if an authentic copy cannot be 
found, the court shall make a new decision as if the case had never been 
decided. After quoting said sections the court interpreted them in this 
wise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears from section 7 above quoted that a new judgment can be rendered, 
as if the case had never been decided, only when the original decision cannot be 
reconstructed by means of an authentic copy. So that if an authentic copy of the 
original decision exists, the latter must be reconstructed by means thereof. If 
this is so, the reconstruction of the oral evidence introduced at the original 
trial of civil cases, when no authentic copy thereof exists, or when the 
stenographic notes have been destroyed and it is impossible to secure another 
transcript of the same, the testimony of the witnesses who testified at the 
original trial shall be taken again; because, as the original decision is 
reconstructed by means of an authentic copy of the same, it is not necessary to 
render a new one, and the reconstruction of the oral evidence is only for the 
purpose of permitting the court of appeal to review it and determine whether the 
appealed decision is in accordance therewith.</p>
<p>"Consequently, Act No. 3110 in providing in its section 7 that if an 
authentic copy exists the decision shall be reconstructed by means thereof, it 
was the intention that in the reconstruction of the oral evidence, provided in 
section 6, only the testimony of the same witnesses who testified at the 
original trial must be taken again and not the testimony of additional 
witnesses, because neither the literal meaning of the verb "reconstitute," used 
in said law, nor the spirit, nor the object of the same warrants a different 
interpretation. (Page 490.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Relying upon said decision the herein respondents contend that the new trial 
ordered by this court was limited to the reception of the testimony of the 
witnesses who testified in the original trial; that all that the respondent 
judge had to do was to forward the reconstructed oral evidence to this court in 
order that the original decision rendered by Judge Bautista Angelo might be 
reviewed on appeal; and that, therefore, the petition for <i>certiorari </i>and <i>
mandamus </i>should be denied.</p>
<p>The facts of the Madalang case differ from those of the present in these 
respects: (1) In that case the witnesses who testified in the original trial 
were present and available and in fact did testify in the new trial; whereas in 
the present case one of the principal witnesses for the plaintiff, namely, the 
original plaintiff himself, Luis D. Almario, had disappeared and his whereabouts 
was unknown when the case was called for new trial. (2) In that case the 
stenographic notes were burned while the case was still pending on a motion for 
new trial in the trial court, and apparently the judge who had tried and decided 
the case originally was the same judge who ordered and conducted a new trial; 
whereas in the present case the stenographic notes were lost after the case had 
been elevated on appeal and the new trial ordered by this court was to take 
place before another judge who did not hear and decide the case originally. 
These variations between the respective facts of the two cases are in our 
opinion substantial enough to produce different results, as we shall presently 
explain.</p>
<p>It will be noted that Act No. 3110 provides separate procedures for the 
reconstitution of civil cases pending in the Courts of First, Instance and for 
the reconstitution of those pending in the Supreme Court on appeal. (Cf. 
sections 6 and 7 and section 64.) Different sections of the Act cover different 
stages in which the cases were found at the time the records were destroyed. 
Thus, section 4 covers the stage where a civil case was pending trial in the 
Court of First Instance at the time the record was destroyed or lost; section 6 
evidently refers to the stage where the trial had been concluded but the case 
had not been decided at the time the stenographic notes were destfoyed or lost; 
section 7 covers the stage where the case had been tried and decided but was 
still pending in the Court of First Instance at the time the record was 
destroyed or lost; and 64 covers the stage where the case was pending in Supreme 
Court (or Court of Appeals) at the time the record was destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>If no authentic copy of the transcript of the stenographic notes can be 
obtained and the stenographic notes have also been destroyed, the case "shall be 
tried <em>de novo</em> as if called for trial for the first time." (Section 6.) 
It is to be assumed that section 6 refers to the stage where the court had not 
yet rendered its decision at the time the stenographic notes were destroyed, 
because another provision (section 7) is made when a decision had been rendered 
at the time the stenographic notes were destroyed. In the situation covered by 
section 6 the case is tried <i>de novo</i> as if called for trial for the first time, 
and naturally there is no restriction of the witnesses whose testimony may be 
taken. In the situation covered by section 7 where a decision had been rendered, 
the case may or may not be tried <em>de novo</em>, depending upon the 
circumstances. If the decision can be reconstituted by means of an authentic 
copy and the stenographic notes have not been destroyed, there is no need for 
reopening the trial. If the decision cannot be reconstituted by means of an 
authentic copy but either the stenographic notes or the transcript thereof is 
intact, neither is there any need for reopening the trial; the court will simply 
make a new decision as if the case had never been decided. If the decision can 
be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy but neither the stenographic 
notes nor an authentic copy of the transcript thereof can be found, as in the 
Madalang case (<em>supra</em>), a new trial is required.</p>
<p>What then is the scope of such new trial? Is the case to be "tried <em>de 
novo</em> as if called for trial for the first time," as provided in section 6? 
Or may it be limited to the same witnesses who testified in the original trial? 
And will the original decision which has been reconstituted stand, or will the 
court have to render a new decision after the new trial?</p>
<p>Section 7 is not specific on these points. But since the law is procedural or 
adjective and is only a means to an endâ€”an aid to substantive lawâ€”it should be 
interpreted and applied to accomplish that end. Thus, as in the Madalang case, 
if the decision of the trial court is intact but because of the lack of the 
stenographic notes or of the transcript thereof the testimony of the witnesses 
have to be retaken, and if all of said witnesses are available and the judge who 
heard them before is the same judge who is to retake their testimony, there is 
no reason of law or justice to hear new or additional witnesses, because the 
loss of the record of the testimony of the original witnesses does not and 
cannot give rise to any necessity.or justification for calling new or additional 
witnesses whose testimony would necessarily render the reconstituted decision 
inapplicable and, therefore, its reconstitution of no avail. Hence, as was 
decided in the Madalang case, the trial court may propperly limit the parties to 
the same witnesses who testified in the original trial; and if said witnesses 
should testify In the new trial to substantially the same facts as those 
testified to by them in the original trial, as they are supposed to do, and as 
the same judge who heard them before will require them to do, there is no need 
to render a new decision. But if the said witnesses or some of them should 
testify differently from the facts they testified to in the original trial, the 
court would have to make new findings of fact and render a new decision. As thus 
qualified and explained, the decision of this court in the Madalang case is 
correct and need not be disturbed.</p>
<p>But that case is not applicable to the instant case, Which, as already noted 
above, presents substantially different facts. In the instant case one of the 
principal witnesses for the plaintiff, namely, the original plaintiff himself, 
Luis D. Almario, cannot testify in the new trial, he having disappeared, and it 
would be unjust to deny to his successor in interest as party plaintiff the 
right to substitute his testimony with that of another witness or witnesses who 
may have knowledge of the same facts to which he testified in the original 
trial. Another difference is that the judge who heard the original witnesses and 
decided the case is not the same judge before whom the new trial is held and is 
therefore totally ignorant of what the original Witnesses had testified to. He 
would not be in a position to instruct the witnesses who testified in the 
original trial to limit their testimony to the points to which they had 
testified before. These two circumstances, which did not obtain in the Madalang 
case, render untenable the theory of the respondent judge that his task is only 
to retake the testimony of the witnesses who testified during the original trial 
and forward it to the appellate court without rendering a new decision.</p>
<p>In the present case it is imperative that the trial should render a new 
decision in conformity with the facts established in the new trial. That is 
contemplated and authorized by section 64 of Act No. 3110, which is the 
provision applicable to the reconstitution in the Supreme Court (or Court of 
Appeals) of civil cases under appeal. While the Supreme Court may limit the 
scope of the new trial as the circumstances warrant, the order of new trial 
issued in this case was couched in general or unrestricted terms, and the facts 
and circumstances now disclosed before us do not warrant any limitation or 
restriction.</p>
<p>During our deliberation a suggestion was made that if the petitioner desires 
to call new or additional witnesses she should bring a new action under section 
30 of Act No. 3110 The court, however, is of the opinion that said section is 
not applicable because it refers to a situation where the entire record of the 
case including the pleadings is destroyed and it is not possible to reconstitute 
it by means of the procedure established in said Act or for any reason not 
provided for therein. It is not necessary for the plaintiff herein to file a new 
action and pay the proper fees, since the pleadings have been reconstituted and 
only the oral evidence is missing.</p>
<p>The writ prayed for is granted without any finding as to costs. <br></p><p>SO
