				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; February 15,&nbsp; 1954, Irenea Lasit&nbsp; and Julian&nbsp; Mayol filed in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Cebu&nbsp; a petition praying that certain plans&nbsp; and&nbsp; technical&nbsp; descriptions covering lots Nos. 2545-A and- 2545-B&nbsp; be ordered reconstituted and, thereafter, an order be issued&nbsp; directing the Chief, General&nbsp; Land Registration Office, to issue&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; decrees&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; plans&nbsp; and descriptions (G.L.R.O. Record&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4030, Case No. 3). Domingo Mayol and Emilio Mayol filed separately an opposition&nbsp; to said&nbsp; petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the hearing,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; certain documentary&nbsp; evidence which showed that&nbsp; it merely represents duplicate copies of the decisions, plans and technical descriptions on which they wanted the court to base the issuance of the decree but that* the originals thereof are not found in the record of the case,&nbsp; whereupon oppositors&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion to dismiss contending that, since&nbsp; the petition filed by petitioners is virtually&nbsp; a motion for&nbsp; reconstitution of a judicial record and the period&nbsp; for such purpose has&nbsp; expired since 1947, the court had no longer jurisdiction to act on&nbsp; said petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppositors therefore prayed&nbsp; that the petition&nbsp; be denied.&nbsp; Their motion&nbsp; for dismissal as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; their motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; having been&nbsp; denied, oppositors have come before this Court by&nbsp; way of certiorari alleging that respondent&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; acted&nbsp; without jurisdiction or with grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion.<p></p><p>The&nbsp; question&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; determined is&nbsp; whether&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition filed by respondents&nbsp; Irenea Lasit and Julian Mayol is one which seeks the issuance of a decree for registration of certain lots&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; a decision already&nbsp; rendered or whether it is a motion for&nbsp; reconstitution of a court record which may serve as basis for the issuance of said decree.</p><p>It appears that the lots in question were adjudicated on February 27, 1934 in&nbsp; the registration proceedings instituted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the "El Seminario&nbsp; de San Carlos&nbsp; de Cebu" as shown by a&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; issued by the clerk of court of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Cebu&nbsp; (Annex 2), but it does not&nbsp; appear in the record the names&nbsp; of the persons to whom the same&nbsp; were&nbsp; adjudicated&nbsp; nor the originals&nbsp; of the decisions covering&nbsp; the adjudicated lots.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; merely states that on page 160&nbsp; of the court record there appears an entry regarding the adjudication of the above-mentioned lots.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; further appears that&nbsp; sometime in December, 1934 a petition for subdivision&nbsp; of the aforesaid lots&nbsp; was filed on behalf&nbsp; of the interested parties praying for authority to have the lots subdivided for the reason that the&nbsp; owners had already agreed to divide them and have the titles issued in their&nbsp; names,&nbsp; and to that effect&nbsp; they recommended that&nbsp; one Higinio&nbsp; B. Alfaro be commissioned to make the subdivision, but there is nothing in the record to show that said subdivision plan&nbsp; has ever been&nbsp; made&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason petitioners have&nbsp; ordered the making&nbsp; of a&nbsp; new&nbsp; subdivision plan&nbsp; and asked the court&nbsp; to&nbsp; approve and&nbsp; consider them&nbsp; irt connection&nbsp; with their&nbsp; petition.&nbsp; It therefore appears clear&nbsp; that the record of the court&nbsp; in so far as said&nbsp; lots are concerned is&nbsp; really incomplete for neither the&nbsp; original decision&nbsp; nor&nbsp; the original subdivision plan appear therein, and yet petitioners now want the court tp issue the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; decree on the basis merely of&nbsp; duplicate copies&nbsp; that&nbsp; are&nbsp; in&nbsp; their possession.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is indeed a&nbsp; petition for reconstitution that comes within the purview of Section 29&nbsp; of Act 3110. In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Ambat <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands, 49&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 129, this Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"A judgment rendered before&nbsp; the&nbsp; war, in a case pending appeal before the Court of Appeals, does not become final&nbsp; because of the failure of the&nbsp; losing party&nbsp; to&nbsp; ask for the&nbsp; reconstitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the records in the&nbsp; appellate&nbsp; court within&nbsp; the&nbsp; time prescribed by law for&nbsp; reconstitution of judicial&nbsp; records.&nbsp; The&nbsp; duty&nbsp; to reconstitute lies upon both&nbsp; parties to the action.&nbsp; If a party&nbsp; in whose favor a judgment is&nbsp; rendered fails to ask for the reconstitution&nbsp; of the records of&nbsp; the case&nbsp; wherein the&nbsp; judgment is&nbsp; rendered, he&nbsp; impliedly waives, by&nbsp; his voluntary&nbsp; omission to ask&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconstitution, his right&nbsp; to the favorable judgment;&nbsp; and&nbsp; if&nbsp; the period&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reconstitution has already expired,&nbsp; section 29 of Act No. 3110 is applicable, the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; being&nbsp; understood&nbsp; as&nbsp; having waived&nbsp; the right to reconstitution and having the&nbsp; right to file&nbsp; their respective actions anew."</p></blockquote><p>It appearing that the period for reconstitution&nbsp; fixed by. the law&nbsp; has long expired,&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; are deemed to have&nbsp; waived&nbsp; the&nbsp; effects of the decision&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; their favor&nbsp; and their only alternative is to&nbsp; file&nbsp; an action anew for the&nbsp; registration in&nbsp; their&nbsp; names of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots&nbsp; in question.</p><p>Wherefore, petition is granted.&nbsp; Respondent Judge&nbsp; is hereby ordered to desist from further&nbsp; hearing the&nbsp; petition of respondents Irenea Lasit and Julian Mayol,&nbsp; and all proceedings heretofore had on said petition are hereby annulled, without pronouncement&nbsp; as to&nbsp; costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Jugo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
