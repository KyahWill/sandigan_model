				<H3>CHARLIE BROWN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. CONSTANCIO S. SUEZO, AN OPERATOR OF THE MOTOR-LAUNCH FERRY SERVICE DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE  COMMON NAME "C. S. SUEZO & BROS.", DEFENDANT AND  APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Charlie Brown is the operator of a motor-launch ferry service, crossing  the Panguil  Bay, from Ozamis  City to Baroy, Lanao, by way  of Tubod, Lanao, since 1947.   For this purpose, he uses the  motor  launches "Rosita  II", "Rosita III"  and "Rosita IV", which were duly registered with the Bureau of Customs.   In the early part of 1954, Constancio S. Suezo obtain a license from the  Bureau of Customs  to  engage in the same  business of carrying or towing passengers or freight along the same route as covered by Brown's vessels, and in offering his services to the  public,  the former utilized 2  launches,  the "M/L Azucena" and  "M/L Sampaguita". <br><br>On  February 17,  1956,  presumably  upon application, Charlie Brown was issued a certificate of public  convenience by  the Public Service Commission allowing  him to operate a ferry service  in the above-mentioned areas, regulating the  trips and the passengers and freight rates therefor.   Suezo,  on the  other hand, apparently did not see the wisdom of securing such a certificate from the Commission for he made no move to obtain one. <br><br>On April  4,  1956,  Brown filed a  complaint  with  the Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental against Constancio S.  Suezo,  who was sued as  operator of a  motor launch  ferry service doing  business  under the common name  "C. S.  Suezo &amp;  Bros."  (Civil  Case No.  1877) charging that defendant's operation of vessels plying the same distance  and route covered by his certificate of public convenience without securing  a  permit  from  the Public  Service  Commission,  rendered with operation unauthorized; that this operation was  offering plaintiff  a ruinous and  illegal competition causing him damage at the  rate of  P50.00  a  day per  launch; that being  the holder of a permit from  the Public  Service  Commission to engage in such business, he should be protected from such unfair competition;  that in  view of the precarious business brought  about  by the  aforesaid  undertaking, plaintiff was forced  to pull out of  operation his motor launch "Rosita  IV".  It was thus prayed that defendant's operation of  a ferry service along the route covered by his permit be declared illegal; that defendant be ordered to  pay damages in  the  sum of P50 a  day for  every motor launch in operation from February 17, 1956, until defendant desist from offering services to the public; and that defendant  be  enjoined from continuing said activity. <br><br>And finding his petition  meritorious, the  lower Court issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for upon plaintiff's filing a bond in the sum of P10,000.  The writ, however, was dissolved when defendant posted a counterbond in the amount of P20,000. <br><br>On April 28, 1956, defendant filed a motion to dismiss for  lack of cause  of action for the  reason that as  a certificate of public convenience is  not a condition precedent in the business of towing  passengers  and  freight, plaintiff's claim for damages could not prosper.  Furthermore, it was alleged that  under Commonwealth Act  146 as  amended,  the Public  Service Commission was  the body empowered to investigate any charges or grievances against public utility operators.  The Court,  therefore, defendant claimed,  had no jurisdiction to entertain such complaint.   As the aforesaid motion was denied defendant  filed his answer denying the material averments of the  complaint and setting up as affirmative defenses the reasons adduced in  his motion to dismiss.  In praying for the  dismissal of the action,  defendant also  claimed  for actual  and moral damages, attorney's fees and such other relief as may be just and equitable in the premises. <br><br>On January 8, 1957, defendant filed a  motion for the reconsideration of  the order of June  25,  1956,  denying the  motion to dismiss, based on  the ruling  rendered  by this Court  in  the  case of Elpidio Javellana vs. Public Service Commission and Artemio Barron, 98 Phil., 964; 52 Off. Gaz. (14) 6196, holding that  the Public Service Commission has no authority to require operators of steamboats, motor  boats and motor vessels used in ferry  or coastwise trade, to secure a certificate of public convenience.  Acting upon said motion, the Court, in its order of February 25, 1957, dismissed the complaint, without costs.  From this order, plaintiff  instituted  the instant  appeal contending that the case of Javellana vs.  Public Service Commission is not in point and not applicable  to the instant action. <br><br>Appellant tries to draw a dividing line between the aforesaid Javellana case  and  the one at bar,  distinguishing one  from the other, arguing that the  pronouncement of this Court in the former is operative only to cases involving motor  service and not to ordinary, ferry business, taking into consideration the distance to be  covered, the nature  of the water to  be traversed  and the  kind  of craft or  vessel to be used  for the purpose.   Relying  on Section 13-(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  of the  Public Service Law,  as amended, this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Montemayor, made a ruling on this matter when it said:<br><blockquote>"*  * *. Anyway, whether, said service between  the different islands  is  regarded  as  ferry  service  or  coastwise  trade  service, <span style="font-style: italic;">as long as the  water  craft  used are steamboats, motorboats or motor vessels, the result will be the  same as far as the  Commission is concerned</span>.  * * *.  It is true  that  steamboats, motorboats and  motor vessels are included  in  the public service over which the Commission has jurisdiction.  It  is equally true, however, that as regards  those means of transportation,  whether used in a ferry or in the coastwise trade, the Commission has  no  authority to require  them  to obtain certificate  of public  convenience or prescribe their definite route or  line.  * *  *"  Javellana et al. vs. The Public Service Commission et al., 98 Phil.,  964).  (See Section 13- [<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>] and [<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>] of Commonwealth Act No. 146, known  as the Public Service Act, as amended).</blockquote>It may be asked in this connection, if it is not the Public Service Commission, what office or body  has  jurisdiction over  the  same? <br><br>Section 1139 of the Revised Administrative Code  provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1139. <span style="font-style: italic;">General Jurisdiction of Bureau</span>.â€”The general duties, powers, and jurisdiction of Bureau of Customs shall include: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*    *    *    *    *    *    *<br></div><br>(b) The general supervision, control and regulation of the coastwise trade and in the carrying or towing of passengers  and freight in the bays and rivers of the Philippines."</blockquote>Appellee Constancio Suezo was duly granted permit by the Bureau of Customs to engage in ferrying passengers  or  towing freight  in said areas; hence, said operation cannot  be declared  to  be  unauthorized or  illegal.  It may not be  amiss to state at this juncture that from 1947 up to February 17, 1956, appellant  in the operation of  the  same ferry business was  equipped by no less  a similar permit from the Bureau of Customs than the one he  is now trying to contest, which shows that before his competitor entered into the picture,  he  believed  in the efficacy and sufficiency of  such permit to sustain  the legality of his aforesaid business.  Certainly, it  is not difficult to comprehend why he should  now contest its validity. <br><br>Wherefore,  the order  of the lower Court of February 25, 1957, appealed from is hereby  affirmed,  with costs against appellant.  It is so ordered.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon,  Padilla, Montemayor,  Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia,  JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">A., J</span>., <br><br>I concur in the result, considering that the ferry service here in question may well belong to the  coastwise trade. But whether  a ferry service  across  a narrow  body of water, such as a river, for instance, would be  outside the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission if the watercraft used were steam vessels or motorboats, is a question on  which I am not now expressing my opinion. <br></div>
