				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Samar 
convicting appellant of murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment with 
perpetual absolute disqualification, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased 
Diego Testor in the sum of P2,000 and to pay costs.
<p>The evidence shows that some time before March 11, 1944, the now deceased 
Diego Testor was asked by one Ponting to take a quantity of fish to a 
constabulary detachment in the barrio of Trinidad, municipality of Calbayog, 
province of Samar. The detachment was made up of seven or eight men with Dario 
Margen in command. Needing food for his children, Testor traded the fish for 
<em>camote</em>, and when he was sent for by Sgt. Margen to make him account for 
this breach of trust, he brought with him to the barracks a quantity of another 
kind of fish, called <em>kalapion</em>. Irritated by Tester's conduct, Sergeant 
Margen took hold of the fish and threw them into Testor's face, and then he had 
Tester's hands tied behind his back and gave him fist blows. Taking their cue 
from the sergeant, three of the soldiers, namely, Julian Tarrayo, Domingo Ramos 
(now deceased) and Andres Midoranda, also maltreated Testor by hitting him in 
different parts of the body. Thereafter, Sergeant Margen forced Testor to eat up 
two of the <em>kalapions</em>. In this the sergeant was aided by Tarrayo, who 
shoved the fish into Testor's mouth, and by Midoranda, who held the loose end of 
the rope with which Tester's hands were tied. After this ordeal Testor was taken 
to Calbayog where, despite medical attendance, he died the following day, March 
12, 1944. The cadaver presented various contusions, but autopsy revealed that 
death was due to internal hemorrhage resulting from the perforation of the 
intestines by stiff fish bones.</p>
<p>For the death of Diego Testor, Margen, Tarrayo, and Midoranda were prosecuted 
for murder. But only Midoranda, the herein appellant, was tried because the 
other two were able to escape.</p>
<p>There is hardly any doubt as to the essential facts. While appellant would 
have the Court believe that he did not join Ms companions in maltreating the 
deceased, alleging that all he did was to stand by and watch, this allegation is 
belied by the testimony of eye-witnesses whose veracity has not been put in 
doubt. Indeed, appellant's own witness, Eleuterio Anabeso, admitted on 
cross-examination that appellant was among those who slapped the deceased in the 
face. The evidence is, we believe, quite clear that appellant cooperated with 
his co-defendants in binding and beating up the deceased as well as in the no 
less inhuman act of making him devour raw fishâ€”flesh, scales, spines, and 
all.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that the crime of murder was committed in this case, it 
appearing that the acts which resulted in the death of Diego Testor were 
performed when the latter, with his hands bound behind his back, was entirely 
defenseless. But counsel for the defense argues that, in the absence of proof of 
conspiracy, appellant should not be held liable for the said crime because he 
merely obeyed the orders of his superior.</p>
<p>Obedience to an order of a superior gives rise to exemption from criminal 
liability only when the order is for some lawful purpose (Art. 11, par. 6, 
Revised Penal Code). Sergeant Margen's order to have the deceased tortured was 
not of that kind. The deceased may have given offense. But that did not give the 
sergeant the right to take the law in his own hands and have the offender 
subjected to inhuman punishment. The order was illegal, and appellant was not 
bound to obey it. Moreover, it does not appear that in taking part in the 
maltreatment of the deceased, appellant was prompted solely by his sense of duty 
toward his superior. What appears is that he and his companions had a common 
grievance against the deceased, because the latter had misappropriated a 
quantity of fish intended for their consumption. It was, therefore, but natural 
that they should all want to teach the deceased a lesson by making him suffer 
for the fault he had committed.</p>
<p>Having taken direct part in the unlawful acts which resulted in the death of 
the deceased and nothing having been proved which would exempt him from criminal 
liability, appellant must be held as co-principal of the crime of murder charged 
in the information. We do not find in the circumstances attending the commission 
of the crime anything that should aggravate or mitigate criminal liability, and 
as the penalty imposed below is in accordance with law, the sentence appealed 
from is hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla</em>, and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p>MORAN, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>
<p>I hereby certify that Mr. Justice Montemayor, who is now in Baguio, took part 
in the disposition of this case and voted in favor of this decision.</p></div>
