				<H3>RECONSTRUCTED LAND REGISTRATION CASE NO. 687. EUGENIO PALUAY, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. CELESTINO BACUDAO, ET AL., OPPOSITORS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime before the last war, Eugenio Paluay filed a petition for the 
registration of five parcels of land situated in the municipality of Barotac 
Viejo, Province of Iloilo, known as lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of plan 
Psu-109870, in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. The petition was opposed 
by the Director of Lands, Juan Bacudao, Lourdes Bacudao and Celestino Bacudao. 
After due trial, the court on March 31, 1942 rendered decision awarding lots 
Nos. 1, 2 and 5 to the applicant and lots Nos. 3 and 4 to oppositors Juan 
Bacudao and the heirs of Lourdes Bacudao.
<p>The Court of First Instance of Iloilo was reorganized on March 22, 1945, four 
days after the American forces liberated the island of Panay. The clerk of 
court, in accordance with Act No. 3110, submitted a report to the court stating 
that all the court records were destroyed or burned as a result of the battle 
for liberation and so the court issued an order on June 7, 1945 directing their 
reconstruction which was published in two leading newspapers in the City of 
Iloilo once a week for six months.</p>
<p>Taking notice of the court order, Eugenio Paluay filed on July 16, 1945 a 
motion with the court praying for the reconstitution of the registration case 
concerning the five lots applied for by him, and on the next day, July 17, he 
filed another motion wherein he prayed for the issuance of a decree ordering the 
registration in his name of lots Nos. 1, 2 and 5 adjudicated in his favor in the 
decision rendered by the court on March 31, 1942. Copies of these two motions 
were served on the provincial fiscal who was at the same time notified that said 
motions would be heard on July 21, 1945. The hearing however was postponed to 
July 28, 1945.</p>
<p>On August 8, 1945, after the hearing of said two motions which was held in 
the absence of the original oppositors, the court issued an order declaring the 
registration case reconstituted and ordering the Chief of the General Land 
Registration Office to issue the final decree and title for lots Nos. 1, 2 and 
5, with all the improvements existing thereon, in favor of spouses Eugenio 
Paluay and Maria Pelobello, free from all liens and encumbrances.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1946, oppositor Celestino Bacudao, who came to Iloilo City 
for the first time since liberation to investigate the status of the ease, and 
came to know that not only a decision has already been rendered but that the 
case has been reconstituted and an order for the issuance of final decree 
issued, filed a motion for new trial with the end in view of securing their 
nullification, but later withdrew said motion and filed instead a petition for 
review on November 9, 1946 when he discovered that the title to the lots had 
already been issued in the name of the applicant. Oppositor Bacudao attached to 
this petition two affidavits of merit, one subscribed to by him and another by 
his counsel Claro Gasendo wherein they averred that they never received a copy 
of the decision rendered in the registration case, nor of the motion filed by 
the applicant for the reconstruction of said registration case. as required by 
law. The petition for review was submitted to the court on December 21, 1946, 
but it was never acted upon, and on August 9, 1947, oppositor Bacudao filed an 
amended petition for review praying for a similar relief, to which applicant 
Eugenio Paluay filed a written opposition.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1952, oppositor Bacudao filed a motion praying that his amended 
petition for review be set for hearing since the same has never been acted upon 
while the applicant is in possession of the property and has been enjoying it as 
owner to his prejudice. The applicant vigorously opposed this motion and on June 
19, 1952 the court denied the petition for review mainly on the ground that the 
movant failed to urge the court to act upon his petition for a period of more 
than five years. The court also found in addition that the claim of fraud of 
petitioner has no merit because it is not the fraud contemplated in Section 38 
of the Land Registration Act (Act 496). This is the order now subject of the 
present appeal.</p>
<p>The law which provides for the reconstitution of court records when they are 
lost or destroyed either totally or partially is Act No. 3110, Said Act provides 
that "after the occurrence of any fire or other public calamity resulting in the 
loss of all or part of the records of judicial proceedings" the clerk of court 
shall "send a notice by registered mail, among other officers, to the judge of 
the province "and all lawyers who may be "interested" in the proceedings 
(section 1), and upon receipt of such notice, the court shall issue a general 
notice which shall be addressed and sent by registered mail to said lawyers and 
to such other persons as might be interested advising them of the destruction of 
the records. This notice shall be published in the Official Gazette and in one 
of the newspapers of wide circulation in the province once a week for four 
consecutive Weeks (section 2). Said Act likewise provides that any interested 
party, or his counsel, shall appear and file within thirty days after having 
been notified of the destruction as above stated, an application for the 
reconstitution of the record of said case, "and the clerk of the court, upon 
receiving such application, shall send notice to other parties interested, or 
their counsels, of the day, hour, and place when the court will proceed to the 
reconstitution." (Section 3).</p>
<p>The foregoing in brief is the procedure laid down by law for the 
reconstitution of a court record in case of loss or destruction. Has this 
procedure been followed in the present case?</p>
<p>It is true that the clerk of court, soon after liberation, sent a notice to 
the judge then presiding the Court of First Instance of Iloilo informing him of 
the destruction of all court records in the province and that, acting thereon, 
the judge immediately issued an order for their reconstitution which was 
published in two newspapers of general circulation in the City of Iloilo once a 
week for six months. This is a substantial compliance with the law even if it 
does not appear that no notice of the destruction was ever served by registered 
mail to all the lawyers or persons who appear to be interested in the cases 
affected. But we notice that the applicant herein, Eugenio Paluay, in filing his 
application for reconstitution of the present registration case, merely served a 
copy thereof on the provincial fiscal, and not on the oppositors of record, or 
their counsel. Neither does it appear, that the clerk of court, upon receiving 
such application, has sent a notice to all interested parties therein, or their 
counsel, of the date, hour and place of hearing of the petition for 
reconstitution. The only thing that the record discloses is that the applicant 
only notified the provincial fiscal of the date and hour of the hearing, and 
when this was postponed, the court notified the provincial fiscal and the 
applicant of the postponement (pages 3, 5, and 11, Record on Appeal). Had the 
applicant sent a copy of his petition for reconstitution to the oppositors or 
their counsel in order that they may be notified of the date and place of 
hearing thereof, even if the clerk of court had not notified said oppositors or 
their counsel of the date of hearing, the action of the applicant would have 
been a substantial compliance with the law for in that case the oppositors could 
not be heard to complain of lack of service of the requisite notice regarding 
the hearing of the petition for reconstitution. But here both notices are 
conspicuously absent with the result that the oppositors were not given their 
day in court. The hearing for the reconstitution took place in their absence, 
and they only came to know of the action taken months later, or after the 
expiration of the period within which they could appeal from the order of 
reconstitution. This is a substantial error which should be corrected because it 
affected adversely the rights of the oppositors.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of the requisite notice as above adverted to, the hearing 
of the motion for reconstitution took place at the back of the oppositors and so 
only the movant was able to present his evidence. And so it is not strange that 
in the order of the court there should appear a statement to the effect "that 
all the parties concerned in the case were duly notified and facilitated copies 
of the aforesaid decision of the court", which fact is precisely disputed by the 
oppositors.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that in the first petition for review presented by 
oppositors they attached two affidavits of merit wherein they averred that they 
had never received a copy of the decision of the court because at that time 
there was already a state of confusion in the Island of Panay in view of the 
impending advance of Japanese forces. Because of their inability to appear, for 
lack of the requisite notice, they were not able to prove this allegation. This 
is a part of due process, because if it turns out that they have never been 
notified of the decision, they would have been deprived of the right to appeal 
within the reglementary period, or of such remedy as they may avail of to 
protect their interest. Since they were not present when the hearing for the 
reconstitution took place, nor were they notified of the order of the Court of 
August 8, 1945, they cannot therefore be bound by the finding that they were 
furnished with a copy of the decisions of the court on the merits.</p>
<p>There is merit in the contention that the claim of fraud alleged by the 
oppositors in their two petitions for review is not the fraud contemplated in 
Section 38 of the Land Registration Act (Government of the Philippine Island 
<em>vs</em>. Tombie Triño, 50 Phil., 708; Ruiz <em>vs</em>. Lacsamana, 32 Phil, 
653), because that fraud is merely predicated on the lack of notice of the 
petition for reconstitution and the failure to receive a copy of the decision on 
the merits, being matters that have taken place not before or during the trial, 
but subsequent thereto. But we are not concerned here with the review of the 
original decision but of the final decree which was ordered issued by the court 
after the ex-parte hearing of the petition for reconstitution, and, in our 
opinion, the alleged fraud claimed by the oppositors which consists in the 
deliberate failure of the applicant to notify them of the hearing, may serve as 
enough ground to justify the review, it being an undisputed fact that because of 
such failure or <em>of the lack of notice required by law</em> they were 
deprived of their day in court. The lower court, for that reason, should have 
set aside the order of reconstitution and should have set the motion anew giving 
the oppositors an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p>Capital is made of the fact that oppositors failed to urge the court to act 
on their two petitions for review within a reasonable time and only did so after 
the lapse of five years, an attitude which, it is claimed, indicates abandonment 
or lack of interest on their part and which in itself may justify denial of the 
relief, but we find that the cause of the delay cannot be entirely attributed to 
oppositors it appearing that they set for hearing the first petition on two 
occasions and the court failed to take action thereon. The second petition is 
but a reiteration of the first with a slight modification as to the interest of 
the parties, and while it was not set for hearing, copy thereof was served on 
the applicant. The court also failed to take action on this petition. We feel 
that it is unfair to dismiss these two petitions simply because they were not 
acted upon by the court in due time. This delay or inaction cannot entirely be 
attributed to oppositors.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the court hereby sets aside the order of the lower court of June 
19,1952, as well as its order of August 8, 1945, and orders that this case be 
remanded to the lower court in order that a new hearing may be had, with notice 
to all parties, relative to the reconstitution of the record of this case, for 
the purpose merely of giving the oppositors an opportunity to present their 
evidence. In the meantime, the validity of the final decree issued by the 
General Land Registration Office and of the Original Certificate of Title No. 
69243 issued by the Register of Deeds of Iloilo should be held subject to the 
outcome of the rehearing.</p>
<p>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em> and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Orders set aside; case remanded for new trial.</em></p></div>
