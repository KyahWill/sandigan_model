				G.R. No. L-1442, August 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>MIGUEL R. MATEO, PETITIONER, VS. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND MANUEL BORJA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The respondent Manuel Borja is an operator of a transportation 
service between Dampalit (Malabon, Rizal) and Divisoria (City of Manila) by 
virtue of an emergent certificate of public convenience. He filed an application 
with the Public Service Commission for authority to add to his Equipment four 
more buses, to make additional trips, and to extend his line from Malabon to 
Santa Cruz, Manila. The petitioner Miguel R. Mateo and the Pasay Transportation 
Company opposed the application. After hearing, the Public Service Commission 
granted the application, subject to the conditions set forth in the decision. 
This is sought to be reversed by the petitioner Miguel R. Mateo.
<p align="justify">After examining the record we are convinced that there is ample 
evidence to support the appealed decision. We have no doubt that the application 
of respondent Manuel Borja would promote the convenience of travelling public on 
the line in question, it appearing that (1) while the petitioner Miguel R. Mateo 
had before the war 5l Buses, actually he is operating only 17 buses; (2) while 
before the war about 600 carretelas were operating on the line in question, 
there is now only an insignificant number of said means of travel; (3) the 
street car service maintained fey the Manila Electric Company before the war, is 
no longer in existence; (4) the population of Malabon has increased from less 
than 20,000 before the war, to nearly 40,000 at present; (5) as a matter of 
fact, the petitioner Miguel R. Mateo is himself desirous of adding to his 
present equipment five more units.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the decision of the Public Service Commission is 
affirmed, and it is so ordered with costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
