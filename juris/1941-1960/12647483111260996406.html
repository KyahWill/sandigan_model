But he now pleads for a modification of the sentence, contending that the lower court erred:<br><blockquote>"1. In not taking into consideration, as mitigating circumstances, the following facts: (1) voluntary surrender; (2) the fact that the accused has been and is being utilized as witness by the CIC in cases against Japanese soldiers under trial by the military commission; and (3) the fact that the accused helped and saved the lives of many civilians and soldiers from death in the hands of the Japanese;<br><br>"2. In making as a matter of set-off the plea of guilty entered by the defendant-appellant on the strength of the assurance that no death penalty would be imposed upon him;<br><br>"3. In considering, as aggravating circumstances, treachery, abuse of superiority, and unnecessary cruelty;<br><br>"4. In holding that the crime committed by the accused is a complex crime of treason with murder, rape and robbery;<br><br>"5. In sentencing the accused to death and to pay a fine of P20,000."<br></blockquote>Taking up first the fourth alleged error, we find merit in the contention that appellant should not have been convicted of the so-called "complex crime of treason with murder, robbery, and rape." The killings, robbery, and raping mentioned in the information are therein alleged not as specific offenses but as mere elements of the crime of treason for which the accused is being prosecuted. Being merged in and identified with the general charge, they can not be used in combination with treason to increase the penalty under article 48 of the Revised Penal Code. (People vs. Prieto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> L-399, January 29, 1948.) Appellant should, therefore, be held guilty of treason only.<br><br>Appellant's claim of voluntary surrender has not been satisfactorily proved. On the other hand, his admission that he was "taken" from the house of his mother by an agent of the CIC, is proof that he was in fact arrested. Where there has been actual arrest the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender cannot be invoked (People vs. Conwi,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 40 Off. Gaz. [14th Supp.], No. 23, p. 166; People vs. Siojo, 61 Phil. 307.)<br><br>The meritorious acts which appellant claims to have performed in aid of the CIC and his countrymen have not been established by satisfactory proof and may not in any event be considered as mitigating circumstances under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>There is nothing to the claim that appellant entered a plea of guilty on the assurance that he would not be sentenced to death. The claim is not supported by proof. On the other hand, it is denied by both the prosecution and the trial court, the latter stating in its order denying appellant's motion for reconsideration that "No responsible judge can or would advance his opinion in connection with the decision to be rendered in any case before he has properly deliberated on the merits of the same."<br><br>There is, however, merit in the contention that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength should not have been considered. These circumstances are "by their nature, inherent in the offense of treason and may not be taken to aggravate the penalty." (People vs. Racaza, 82 Phil., 623.) But the facts alleged in the information show that appellant, in committing the crime of treason, deliberately augmented the wrong by being unnecessarily cruel to captured guerrilla suspects, subjecting them to barbarous forms of torture and finally putting them to death, and, as appears in count No. 18, he also chose to add ignominy to his treasonous act in arresting and maltreating a guerrilla suspect by stripping his wife of her clothes and then abusing her together with other Filipino girls. Clearly shown as they are by the allegations of the complaint and deemed admitted by appellant's plea of guilty, these two aggravating circumstances of unnecessary cruelty and ignominy may be appreciated against him. As this Court said in the case of People vs. Racaza, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.<br><blockquote>"But the law does abhor inhumanity and the abuse of strength to commit acts unnecessary to the commission of treason. There is no incompatibility between treason and decent, human treatment of prisoners. Rapes, wanton robbery for personal gain, and other forms of cruelties are condemned and their perpetration will be regarded as aggravating circumstances of ignominy and of deliberately augmenting unnecessary wrongs to the main criminal objective under paragraphs 17 and 21 of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code. The atrocities above mentioned, of which the appellant is beyond doubt guilty, fall within the terms of the above paragraphs.<br><br>"For the very reason that premeditation, treachery and use of superior strength are absorbed in treason characterized by killings, the killings themselves and other accompanying crimes should be taken into consideration for measuring the degree and gravity of criminal responsibility irrespective of the manner in which they were committed. Were not this the rule, treason, the highest crime known to law, would confer on its perpetrators advantages that are denied simple murderers. To avoid such incongruity and injustice, the penalty in treason will be adapted, within the range provided in the Revised Penal Code, to the danger and harm to which the culprit has exposed his country and his people and to the wrongs and injuries that resulted from his deed. The letter and pervading spirit of the Revised Penal Code adjust penalties to the perversity of the mind that conceived and carried the crime into execution. Where the system of graduating penalties by the prescribed standards is inapplicable, as in the case of homicides connected with treason, the method of analogies to fit the punishment with the enormity of the offense may be summoned to the service of justice and consistency and in furtherance of the law's aims."<br></blockquote>The penalty prescribed for the crime of treason <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> to death and a fine of not to exceed P20,000. Giving the appellant the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt, but appreciating against him the aggravating circumstances of ignominy and unnecessary cruelty, the said penalty should be imposed in its maximum. But since five members of this Court are opposed to the imposition of the death penalty in this case, the appellant can only be sentenced to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and a fine of P20,000.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment below is modified in the sense that the appellant is declared guilty of treason and sentenced to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and to pay a fine of P20,000, with costs in this instance <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Moran, C.
