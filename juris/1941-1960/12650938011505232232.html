				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Leonardo&nbsp; Alia, who had been hired by petitioner company&nbsp; to&nbsp; mend&nbsp; sugar sacks at P4.00 a day, was injured while engaged in that work on board a freighter on March 19,&nbsp; 1954 when a sack of sugar&nbsp; fell on him as it was being hoisted in a cargo net into the ship's hold.&nbsp; Examined by both the company physician and the medical officer of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission, he was&nbsp; found to have&nbsp; suffered "fracture of the <i>pubis&nbsp; ischium</i> and&nbsp; slight bladder injury."&nbsp; He was given free medicine and medical treatment in the company hospital until his discharge there from&nbsp; on May 13, 1954, and for the time he&nbsp; was totally disabled for work—31% weeks—he was&nbsp; paid by the company&nbsp; a compensation&nbsp; equivalent to 60 %&nbsp; of&nbsp; his average weekly wages.&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp; still being paid such compensation, he filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission on August of that same year notice of injury and claim for additional compensation.&nbsp; At first&nbsp; the Commissioner declared&nbsp; him entitled (1) to medical&nbsp; supplies and hospital services, (2) to 60% of his average weekly wages for the 31-6/7 weeks he was incapacitated for labor,&nbsp; or P458.74, as&nbsp; compensation for temporary total&nbsp; disability, and&nbsp; (3) to 50% of 60% of his average weekly wages for 208 weeks, or P1,497.60, as compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; permanent&nbsp; partial disability.&nbsp;&nbsp; But upon reconsideration,&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; reduced the compensation for permanent&nbsp; partial&nbsp; disability to 50% of&nbsp; 50 %&nbsp; of the laborer's weekly wages for 208 weeks, or P1,248.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not satisfied with this reduction, the company brought the case here for review by certiorari, contending that the compensation awarded for permanent partial disability was excessive.<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; company claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; disability suffered by the injured employee should not be considered permanent because the medical certificate&nbsp; dated September 9, 1955, issued jointly&nbsp; by its physician&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission's&nbsp; own medical officer does not say so, while on the other hand the statement made therein "that at&nbsp; present this laborer is disabled to the&nbsp; extent of 50%&nbsp; N.S.D." implies that his disability is only&nbsp; temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The claim is untenable.&nbsp; The certificate mentioned refers to the extent of the disability and not to its&nbsp; duration and does&nbsp; not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; impugn the finding&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Commissioner,&nbsp; based on the estimate of the medical officer of the Commission and supported by a certificate&nbsp; issued by the company's own physician&nbsp; that the disability is permanent.<br><br>It is further&nbsp; contended that if the injured laborer&nbsp; is at all entitled to compensation for a permanent <i>partial</i> disability such&nbsp; compensation should&nbsp; be&nbsp; payable only from November 1, 1955, the day following the&nbsp; cessation of his temporary total disability, to&nbsp; December 31, 1955,&nbsp; the day before he found&nbsp; a new&nbsp; employment&nbsp; with the Nasugbu Watchmen&nbsp; Agency at a higher salary.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this alleged new employment does not appear to have been&nbsp; duly established and, indeed, even supposing it to be true, that fact would not in itself necessarily&nbsp; affect&nbsp; the laborer's claim for compensation for a permanent partial&nbsp; disability.&nbsp;&nbsp; An injured laborer's incapacity for work is not to be measured solely by the wages he receives, or his earnings, after the injury, since the&nbsp; amount of such wages or earnings&nbsp; may be affected by&nbsp; various extraneous matters or factors&nbsp; (58 Am. Jur. 780-781)&nbsp; As noted in the&nbsp; American Law Reports, "there are a number of possible explanations of the fact that an&nbsp; employee who receives higher wages after an injury than what he earned before may still have suffered an impairment of earning capacity.&nbsp; Thus, it may indicate: (1) that the employee is the beneficiary of a mere gratuity and does not&nbsp; actually 'earn' his wages;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; employee,&nbsp; by education and&nbsp; training,&nbsp; has fitted himself for more remunerative employment; (3)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; employee works longer hours&nbsp; than&nbsp; he did before his injury, his hourly remuneration having increased; (4) that&nbsp; a general change&nbsp; in wage scales has taken place for&nbsp; the type of work or in the&nbsp; industry;&nbsp; (5) that the new wages are intended as an inducement to him to&nbsp; refrain from pursuing a claim;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; that the employee, before his&nbsp; injury,&nbsp; was younger or a minor;&nbsp; (7) that the employment&nbsp; in&nbsp; which the employee&nbsp; was&nbsp; employed after the injury was of uncertain&nbsp; duration."&nbsp; (149 ALE 438, citing cases.)<br><br>Citing section 17 of the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Act, which fixes a schedule of compensation for the loss of&nbsp; specified parts of the body or&nbsp; their use,&nbsp; petitioner company also claims that the award of compensation for 208&nbsp; weeks for a permanent partial&nbsp; disability is excessive "for the reason", so it says, "that the compensation for disabilities which arise from losses&nbsp; of parts of the body where are more important to&nbsp; the employee than a bone in the pelvic wing is&nbsp; payable for a relatively&nbsp; shorter period."&nbsp; Again, we find&nbsp; the contention&nbsp; without&nbsp; merit.&nbsp; The penultimate paragraph of section&nbsp; 18&nbsp; of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Act,&nbsp; relied&nbsp; upon by the Commissioner in awarding compensation for a permanent partial disability to the herein injured employee reads:<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; all other cases of&nbsp; this kind of disability not mentioned in other sections of this Act, the compensation shall be fifty <i>per&nbsp; centum</i> of the difference between the average weekly wages of the injured person and his&nbsp; subsequent earning capacity in these same or&nbsp; some other employment,&nbsp; payable while the&nbsp; partial&nbsp; disability lasts; but subject to reconsideration of the degree of impairment by the Commissioner at the request of an interested party: <i>Provided, however</i>, that the weekly payment shall in no case be continued for period longer than&nbsp; two hundred&nbsp; and&nbsp; eight weeks."</blockquote>The applicability of the above provision to the kind of injury sustained in this case in not disputed, and the provision, as will be noted, authorizes a maximum of 208 weeks' compensation for such&nbsp; injury.&nbsp; The period may be longer than those&nbsp; authorized for more serious injuries under section 17,&nbsp; but from this&nbsp; it&nbsp; does not necessarily follow that the injured laborer will&nbsp; receive more compensation if he is granted&nbsp; a longer period&nbsp; under&nbsp; the above provision of section 18 than what he will get for a lesser period under section 17.&nbsp;&nbsp; For whereas under section 17 the compensation allowed&nbsp; is&nbsp; 50%&nbsp; of his&nbsp; average weekly wages,&nbsp; under the above-quoted paragraph of section 18&nbsp; the compensation authorized&nbsp; is only 50%&nbsp; of the difference between his ave- rage weekly wages before the injury and his subsequent earning&nbsp; capacity in the same or some other employment.<br><br>As to the contention&nbsp; that the compensation for temporary total&nbsp; disability&nbsp; already paid to the&nbsp; employee should be deducted from his compensation for permanent partial disability, it is&nbsp; now settled that an injured employee may recover compensation for both temporary total and permanent partial disability.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; was said by this Court in the case of Cañete vs. Insular Lumber Co., 61 Phil. 592—<br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of&nbsp; the law in allowing compensation during temporary disability is to compensate the laborer for what he might have earned&nbsp; during the period of the treatment of his&nbsp; injury.&nbsp; On the other hand the object of the law in granting compensation for a permanent disability is to compensate&nbsp; the injured laborer for tile actual&nbsp; and permanent loss of a member of the body.<br><br>"In&nbsp; other&nbsp; jurisdiction where&nbsp; the workmen's&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; acts provide compensation for different&nbsp; disabilities resulting from an injury, covered by said acts,&nbsp; the court have consistently held that tho injured workman is entitled to the compensation provided for&nbsp; each disability.<br><br>" 'Temporary, as distinguished from permanent, disability, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, is a condition that, exists until the injured workman is as far restored as the permanent character of the injuries will permit.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, where, after the period of temporary total disability had ceased, an employee was found to be suffering from a permanent partial&nbsp; disability, he was entitled to an award based upon partial disability permanent in character.&nbsp; (Vishney vs. Empire Steel &amp; Iron Co., 87 N..I.L., 481; 95 At., 143)<br><br>" 'The claimant was awarded&nbsp; compensation for temporary&nbsp; total disability, based&nbsp; upon&nbsp; loss of&nbsp; earning capacity.&nbsp; Later, an award was made for permanent partial disability as provided&nbsp; in "other cases",&nbsp; based upon loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; earning capacity.&nbsp; The employer&nbsp; contended that&nbsp; since both awards were based upon&nbsp; a&nbsp; loss&nbsp; of earning capacity, he&nbsp; would be given credit for the compensation paid under the temporary total disability&nbsp; award.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court held&nbsp; the intent of the compensation law was that the claimant was entitled to the prior award&nbsp; for&nbsp; temporary total disability in addition to any&nbsp; sum paid for permanent partial&nbsp; disability/&nbsp; (Simpson&nbsp; Fell Oil Co.&nbsp; vs. Tucker&nbsp; (OH.)&nbsp; 12 P. (2)&nbsp; 529 June, 1932.)." </blockquote>The above&nbsp; ruling was reiterated in the case of Yarcia vs. Philipipne Education Co.&nbsp; and Elser, 62 Phil. 634, and&nbsp; we now see no reason for&nbsp; repudiating it.<br><br>With respect to the claim that the combined total of&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of compensation for temporary total disability and that for permanent partial disability in this case should not exceed&nbsp; 208 weeks, it will be noted that while the provisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Act covering&nbsp; the&nbsp; other kinds of disability limit the total compensable&nbsp; period to&nbsp; 208 weeks,&nbsp; section 18, which is the one applicable in the present case, contains no such limitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact the last paragraph thereof provides that award may be reopened and modified "with a view to extending,&nbsp; if necessary, the period of compensation"&nbsp; provided the total compensation to be paid does not exceed&nbsp; P4,000.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
