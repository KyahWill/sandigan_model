				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present appeal concerns a&nbsp; review of an order entered by the Court of First Instance of Cavite on June 12, 1953 which dismisses the complaint in&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 5113 instituted to obtain from&nbsp; the court a declaratory relief on certain&nbsp; matters pleaded therein while&nbsp; it grants the plea prayed for in Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 4606 of the same court for withdrawal of Original Certificate of Title No. 114 in order that the Register of Deeds may effect the registration of the document of consolidation&nbsp; of ownership and issuance of the necessary title in favor of the winning party. Another order appealed from is that of August 26, 1953, but, being&nbsp; merely corollary, discussion thereof is deemed unnecessary.<br><br>For a clear&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; of the issues raised&nbsp; herein, it is necessary to make a brief statement&nbsp; of the factual background and the different steps taken by the parties leading&nbsp; to the issuance of the order subject of the present review.<br><br>On April 10,&nbsp; 1948, appellant&nbsp; instituted in the Court of First Instance of Cavite&nbsp; an action for the&nbsp; annulment of a certain contract of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro&nbsp;</span> (Civil Case No. 4606).&nbsp; On May 11,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; the trial court rendered a decision&nbsp; declaring the contract valid and absolving appellee of.the complaint.&nbsp; After&nbsp; a motion to set aside judgment and a motion for new trial filed by appellant were denied by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court, appellant&nbsp; brought the case on appeal to the Supreme&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 23,&nbsp; 1951, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision appealed from particularly with regard to the&nbsp; validity of the contract which is disputed by&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the&nbsp; two motions for reconsideration , filed by&nbsp; appellant were denied,&nbsp; the, decision&nbsp; became final and executory and the record was returned to the court of origin; but,&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 8, 1951, appellant initiated the present case for declaratory relief.&nbsp; Considering that this action is purposeless because, while outwardly ita aim is to seek a declaratory relief on certain matters&nbsp; but in effect its purpose is to nullify the judgment rendered in the previous ease (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 4606)&nbsp; which was affirmed by the Supreme Court (G. R. No. L-3278),<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*&nbsp; </span>appellee filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the case states no cause of&nbsp; action.&nbsp; In the meantime, appellee moved to withdraw the original of Title No. 114 which was presented in the case as evidence in&nbsp; order that his ownership may be consolidated and a&nbsp; new title&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in his name it appearing that that case has been finally terminated (Civil Case No. 4606).&nbsp; The trial court, acting on the two motions, entered&nbsp; an&nbsp; order on June&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1953 granting&nbsp; the motion to dismiss&nbsp; and allowing the withdrawal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original title as already adverted to in the early, part of this decision.<br><br>The case was originally taken to the Court of Appeals wherein appellant&nbsp; assigned nine errors aa allegedly committed by the trial court but, after a cursory&nbsp; reading of the errors assigned, that court certified the case to us&nbsp; on the ground that the questions to be resolved&nbsp; are&nbsp; purely of law.<br><br>The purpose of the case which gave rise to the present appeal is avowedly for&nbsp; declaratory relief instituted under Section 1, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court which provides that&nbsp; "Any person&nbsp; interested under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected by a statute or ordinance, may bring&nbsp; an action to determine any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or statute and for a declaration of his rights or duties thereunder."&nbsp;&nbsp; And, it is claimed, this case comes under its purview because its purpose is to obtain a clarification of the decision of this Court in G. R.&nbsp; No. L-3278 which in the opinion of appellant, is vague and susceptible of double interpretation.&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; contends that&nbsp; the words&nbsp; "other&nbsp; written instrument" should be&nbsp; interpreted as including a court&nbsp; decision regardless of whether it&nbsp; is final, in character or&nbsp; otherwise. <br><br>We do not subscribe to the foregoing view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, a court decision cannot be interpreted&nbsp; as included within the purview of the words "other&nbsp; written instrument",&nbsp; as contended by&nbsp; appellant; for the&nbsp; simple&nbsp; reason that the Rules of Court already provide for the ways by which an ambiguous or&nbsp; doubtful decision may be corrected or clarified without need of resorting to the expedient prescribed by Rule 66.&nbsp; Thus, if a party is not agreeable to a decision either&nbsp; on questions&nbsp; of law, or of fact, he may me with the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; or&nbsp; a&nbsp; new trial in order&nbsp; that the defect may be corrected&nbsp; (Section 1, Rule 37).&nbsp; The&nbsp; same remedy may be pursued by a party with regard to a decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals or&nbsp; of the Supreme Court (section 1, Rule 54, section&nbsp; 1, Rule 55, in connection with section 1,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 58).&nbsp; A party may even seek relief from a judgment or order of an inferior court on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; of fraud,&nbsp; accident,&nbsp; mistake or excusable negligence if&nbsp; he avails of that remedy within the terms, prescribed by section ,1,&nbsp; Rule 88.&nbsp; Apparently, appellant has already availed&nbsp; of some of&nbsp; these&nbsp; legal remedies but that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; relief because&nbsp; his claim&nbsp; was&nbsp; found unmeritorious.<br><br>But the fundamental&nbsp; reason why the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; in the original case (G. R. No.&nbsp; L-3278)&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be the subject of declaratory relief is&nbsp; predicated upon the principle of <i>res judicata</i>&nbsp; which stamps the mark of .finality on&nbsp; a case which has been fully and&nbsp; definitely litigated1 in court. This prnciple is sound.&nbsp; It&nbsp; avoids multiplicity&nbsp; of actions. It commands that&nbsp; once a case is&nbsp; definitely litigated&nbsp; it should not&nbsp; be reopened.&nbsp; Thus, it has been&nbsp; held that "The foundation principle upon which the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> rests is&nbsp; that parties ought&nbsp; not to be permitted to litigate the same&nbsp; issue more&nbsp; than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined&nbsp; by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has&nbsp; been given, the judgment of the court,&nbsp; so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties, and those in privity with "them in law or estate. It is considered that a judgment presents evidence of the facts of so&nbsp; high a&nbsp; nature&nbsp; that&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; which could&nbsp; be proved by evidence <i>aliunde</i> would be sufficient to overcome it; and therefore it&nbsp; would be useless for&nbsp; a party against whom it can be&nbsp; properly applied to adduce any such evidence, and accordingly he is estopped or precluded by law from doing&nbsp; so.&nbsp; Such is the character of an estoppel&nbsp; by matter&nbsp; of record, as in&nbsp; case of an issue on&nbsp; a question of fact, judicially tried and decided."&nbsp; (Oberiano <i>vs.</i> Sobremesana, G.&nbsp; R, No. L-4622, May 30, 1952.)<br><br>We may mention in passing that the claim of appellant that the decision of this Court above referred to suffers from contradiction or inconsistency is rather&nbsp; equivocal for he mistook&nbsp; a restatement made&nbsp; therein of&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of the argument of appellant as a finding of fact made by the&nbsp; Court which is not&nbsp; the&nbsp; case.&nbsp; A more&nbsp; discerning appreciation&nbsp; of the decision would bear this out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; truth of the matter&nbsp; is that the Court concluded that the&nbsp; contract in dispute was valid as&nbsp; may be inferred from the portion of the decision which we quote:<br><blockquote>"The second or supplemental motion for a new trial, the denial of which is the subject of&nbsp; the fourth assignment&nbsp; of&nbsp; err added a now ground to the&nbsp; first&nbsp; motion for new trial and assailed the validity of the contract of sale&nbsp; for supposed lack of valuable consideration or&nbsp; because the consideration was 'false and illicit' <i>Here is what we make out&nbsp; of the plaintiff's line of reasoning is none too easy to understand:</i><br><br>"At the start and&nbsp; through the&nbsp; greater&nbsp; part of the Japanese occupation, the Japanese war notes were at par&nbsp; with the Commonwealth currency and were&nbsp; so understood and&nbsp; recognized both by the Philippine Executive Commission&nbsp; and the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic'&nbsp; By the contract in.question the par reduced the rate of exchange between the two. currencies from par one to ten.&nbsp; 'This&nbsp; reduction is&nbsp; contrary to the law or&nbsp; public policy promulgated by the Japanese Military&nbsp; authorities, or the Philippine Executive Commission.'&nbsp; Therefore the consideration was&nbsp; false and illicit and the contract was void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>, according to Articles 1255 1275, 1276, and&nbsp; 1278 of the Civil Code.<br><br>"What the&nbsp; plaintiff would want the court to&nbsp; do&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result of the contract's alleged nullity ig not stated or made clear.&nbsp; <i>However, that may be, the contract was not void.</i>&nbsp; It was licit for the parties to agree&nbsp; that the&nbsp; vendor should pay the purchaser&nbsp; only P2,000 instead of P20.000 as price of repurchase regardless of the currency received by the&nbsp; vendor.&nbsp; In this case the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is a full pledged lawyer and appeared below in his own behalf and filed the brief in this instance, drew&nbsp; the deed of sale himself,&nbsp; according to the lower court's finding, and the fixing of the ratio of ten to one between the Japanese war notes and the Commonwealth&nbsp; money must have&nbsp; been his own&nbsp; idea and certainly was&nbsp; for his own benefit.&nbsp; If the devaluation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; money&nbsp; bothered&nbsp; the plaintiff's conscience, there was no&nbsp; law to prevent him from redeeming the land&nbsp; for P20;000, or P15,000 which&nbsp; he&nbsp; admitted having&nbsp; received." (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>With regard to the portion of the order which&nbsp; allows the withdrawal of the. original certificate of title&nbsp; in order that the Register of Deeds may&nbsp; effect the&nbsp; consolidation of ownership and issuance of&nbsp; a new title in favor of&nbsp; appellee as requested, we do not also find any justification for its reversal, as we are urged, it appearing that the&nbsp; decision in the original case (Civil Case No. 4606) has become final and executory and no&nbsp; further&nbsp; step&nbsp; need be taken therein affecting the equities of the parties.&nbsp; The case is&nbsp; closed, and&nbsp; no&nbsp; reason is&nbsp; seen why the evidence that has been presented cannot be&nbsp; withdrawn.<br><br>Finding no&nbsp; merit in this appeal, we&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirm&nbsp; the order appealed from, with&nbsp; costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
