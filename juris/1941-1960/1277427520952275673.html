				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal by koppel (Philippines), Inc., from the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila in civil case No. 51218 of said court 
dismissing said corporation's complaint for the recovery of the sum of 
P64,122.51 which it had paid under protest to the Collector of Internal Revenue 
on October 30, 1936, as merchant sales tax. The main facts of the case were 
stipulated in the court below as follows"</p>
<p align="center">"AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now come the plaintiff by Attorney Eulogio P. Revilla and the defendant by 
the Solicitor General and undersigned Assistant Attorney of the Bureau of 
Justice and, with leave of this Honorable Court, hereby respectfully stipulated 
and agree to the following facts, to wit:</p>
<p>"I. That plaintiff is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by 
virtue of the laws of the Philippines, with principal office therein at the city 
of Manila, the capital stock of which is divided into one thousand (1,000) 
shares of P100 each. The Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company, a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, 
United States of America, and not licensed to do business in the Philippines, 
owned nine hundred and ninety-five (995) shares out of the total capital stock 
of the plaintiff from the year 1928 up to and including the year 1936, and the 
remaining five (5) shares only were and are owned one each by officers of the 
plaintiff corporation.</p>
<p>"II. That plaintiff, at all times material to this case, was and now is duly 
licensed to engaged in business as a merchant and commercial broker in the 
Philippines; and was and is the holder of the corresponding merchant's and 
commercial broker's privilege tax receipts.</p>
<p>"III. That the defendant Collector of Internal Revenue is now Mr. Bibiano L, 
Meer in lieu of Mr. Alfredo L. Yatco.</p>
<p>"IV. That during the period from January 1, 1929, up to and including 
December 31, 1932, plaintiff transacted business in the Philippines in the 
following manner, with the exception of the transactions which are described in 
paragraphs V and VI of this stipulation:</p>
<p>"When a local buyer was interested in the purchase of railway materials) 
machinery, and supplies, it asked for price quotations from plaintiff. A typical 
form of such request is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit A. 
(Exhibit A represents typical transactions arising from written requests for 
quotations, while Exhibit B to G, inclusive, are typical transactions arising 
from verbal requests for quotation.) Plaintiff then cabled for the quotation 
desired from Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. A sample of the 
pertinent cable is hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit B. Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company answered by cable quoting its cost price, 
usually A C. I. F. Manila cost price, which was later followed by a letter of 
confirmation. A sample of the said cable quotation and of the letter of 
confirmation are hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibits C and C-l. 
Plaintiff, however, quoted to the purchaser a selling price above the figures 
quoted by Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. Copy of the plaintiff's 
letter to purchaser is hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit D. On 
the basis of these quotations, orders were placed by the local purchasers, 
copies of which orders are hereto attached as Exhibit E and E-1.</p>
<p>"'A cable was then sent to Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company giving 
instructions to ship the merchandise to Manila forwarding the customer's order. 
Sample of said cable is hereto<br>attached as Exhibit F. The bills of lading 
were usually made to 'order' and indorsed in blank with notation to the effect 
that the buyer be notified of the shipment of the goods covered in the 
bills<br>of lading; commercial invoices were issued by Koppel Industiral Car and 
Equipment Company in the names of the purehasers and certificates of insurance 
were likewise issued in their names, or in the name of Koppel Industrial Car and 
Equipment Company but indorsed in blank and attached to drafts drawn by Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company on the purchasers, which were forwarded 
through foreign banks to local banks. Samples of the bills of lading 
are<br>hereto attached as Exhibits F-l, I-l, I-2 and I-3. Bills of lading, 
Exhibits I-l, I-2 and I-3, may equally have been employed, but said Exhibits 
I-l, I-2, and I-3 have no connection with the transaction covered by Exhibits B 
to G, inclusive. The purchasers secured the shipping papers by arrangement with 
the banks, and thereupon received and cleared the shipments. If the merchandise 
were of European origin, and if there was not sufficient time to forward the 
documents necessary for clearance, through foreign banks to local banks, to the 
purchasers, the Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company did, in many cases, 
send the documents directly from Europe to plaintiff with instructions to turn 
these documents over to the purchasers. In many cases, where sale was effected 
on the basis of C. I. P. Manila, duty paid, plaintiff advanced the sums required 
for the payment of the duty, and these sums, so advanced, were in every case 
reimbursed to plaintiff by Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. The 
price were payable by drafts agreed upon in each case and drawn by Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company on the respective purchasers through local 
banks, and payments were made to the banks by the purchasers on presentation and 
delivery to them of the above-mentioned shipping documents or copies thereof. A 
sample of said drafts is hereto attached as Exhibit G. Plaintiff received by way 
of compensation a percentage of the profits realized on the above transactions 
as fixed in paragraph 6 of the plaintiff's contract with Koppel Industrial Car 
and Equipment Company, which contract is hereto attached as Exhibit H, and 
suffered its corresponding share in the losses resulting from some of the 
transactions.</p>
<p>"'That the total gross sales from January 1, 1929, up to and including 
Decembar 31, 1932, effected in the foregoing manner and under the above 
specified conditions, amount to P3,596,438.84.'</p>
<p>"V. That when a local sugar central was interested in the1 purchase of 
railway materials, machinery and supplies, it secured quotations from, and 
placed the corresponding orders with, the plaintiff in substantially the same 
manner as outlined in paragraph IV of this stipulation, with the only difference 
that the purchase orders which were agreed to by the central and the plaintiff 
are similar to the sample hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit I. 
Typical samples of the bills of lading covering the herein transaction are 
hereto attached and made a part hereto as Exhibit I-1, I-2, and I-3. The value 
of the sales carried out in the manner mentioned in this paragraph is 
P133,964.98.</p>
<p>"VI. That sometime in February, 1929, Miguel J. Ossorio, of Manila, 
Philippines, placed an option with Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company, 
through plaintiff, to purchase within three months a pair of Atlas-Diesel Marine 
Engines. Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company purchased said Diesel 
engines in Stockholm, Sweden, for $16,508.32. The suppliers drew a draft for the 
amount of $16,508.32 on the Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company, which 
paid the amount covered by the draft. Later, Miguel J. Ossorio definitely called 
the deal off, and as Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company could not ship 
to or draw on said Mr. Miguel J. Ossorio, it in turn drew another draft on 
plaintiff for the same<br>amount at six months sight, with the understanding 
that Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company would reimburse plaintiff when 
said engines were disposed of. Plaintiff honored the draft and debited the said 
sum of P16,508.32 to merchandise account. The engines were left stored at 
Stockholm, Sweden. On April 1, 1930, a new local buyer, Mr. Cesar Barrios, of 
Iloilo, Philippines, was found and the same engines were sold to him for $21,000 
(P42,000) C. I. F. Hongkong. The engines where shipped to Hongkong and a draft 
for $21,000 was drawn by Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company on Mr. 
Cesar Barrios. After the draft was fully paid by Mr. Barrios, Koppel Industrial 
Car and Equipment Company reimbursed plaintiff with cost price of $16,508.32 and 
credited it with $1,152.95 as its share of the profit on the transaction. 
Exhibits J and J-1 are herewith attached and made integral parts of this 
stipulation with particular reference to paragraph VI hereof.</p>
<p>"VIII. That plaintiff's share in the profits realized out of these 
transactions described in paragraph IV, V, and VI hereof totaling P3,772,403.82, 
amounts to P132.201.30; and that plaintiff within the time provided by law 
returned the aforesaid amount of P132,201.30 for the purpose of the commercial 
broker's 4 per cent tax and paid thereon the sum of P5,288.05 as such tax.</p>
<p>"VIII. That defendant demanded of the plaintiff the sum of P64,122.51 as the 
merchants' sales tax of 1½ per cent on the<br>amount of 
P3,772,403.82, representing the total gross value of the sales mentioned in 
paragraphs IV, V, and VI hereof, including the 25 per cent surcharge for the 
late payment of the said tax, which tax and surcharge were determined after the 
amount of P5,288.05 mentioned in paragraph VI hereof was deducted.</p>
<p>"IX. That plaintiff, on October 30, 1936, paid under protest said sum of 
P64,122.51 in order to avoid further penalties, levy and distraint 
proceedings.</p>
<p>"X. That defendant, on November 10, 1936, overruled plaintiff's protest, and 
defendant has failed and refused and still fails and refuses, notwithstanding 
demands by plaintiff, to return to the plaintiff said sum of P64,122.51 or any 
part thereof.</p>

<p>Both parties adduced some oral evidence in clarification of or addition to 
their agreed statement of facts. A preponderance of evidence has established, 
besides the facts thus stipulated, the<br>following:</p>
<p>(a) The shares of stock of plaintiff corporation were and are all owned by 
Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company of Pennsylvania, U. S. A., except 
five which were necessary to qualify the Board of Directors of said plaintiff 
corporation;</p>
<p>(b) In the transactions involved herein the plaintiff corporation acted as 
the representative of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company only, and not 
as the agent of both the latter company and the respective local 
purchasers-plaintiff's principal witness, A. H. Bishop, its resident 
Vice-President, in his testimony invariably referred to Koppel Industrial Car 
snd Equipment Co. as "our principal" (t.s.n. pp. 10, 11, 12, 19, 75), except 
that at the bottom of page 10 to the top of page 11, the witness stated that 
they had "several principals" abroad but that "our principal abroad was, for the 
years in question, Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company", and on page 68, 
he testified that what he actually said was "* * * but our <em>principal 
principal abroad</em>" and not "our principal abroad"-as to which it is very 
significant that neither this witness nor any other gave the name of even a 
single other principal abroad of the plaintiff corporation;</p>
<p>(c) The plaintiff corporation bore alone incidental expenses as, for 
instance, cable expenses-not only those of its own cables but also those of its 
"principal" (t.s.n. pp. 52, 53);</p>
<p>(d) The plaintiff !sl!share in the profits" realized from the transactions in 
which it intervened was left vlatfttoalHy in the hands of Koppel Industrial Car 
and Equipment Company (t.s.n, p. 51);</p>
<p>(e) Where drafts were not paid by the purchasers, the local banks were 
instructed not to protest them but to refer them to plaintiff which was fully 
empowered by Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company to instruct the banks 
with regards to disposition of the drafts and documents (t.s.n., p. 50; Exhibit 
G);</p>
<p>(f) Where the goods were of European origin, consular invoices, bills of 
lading, and, in general, the documents necessary for clearance were sent 
directly to plaintiff (t.s.n., p. 14);</p>
<p>(g) If plaintiff had in stock the merchandise desired by local buyers it 
immediately filled the orders of such local buyers and made delivery in the 
Philippines without the necessity of cabling its principal in America either for 
price quotations or confirmation or rejection of that agreed upon between it and 
the buyer (t.s.n., pp. 39-43);</p>
<p>(h) Whenever the deliveries made by Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment 
Company were incomplete or insufficient to fill the local buyers' orders, 
plaintiff used to make good the deficiencies by deliveries from its own local 
stock, but in such cases it charged its principal only the actual cost of the 
merchandise thus delivered by it from its stock and in such transactions 
plaintiff did not realize any profit (t.s.n. pp. 53-54);</p>
<p>(i) The contracts of sale involved herein were all perfected in the 
Philippines.</p>
<p>Those described in paragraph IV of the Agreed Statement of Pacts went thru 
the following process: (1) "When a local buyer was interested in the purchase of 
railway materials, machinery, and supplies, it asked for price quotations from 
plaintiff"; (2) "Plaintiff then cabled for the quotation desired from Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company"; (3) "Plaintiff, however, quoted to the 
purchaser a selling price above the figures quoted by Koppel Industrial Car and 
Equipment Company"; (4) "On the basis of these quotations, orders were placed by 
the local purchasers * * *."</p>
<p>Those described in paragraph V of said agreed statement of facts were 
transacted "in substantially the same manner as outlined in paragraph IV."</p>
<p>As to the single transaction described in paragraph VI of the same agreed 
statement of facts, discarding the Ossorio option which anyway was called off, 
"On April 1, 1930, a new <em>local</em> buyer, Mr. Cesar Barrios, of <em>Iloilo, 
Philippines,</em> was found and the same engines <em>were sold to him</em> for 
$21,000 (P42,000) C. I. F. HongKong." (Italic supplied.)</p>
<p>(j) Exhibit H contains the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is clearly understood that the intent of this contract is that the broker 
shall perform only the functions of a broker as set forth above, and shall not 
take possession of any of the materials or equipment applying to said, orders or 
perform any acts or duties outside the scope of a brokers and in no sense shall 
this contract be construed as granting to the broker the power to represent the 
principal as its agent or to make commitments on its behalf."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Court of First Instance held for the defendant and dismissed plaintiff's 
complaint with cost to it.</p>
<p>Upon this appeal, seven errors are assigned to said judgment as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the court<em> a quo</em> erred in not holding that appellant is a 
domestic corporation distinct and separate from, and not a mere branch of Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Co.;</p>
<p>"2. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in ignoring the ruling of the Secretary of 
Finance, dated January 31, 1931, Exhibit M;</p>
<p>"3. The court <em>a quo </em>erred in not holding that the character of a 
broker is determined by the nature of the transaction and not by the basis or 
measure of his compensation;</p>
<p>"4. The court a quo erred in not holding that appellant acted as a commercial 
broker in the transactions covered under paragraph IV of the agreed statement of 
facts;</p>
<p>"5. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in not holding that appellant acted as a 
commercial broker in the transactions covered under paragraph V of the agreed 
statement of facts;</p>
<p>"6. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in not holding that appellant acted as a 
commercial broker in the sole transaction covered under paragraph VI of the 
agreed statement of facts;</p>
<p>"7. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in dismissing appellant' s 
complaint."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court found and held that Koppel (Philippines) Inc. is a mere dummy 
or branch ("hechura") of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. The lower 
court did not deny legal personality to Koppel (Philippines) Inc. for any and 
all purposes, but in effect its conclusion was that, in the transactions 
involved herein, the public interest and convenience would be defeated and what 
would amount to a tax evasion perpetrated, unless resort is had to the doctrine 
of "disregard, of the corporate fiction."</p>
<ol type="I"><li>
<p>In its first assignment of error appellant submits that the trial court erred 
in not holding that it is a domestic corporation distinct and separate from and 
not a mere branch of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. It contends 
that its corporate existence as a Philippine corporation can not be collaterally 
attacked and that the Government is estopped from so doing. As stated above, the 
lower court did not deny legal personality to appellant for any and all purpose, 
but held in effect that in the transactions involved in this case the public 
interest and convenience would be defeated and what would amount to a tax 
evasion perpetrated, unless resort is had to the doctrine of "disregard of the 
corporate fiction." In other words, in looking through the corporate form to the 
ultimate person or corporation behind that form, in the particular transactions 
which were involved in the case submitted to its determination and judgment, the 
court did so in order to prevent the contravention of the local internal revenue 
laws, and the perpetration of what would amount to a tax evasion, inasmuch as it 
considered-and in our opinion, correctly-that appellant Koppel (Philippines) 
Inc. was a mere branch or agency or dummy ("hechura") of Koppel Industrial Car 
and Equipment Co. The Court aid not hold that the corporate personality of 
Koppel (Philippines) Inc. would also be disregarded in other cases or for other 
purposes. It would have had no power to so hold.. The courts' action in this 
regard must be confined to the transactions involved in the case at bar "for the 
purpose of adjudging the rights and liabilities of the parties in the ease. They 
have no jurisdiction to do more." (1 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporation, 
Permanent ed., p. 134, section 41.)</p>
<p>A leading and much cited case puts it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If any general rule can be laid down, in the present state of authority, it 
is that a corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity as a general rule, 
and until sufficient reason to the contrary appears; but, when the notion of 
legal entity is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, 
or defend crime, the law will regard the corporation as an association of 
persons." (1 Fletcher Cyclopedia of Corporations [Permanent Edition], pp. 135, 
136; United States vs. Milwaukee Refrigeration Transit Co., 142 Fed., 247, 255, 
per Sanborn, J.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In his second special defense appellee alleges "that the plaintiff was and is 
in fact a branch or subsidiary of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Co., a 
Pennsylvania corporation not licensed to do business in the Philippines but 
actually doing business here thru the plaintiff; that the said foreign 
corporation holds 995 of the 1,000 shares of the plaintiff's capital stoc).c, 
the remaining five shares being held by the officers of the plaintiff herein in 
order to permit the incorporation thereof and to enable its aforesaid officers 
to act as directors of the plaintiff corporation; and<br>that plaintiff was 
organized as a Philippine corporation for the purpose of evading the payment by 
its parent foreign corporation of merchants' sales tax on the transactions 
involved in this case and others of similar nature."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By most courts the entity is normally regarded but is disregarded to prevent 
injustice, or the distortion or hiding of the truth, or to <em>let in a just 
defense</em>." (1 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporation, Permanent Edition, pp. 
139-140; italics supplied).</p>
<p>"Another rule is that, when the corporation is the mere1 alter ego, or 
business conduit of a person, it may be disregarded." (1 Fletcher., Cyclopedia 
of Corporation, Permanent Edition, p. 136).</p>
<p>Manifestly, the principle is the same whether the "person" be natural or 
artificial.</p>
<p>"A very numerous and growing class of cases wherein the corporate entity is 
disregarded is that wherein (it is so organized and controlled, and its affairs 
are so conducted, as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or 
adjunct of another corporation)." (1 Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporation Permanent 
ed., pp 154, 155.)</p>
<p>"While we recognize the legal principle that a corporation does not lose its 
entity by the ownership of the bulk or ever; the whole of its stock, by another 
corporation (Monongahela Co. <em>vs.</em> Pittsburg Co., 196 Pa. 25; 46 Atl. 99, 
79 Am. St. Rep. 685) yet it is equally well settilad'courts will look beyond the 
mere artificial personality which incorporation confers, and if necessary to 
work out equitable ends, will ignore corporate forms." (Colonial Trust Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Montello Brick Works, 172 Fed. 310.)</p>
<p>Where it appears that two business enterprises are owned, conducted and 
controlled by the same parties, both law and equity vail, when necessary to 
protect the rights of third persons, disregard the legal fiction that two 
corporations are distinct entities, and treat them as identical." (Abney vs. 
Belmont Country Club Properties, Inc., 279 Pac. 829).</p>
<p>"* * * the legal fiction of distinct corporate existence will be disregarded 
in a case where a corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are 
so conducted, as to make it merely an instrumentality or adjunct of another 
corporation." (Hanter vs. Baker Motor Vehicle Co., 190 Fed. 
665.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In United States vs. Lehigh Valley R. Co. (220 U. S. 257, 55 Law ed., 458, 
464), the Supreme Court of the United States disregarded the artificial 
personality of the subsidiary coal company in order to avoid that the parent 
corporation, the Lehigh Valley R. Co., should be able, through the!fiction of 
that personality, to evade the prohibition of the Hepburn Act against 
the<br>transportation by railroad companies of the articles and commodities 
described therein.</p>
<p>Chief Justice White, speaking for the court, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. Coming to discharge this duty it follows, in view of the express 
prohibitions of the commodities clause, it must be held that while the right of 
a railroad company as a stock-holder to use its; stock ownership for the purpose 
of a <em>bona fide</em> separate administration of the affairs of a corporation 
in which it has a stock interest may not be denied, the use of such stock 
ownership in substance for the purpose of destroying the entity of a producing, 
etc., corporation, and of commingling its affairs in administration with the 
affairs of the railroad company, so as to make the two corporations virtually 
one, brings the railroad company so voluntarily acting as to such producing, 
etc., corporation within the prohibitions of the commodities clause. In other 
words, that by operation at effect of the commodities clause there is a duty 
cast upon a railroad company proposing to carry in interestate commerce the 
product of a producing, etc., corporation in which it has a stock interest, not 
to abuse such power so as virtually to do <em>by indirection</em> that which the 
commodities clause prohibits-a duty which plainly would be violated by the 
unnecessary commingling of the affairs of the producing company with its own, so 
as to cause<br>them to be one and inseparable."</p></blockquote>
<p>Corroborative authorities can be cited in support of the same proposition, 
which we deem unnecessary to mention here.</p>
<p>From the facts hereinabove stated, as established by a preponderance of the 
evidence, particularly those narrated in paragraphs; <em>(a), (b), (c), (d), 
(e)</em>, <em>(f), (h), (i),</em> and <em>(j)</em> after the agreed statement of 
facts, we find that, in so far as the sales involved herein are concerned, 
Koppel (Philippines) Inc., and Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company are 
to all intents and purposes one and the same; or, to use another mode of 
expression, that, as regards those transactions, the former corporation is a 
mere branch, subsidiary or agency of the latter. To our mind, this is 
conclusively borne out by the fact, among others, that the amount of the 
so-called "share in the profits" of Koppel (Philippines) Inc. was ultimately 
left to the sole, unbridled control of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment 
Company. If, in their relations with each other, Koppel (Philippines) Inc. was 
considered and intended to function as a <em>bona fide</em> separate 
corporation, we can not conceive how this arrangement could have been adopted, 
for it there was any factor in its business as to which it would, in that case 
naturally have been opposed to being thus controlled, it must have been 
precisely the amount of <em>profit</em> which it could endeavor and hope to 
earn. No group of businessmen could be expected to organize a mercantile 
corporation-the ultimate end of which could only be profit-if the amount of that 
profit were to be subjected to such a unilateral control of another corporation, 
unless indeed the former has previously been designed by the incprporators to 
serve as a mere subsidiary, branch or agency of the latter. Evidently, Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company made use of its ownership of the 
overwhelming majority-99.5%-of the capital stock of the local corporation to 
control the operations of the latter to such an extent that it had the final say 
even as to how much should be allotted to said local entity in the so-called 
sharing in the profits. We can not overlook the fact that in the practical 
working of corporate organizations of the class to which these two entities 
belong, the holder or holders of the controlling part of the capital stock of 
the corporation, particularly where the control is determined by the virtual 
ownership of the totality of the shares, dominate not only the selection of the 
Board of Directors but, more often than not, also the action of that board, 
applying this to the instant case, we can not conceive how the Philippine 
corporation could effectively go against the policies, decisions, and desires of 
the American corporation with regard to the scheme which was devised through the 
instrumentality of the contract Exhibit H, as well as all the other details of 
the system, which wels adopted in order to avoid paying the per cent merchants' 
sales tax. Neither<br>can we conceive how the Philippine corporation could avoid 
following the directions of the American, corporation in every other transaction 
where they had both to intervene, in view of the fact that the American 
corporation held 99.5 per cent of the capital stock of the Philippine 
corporation. In the present instance, we note that Koppel (Philippines) Inc. was 
represented in the Philippines by its "resident Vice-President." This fact 
necessarily leads to the inference that the corporation had at least a 
Vice-Presidents and presumably also a President, who were not resident in the 
Philippines but in America, where the parent corporation is domiciled. If Koppel 
(Philippines) Inc. had been intended to operate as a regular domestic 
corporation in the Philippines, where it was formed, the record and the evidence 
do not disclose any reason why all its officers should not reside and perform 
their functions in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Other facts appearing from the evidence, and presently to be stated, 
strengthen our conclusion, because they can only be explained if the local 
entity is considered as a mere subsidiary, branch or agency of the parent 
organization. Plaintiff charged the parent corporation no more than actual 
cost-without profit whatsoever-for merchandise allegedly of its own to complete 
deficiencies of shipments made by said parent corporation (t.s.n., pp. 53-54-)-a 
fact which could not conceivably have been the case if plairtiff had acted in 
such transactions as an entirely independent entity doing business-for profit, 
of course-with the American concern. There has been no attempt even to explain, 
if the latter situation really obtained, why these two corporations should have 
thus departed from the ordinary course of business. Plaintiff was charged by the 
American corporation with the cost even of the letter's cable quotations-from 
aught that appears from the evidence, this can only be comprehended by 
considering plaintiff as such a subsidiary, branch or agency of the parent 
entity, in which case it would be perfectly understandable that for convenient 
accounting purposes and the easy determination of the profits or losses of the 
parent corporation's Philippine business, all expenses of its business in the 
Philippines should be charged against the, Philippine office and set off against 
its receipts, thus separating the accounts of said branch from those, which the 
central organization might have, for instance, in Sweden, and those which it 
might have in other countries. The reference to plaintiff by local banks, under 
a standing instruction of the parent corporation, of unpaid drafts drawn on 
Philippine customers by said parent corporation, whenever said customers 
dishonored thejdrafts, and the fact that the American corporation had previously 
advised said banks that plaintiff in those cases was "fully empowered to 
instruct (the banks) with regard to the disposition of the drafts and documents" 
(t.s.n., p. 50), in the absence of any other satisfactory explanation, naturally 
give rise to the inference1 that plaintiff was a subsidiary, branch or agency of 
the American, concern, rather than an independent corporation acting as a 
broker. For, without such positive explanation, this delegation of power is 
indicative of the relations between central and branch offices of the same 
business enterprise, with the latter acting under instructions already given by 
the former. Far from disclosing a real separation between the two entities, 
particularly in regard to the transactions in question, the evidence reveals 
such a commingling and interlacing of their activities as to render even 
incomprehensible certain accounting operations between them, except upon the 
basis that the Philippine corporation was to all intents and purposes a mere 
subsidiary, branch, or agency of the American parent entity. Only upon this 
basis can it be comprehended why it seems not to matter at all how much profit 
would be allocated to plaintiff, or even that no profit at all be so allocated 
to it, at any given time or after any given period.</p>
<p>As already stated above, under the evidence the sales in the Philippines of 
the railway materials, machinery and supplies imported here by Koppel Industrial 
Car and Equipment Company could have been as conveniently and efficiently 
transacted and handled-if not more so-had said corporation merely established a 
branch or agency in the Philippines and obtained license to do business locally; 
and if it had done so and said sales had been effected by such branch or agency, 
there seems to be no dispute that the per cent merchants' sales tax then in 
force would have been collectible. So far as we can discover, there would be 
only one, but very important, difference between the two schemes a difference in 
<em>tax liability</em> amounting to the respectable sum of P64,122.51 in this 
case. To allow the taxpayer now to deny this tax liability on the ground that 
the sales were made through another and distinct corporation, as alleged broker, 
when we have seen that this latter corporation is <em>virtually owned</em> by 
the former, or that they are practically one and the same, is to sanction a 
circumvention of our tax laws, and permit a tax evasion of no mean proportions 
and the consequent commission of a grave injustice to the Government. Not only 
this; it would allow the taxpayer to do <em>by indirection</em> what the tax 
laws prohibited to be done directly (non-payment of legitimate taxes), 
paraphrasing the United States Supreme Court in United States vs. Lehigh Valley 
R. Co., <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>The act of one corporation crediting or debiting the other for certain 
itec.s, expenses or even merchandise sold or disposed of, is perfectly 
compatible with the idea of the domestic entity being or acting as a mere 
branch, agency or subsidiary of the parent organisation. Such operations were 
called for any way by the exigencies or convenience of the entire business. 
Indeed, accounting operations such as these are inevitable, and have to be 
effected in the ordinary course of business, wherever the home office of a 
business enterprise extends its trade to another land through a branch office, 
or thru another scheme amounting to the same thing.</p>
<p>If plaintiff were to act as broker in the Philippines for any other 
corporation, entity or person, distinct from Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment 
Company, an entirely different question will arise,<br>which,however, we are not 
called upon, nor in a position, to decide.</p>
<p>As stated above, Exhibit H contains the following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is clearly understood that the intent of this contract is that the broker 
shall perform only the functions of a broker as set forth above, and shall not 
take possession of any of the materials or equipment applying to said orders or 
perform any acts or duties cutside the scope of a brokers and in no sense shall 
this contract be construed as granting to the broker the power to represent the 
principal as its agent or to make commitments on its behalf."</p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing paragraph, construed in the light of other facts noted 
elsewhere in this decision, betrays, we think, a deliberate intent,<br>through 
the medium of a scheme devised with great care, <em>to avoid</em> the payment of 
precisely the per cent merchants' sales tax in force in the Philippines before, 
at the time of, and after, the making of the said contract Exhibit H. If this 
were to be allowed, the payment of a tax, which directly could not have been 
avoided, could he evaded <em>by indirection</em>, consideration being had of the 
aforementioned peculiar relations between the said American and local 
corporations. Such evasion, involving as it would, a violation of the former 
Internal Revenue Law, would even fall within the penal sanction of section 2741 
of the Revised Administrative Code. Which only goes to show the illegality of 
the whole scheme. We are not here concerned with the impossibility of collecting 
the merchants' sales tax, as a mere incidental consequence of transactions legal 
in themselves and innocent in their purpose. We are dealing with a scheme the 
primary, not to say the sole, object of which is the evasion of the payment of 
such tax. <br>It is this aim of the scheme that makes it illegal.</p>
<p>We have said above that the contracts of sale involved herein were fell 
perfected in the Philippines. From the fects stipulated in paragraph IV of the 
agreed statement of facts, it clearly appears that the Philippine purchasers had 
to wait for Koppel Industrial Car<br>and Equipment Company to communicate its 
cost prices to Koppel (Philippines) Inc., and for the latter to make the 
definite price quotations, before placing their orders, wherever such price 
quotations from the American corporation were required. It is obvious that in 
those cases the contracts involved in the orders thus placed by the said 
purchasers with Koppel (Philippines) Inc.,<br>were perfected in the Philippines. 
In those cases where no such price quotations from the American corporation were 
needed of course, the sales were immediately perfected, locally. The sales 
effected in those cases described in paragraph V of the agreed statement of 
facts were, as expressed therein, transacted "in substantially the same manner 
as outlined in paragraph IV." Even the single transaction described in paragraph 
VI of the agreed statement of facts was also perfected in the Philippines, 
because the contracting parties were here and the consent of each was given 
here. While it is true that when the contract was thus perfected in the 
Philippines the pair of Atlas-Diesel Marine Engines were in Sweden and the 
agreement was to deliver them C. I. F. Hongkong, the contract of sale being 
consensual-perfected by mere consent-(Civil Code, Article 1445; 10 Manresa, 4th 
ed. p. 11), the location of the property and the place of delivery did not 
matter in the question of where the agreement was perfected.</p>
<p>In said paragraph VI, we read the following, as indicating where the contract 
was perfected, considering beforehand that one party, Koppel (Philippines) Inc. 
which in contemplation of law, as to that transaction, was the same Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Co., was in the Philippines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * on April 1, 1930 a new local buyer, Mr. Cesar, Barrios, of <em>Iloilo, 
Philippines</em> was found and the same engines <em>were sold to him</em> for 
$21,000 (P42,000) C. I. F. Hongkong * * * (Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the revenue law in force when the sales in question took place, the 
merchants' sales tax attached upon the happening of the respective sales of the 
"commodities, goods, wares, and merchandise" involved, and we are clearly of 
opiinion that such "sales" took place upon the perfection of the corresponding 
contracts. If such perfection took place in the Philippines, the merchants; 
sales tax<br>then in force here attached to the transactions.</p>
<p>Even if we should consider that the Philippine buyers in the cases covered by 
paragraphs IV and V of the agreed atatement of facts, contracted with Koppel 
Industrial Car and Equipment Company, we will arrive at the same final result. 
It can not be denied in that case that said American corporation contracted 
through Koppel (Philippines) Inc., which was in the Philippines. The real 
transaction in each case of sale, in final effect, begar with an offer of sale 
from the seller, said American corporation, thru its agent, the local 
corporation, of the railway materials, machinery, and supplies at the prices 
quoted, and perfected or completed by the acceptance of that offer by the local 
buyers when the latter, accepting those prices, placed their orders. The offer 
could not correctly be said to have been made by the local buyers when they 
asked for price quotations, for they could not rationally be taken to have bound 
themselves to buy before <em>knowing the prices</em>. And even if we should take 
into consideration the fact that the American corporation contracted, at least 
partly, through correspondence, according to article 54 of the Code of Commerce, 
the respective contracts were completed from the time of the acceptance by the 
local buyers, which happened in the Philippines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Contracts executed through correspondence shall be completed from the time 
an answer is made accepting the proposition or the conditions by which the 
latter may be modified." (Code of Commerce, article 54, italics supplied).</p>
<p>"A contract is as a rule considered as entered into at the place where the 
offer is accepted, or where the last act necessary to complete it is performed. 
So where delivery is regarded as essential to the completion of the contract, it 
is regarded as made at the place of delivery." (13 C. J. 580-81, section 
581.)</p>
<p>"(In the consensual contract of sale delivery is not needed for its 
perfection.)"</p></blockquote>
</li><li>Appellant's second assignment of error can be summarily disposed of. It is 
clear that the ruling of the Secretary of Finance, Exhibit M, was not 
binding upon the trial court, much less upon this tribunal, since the duty and 
power of interpreting the laws is primarily a function of the judiciary (Ortua 
vs. Singson Encarnacion, 59 Phil, 440, 444.) Plaintiff cannot be excused from 
abiding by this legal principle, nor can it properly be heard to say that it 
relied on the Secretary's ruling and that, therefore, the courts should not now 
apply an interpretation at variance therewith. The rule of stare decisis is 
undoubtedly entitled to more respect in the construction of statutes than the 
interpretations given by officers of the administrative branches of the 
government, even those entrusted with the administration of particular laws. But 
this court, in Philippine Trust Company vs. Mitchell (59 Phil., 30, 36), said: 
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The rule of <em>stare decisis</em> is entitled to respect. Stability 
in the law, particularly in the business field, is desirable. But idolatrous 
reverence for precedent, simply as precedent, no longer rules. More important 
than anything else is that the court should be right. * * *"</p></blockquote>
</li><li>In the view we take of the case, and after the disposition made above of the 
first assignment of error, it becomes unnecessary to make any specific ruling on 
the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error, all of which 
are necessarily disposed of adversely to appellant's contention. </li></ol>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs of both 
instances against appellant. So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, 
Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>We fully agree with the well-written decision penned by Mr. Justice Hilado in 
this case. We only wish to add that the ingenious device of organizing a 
subsidiary corporation, with the purpose of evading the payment of taxes, is not 
a new one. It is only one of the manifold manifestations of the shrewdness of 
the masterminds behind some powerful corporations who, without any oompuinction, 
do not stop at adopting any scheme by which the controlling capitalists may get 
even richer and richer, sometimes at government expense, sometimes by squeezing 
credulous or ignorant small shareholders, sometimes with the exploitation of the 
helpless public at large, and sometimes at great sacrifice of all the three 
entities.</p>
<p>The system of corporation combines, of holding and subsidiary corporations, 
of spreading and interlooking companies, has so well developed and has grown so 
powerful that even the wisest government had been unable to defend itself and 
protect the people from the<br>crushing tentacles of the moneyed octopuses. It 
is true that in the United States of America antitrusts laws were enacted but, 
notwithstanding their ability and wisdom, the Americans were unable to stave off 
the effects of the bankruptcy of the pyramid of holding and interlocking 
complies built around the tragic figure of Samuel Insull.</p>
<p>That Philippine Government, that Filipino consumers, that Filipino public at 
large, had already been victims of the evil effects of such a system has been 
conclusively proved in the scandalous illegalities and irregularities disclosed 
in the investigation made by the First National Assembly, through its Committee 
on Rate Reducing of Public Utilities. In said investigation, it was revealed 
that, by a system of holding and interlocking companies, by their manipulation 
of books of accounts, our government was defrauded of enormous amounts in taxes 
and millions of pesos were unjustly squeezed from the public.</p>
<p>It is high time that alarm be sounded so that our government and our public 
may avoid being further victimized and this country turned into a puppet at the 
mercy of moneyed tycoons who are not stopped by any scruple to attain their 
unquenchable thirstiness for more money and for power and domination. All 
liberal-minded people must fight not only against political imperialism, but 
also against economic or financial imperialism, in fact, against any kind of 
imperialism. The call for eternal vigilance must be heeded by all, including 
tribunals, if the survival of our people must not be jeopardized by artful 
corporations and unscrupulous financiers.</p>
