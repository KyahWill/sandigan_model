				<H3>THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF ILOCOS NORTE, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE JUDGES, CEFERINO DELOS SANTOS,VICENTE SANTIAGO, PATRICIO CENIZA, ZOILO HILARIO, BERNABE DE AQUINO AND LUIS ORTEGA,IN THEIR CAPACITIES AS MEMBERS OF THE SECOND GUERRILLA AMNESTY COMMISSION, AND JULIO ACOSTA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The herein respondent Julio Acosta was prosecuted in five cases 
for murder and in two cases for murder with arson. In due time he filed with the 
Second Guerrilla Amnesty Commission (for the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos 
Sur, Abraand La Union), consisting of respondent Judges Ceferino delos Santos, 
Vicente Santiago and Patricio Ceniza, a petition for amnesty under Proclamation 
No. 8 of the President of the Philippines dated September 7, 1946. After 
hearing, the Second Guerrilla Amnesty Commission rendered a decision, dated June 
9, 1947, and actually received by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of 
Ilocos Norte on November 12, 1947, sustaining the petition for amnesty and 
accordingly ordering the release of respondent Acosta. The herein petitioner, 
the Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos Norte, in his present special civil action for 
certiorari and mandamus, assails the validity of the decision, on the grounds 
(1) that it was rendered when respondent Judges Santos, Santiago and Ceniza had 
ceased to be members of the Commission, it being alleged that on June 5, 1947, 
the Secretary of Justice appointed new members for the Second Guerrilla Amnesty 
Commission; (2) that the decision took legal effect only on November 12, 1947, 
when it was received in the office of the clerk of Court of First Instance of 
Ilocos Norte, on which date respondent Judges Santos, Santiago and Ceniza were 
no longer members of the Commission; and (3) that the Commission was without 
jurisdiction to act on the application for amnesty of respondent Acosta because 
he did not admit the commission of the offenses charged against him. None of 
these grounds is tenable.
<p align="justify">As there is absolutely no showing that respondent Judges 
Santos, Santiago and Ceniza knew, when they rendered their decision on June 9, 
1947, that they had been replaced by other members in the Second Guerrilla 
Amnesty Commissionâ€”as a matter of fact, the petitioner admits that the new 
members held sessions in Laoag only in August, 1947, they may at least be 
considered as <em>de facto</em> members of said Commission on June 9, 1947. The 
validity of the decision cannot be affected by the fact that it was received in 
the clerk's office on November 12, 1947, because the Commission, unlike a 
regular and permanent Court of First Instance, does not technically have its own 
clerk of court with whom its judgments should be filed as required in section 1 
of Rule of Court 35. Moreover, we can well treat the letter of the 
Undersecretary of Justice to respondent Judge Ceferino de los Santos, dated July 
31, 1947, as sufficient authority for him and respondent Judges Santiago and 
Ceniza "to act on the cases submitted to the Commission." It is noteworthy that 
the letter expressly referred to the "Second Guerrilla Amnesty Commission, 
formerly composed of Judges Simeon Ramos, Ceferino de los Santos, Patricio 
Ceniza and Vicente Santiago."</p>
<p align="justify">In order to entitle a person to the benefits of the Amnesty 
Proclamation of September 7, 1946, it is not necessary that he should, as a 
condition precedent or <em>sine qua non</em>, admit having committed the 
criminal act or offense with which he is charged, and allege the amnesty as a 
defense. (Barrioquinto vs. Fernandez, 82 Phil., 642.)</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the petition for certiorari and mandamus is hereby 
dismissed without costs. So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Bengzon, 
Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,</em> and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur. 
<p align="justify"><i>Tuason, J.</i>, I concur in the result.</p></div>
