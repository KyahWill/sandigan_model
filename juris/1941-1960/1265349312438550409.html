				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners&nbsp; have presented this original&nbsp; special&nbsp;&nbsp; civil action of&nbsp; certiorari seeking the annulment&nbsp; of&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; the order for&nbsp; issuance of alias&nbsp; writ of execution dated September&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; (as well&nbsp; as the alias writ itself dated September 11, 1953);&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated September 11, 1953 setting aside a previous&nbsp; order of August 1, 1958; and&nbsp; (3) the order of September 30, 1958&nbsp; denying: petitioners&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for reconsideration,&nbsp; all&nbsp; issued,&nbsp; allegedly without or&nbsp; in excess of jurisdiction&nbsp; or with grave abuse of discretion, by the respondent Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Bulacan in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 694 concerning&nbsp; the foreclosure, of a mortgage executed by&nbsp; petitioners in favor of respondent Miguel&nbsp; Campos.<br><br>The foreclosure suit,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appear&nbsp; went to trial&nbsp; after defendants&nbsp; (herein petitioners)&nbsp; have been duly&nbsp; declared in default for failure to appear and answer the complaint. On January 12, 1953, judgment was rendered sentencing the&nbsp; defendants jointly&nbsp; and&nbsp; severally&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; plaintiff (herein respondent Campos),&nbsp; within ninety (90)&nbsp; days from notice of the decision, the sum of&nbsp; P25,000.00 with the stipulated interest, and&nbsp; a sum equivalent to 15% of the total amount&nbsp; due,&nbsp; as attorney's&nbsp; fees, and the costs. The usual order to sell the mortgaged properties at public auction&nbsp; in case of default,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the application&nbsp; of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the judgment appears in the dispositive&nbsp; part of the decision.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendants-petitioners having&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; adjudged, the mortgaged properties&nbsp; were&nbsp; sold in public auction to respondent&nbsp; Campos himself, who was the lone&nbsp; bidder,&nbsp; for the amount of P10,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 3, 1953&nbsp; the respondent court confirmed the auction sale. On August 25,&nbsp; 1953, respondent Campos&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an ex-parte motion-in the following tenor:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; That on&nbsp; 12 January 1953&nbsp; judgment was&nbsp; rendered against defendants,&nbsp; jointly&nbsp; and severally, to&nbsp; pay plaintiff the&nbsp; sum of P25,000.00 with interest at the&nbsp; rate of twelve&nbsp; (12%)&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent per annum from 3 July 1952 until fully paid, and the sum equivalent to&nbsp; fifteen (15%)&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent of the total amount due as attorney's fees and the costs;<br><br>"2.&nbsp; That on 22 June 1953 said judgment was partially executed when&nbsp; the Provincial&nbsp; Sheriff&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bulacan sold to plaintiff, as the highest bidder the mortgaged properties of&nbsp; defendants for the&nbsp; sum of P10.000.00;<br><br>"3. That&nbsp; as&nbsp; of 22 June 1953&nbsp; the total amount of the judgment against defendants was in the sum of P32,375.21 consisting of the following: <br><br><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="55%">Capital</td> <td width="29%"><div align="right">P25,000.00</div></td> <td width="16%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> Interest at 12%</td> <td><div align="right">2,824.70</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Attorney's fees at 15%.</td> <td><div align="right">4,173.71</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Publication</td> <td><div align="right">300.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sheriff's fee</td> <td><div align="right">6.80 </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Costs </td> <td><div align="right">70.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">__________</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td><div align="right">P32,375.21</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>"4. That out of the total amount of the judgment in the sum of P32,375.21, only the sum of P10,000.00 has been satisfied by the sale of the mortgaged properties&nbsp; to the plaintiff, leaving unpaid the sum of P22,375.21;<br><br>"5. That plaintiff&nbsp; has&nbsp; discovered properties registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; defendants names and situated in the Province of Rizal, which properties may properly answer for&nbsp; the balance of the judgment in the said sum of P22,375.21 against the defendants. "Wherefore, pursuant&nbsp; to Rule&nbsp; 70, Section&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court, it is respectfully prayed that a first alias writ of execution be issued&nbsp; against the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; and that&nbsp; said&nbsp; alias writ&nbsp; of execution be&nbsp; addressed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial Sheriff of Rizal for&nbsp; the proper enforcement of the terms thereof."<br></blockquote>On September&nbsp; 7, 1953,&nbsp; respondent court&nbsp; granted the petition, stating:<br><blockquote>"Considering as well founded the ex parte motion dated August 25, 1953 filed by the plaintiff&nbsp; through&nbsp; counsel, let alias&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of execution be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case directed to the Provincial&nbsp; Sheriff of Rizal."<br></blockquote>Accordingly, an alias writ&nbsp; was issued on September 11, 1953.<br><br>On June 21, 1958, that is, more than 4 years&nbsp; after the issuance of&nbsp; the said alias writ of execution, the petitioners filed a motion to set aside the aforementioned order of the respondent court (of September 7, 1953)&nbsp; for the issuance of the alias writ of execution and all proceedings taken thereunder alleging&nbsp; that the said order had no basis, there being no deficiency judgment, and the respondent court had, therefore, no jurisdiction to issue the same.&nbsp; On July 7, 1958, respondent Campos opposed the motion stating that the same was filed out of time and did not conform, in form or substance, to a petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. &nbsp;<br><br>On August&nbsp; 1, 1958, the respondent court issued an order, setting aside the alias writ of execution issued on September 11, 1953, to wit: <br><blockquote>"Considering the motion to set aside the order for issuance of alias writ of execution and all proceedings taken thereunder filed by the defendants thru their counsel and the&nbsp; opposition thereto and it appearing that the alias writ of execution was issued without any basis at all for no deficiency judgment has been rendered pursuant to the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sec.&nbsp; 6, Rule 70 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court;<br><br>"AS PRAYED FOR, the alias writ of execution dated September 11, 1953 is hereby set aside as&nbsp; it has no leg upon which to stand."<br></blockquote>On August 18, 1958, respondent Campos asked for&nbsp; new trial and/or reconsideration of this last order, contending that the court had lost its jurisdiction over the case, as the proceedings, thereunder were "definitively closed in October 1953", when the full amount of the judgment in his favor was satisfied and, therefore, the aforementioned order of August 1, 1958 was issued by the respondent court without or in excess of its jurisdiction; and that there was in fact&nbsp; a&nbsp; deficiency Judgment in his favor as shown in the respondent&nbsp; court's order of&nbsp; September&nbsp; 7, 1953.&nbsp; An opposition to the said motion was filed by the petitioners on August 25,&nbsp; 1958.&nbsp; On August 30, 1958, respondent Campos submitted a memorandum in amplification of oral argument contending that since the judgment rendered on January 12, 1953 against the petitioners was by default, said petitioners had no standing whatsoever before the&nbsp; court&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore, all pleadings that they had filed should be stricken from the record.&nbsp; In a reply to the said memorandum, dated September 5, 1958, the petitioners claimed that the respondent Campos&nbsp; had waived the petitioners' alleged default.&nbsp; On September 11,&nbsp; 1958, the respondent&nbsp; court issued an order, setting aside its order of August 1,&nbsp; 1958, as follows:<br><br>"Acting upon the 'motion for new trial and/or reconsideration' filed by the plaintiff&nbsp; (respondent Campos herein) and the opposition thereto, and&nbsp; it&nbsp; appearing that the herein defendants&nbsp; (petitioners herein)&nbsp; have no standing whatsoever&nbsp; before this&nbsp; court as the&nbsp; judgment rendered in this&nbsp; case on January&nbsp; 12, 1953 against them was&nbsp; by default;<br><br>"AS prayed FOR, the order of the Court&nbsp; dated August" 1, 1958, is&nbsp; hereby reconsidered and&nbsp; set aside." On&nbsp; September 17, 1958, the&nbsp; petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; which&nbsp; was denied on September 30, 1958.&nbsp; Hence, this&nbsp; petition for certiorari.&nbsp; The two legal&nbsp; issues to be determined in this&nbsp; case are (1)&nbsp; whether the respondent court acted&nbsp; without&nbsp; or in excess of its&nbsp; jurisdiction in issuing, in the first place, its order&nbsp; dated September 7, 1953 granting an&nbsp; alias writ of execution; and (2) whether the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; court also acted with grave abuse of discretion in reversing its order of August 1, 1958 (which in turn set aside the alias writ of Execution dated September 11, 1953), on the ground that the petitioners had no standing in court as they had been previously declared in default.<br><br>As&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; first issue,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners claim that&nbsp; there was no basis&nbsp; for the order of September 7, 1953&nbsp; granting the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; alias writ of execution, because no deficiency judgment had been rendered in the&nbsp; foreclosure suit, pursuant to Section 6, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 6. Judgment for balance after sale of property.âUpon the sale&nbsp; of any real property, under&nbsp; an order for a sale to satisfy a mortgage&nbsp; or other incumbrance&nbsp; thereon, if&nbsp; there be&nbsp; a balance due&nbsp; to the plaintiff after applying the proceeds of the sale, the court, upon motion, shall&nbsp; render judgment&nbsp; against the&nbsp; defendant for any such balance for which, by the record of the case, he may be&nbsp; personally liable&nbsp; to the plaintiff, upon which&nbsp; execution&nbsp; may issue immediately if&nbsp; the balance is all due at the time of the rendition of the judgment; otherwise&nbsp; the plaintiff shall&nbsp; be entitled to execution at&nbsp; such time as&nbsp; the balance remaining would have become due by,the terms of the original contract, which time shall be stated in the judgment."<br></blockquote>Respondent Campos, on the other hand, contends that the order&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, considered&nbsp; in&nbsp; conjunction with his <i>ex parte</i> motion dated August 25, 1953, "constitutes a deficiency&nbsp; judgment"&nbsp; within&nbsp; the meaning of the aforequoted&nbsp; provisions of the Rules of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; We&nbsp; agree substantially with respondent.&nbsp; It will be observed that in his said ex parte motion,&nbsp; he alleged&nbsp; that "out of the total amount of the judgment in the sum of P32.375.21, only the sum of P10,000.00 has been satisfied&nbsp; by the sales of the mortgaged properties" to him, "leaving&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; the sum of P22,375.21"; that he "has discovered properties" registered in the petitioners' name, situated in&nbsp; the province of Rizal, "which properties may properly answer for the balance of the judgment in the said sum of P22,375.21" against&nbsp; the petitioners.&nbsp; He, therefore, prayed "that a first alias writ of execution be issued" against the petitioners pursuant to Section 6, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Acting upon the said motion, the respondent court issued the order in question, granting the alias writ of execution prayed&nbsp; for.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; the said order failed to declare that the petitioners were&nbsp; deficient&nbsp; in regard to the payment of their mortgage indebtedness and the exact amount of the&nbsp; deficiency, or that the petitioners were personally liable to the respondent Campos for the said amount, as shown by the record of the case, it was for all legal purposes, substantially a deficiency&nbsp; judgment within the meaning of Section 6, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court aforequoted.&nbsp; The issuance of the said writ was, precisely, for the purpose of satisfying the&nbsp; deficiency claimed by the respondent Campos.&nbsp; Indeed, there would have been no reason for its issuance, if the alleged deficiency had&nbsp; not existed, in the opinion of the court. &nbsp;<br><br>For all the foregoing, we find and so hold that, in issuing the writ in question, the respondent court did not act without or in excess of its jurisdiction. <br><br>In respect to the second issue, it appears that the respondent court, on September 11, 1958, set aside its&nbsp; order of August 1, 1958 (which in turn set aside the alias writ of execution dated&nbsp; September 11,&nbsp; 19E3), upon being apprised that petitioners had no standing in court, having been declared in default on&nbsp; November 26, 1952 for failure to appear or file their answer&nbsp; to the foreclosure complaint; and that the judgment rendered against them on January 12, 1953 was likewise, by default.&nbsp; The lejal consequences of a default order were succinctly explained by&nbsp; this Court in&nbsp; the case of Lim&nbsp; Toco <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Go Fay&nbsp; (80 Phil.,&nbsp; 166).&nbsp; It was held therein thatâ<br><blockquote>"A defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; default loses his&nbsp; standing in,&nbsp; or is considered out of, court and&nbsp; consequently&nbsp; can&nbsp; not appear in court, adduce evidence, and be heard, and for that reason he is not entitled to notice.&nbsp; If he is not entitled to notice of the proceedings in the case and to be heard, he&nbsp; can&nbsp; not appeal from the judgment rendered by the court&nbsp; on the merits, because&nbsp; he can not file a notice of appeal, for approval by the court.&nbsp; The only exception provided by law is when the&nbsp; defendant in default files a motion to set aside the order of default on the grounds stated in Rule 38 in which event he is&nbsp; entitled to notice of all further proceedings.' That a defendant in default can not be heard in the suit, not only in the trial court but&nbsp; also in the final hearing, that is, on appeal which is a part of the proceedings in a suit, is the&nbsp; ruling laid down for guidance of court,&nbsp; and practitioners&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in the case of Velez <i>vs.</i> Rambs, 40 Phil. 787, * * *. <br><br>"The&nbsp; reason why the&nbsp; defaulting&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to notice&nbsp; is because it would&nbsp; be useless or of no purpose to do so, since the defendant can not appear&nbsp; and be&nbsp; heard in&nbsp; the suit&nbsp; in any way * *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; There is absolutely&nbsp; no&nbsp; reason for denying&nbsp; a defaulted&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard&nbsp; before, and&nbsp; granting him that right after, the judgment on the merits.&nbsp; If he is out of or has no standing in court&nbsp; before judgment&nbsp; on the merits, he can not be considered as no longer in default after said judgment. <br><br>"There is, therefore;&nbsp; no reason in law or equity for permitting a defaulting defendant, after judgment on the merits, to appear and be heard either in the trial court or on appeal.. *&nbsp; * ."&nbsp; , (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is contended, however, by&nbsp; the petitioners that respondent Campos, by filing an opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; petitioners' motion dated June 21, 1958 to set aside the alias writ issued on September-11,1953, and other pleadings in answer to petitioners' subsequent pleadings, had, in effect, waived the effects of petitioners' default, such that they thereby regained&nbsp; their&nbsp; standing in&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Granting,&nbsp; arguendo that the respondent Campos had waived the effects of the said default, the petitioners could no longer&nbsp; benefit by said waiver because at the time petitioners filed their&nbsp; motion dated June 21,&nbsp; 1958, the judgment rendered in the&nbsp; foreclosure suit had already been fully satisfied since October, 1953, thereby depriving the respondent court of its jurisdiction over the case;&nbsp; Moreover, the aforementioned&nbsp; motion of June 21, 1958 could not&nbsp; be considered as a petition for relief under Rule 38&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, because it was filed 4 years and 9 months after the issuance&nbsp; of the order of September 7, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a defendant was declared in default and later&nbsp; a judgment on the merits was rendered against him, and without praying&nbsp; for the revocation&nbsp; of the order of default&nbsp; he filed&nbsp; a motion for the annulment of the judgment rendered, it has been held that he has no standing in court and he has no&nbsp; right to appeal.&nbsp; (Isaac <i>vs.</i> Mendoza, 89 Phil., 279.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same case, this Court said that even&nbsp; granting, for the sake of&nbsp; argument that the plaintiff's motion for annulment&nbsp; included&nbsp; the order of default, his motion cannot be sustained, it having been filed too late, beyond the six months period within which applications for relief under Rule 38 may be entertained. <br><br>Neither could the petitioners invoke Section 5 (g),&nbsp; Rule 124 of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to&nbsp; the inherent power of the court "to. amend and control its process and orders so as&nbsp; to make them comformable&nbsp; to&nbsp; law and justice' to justify the setting aside of the alias writ in question, as the said provision is applicable only where the court has&nbsp; not yet lost&nbsp; its jurisdiction over&nbsp; the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Veluz <i>vs.</i> Justice of the Peace of Sariaya, 42 Phil.,&nbsp; 557.) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup> It is elementary that final orders and decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction may not be set aside, except in accordance with&nbsp; the express&nbsp; statutory&nbsp; provisions, and upon grounds stated therein and within the time provided therefore.&nbsp; (Perez <i>vs.</i> Sweeney, 8 Phil., 157; Pacific Importing &amp;&nbsp; Exporting&nbsp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Tinio, et al., 85 Phil.,&nbsp; 239;&nbsp; 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 2910.) <br><br>In conclusion, we are of the opinion and so hold that the&nbsp; respondent court,&nbsp; in issuing the&nbsp; order dated&nbsp; September 7, 1953 granting an&nbsp; alias writ of execution and its&nbsp; subsequent order of September 11, 1958 (reversing its order of August 1, 1958) as well as the denial (September 30, 1958) of petitioners' motion for reconsideration did not act with grave abuse of discretion, as to warrant the&nbsp; issuance of a writ of certiorari prayed for by the petitioners. <br><br>Wherefore, the petition is hereby dismissed without costs. It is so&nbsp; ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B.
