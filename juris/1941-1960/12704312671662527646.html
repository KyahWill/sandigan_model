				G.R. No. L-2802, December 23, 1949</h4>
				<H3>ROSA PASCUAL, GREGORIO CRUZ, AND JOAQUIN SERIBAN, PETITIONERS, VS. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, RIZAL CITY BRANCH, BERNARDICA LUCAS, AND AMBROSIO J. GUTIERREZ, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for certiorari to review an order of Judge 
Bienvenido A. Tan of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Rizal City Branch, 
refusing to stay an execution issued in three unlawful detainer cases against 
the herein petitioners.
<p align="justify">It appears that Joaquin Seriban, Rosa Pascual, and Gregorio 
Cruz, petitioners herein, were severally sued for unlawful detainer in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Malabon, Rizal. The cases were jointly tried and 
decided in favor of the plaintiffs. On appeal to the Court of First Instance, 
decision was handed down on October 27, 1948, sentencing the defendants 
severally to pay the back rents and to vacate the premises that were the 
subjects of the actions, without costs. There was no appeal from that 
decision.</p>
<p align="justify">No question is raised as to the legality of the execution of 
the money part of the judgment. But as to eviction, the execution debtors 
claimed that on December 10, 1948, after the judgment was rendered, they 
purchased from the Rural Progress Administration the lots in question, and had 
brought actions to suspend the execution on the ground that they had become 
owners of the land. It should be stated that the plaintiffs were mere lessees 
and the defendants sub-lessees of these lots and that the Rural Progress 
Administration, an instrumentality of the Government, acquired recently, by 
purchase from the plaintiffs' lessors, the estate of which the said lots form 
part.</p>
<p align="justify">A court, or the judge thereof, has the power temporarily to 
stay execution of its judgment whenever it is necessary to accomplish the aims 
of justice. (33 C.J.S., 312.) The mere pendency of another court proceeding is 
not necessarily a ground for a stay. However, an execution will ordinarily be 
stayed pending the termination of other proceedings connected with the principal 
case. (<em>Id</em>., 314.) Other ground of relief from an execution refers to 
facts occurring subsequent to the judgment. (Chua A. H. Lee vs. Mapa, 51 Phil., 
624.)</p>
<p align="justify">Here, there are three pending actions in the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal filed by the present petitioners against their former 
sublessors, the respondents Bernardica Lucas and Ambrosio J. Gutierrez, seeking 
preliminary injunction to suspend the execution and asking that they be declared 
entitled to the possession of the property in litigation. The right of the 
execution creditors to eject the execution debtors is directly involved in these 
suits. Their result will determine the right of the plaintiffs in the unlawful 
detainer cases to go ahead with the execution of the judgment. It is obvious 
that if the court in the pending cases should decide that the defendants have 
lawfully acquired the lots, they are now the lawful owners thereof, as they 
allege, entitled to stay thereon. The alleged purchases occurred subsequent to 
the judgment, the execution of which is the subject of the instant proceeding, 
and were not included in that judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">The execution therefore may proceed as to the money part of the 
judgment, but the petition is granted with reference to the attempted eviction 
of the defendants; and it is ordered that as to the said eviction, execution be 
stayed until the pending cases shall have been definitely concluded. Respondents 
Bernardica Lucas and Ambrosio J. Gutierrez will pay the costs of these 
proceedings.</p> <em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</em> and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
