				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 22, 1947,&nbsp; the Philippines Alien Property Administrator vested&nbsp; for the&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States Government&nbsp; six parcels of&nbsp; land,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with&nbsp; their&nbsp; improvements, located in Kansas Street, Malate, Manila, and covered by transfer certificates of title&nbsp; Nos. 64862, 64863 (for two lots), 64864,&nbsp; 64865 and 64566 in the name of the Philippine Cotton Growing Association, and on January 12, 1948, took title and possession of the personal properties found&nbsp; therein&nbsp; under&nbsp; Vesting Order No. P-123&nbsp; (Supplemental).&nbsp; Agustin Liboro filed a claim for the recovery of the properties which was denied by said Administrator; whereupon the present suit was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the same purpose by Agustin Liboro, in which the Republic of the Philippines intervened.&nbsp; On June 30, 1956, the complaint was dismissed without costs. Plaintiff Agustin Liboro has appealed.<br><br>It appears that the appellant, the original owner of the properties&nbsp; in controversy, sold the same on March 2, 1942, to the Philippine Cotton Growing Association, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan, for P112,000.00. He received in cash only P12,000.00, as the vendee assumed the responsibility of paying his outstanding obligations to the Bank of the Philippine Islands, the Agricultural and Industrial&nbsp; Bank and the&nbsp; Philippine Bank of Commerce amounting to&nbsp; P100,000.00.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; corresponding transfer certificates of title&nbsp; were issued in favor of the vendee.<br><br>The appellant is&nbsp; repudiating the validity of&nbsp; the sale to the Japanese&nbsp; corporation, on the&nbsp; ground of&nbsp; duress and upon the allegation&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had already repurchased the properties&nbsp; although the corporation had failed to execute the necessary deed.<br><br>On the&nbsp; matter of duress,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; in substance testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; in January, 1942, two Japanese&nbsp; civilians, introducing themselves as Mashiba and Imamura, general manager and assistant manager, respectively, of the.Philippine&nbsp; Cotton Growing&nbsp; Association, inspected and offered to buy his&nbsp; house; that as he refused, the two left; that he subsequently received&nbsp; a letter&nbsp; directing&nbsp; him to, as&nbsp; he did, see a certain Kempetai officer at the Finance Building; that on this occasion the same offer was made, only again to be turned down by him; that he was later summoned by said officer twice, and in the last meeting he was warned that, should he refused to cooperate, he might be considered an enemy;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Hashiba was present&nbsp; in&nbsp; all&nbsp; said interviews&nbsp; and the officer cautioned him not to tell anybody about their conversations; that, fearing that he might be brought to&nbsp; and tortured&nbsp; in Fort&nbsp; Santiago, like some of his friends and relatives, he agreed to sell.<br><br>This Court has, in many cases, already ruled that "collective"&nbsp; or&nbsp; "general" duress allegedly&nbsp; exercised by the Japanese military forces will not nullify certain contractual acts.&nbsp; In Fernandez <i>vs.</i> McGrath, 96 Phil., 411; it was held: <br><blockquote>"As a final argument in&nbsp; annulling the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale in question, the lower court held that the transaction being between the military occupant and an inhabitant of the occupied territory, over a property that was&nbsp; a war necessity, duress may be presumed and no evidence of a particular coercive act is necessary.&nbsp; In numerous cases decided before this, particularly&nbsp; Philippine Trust Co. <i>vs.</i> Luis Araneta, 83 Phil., 132; 46&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 4254;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Bangalamis, 78 Phil., 174; 44 Off. Gaz., 2655; and People <i>vs.</i> Quilloy, 88 Phil.,&nbsp; 53,&nbsp; this Court has already, rejected the theory of 'collective'&nbsp; or&nbsp; 'general' duress allegedly&nbsp; exercised&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; military&nbsp; occupant over&nbsp; the inhabitants of this country as ground to invalidate acts&nbsp; that would otherwise be valid and voluntary if done in times of peace."<br></blockquote>Assuming, therefore,&nbsp; that the appellant was compelled to execute the&nbsp; disputed deed of sale, the duress invoked was no more than the general feeling of fear on the part of the Filipinos brought about&nbsp; by the excessive show of might by their miltiary occupants and,&nbsp; we reiterate, insufficient to render an otherwise valid contract&nbsp; a nullity.&nbsp; What is more, appellant's outstanding obligations amounting to P100,000.00 had been paid out of the purchase price, with the result that, even disregarding the statement of Seiichi Tagawa, a mutual friend of Hashiba and Imamura, that the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; constrained to sell&nbsp; his house&nbsp; because&nbsp; of financial difficulties (Exh. C), the fact remains that he&nbsp; actually&nbsp; reaped the benefit of the transactions. As this&nbsp; Court had said:&nbsp; "A party that is able to carry out an act redounding to its exclusive benefit simultaneously with the assailed contract, cannot successfully&nbsp; claim in the&nbsp; latter case&nbsp; to have&nbsp; acted mechanically&nbsp; under the influence of violence or intimidation (Reyes&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Zaballero, 89 Phil., 39; Martinez&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai&nbsp; Bank, 15 Phil., 252; Vales <i>vs.</i> Villa, 35 Phil., 769)."&nbsp; And in the case of Fernandez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Brownell, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, the pronouncement was laid&nbsp; down that "Even if&nbsp; we&nbsp; concede that the sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed through&nbsp; threat&nbsp; and intimidation&nbsp; by Mori, the&nbsp; action for&nbsp; annulment was&nbsp;&nbsp; waived and the contract ratified,by the plaintiff's action in depositing the check for the purchase&nbsp; price and withdrawing the money from time to time."<br><br>We have gone over&nbsp; appellant's evidence and found no reason to&nbsp; disturb the lower court's conclusion that he had failed to prove a valid repurchase of the property in question.&nbsp; Supposing that in January, 1945.&nbsp; appellant's daughter made the necessary payment to&nbsp; Imamura, there is no showing that the latter, as assistant&nbsp; general manager, was empowered or authorized&nbsp; to receive&nbsp; such payment for the corporation or that the latter had ever ratified Imamura's act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The powers of a general manager are not unlimited. His&nbsp; province or function is only to supervise and conduct the ordinary business of his principal, and whether an act falls within his implied powers depends&nbsp; on&nbsp; whether or not it is within the&nbsp; ordinary business entrusted to his management (Vol. 2,&nbsp; Fletcher's&nbsp; Cyclopedia Corporations, Perm. Ed., p. 607, citing Carroll-Cross Coal Co. <i>vs.</i> Abrams Creek Coal &amp; Coke Co.,&nbsp; 83 W. Va. 205, 98 SE 148).&nbsp; And contracts entered into by officers or managers of a corporation beyond the authority granted them&nbsp; do&nbsp; not bind the corporation unless&nbsp; ratified by it (See Deen <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Pacific Commercial, 42 Phil., 758).<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gutierrez David, JJ.,</span>&nbsp; concur.</div>
