				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The 1987 Constitution was crafted and ordained at a historic time when our nation was reeling from ghastly memories of atrocities, excesses and outright violations of our people’s rights to life, liberty and property. Hence, our bill of rights was worded to emphasize the sanctity of human liberty and specifically to protect persons undergoing custodial investigations from ignorant, overzealous and/or incompetent peace officers. The Constitution so dearly values freedom and voluntariness that, inter alia, it unequivocally guarantees a person undergoing investigation for the commission of an offense not only the services of counsel, but a lawyer who is not merely (a) "competent" but also (b) "independent" and (c) "preferably of his own choice" as well.<br><br>In the case before us, the main evidence relied upon for the conviction of appellants were their own extrajudicial confessions which admittedly were extracted and signed in the presence and with the assistance of a lawyer who was applying for work in the NBI. Such counsel cannot in any wise be considered "independent" because he cannot be expected to work against the interest of a police agency he was hoping to join, as a few months later, he in fact was admitted into its work force. For this violation of their constitutional right to independent counsel, appellants deserve acquittal. After the exclusion of their tainted confessions, no sufficient and credible evidence remains in the Court’s records to overturn another constitutional right: the right to be presumed innocent of any crime until the contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Cavite, Branch XVIII in Tagaytay City, disposing of Criminal Case No. TG-1392-89, viz.:<br><br>"WHEREFORE, and premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused:<br><br>(1) RENE JANUARIO Y ROLDAN<br><br>a n d -<br><br>(2) EFREN CANAPE Y BAYOT<br><br>GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of Sec. 14 last sentence of R.A.

Velasco, Jr., was filed against accused-appellants Rene Januario and Efren Canape, and their co-accused Santiago Cid, Eliseo Sarita @ Toto and Eduardo Sarinos @ Digo charging them with violation of Republic Act No. 6539 (Anti-Carnapping Law)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></sup> allegedly commited as follows:<br><br>"That on or about September 4, 1987, at Barangay Bulihan, Municipality of Silang, Province of Cavite, the above-named accused, together with Eliseo Sarita @ Toto and Eduardo Sarinos who (sic) still at-large, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another, with intent to gain, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did, then and there, willfully (sic), unlawfully and feloniously, after stabbing to death the driver Gernonimo (sic) Malibago and conductor Andrew Patriarca, take, steal and carry away and carnap, one Isuzu passenger type jeepney, with plate No. DFB-550, owned by Doris and Victor Wolf, to their damage and prejudice in the total amount of P124,000.00.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></sup><br><br>Arraigned on February 7, 1989, appellants Januario and Canape, assisted by counsel de oficio, pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></sup> On May 30, 1989, Cid, assisted by counsel de parte, likewise entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></sup> Sarita and Sarinos remained at large. At the trial, the prosecution presented the following witnesses: Myrna Temporas, NBI Agent Arlis S. Vela, Vicente Dilanco Pons, Andrew Patriarca, Sr., Juliana Malibago, Atty. Magno Toribio, and Atty. Carlos Saunar, documentary and other evidence tending to prove the following:<br><br>Sometime in March 1988, Santiago Cid went to the house of prosecution witness Vicente Dilanco Pons, a farmer engaged in the buy and sell business, in Camarines Sur. Cid, Pons' cousin, asked Pons if he wanted to buy a jeepney. Pons replied that he had no money but that he could help him find a buyer for the jeepney for the price of P50,000.00. With Amador Alayan, one of the drivers of his son who was around, Pons offered to look for a buyer of the jeepney provided that Cid would entrust the vehicle to them. Cid agreed to the proposal. At that time, Pons did not know who owned the jeepney, but he eventually offered it for sale to Myrna Temporas who agreed to the purchase price of P65,000.00. However, Temporas paid Pons only the amount of P48,500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></sup><br><br>Myrna Temporas had a slightly different story. According to her, Pons said that the jeepney was owned by his niece, Doris Wolf. Pons, purportedly acting upon the instructions of Doris Wolf, borrowed from Myrna Temporas the amount of P48,500.00 and used the jeepney as a collateral. The amount was given to Pons in P10,000.00 cash and the balance in a check payable to Doris Wolf. The check was encashed as it was cleared from Myrna Temporas' account. It bore a signature supposedly of Doris Wolf at its back portion and a second endorsement by Pons who subsequently deposited it in his account.<br><br>On September 11, Temporas asked Pons to secure a special power of attorney from Doris Wolf. Pons promised to comply in one or two weeks. But Pons failed to pay the indebtedness. So, Myrna Temporas repeatedly went to his house in Digmaan, Camarines Sur to collect the amount borrowed but Pons always promised that he himself would go to her house to pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></sup><br><br>Inasmuch as Pons also failed to produce a deed of sale covering the jeepney, Temporas lodged a complaint against him for estafa before the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></sup> Acting on the complaint, the NBI contacted the relatives of the owner of the jeepney who went to Camarines Sur, identified the jeepney and informed the NBI that its driver (deceased Geronimo Malibago) and conductor (deceased Andrew Patriarca, Jr.) had been killed by carnappers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></sup><br><br>Patriarca's widow also filed a complaint with the NBI. Upon investigation, an NBI team led by Supervising Agent Magno Toribio found out that the carnapping of the jeepney and the killing of Patriarca and Malibago were the "handiwork" of a group of four (4) persons named Rene Januario, Efren Canape, Eliseo Sarita alias Toto, and Eduardo Sarinos alias Digo. The team also discovered that the jeepney was disposed of through Cid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></sup><br><br>Appellants Januario and Canape, as well as Cid, were arrested in Camarines Sur. The NBI then invited Pons and Temporas to shed light on the carnapping incident. The jeepney was recovered in an auto shop with its engine partly dismantled. Upon being informed by the NBI that the jeepney had been found, an insurance company brought it back to Manila.<br><br>From the "oral investigation" they conducted at the Naga City NBI office on March 27, 1988, the team learned that Sarita and Sarinos took Patriarca and Malibago inside a sugar plantation where presumably they were killed. Because appellants volunteered that their companions were their neighbors in Paliparan, Dasmariñas, Cavite who could be in Manila already, the NBI team decided to take down their statements at the NBI head office in Manila. The team traveled with appellants to Manila, arriving there at around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon of March 28, 1988.<br><br>At the Taft Avenue head office of the NBI, the team took the statements of appellants one at a time. They asked Atty. Carlos Saunar, who was "just around somewhere," to assist appellants during the investigation. Agent Arlis Vela took the statement of appellant Januario while Supervising Agent Toribio took that of Canape. The first portion of the statement, Exhibit C, taken from appellant Januario reads:<br><br>"SINUMPAANG SALAYSAY NA IBINIGAY NI RENE JANUARIO Y ROLDAN SA HARAP NI NBI AGENT ARLIS E.

Palapala, Dasmariñas, Cavite to procure chicken and "kalawit" for his business. He also went there because his new friends named Toto Sarita and Digo Samera (sic), as well as appellant Canape, wanted him to look for a buyer of a jeep. Appellant Januario asked for a photograph of the jeep to assist him in making a canvass of buyers in Bicol but he was told that he would have it later at night because they were then having drinks in the house of Toto.<br><br>After that drinking spree, the group agreed to fetch appellants Januario and Canape at 4:00 o'clock the following morning. It was Digo Samera who fetched appellants before they went to the house of Toto Sarita. Together, they went to GMA town in Cavite. It was around 5:00 o'clock in the morning when they hailed a jeep from the "looban." Thereafter, the following allegedly transpired:<br><br>"18. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;T &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ano na ang nangyari noong kayo ay sumakay sa jeep?<br>S &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Ako ang naunang sumakay pagtigil noong jeep.

Habang nangyayari iyon ay tinutukan naman ni DIGO na nasa loob ng jeep ang conductor na pinasubsub ang ulo habang tinutukan ng 29.

Upon reaching Libmanan, they went directly to Santiago Cid with whom appellant Januario had earlier conferred regarding the sale of the jeep. Appellant Januario did not know to whom the jeep was sold but he knew that Cid approached Vicente Pons. The latter gave appellant Januario P1,000 cash and rice and eggs worth around P600. A second jeep was brought by Toto and Digo to Roger Abajero. Cid brought both appellants to the house of Roger.

On March 1988, while still in private practice, he was at the NBI head office handling a client case when Atty. Vela, an NBI agent, approached him. The latter and Atty.

Jose C. Claro for Januario and Atty. Florendo C. Medina for Canape), appellants ascribe basically two errors against the trial court:<br><br>(1) The trial procedure, particularly the presentation and admission of the testimony of Atty. Carlos Saunar, was irregular and prejudicial to the appellants; and<br><br>(2) The extra-judicial confessions of the appellants are inadmissible in evidence for having been extracted in violation of their constitutional right to counsel.<br><br>Insisting that his guilt had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt, appellant Januario contends that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence his sworn statement before the NBI and the testimony of Atty. Saunar as rebuttal or additional witness after the prosecution had rested its case, he (appellant Januario) had filed his memorandum, and the decision had been scheduled for promulgation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></sup><br><br>For his part, appellant Canape also claims that his guilt had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. He questions the trial court's having given "weight and sufficiency" to his extra-judicial confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></sup><br><br>Appellant Januario contends that the trial court erred in allowing the presentation of Saunar as a witness after the prosecution had closed its case and offered its documentary evidence. Saunar could not in any guise be considered as a rebuttal witness simply because there was no defense evidence to rebut.<br><br>The Court’s Ruling<br><br>The First Issue: Order of Trial<br><br>The pertinent provisions of Rule 119 of the Rules of Court state:<br><br>"Sec. 3. Order of trial.- The trial shall proceed in the following order:<br><br>(a) The prosecution shall present evidence to prove the charge, and in the proper case, the civil liability.<br><br>(b) The accused may present evidence to prove his defense, and damages, if any, arising from the issuance of any provisional remedy in the case.<br><br>(c) The parties may then respectively present rebutting evidence only, unless the court, in the furtherance of justice, permits them to present additional evidence bearing upon the main issue.<br><br>(d) Upon admission of the evidence, the cases shall be deemed submitted unless the court directs the parties to argue orally or to submit memoranda.<br><br>(e) However, when the accused admits the act or omission charged in the complaint or information but interposes a lawful defense, the order of trial may be modified accordingly." (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>The trial procedure as outlined in this rule is ordinarily followed to insure the orderly conduct of litigations to attain the magisterial objective of the Rules of Court to protect the parties' substantive rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></sup> However, strict observance of the Rules depend upon the circumstances obtaining in each case at the discretion of the trial judge. Thus, as early as 1917, this Court explained:<br><br>"x x x. The orderly course of proceedings requires, however, that the prosecution shall go forward and should present all of its proof in the first instance; but it is competent for the judge, according to the nature of the case, to allow a party who has closed his case to introduce further evidence in rebuttal. This rule, however, depends upon the particular circumstances of each particular case, and falls within the sound discretion of the judge, to be exercised or not as he may think proper."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></sup><br><br>Hence, the court may allow the prosecutor, even after he has rested his case or even after the defense has moved for dismissal, to present involuntarily omitted evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></sup> The primary consideration is whether the trial court still has jurisdiction over the case. Thus<br><br>"The claim that the lower court erred in allowing the prosecuting attorney to introduce new evidence is devoid of any merit, for while the prosecution had rested, the trial was not yet terminated and the cause was still under the control and jurisdiction of the court and the latter, in the exercise of its discretion, may receive additional evidence. Sec. 3(c), Rule 119 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that, in the furtherance of justice, the court may grant either of the parties the right and opportunity to adduce new additional evidence bearing upon the main issue in question."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></sup><br><br>Saunar’s testimony was admitted in evidence before the trial court rendered its Decision. Undoubtedly then, the court a quo retained its jurisdiction even though the prosecution had rested its case. As to appellants, Saunar was an additional prosecution witness, not a rebuttal witness, because the defense waived presentation of evidence after the prosecution had rested its case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></sup> Saunar was, therefore, a rebuttal witness with respect to accused Cid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></sup><br><br>The Second Issue: Appellants’ Right to Counsel<br><br>Proof of Saunar's presence during the custodial investigation of appellants is, however, not a guarantee that appellants' respective confessions had been taken in accordance with Article III, Section 12 (1) of the Constitution. This constitutional provision requires that a person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have no less than "competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice." Elucidating on this particular constitutional requirement, this Court has taught:<br><br>"It is noteworthy that the modifiers competent and independent were terms absent in all organic laws previous to the 1987 Constitution. Their addition in the fundamental law of 1987 was meant to stress the primacy accorded to the voluntariness of the choice, under the uniquely stressful conditions of a custodial investigation, by according the accused, deprived of normal conditions guaranteeing individual autonomy, an informed judgment based on the choices given to him by a competent and independent lawyer.<br><br>Thus, the lawyer called to be present during such investigation should be as far as reasonably possible, the choice of the individual undergoing questioning. If the lawyer were one furnished in the accused's behalf, it is important that he should be competent and independent, i.e., that he is willing to fully safeguard the constitutional rights of the accused, as distinguished from one who would merely be giving a routine, peremptory and meaningless recital of the individual's constitutional rights. In People v. Basay, this Court stressed that an accused's right to be informed of the right to remain silent and to counsel 'contemplates the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.'<br><br>Ideally, therefore, a lawyer engaged for an individual facing custodial investigation (if the latter could not afford one) 'should be engaged by the accused (himself), or by the latter's relative or person authorized by him to engage an attorney or by the court, upon proper petition of the accused or person authorized by the accused to file such petition. Lawyers engaged by the police, whatever testimonials are given as proof of their probity and supposed independence, are generally suspect, as in many areas, the relationship between lawyers and law enforcement authorities can be symbiotic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></sup><br><br>We find that Saunar was not the choice of appellant Januario as his custodial investigation counsel.

Under the circumstances described by the prosecution however, he could not have been the independent counsel solemnly spoken of by our Constitution. He was an applicant for a position in the NBI and therefore it can never be said that his loyalty was to the confessants. In fact, he was actually employed by the NBI a few months after. As regards appellant Januario, Saunar might have really been around to properly apprise appellant of his constitutional right as reflected in the written sworn statement itself.<br><br>However, the same cannot be said about appellant Canape. Clearly, he was not properly informed of his constitutional rights. Perfunctorily informing a confessant of his constitutional rights, asking him if he wants to avail of the services of counsel and telling him that he could ask for counsel if he so desires or that one could be provided him at his request, are simply not in compliance with the constitutional mandate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></sup> In this case, appellant Canape was merely told of his constitutional rights and posthaste, asked whether he was willing to confess. His affirmative answer may not, by any means, be interpreted as a waiver of his right to counsel of his own choice.<br><br>Furthermore, the right of a person under custodial investigation to be informed of his rights to remain silent and to counsel implies a correlative obligation on the part of the police investigator to explain and to contemplate an effective communication that results in an understanding of what is conveyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></sup> Appellant Canape's sworn statement, which reads and sounds so lifeless on paper, fails to reflect compliance with this requirement. Neither does the aforequoted testimony of NBI Agent Toribio. Bearing in mind that appellant Canape reached only the fifth grade, the NBI agents should have exerted more effort in explaining to him his constitutional rights.<br><br>Moreover, there is enough reason to doubt whether appellant Canape was in fact and in truth assisted by counsel. Atty. Saunar affirmed on the witness stand that he assisted appellants on March 28, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></sup> However, the sworn statement itself reveals that it was taken on March 27, 1988. No satisfactory explanation was made by the prosecution on this discrepancy. All that Agent Vela stated was that they conducted an oral investigation in Naga City on March 27, 1988 and that investigation at the NBI Manila head office was made in the afternoon of March 28, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></sup><br><br>The law enforcement agents' cavalier disregard of appellants' constitutional rights is shown not only by their failure to observe Section 12 (1) of Article III of the Constitution. They have likewise forgotten the third paragraph of Section 12 of the same article which mandates that an admission of facts related to a crime must be obtained with the assistance of counsel otherwise it would be inadmissible in evidence against the person so admitting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></sup><br><br>An admission, which, under Section 26 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, is an "act, declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact" is different from a confession which, in turn, is defined in Section 33 of the same Rule as the "declaration of an accused acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, or of any offense necessarily included therein."

Verbal admissions, however, should also be made with the assistance of counsel. Thus:<br><br>"The verbal admissions allegedly made by both appellants of their participation in the crime, at the time of their arrest and even before their formal investigation, are inadmissible, both as violative of their constitutional rights and as hearsay evidence. These oral admissions, assuming they were in fact made, constitute uncounselled extrajudicial confessions within the meaning of Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></sup><br><br>That appellants indeed admitted participation in the commission of the crime in Naga City is shown by the fact that the NBI agents brought them to Manila to facilitate apprehension of the other culprits who could be either in Cavite or Manila. Because their uncounselled oral admissions in Naga City resulted in the execution of their written confessions in Manila, the latter had become as constitutionally infirm as the former. In People vs. Alicando,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></sup> this Court explained the ramifications of an irregularly counselled confession or admission:<br><br>"We have not only constitutionalized the Miranda warnings in our jurisdiction. We have also adopted the libertarian exclusionary rules known as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree,' a phrase minted by Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter in the celebrated case of Nardone v. United States. According to this rule, once the primary source (the 'tree') is shown to have been unlawfully obtained, any secondary or derivative evidence (the 'fruit') derived from it is also inadmissible. Stated otherwise, illegally seized evidence is obtained as a direct result of the illegal act, whereas the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' is the indirect result of the same illegal act. The 'fruit of the poisonous tree is at least once removed from the illegally seized evidence, but is equally inadmissible. The rule is based on the principle that evidence illegally obtained by the State should not be used to gain other evidence because the originally illegally obtained evidence taints all evidence subsequently obtained."<br><br>Appellants might have indeed committed the crime in concert with Eliseo Sarita and Eduardo Sarinos. However, what could have been their valuable admissions and confessions as far as the prosecution was concerned were sullied and rendered inadmissible by the irregular manner by which the law enforcement agents extracted such admissions and confessions from appellants. Without such statements, the remaining prosecution evidence -- consisting mostly of hearsay testimony and investigation reports -- is sorely inadequate to prove appellants’ participation in the crime.<br><br>Notably, these law enforcers did not only defy the mandate of Section 12 of the Bill of Rights but, after making "inquiries" from appellants about the crime, they likewise illegally detained appellants as shown by the admission of one of the NBI agents that appellants were deprived of their liberty while in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></sup> Appellants were even made to travel for ten (10) hours<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></sup> from Naga City to Manila just so their formal confessions could be executed in the latter city. According to NBI Agent Vela, they "actually arrested" the appellants when the court issued the warrant for their arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></sup> The records show however that the NBI turned appellants over to the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Silang-Amadeo in Cavite only on March 30, 1989. On the same day, the same court turned them back to the NBI for "detention during pendency of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></sup><br><br>Epilogue<br><br>The Court understands the difficulties faced by law enforcement agencies in apprehending violators of the law especially those involving syndicates. It sympathizes with the public clamor for the bringing of criminals before the altar of justice. However, quick solution of crimes and the consequent apprehension of malefactors are not the end-all and be-all of law enforcement. Enforcers of the law must follow the procedure mandated by the Constitution and the law. Otherwise, their efforts would be meaningless. And their expenses in trying to solve crimes would constitute needless expenditures of taxpayers’ money.<br><br>This Court values liberty and will always insist on the observance of basic constitutional rights as a condition sine qua non against the awesome investigative and prosecutory powers of government. The admonition given by this Court to government officers, particularly those involved in law enforcement and the administration of justice, in the case of People vs. Cuizon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></sup> where NBI agents mishandled a drug bust operation and in so doing violated the constitutional guarantees against unlawful arrests and illegal searches and seizures, is again called for and thus reiterated in the case at bench, to wit:<br><br>"x x x In the final analysis, we in the administration of justice would have no right to expect ordinary people to be law-abiding if we do not insist on the full protection of their rights. Some lawmen, prosecutors and judges may still tend to gloss over an illegal search and seizure as long as the law enforcers show the alleged evidence of the crime regardless of the methods by which they were obtained. This kind of attitude condones law-breaking in the name of law enforcement. Ironically, it only fosters the more rapid breakdown of our system of justice, and the eventual denigration of society. While this Court appreciates and encourages the efforts of law enforcers to uphold the law and to preserve the peace and security of society, we nevertheless admonish them to act with deliberate care and within the parameters set by the Constitution and the law.
