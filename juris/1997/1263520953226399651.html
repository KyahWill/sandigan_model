<blockquote>(<i>Rollo</i>,
p. 57)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Based
on the record, the undisputed facts of the case are the following:</p>

<blockquote>At
around 8 o’clock on the night of October 30, 1992, as Victoriano Aguilar
Cabangon, 26 years old, Teresita Cabangon, 22 years old, husband and wife,
together with their 5-year-old son, were resting in their bamboo hut at
Barangay Apurao, Bani, Pangasinan, Victoriano, who was already asleep, was
suddenly killed by a gunshot directed at the frontal area of his skull.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The
prosecution’s version is based on the testimony of its witnesses, Victoriano’s
widow, Teresita, who positively identified accuses-appellant Danny Queliza, as
the culprit; Loreta Aguilar Cabangon, mother of the deceased; Restituto Rivera,
the embalmer; and Dr. Vicente C. Tongson, the Rural Health Doctor.  The Office of the Solicitor General
summarized the events as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="">Appellant
Danny Queliza, victim Victoriano Cabangon and his mother Loreta were neighbors
at Barangay Apurao, Bani, Pangasinan.  Five days before the fateful night of October 30, 1992, appellant had a
quarrel with victim’s cousin, Ruben Ardesani.  In that incident, the victim had made manifestations siding with his
cousin whom he felt was aggrieved.  Appellant resented this and threatened the victim saying that the
latter’s life was only worth <s>P</s>12,000.00 (Records, p. 55).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">At
about 8 o’clock in the evening of October 30, 1992, his wife Teresita and their
5-year old son were peacefully lying down for the night in their house (bamboo
hut) illuminated by an electric bulb.  Father and son had already fallen asleep while Teresita was still awake
listening to the program “Mr. Lonely” (TSN, Sept. 9, 1993, pp. 4-7).  All of a sudden, appellant pushed the door
open and forthwith fired a gun at the victim’s head.  Appellant glanced at Teresita and fled.  The victim died on the spot.  Horrified by the scene, Teresita cried for help (TSN, Sept. 9, 1993, pp.
4-12).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">Moments
before the gruesome murder, the victim’s mother, Loreta Cabangon, was in her
yard (about five meters away from the victim’s house) to answer a call of
nature.  She saw appellant and two
others arrive at the victim’s porch then illuminated by an electric lamp.  Appellant went up alone at the victim’s
balcony.  Not long after, she heard a
gun report coming from the victim’s house and thereafter saw appellant jump out
of the victim’s house holding a gun and sped away (TSN, Sept. 15, 1993, pp.
5-18; Sept. 13, 1993, p.15).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">Loreta
shouted for help and dashed to the victim’s house where she met Teresita at the
porch crying and shouting, “Nay awan ni Victoriano pinatay ni Danny Queliza”
(“Mother, Victoriano is already gone, he was killed by Danny Queliza”) [TSN,
Sept. 15, 1993, pp. 11-12; Sept. 13, 1993, p. 15].</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">On
the same night, the incident reached the barangay and police authorities.  Pat. Cecilio Dollaga was one of the
policemen who responded and investigated the case.  When he interviewed Teresita, the latter named appellant as her
husband’s assailant (Id., pp. 14-15; TSN, Sept. 9, 1993, p. 15; TSN, May 19,
1994, pp. 3-4).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">The
post-mortem examination on the cadaver of the victim shows that he died of  “Intracranial Hemorrhage, secondary to Brain
Tissue Injury secondary to Gunshot wound (Exh. “A”, Records, p. 6).  After the victim’s burial, Teresita gave her
sworn statement at the Police Station, Bani, Pangasinan (Exh. “B” and “B-1”;
TSN, Sept. 9, 1993, p. 16).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">(<i>Rollo,
</i>p. 83.)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Accused-appellant,
on the other hand, presented the defense of alibi, Corroborated by witnesses
William Raboy and Cornelia Romero, accused-appellant’s defense is to the effect
that at the time of the incident he was in Arnedo, Bolinao to go swimming at
the sea with his cousins; and that he returned to his hometown only on December
21, 1992 when he voluntarily surrendered to the police authorities of Bani,
Pangasinan to deny any knowledge of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The
defense also clings to the testimony of Pat. Cecilio Dollaga to the effect that
when he interrogated Teresita Cabangon, she declared that she did not know the
killer of her husband (tsn, pp. 17, 19, 21, Oct. 28, 1993).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Lastly,
the defense notes that the trial in this case was conducted before Judge
Segundo Paz who passed away before he could decide the case, and that the
decision was penned by Judge Jules A. Mejia, who did not have the opportunity
of observing the demeanor of the witnesses for both the prosecution and the
defense.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In
giving credence to the prosecution’s evidence, the trial court noted the
opposing contentions of Teresita Cabangon, as corroborated by Loreta Cabangon,
and that of Patrolman Dollaga.  Teresita
Cabangon testified that when she was asked by Dollaga who killed her husband,
she identified the accused-appellant.  This was corroborated by Loreta Cabangon, who testified that she heard
her daughter-in-law reveal to Dollaga the identity of the assailant.  On the other hand, Dollaga said that for
three times during his interrogation on the very night of the incident, he
asked the widow who killed her husband and she disclaimed knowledge
thereof.  Faced with these contradictory
contentions, the trial court preferred the affirmative over the negative
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Nevertheless,
the trial court held that even assuming that Teresita Cabangon indeed did not,
on the initial investigation, identify the author of the crime, such failure,
“lacks spontaneity because of the condition of the declarant, surrounding
circumstances such as fright, tension, stress, instability under an atmosphere
of serious or continuing fear specially since it was nighttime, just a few
hours after her husband was murdered” and that the “diversion of her thoughts
may be the result of attention to other matters, more importantly her own
safety which is in fact the first law of nature…”</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Further,
the trial court did not give credence to the insistence of accused-appellant
that he was not the assailant because he was not at the place of the crime at
the time of its occurrence.  The court
said that “alibi cannot stand to exculpate him as he was positively identified
by Teresita as the very person who shot her sleeping husband, coupled by the
testimony of the mother of the deceased that after the shot was heard, she saw
the accused jump from the porch carrying a hand gun in his right hand.”  The trial court ruled out the reliability of
alibi as a defense since “it was not physically impossible for the accused to
proceed to Arnedo, Bolinao from Apurao, Bani on the night of October 30, 1992”,
a distance which would not take more than two hours to traverse.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The
trial court also did not see any personal reason on the part of the widow and
the mother of the deceased nor any grudge that may push them to falsely testify
against accused-appellant, unlike the witnesses for the defense, who were
perceived to be biased in favor of accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Lastly,
the trial court appreciated against accused-appellant the
qualifying/aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation, and
nocturnity, it being undisputed that the deceased was asleep with his family
when he was shot, that the attack was so sudden and that the victim could not
have been given even the slightest opportunity to prepare for or repel or avoid
the attack, even if he were awake.  Evident premeditation is said to have been present since minutes before
the gunshot was heard, three persons, one of whom was identified as
accused-appellant, were seen only six meters away from the house of the
victim.  The trial court concluded that
the mode of attack was purposely sought to facilitate the commission of the
crime and to facilitate accused-appellant’s escape.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">We
sustain the conviction of accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Under
his assignment of errors, which he discussed jointly, accused-appellant
questions the finding of the trial court that the testimony of the witnesses
for the prosecution is affirmative in nature and that of the witnesses for the
defense is negative.  He likewise
assails the trial court for overlooking and disregarding what he says are
certain facts and circumstances which, if properly considered, would have
resulted in his acquittal.  Lastly, he
objects to the trial court’s finding that the prosecution was able to prove his
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">At
the outset, it is significant to note that the circumstance that Judge Jules
Mejia, the one who penned the assailed decision, is not the one who heard the
witnesses, a fact which Judge Mejia honestly admitted in his decision, will not
automatically warrant a reversal of the decision.  In the recent case of <i>People v. Rabutin</i> (G.R. Nos.
118131-32, May 5, 1997) we held:</p>

<blockquote>This
Court had ruled that while the trial judge who presided at the trial of the
case would be in a better position to ascertain the truth or falsity of the
testimony of the witnesses, it does not necessarily follw that a judge who was
not present during the trial cannot render a valid and just decision  this is the main reason why all trial courts
are mandatorily  required to be courts
of record.  Whoever is tasked to render
judgment in every case can rely on the transcribed stenographic notes taken
during the trial as basis for his decision. (<i>People v. Peralta</i>, 237 SCRA
220 [1994]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp.
10-11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">We
agree with the finding of the court <i>a quo</i> that based on jurisprudence,
affirmative testimony has greater value than a negative one (<i>People v.
Salazar, </i>248 SCRA 157 [1995]) since the defense of denial crumbles in the
face of the complainant’s positive identification of the culprit (<i>People v.
Balsacao</i>, 241 SCRA 309 [1995]).  However, we rule that the distinction between affirmative and negative
testimony is not applicable to the opposing contentions of Teresita Cabangon
and Patrolman Dollaga.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In
<i>Revilla v. Court of Appeals</i> (217 SCRA 583 [1993]), negative and positive
testimony were distinguished as follows:</p>

<blockquote>…Evidence
is negative when the witnesses states that he did not see or know the
occurrence of a fact, and positive when the witness affirms that a fact did or
did not occur (2 Moore on Facts, p. 1338)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p.
592)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Based
on the above distinction, it is plain that the declarations of Teresita
Cabangon and Patrolman Dollaga are both positive in nature.  Teresita said that she identified her killer
when she was interrogated by Dollaga.  Patrolman Dollaga, on the other hand, testified to something known to
himself, namely, that Teresita did not divulge the identity of the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">However,
taken in its totality, in contrast to the defense denial made by
accused-appellant, which is indeed negative testimony, we give greater weight
to Teresita’s positive identification of the culprit and her testimony on the
circumstances of the murder.  This was
corroborated by Loreta Cabangon that (a) she saw accused-appellant enter the
balcony of the house of the deceased moments before the fatal gunshot was
heard, and (b) immediately thereafter she saw accused-appellant with a gun in
his right hand leaving the victim’s house.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Even
assuming that Teresita did delay in revealing the identity of her husband’s
assailant, this should not destroy the essence of her testimony, mainly, the
positive identification of accused-appellant as the culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Defense
witnesses Patrolman Dollaga and Councilman Moises corroborated each other’s
testimony that Teresita Cabangon delayed in revealing the identity of her dead
husband’s assailant.  The record shows
that it was only on November 16, 1992, or a delay of only 16 days from the
commission of the crime on October 30, 1992, when Teresita Cabangon reported
the crime to the police authorities and named accused-appellant as her
husband’s assailant.  She did this when
she executed her affidavit which was presented during the preliminary
investigation of the case at bench.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">However,
we believe that the slight delay is not far from ordinary human
experience.  We have to understand the
human psyche given the morbid and horrific situation Teresita Cabangon was in.  She witnessed her husband’s death.  For a moment, her husband was sleeping
peacefully; the next moment, he was dead.  So violent was his death that the poor wife saw blood come out from his
head and she saw his right eye bulge.  Such dreadful circumstances would undoubtedly leave the helpless wife in
fright and in shock.  Fear of the
assailant’s return to kill her and her son was also a natural reaction.  Hence, it was normal and not unreasonable
for Teresita Cabangon to have taken her time to muster enough strength to identify
her husband’s assailant, whom she saw with her own eyes that fatal night.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">There
is no rule that the suspect in crime be named by a witness hurriedly.  In fact, in <i>People v. Corpuz</i> (240
SCRA 203 [1995]), we had an opportunity to rule that the unhurried and
deliberate manner in which a witness identifies the accused even strengthened
for credibility, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>…It
is true that Calapini did not point to accused-appellant as one of her
assailants <i>immediately and straight-away upon seeing him at the hospital</i>.  The records show that Calapini took her time
to scrutinize accused-appellant’s features.  She studiously looked him over before identifying him as one of the
assailants.  Surely, she cannot be
faulted for deliberating and making sure that the person presented before her
was indeed one of the culprits.  <i>When
she became certain, however, she decisively and without the slightest
hesitation, identified the accused-appellant</i>…</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p.
208)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">We
have consistently ruled that persons do not necessarily react uniformly to a
given situation, for what is natural to one may be strange to another (<i>People
v. Cabrera</i>, 241 SCRA 28 [1995]; <i>People v. Paguntalan</i>, 242 SCRA 753
[1995]; <i>People v. Halili</i>, 245 SCRA 312 [1995]; People v. Espinoza, 247
SCRA 66 [1995]).  What is important is
the fact that Teresita Cabangon, notwithstanding the anxiety and fear that she
had to go through after witnessing the brutal killing of her husband, gained
enough courage to name her husband’s assailant.  This she did despite fear of retaliation from accused-appellant,
who actually resides in the same town where Teresita resides.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Teresita’s
testimony is further strengthened by Loreta Cabangon’s narration of events,
particularly the fact of hearing Teresita Cabangon utter the statement “<i>Nay awan
ni Victoriano pinatay ni Danny Queliza</i>” (“Mother, Victoriano is already
gone, he was killed by Danny Queliza”).  This emotional lament is significantly part of the <i>res gestae</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In
a long time of jurisprudence (<i>People v. Esquilona</i>, 248 SCRA 139 [1995]; <i>People
v. Tolentino</i>, 218 SCRA 337 [1993]; <i>Pantranco North Express, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals</i>, 224 SCRA 477 [1993]; <i>Anciro v. People</i>, 228 SCRA
629 [1993]), the requisites of <i>res gestae </i>as an exception to the hearsay
rule were laid down: (1) that the principal act or the <i>res gestae</i> be a
startling occurrence; (2) the statement is spontaneous or was made before the
declarant had time to contrive or devise, and the statement is made during the
occurrence or immediately prior or subsequent thereto; and (3) the statement
made must concern the occurrence in question and its immediately attending
circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Any
delay on Teresita Cabangon’s part to identify her husband’s assailant is
emphatically overcome by the aforestated statement which was correctly
considered by the trial court as part of the<i> res gestae</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Accused-appellant,
in a desperate attempt to discredit the mother-daughter tandem, banks on
inconsistencies in their testimony, which upon perusal are actually minor in
character.  Whether Teresita saw her husband’s
assailant while she was lying down or while whe was sitting is of no
consequence considering that she identified who the assailant was.  Her absence at the crime scene during the
investigation made by Patrolman Dollaga is of no moment, considering that she
was nonetheless later subjected to investigation.  Her failure on the stand to remember the size of the weapon which
she had earlier described as six to twelve inches long during the preliminary
investigation, cannot be taken against her.  Whether Loreta Cabangon looked out of the window or whether she looked
out of the door when she heard the fatal gunshot is not significant.  These inconsistencies are minor details
which can not prompt us to discredit these two witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">It
has always been our ruling that inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness
with respect to minor details or inconsequential matters may be disregarded
without impairing the credibility of the witness (<i>People v. Magalong</i>,
244 SCRA 117 [1995]; <i>People v. Compil</i>, 244 SCRA 135 [1995]).  In fact, such minor inconsistencies even
tend to strengthen rather than weaken a witness’ credibility (<i>People v.
Lorenzo</i>, 240 SCRA 634 [1995]) for these inconsistencies negate and erase
any suspicion of rehearsed testimony (<i>People v. Padilla</i>, 242 SCRA 629
[1995]).  Besides, in the present case,
there is clearly consistency relative to the principal occurrence and positive
identification of the assailant (<i>People v. Panganiban</i>, 241 SCRA 91
[1995]).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Accused-appellant’s
defense is underpinned by his assertion that he was in another municipality at
the night of the murder.  His testimony
on this point was corroborated by Cornelia Romero who testified that
accused-appellant, together with two others, had dinner at her house and stayed
overnight.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Time
and again, we have ruled that alibi is a weak defense and even if it is
supported by the testimony of friends of the accused, deserves the barest
consideration (<i>People v. Gamiao</i>, 240 SCRA 284 [1995]).  It will only be given weight if it would
preclude any doubt that the accused could not have been physically present at
the place of the crime or its vicinity at the time of the commission (<i>People
v. Daquipil</i>, 240 SCRA 314 [1995]; <i>People v. De Roxas</i>, 241 SCRA 369
[1995]; <i>People v. Morin</i>, 241 SCRA 709 [1995]; <i>People v. Rivera</i>,
242 SCRA 26 [1995]; <i>People v. De la Iglesia</i>, 241 SCRA 718 [1995]; <i>People
v. Umali</i>, 241 SCRA 17 [1995]; <i>People v. Dayson</i>, 242 SCRA 124 [1995];
<i>People v. Espinosa</i>, 243 SCRA 7 [1995]; <i>People v. Parica</i>, 243 SCRA
557 [1995]; <i>People v. Escoto</i>, 244 SCRA 87 [1995]).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">We
agree with the trial court’s finding that it was not physically impossible for
accused-appellant to have been at the crime scene on October 31, 1992 at 8 p.m.
From the cross-examination of the accused-appellant, the following facts were established:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style=""> </span>Barangay Apurao, Bani, Pangasinan (the crime
scene), and Arnedo, Bolinao (where accused-appellant allegedly was) are
separated by three barangays, namely, Luac, Tugue, and San Jose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style=""> </span>From Apurao to Luac, the distance is one
kilometer.  From Luac to Tugue is about
two kilometers.  From Tugue to San Jose
is about two kilometers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style=""> </span>From San Jose, Bani to the town proper in
Bolinao, travel time is around 30 minutes.  From Bolinao town proper to Arnedo, travel time is 20 minutes or a distance
of two kilometers, as testified by accused-appellant, for verily, judicial
notice was taken of the fact that one kilometer can be easily travelled within
7 to 8 minutes (<i>People v. Sumbillo, et al., </i>G.R. No. 105292, April 18,
1997).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Considering
that the above-stated barangays and towns could be traversed by motorized
vehicles, we are persuaded with the trial court’s finding that
accused-appellant could not have consumed more than two hours to travel from
Arnedo, Bolinao to Apurao, Bani, considering that it was nighttime and roads
were not too busy.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">As
held in People <i>v.</i> Gamiao, <i>supra:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>The
trial court correctly disbelieved appellant’s defense of alibi, a handy but
shabby excuse which indictees never seem to fire of… [I]t is not enough to
prove that the accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed, but it
must likewise be demonstrated that it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.  Caoile himself admitted in his testimony that
the distance between the <i>locus criminis</i> and tabacan, Dinalupihan, Bataan
where he claimed to be, is only about 100 km., which could be negotiated by a
public utility vehicle in not more than 2 hours, even taking into consideration
the traffic congestion normally encountered by a commuter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp.
261-262)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Moreover,
accused-appellant’s defense of alibi must necessarily fall in the light of the
testimony of Teresita Cabangon and Loreta Cabangon positively and unequivocally
identifying him as the assailant and placing him at the crime scene immediately
after the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The
only corroborative evidence presented by the defense to show that
accused-appellant was in Arnedo, Bolinao during the time of the incident was
the testimony of Cornelia Ramos, which, however, fell apart on
cross-examination where it was elicited that Cornelia Ramos was not a
disinterested witness.  It was shown
that the land where her family was staying is owned by the aunt of
accused-appellant.  The witness herself
testified that accused-appellant did not have the habit of sleeping in her
house, and that when accused-appellant did allegedly spend the night in her
house on October 30, 1992, it was, quite strangely, the first time he did so.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In
sum, we give great weight to Teresita Cabangon’s testimony that it was
accused-appellant who fired the fatal gunshot which killed her husband while he
was asleep last October 30, 1992, which declaration is corroborated by Loreta
Cabangon’s testimony that she saw the accused-appellant near the crime scene
before and after the murder, carrying a hand gun.  These declaration are credible in themeselves, they belie the
accused-appellant’s defense of alibi, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that it
was accused-appellant who murdered the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">However,
we modify the penalty imposed by the trial court from the medium degree of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> to the single indivisible penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.  </i>Based on the evidence, the qualifying
aggravating circumstance of treachery already absorbs the aggravating
circumstance of nocturnity since nighttime forms part of the peculiar
treacherous means and manner adopted to insure the execution of the crime (<i>People
vs. Bardon</i>, 165 SCRA 416 [1988]; <i>People v. Abitona</i>, 240 SCRA 335 [1995];
<i>People vs. Saliling</i>, 249 SCRA 185 [1995]).  It is clear from the circumstances of the murder that
accused-appellant made some preparation to kill the victim by choosing
nighttime when the victim had already retired for the day, in order to ensure
the execution of the crime and to make it impossible for the victim to defend
himself.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">As
regards, the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, we hold that
the presence of the requisites therefor, were not clearly and sufficiently
shown.  The elements of evident
premeditation are: (a) the time when the accused determined to commit the
crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating that the accused had clung to his
determination; and (c)  sufficient lapse
or interval of time between such determination and execution to allow him to
reflect upon the consequence of his act (<i>People vs. Saliling, supra; People
vs. Besana</i>, 220 SCRA 93 [1993]).  The prescence of evident premeditation must not be deduced from mere
presumption or sheer speculation (<i>People vs. Barros</i>, 245 SCRA 312
[1995]) and it must be proven as clearly as the crime itself (<i>People vs.
Halili</i>, 245 SCRA 340 [1995]).  The
mere fact that accused-appellant was seen minutes before the gunshot was heard
together with two persons six meters away is not sufficient to conclude the
attendance of evident premeditation.  At
any rate, with or without this aggravating circumstance, the penalty would
still be <i><u>reclusion perpetua</u></i> which is an indivisible penalty (<i>People
vs. Saliling</i>, <i>supra.</i>)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">As
to accused-appellant’s civil liability, by and large, the trial court was
correct in awarding the following, supported as they are by the testimony of
Teresita Cabangon:</p>

<blockquote>a)<span style=""> </span>Funeral expenses amounted to <s>P</s>500.00 per
day during the seven wake of the victim (tsn, Sept. 9, 1993, p. 17).  Loreta Cabangon further testified that she
spent <s>P</s>7,000.00, consumed 5 gantas of rice, and spent <s>P</s>200.00 per
viand of food during the wake and vigil (tsn, Sept. 13, 1993, p. 19).</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style=""> </span>As regards the victim’s income, it was shown
that he was a farmer who harvested 60 cavans of palay a year, which he sold at <s>P</s>5.00
per kilo.  He was also a fisherman who
used to catch 5 liters of shrimps a day and sold the same at <s>P</s>60.00 or <s>P</s>30.00
per liter depending on the size of the container used.  Lastly, he worked at the construction of a
dike and earned <s>P</s>100.00 a day therefor (tsn, Sept. 9, 1993, pp. 19-22).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Thus,
the trial court correctly awarded <s>P</s>9,500.00 as compensatory damages for
funeral expenses; <s>P</s>100,000.00 for projected loss of earnings considering
that the victim, who was 26 years old, was the lone provider for his family’s
basic needs; and, of course <s>P</s>50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of the
victim, in line with the current jurisprudence.  However, the amount of <s>P</s>100,000.00 as moral damages for
the physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, and moral
shock of the victim’s widow, considering the manner by which the victim was
killed, awarded by the trial court seems to be a bit inflated.  We believe that <s>P</s>20,000.00 would be
more reasonable.</p>
