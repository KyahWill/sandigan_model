Said pleading contained a list of questions sought to be propounded to respondents Enriquez, Carlos and Mendoza in an attempt to elicit from them confirmation regarding the questioned CDF allotment, specifically the cash allocation received by PYHSDFI, and the consumption thereof by PYHSDFI chairman Ronaldo Puno’s SHO for its reported illegal election campaign activities during the May 11, 1992 election.<br><br>Amidst opposition forged by respondents Enriquez and Mendoza, the Comelec Law Department, through Director Balbuena, scheduled the clarificatory questioning on July 9, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Through a Motion for Reconsideration dated July 5, 1994, respondent Enriquez persisted to question the legality of the scheduled clarificatory questioning on the ground that the same is in violation of his constitutional right against self-incrimination.

Easily understandable is the need for further investigation by the COA, considering that nothing on the Special Audit Report on PYHSDFI’s CDF allocation imputed the use thereof for electioneering activities.<br><br>In response, however, to the letter of the Comelec Law Department dated August 20, 1995 requesting the COA to conduct a more rigid and extensive investigation, COA Chairman Celso Gangan wrote Director Balbuena on September 12, 1995 that “the facts stated in our report dated November 15, 1993 are already complete; that the report does not make mention of irregularities or anomalies, rather deficiencies like lack of supporting documents to fully substantiate the disbursement x x x although the distribution of funds by the Foundation is supported by the a list x x x”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On the same day, August 20, 1995, a letter was also sent to respondent Cesar Sarino, former DILG Secretary, requesting him to submit a verified explanation regarding the sub-allotments issued by his office on several dates in February and March, 1992, as well as some various sub-allotments issued by respondent Leonora de Jesus, then Undersecretary of the DILG.<br><br>In the meantime, in a letter dated August18, 1995, Director Balbuena asked petitioner Kilosbayan to “identify, under oath, the John Does in their complaint” Responding through a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> petitioner Kilosbayan, through its Acting President, Cirilo A.

Likewise, they pointed out that Teodoro Benigno newspaper articles constituted hearsay evidence bereft of any probative value.<br><br>Insofar as respondent, then DILG-NCR Regional Directior, Tiburcio Relucio was concerned, the Law Department was unable to subpoena him because he was abroad.<br><br>No rebuttal evidence was tendered by petitioner Kilosbayan to dispute the counter-allegations of herein respondents. Notably, too, petitioner Kilosbayan did not offer any additional evidence, in the place of Teddy Benigno’s published newspaper articles implicating PYHSDFI’s Ronaldo Puno and the SHO’s electioneering activities during the 1992 elections, in order to show even some semblance of a connection between the PYHSDFI’s CDF allotment and SHO’s electioneering activities.<br><br>On April 3, 1996, the Comelec Law Department issued the following finding and recommendations:<br><br>“SYNOPSIS OF CASE<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">[1]</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> TITLE:</span><br></div><br>'KILOSBAYAN VS.

Prohibited Acts – following shall be guilty of an election offense:<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>(o) Use of public funds, money deposited in trust, equipment, facilities owned or controlled by the government for an election campaign. – Any person who uses under any guise whatsoever, directly or indirectly, (1) public funds or money deposited with, or held in trust by, public financing institutions or by government offices, banks, or agencies; x x x x for any election campaign or for any partisan political activity.’<br><br>(v) Prohibition against release, disbursement or expenditure of public funds – Any public official or employee including barangay officials and those of government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, who, during forty-five days before a regular election and thirty days before special election, releases, disburses or expends any public funds for:<br><br>(1) Any and all kinds of public works, except the following:<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>(w) Prohibition against construction of public works, delivery of materials for public works and issuance of treasury warrants and similar devices – during the period of forty-five days preceding a regular election and thirty days before a special election, any person who (a) undertakes the construction of any public works, except for projects or works exempted in the preceding paragraph; or (b) issues, uses or avails of treasury warrants or any device undertaking future delivery of money, goods or other things of value chargeable against public funds.”<br><br>The Commission on Audit, thru its Chairman, pointed out, in its letter dated September 12, 1995, that the facts stated in their report dated November 15, 1993 are already complete and that the report does not make mention of irregularities or anomalies, rather deficiencies like lack of supporting documents to fully substantiate the disbursements, such that although the distribution of funds by the Foundation is supported by a list, this does not show the acknowledgment by supposed recipients.<br><br>Although the report of the COA dated November 15, 1993 mentioned that upon the start of the audit, it was disclosed that PYHSDFI did not keep book of accounts, wherein to record its transactions, which constitute(s) a basic requirement in the accounting for funds and ‘all it had to evidence its disbursements are vouchers, many of which are not supported by receipts or other documents’, it does not show that the public funds released to it by the DILG was used for any election campaign or for any partisan political activity. The report says:<br><br>‘(2) The inadequate financial reports, book of accounts and other supporting documents rendered verification of total disbursement of P70M difficult,<br><br>This consist of the following:<br><br>a) Meals./snacks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P14,465,000<br><br>b) Prof. fees/allowances<br><br>travel expenses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P17,881,500<br><br>c) Rental site/facilities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P 3,441,480<br><br>d) Purchases of supplies and materials&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P34,221,020<br><br>P70,000,000<br><br>This particular part of the report of the COA also clearly showed that the public funds in the hands of the PYHSDFI were not used for any and all kinds of public works.<br><br>Further it says:<br><br>“3.A In most of the transactions undertaken, cash payments [were] used in paying their obligations, since it would have been significantly expensive it in overhead cost to maintain a pool of administrative staff and besides no allocation of such expenses [was] programmed. Moreover, most [the] expenses were in the category of payrolls which [had] to be paid in cash. [L]likewise suppliers asked for cash-on–delivery (COD) basis since the prices given were the lowest obtainable commercial rates.<br><br><blockquote>This showed that not all obligations of the PYHSDFI were paid in cash, in other words, the other obligations were paid in forms which may be checks or any other device undertaking future delivery of money. However, no single piece of evidence was presented by Kilosbayan to prove its complaint to determine whether they (checks) have been issued within the prohibited period.<br><br>In the light of the foregoing, the Law Department reiterates its former findings in its Study for Agenda dated February 8, 1995 that ‘in the case of respondents Ronald Puno, Secretary Vicente Carlos, Melvin Mendoza, Francisco Cancio and Jimmy Durante, based on the existing documents appearing on the records, no probable cause exists against them for violation of the election law’. It is well-settled that the complainant must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of the evidence of the respondent[s].<br><br>In the case of Hon. Cesar N. Sarino, he alleged that his approvals of the sub-allocations reflect a strict compliance with the law and do not violate Section 261 (v) of the Omnibus Election Code as their approval [was] not within the proscribed time frame as designated by the Commission on Elections, and Advice of Sub-allotment No. DILG-92-2-128 covers a type of expenditure which is not public works expenditure, hence, not violative of said provision of law.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>x x x [A]n incisive, careful, meticulous and rigid review and re-evaluation of the above-listed sub-allotments revealed, that the nine (9) sub-allotments approved by former DILG Secretary Cesar Sarino which appeared to be for construction of public works are actually nine (9) pages of five (5) sub-allotments x x x and the one (1) sub-allotment issued by Undersecretary Leonora V. de Jesus which appeared to be for construction of public works is actually:</blockquote><br><br>(b) Sub-allotment No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of Approval&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page No.<br><br>1] 92-1-90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 19, 1992&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br><br>To be liable for violation of Section 261 (v), supra, four (4) essential elements must concur and they are:<br><br>1) A public official or employee releases, disburses, or expends any public funds;<br><br>2) The release, disbursement or expenditure of such public funds must be within forty-five days before regular election (March 27, 1992 until May 11, 1992, Section 1, Comelec Resolution No. 2332, Jan. 02, 1992);<br><br>3) The release, disbursement or expenditure of said public funds is for any and all kinds of public works; and<br><br>4) The release, disbursement or expenditure of the public funds should not cover any exceptions of Section 261 (v).<br><br>Except for Sub-allotment No. 92-1-94 and Sub-allotment No. 92-2-128 approved on March 27, 1992 and April 22, 1992, respectively, by former DILG Secretary Cesar Sarino, not one of the sub-allotments listed above does fall within the proscribed period. Sub-allotment No. 92-1-98 was approved to cover the improvement/rehabilitation of Cabucgayan Waterworks System of Cabucgayan, Leyte. This falls within exception (maintenance of existing and/or completed public works projects) of the proscription being merely a rehabilitation of an existing public works project. Sub-allotment No. 92-2-128 was not for any and all kinds of public works. It was approved to cover the purchase of reference and instructional materials for distribution to all local executives of the 2nd District of Surigao del Norte in support of the Educational Upliftment Program of the DILG, hence, it could not also fall within the proscription. The sub-allotment approved by undersecretary Leonora V. de Jesus, which appreared to be for the construction of public works, having been approved on March 19, 1992 does not fall within the proscriptive period, hence, it could not also fall within the proscription.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>Prescinding from the foregoing documents appearing on [the] records, there exist no sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that former DILG Secretary Cesar Sarino and Undersecretary Leonora V. de Jesus have violated Section 261 (v) of the Omnibus Election Code.<br><br>The Law Department must stress here that the allegations appearing in the columns of Teodoro Benigno in the Philippine Star on several dates imputing dirty ‘election tricks and practices’ (as worded by Kilosbayan) against respondent Jose Almonte, Dionisio de la Serna, Victor Sumulong, Franklin Drilon and Gabriel (Gabby) Claudio cannot be admitted as gospel truth because they are purely speculative and conjectural. Suffice it to say, that, they are mear hearsayevidence. Well-settled is the rule that Newspaper clippings are hearsay and of no evidentiary value. (People vs. Jovito Aguel, et al., 97 SCRA 795].<br><br>Moreover, former Executive Secretary, now Senator, Franklin Drilon’s undated letter, where he approved the request for authority dated March 17, 1992 of then former DILG Secretary Cesar N. Sarino to negotiate, enter into and sign Memoranda of Agreements with and to utilize the accredited Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), in accordance with the directive of then former President Corazon Aquino dated March 13, 1992, regarding the implementation of projects under the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) provided under R.A. 7180, does not refer to any release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds for construction of public works.<br><br>Consequently, there also exist no sufficient evidence to engender a well-grounded belief that respondents Jose Almonte, Dionisio de la Serna, Victor Sumulong, franklin Drilon and Gabriel (Gabby) Claudio have violated Section 261 (o) and (v) of the Omnibus Election code.<br><br>It would not be amissed to state here in passing that well-enshrined is the rule that the complainant must submit evidence to prove his case. IN THE INSTANT CASE, COMPLAINANT KILOSBAYAN DID NOT SUBMIT EVIDENCE TO PROVE ITS CASE. IT POSTULATES THE THEORY THAT SINCE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE COMMISSION TO ENFORCE AND ADMINISTER ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATIVE TO THE CONDUCT OF ELECTION, IT IS INCUMBENT TO USE ITS CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO SECURE THE NEEDED EVIDENCE.

Case No. 93-193. Discussing point by point the arguments raised by petitioner in its Motion for Reconsidiration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration, the Comelec En Banc unanimously held, thus:<br><br>“Movant complains:<br><br>The Law Department makes it appear that the KILOSBAYAN has greater responsibility in the enforcement of election laws than the COMELEC to make it its moral and legal duty to spend its time and private funds to gather evidence from public offices to convince the COMELEC that there is sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the respondents.<br><br>x x x<br><br>It may do well to remember that the Constitution charged the COMELEC with the responsibility to x x x<br><br>x x x<br><br>(6) x x x where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.’ (emphasis theirs)<br><br><blockquote>The Commission has no quarrel with Complainant that indeed the Constitution tasked this Body with the prosecution of election offenses. But the constitutional provision made it clear that prosecution should be made only where it is appropriate. It is appropriate when it is established in the preliminary investigation that probable cause exist to justify the filing of the necessary information against the accused.<br><br>Lest the Complainant forgets, it initiated the complaint. Thus, on it rests the burden of supporting its charges with affidavits and/any evidence, for it is upon the evidence thus adduced, that the investigating officer shall determine whether or not there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial. This is so provided under the COMELEC Rules of Procedure x x x.<br><br>Nonetheless, even with Complainant’s failure to submit substantial enough to justify findings of probable cause, the Commission, through its Law Department undertook an investigation of the case. The Law Department summoned the parties, took testimonies of witnesses, secured documents, and conducted hearings. The result of the preliminary investigation was certainly on the basis of the evidences adduced by complainant and the facts gathered by the Department on its own initiative.<br><br>x x x<br><br>No other evidence except Mr. Benigno’s articles were submitted [by petitioner] to prove the existence of the so called Sulo-Hotel Operations. ‘Newspaper clippings are hearsay and of no evidentiary value.’ (People v. Aquel, et al., 97 SCRA 795). x x x<br><br>[Further] x x x [petitioner] wants the Commission to derive from [the Commission on Audit] report the conclusion that because there were discrepancies, to wit: 1. No books of account [were] maintained by the NGO [i.e., PHYSDFI]; and 2. Cash payments were made regardless of amount, then the allocation to PHYSDFI were made for electioneering purposes. Indeed, there could have been, as alleged by Complainant, irregularities in the allocation, but it must be shown by the quantum of evidence required to establish probable cause that such irregularities constituted election offense. This, Compalinant’s evidences failed to show.<br><br>x x x<br><br>It was established that the PHYSDFI received from DILG-NCR an allocation of P70 million. To Complainant ‘the nature’ of the allocation and the amount of the expenditures’ made by PHYSDFI ‘within a short period of time, i.e., immediately before the elections and in the light of the fact that it stopped all its operations shortly after the elections’ established beyond reasonable doubt that the foundation was engaged in partisan political activity. Complainant further averred that the ‘flight of the heads of the foundation (Puno and Catindig) and Regional Director Tiburcio A. Relucio who went into hiding after the series of exposes by columnist Teodoro Benigno… constitutes an implied admission of guilt.’ x x x<br><br>It is the Law Department’s findings and so is Ours, that the nature and amount of expenditure within a short period of time are not sufficient to meet the quantum proof required to establish that said contributions were made for partisan political activity. It must be emphasized that the burden is on Kilosbayan to prove its allegations. He who alleges must prove his allegation. Unfortunately for Complainant, it was not able to produce evidence showing that the contribution was used for partisan political activity.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Complainant posits the view that respondents are liable x x x because the sports and medical kits were unlawful election propaganda, having been purchased and distributed a few days before election and the stopped after the election. At most, this is speculative and presumptive. In the absence of proof amply showing that the purchase and distribution of gadgets and kits were made to advertise or to further the chances of victory of candidate or candidates, the Commission cannot justify the conclusion that probable cause exist to charge respondents x x x.<br><br>x x x<br><br>While it was established by documents thus presented x x x that there was a release of public funds by DILG/DILG-NCR, within the prohibited period, the same could not be considered as a violation x x x because one, the expenditure was not for public works; and two, the Department of Interior and Local Government can not be considered as an office of other ministries (departments) performing functions similar to the Ministry of Social Services and Development or Ministry of Human Settlements.<br><br>Kilosbayan’s complaints were heard. They were investigated. Complainant was given full opportunity to argue its case and prove its charges. It presented arguments but not evidences. It thesis is more on speculations, conjectures and suspicious. It expects the Commission to find as circumstantial evidence the chain of circumstances which [it] presented, forgetting that:</blockquote><br><br>‘The rule on circumstantial evidence necessarily requires that each circumstance must be positively established with the requisite quantum of evidence, in the same manner that the catena that binds the together and conduces to a conclusion of guilt must survive the test of reason and satisfy the required evidentiary weight.'

As such, this petition must be dismissed.<br><br>Section 2 (7) of Article IX-C of the 1987 Constitution provides that the Comelec shall exercise the power to “investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices”. Discerning the rationale for this grant of prosecutorial powers to the Comelec, we already had occasion to rule, thus:<br><br><blockquote>“The grant to the COMELEC of the power, among others, to enforce and administer all laws relative to conduct of election and the concomitant authority to investigate and prosecute election offenses is not without compelling reason. The evident constitutional intendment in bestowing this power to the COMELEC is to insure the free, orderly and honest conduct of elections, failure of which would result in the frustration of the true will of the people and make a mere idle ceremony of the sacred right and duty of every qualified citizen to vote.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br><br>This constitutional grant of prosecutorial power in the Comelec finds statutory expression under Section 265 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>“SEC. 265. <i>Prosecution.</i> – The Commission shall, through its duly authorized legal officers, have the exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses punishable under this Code, and to prosecute the same. The Commission may avail of the assistance of other prosecuting arms of the government: Provided, however, That in the event that the Commission fails to act on any complaint within four months from his filing, the complainant may file the complaint with the office of the fiscal or with the Ministry of Justice for proper investigation and prosecution, if warranted.”</blockquote><br><br>Insofar as the prosecution of election offenses is concerned, therefore, the Comelec is the “public prosecutor with the exclusive authority to conduct the preliminary investigation and the prosecution of election offenses punishable under the [Omnibus Election] Code before the competent court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This constitutional and statutory mandate for Comelec to investigate and prosecute cases of violation of election law translates, in effect, to the exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigations in cases involving election offenses for the twin purpose of filing an information in court and helping the Judge determine, in the course of preliminary inquiry, whether or not a warrant of arrest should be issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>For the effective investigation and prosecution of cases of election offenses and in the exercise by the Comelec of its quasi-legislative power under Section 6, Article IX of the 1987 Constitution, the Comelec Rules of Procedure were promulgated, providing, among others, the guidelines pertinent to election offenses.

At this initial stage of criminal prosecution, the primordial task of the Comelec is the determination of probable cause, i.e., whether or not there is reason to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense charged and, therefore, whether or not he should be subjected to the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or as the Comelec Rules of the Procedure phrase it, whether or not “there is reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The determination of probable cause in any criminal prosecution, is made indispensable by the Bill of Rights which enshrines every citizen’s right to due process, the presumption that he is presumed innocent, and the inadmissibility against him of any damaging evidence obtained in violation of his right against self-incrimination. As Justice Reynanto S. Puno has pointed out, probable cause is neither an “opaque concept in our jurisdiction”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> or a “high level legal abstraction to be the subject of warring thoughts”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It constitutes those “facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> by the person sought to be judicially indicted. In determining probable cause, however, the public prosecutor must have been apprised by the complainant of his evidence in support of his accusatory allegations. In other words, determining probable cause is an intellectual activity premised on the prior physical presentation or submission of documentary or testimonial proofs either confirming, negating or qualifying the allegations in the complaint.<br><br>It follows, therefore, that in the instant case, petitioner Kilosbayan must have necessarily tendered evidence, independent of and in support of the allegations in its letter-complaint, of such quality as to engender belief in an ordinarily prudent and cautious man that the offense charged therein has been committed by herein respondents. Indeed probable cause need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt, neither on evidence establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt and definitely, not on evidence establishing absolute certainty of guilt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>, but it certainly demands more than “bare suspicion”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and can never be “left to presupposition, conjuncture, or even convincing logic”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The effort of petitioner Kilosbayan, thus, in order to successfully lead to the judicial indictment of respondents, should have gone beyond a largely declamatory condemnation of respondents and diligently focused on its two-fold obligation of not only substantiating its charges against respondents but also proffering before the Comelec substantial evidence of respondents’ utilization, through conspiratorial, cooperative and/or interrelated acts, of Seventy Million Pesos from CDF for electioneering activities in violation of its pertinent provision on election offenses as enumerated in the Omnibus Election Code.<br><br>In the dispensation of this obligation, however Kilosbayan utterly failed. The encompassing narration of the pertinent facts and circumstances of this case in the early part of this ponencia indubitably shows the complacency, at the least, and the gross and deliberate negligence, at most, of petitioner Kilosbayan in presenting sufficient evidence in support of its letter-complaint.<br><br>To salvage its position, however, petitioner Kilosbayan denies the existence, under the 1987 Constitution, of any obligation on its part to present any evidence of its accusations against respondents in its letter-complaint. Petitioner Kilosbayan asserts that it is the obligation of the Comelec to search for the evidence needed to judicially indict respondents because it is the agency empowered to investigate and prosecute cases involving election offenses; that E.O. Case No. 93-193 should, at any rate, be deemed one filed by the Comelec motu proprio, thus needing no evidence since probable cause is such a case is presumed, petitioner Kilosbayan having only “requested” for an investigation and the Comelec having proceeded to in fact hold the investigation, as “requested” by petitioner Kilosbayan; and that the Comelec should already be grateful to petitioner Kilosbayan for the latter’s private efforts at exposing respondents’ illegal election activities.<br><br>Kilosbayan’s position is not tenable.<br><br>Indeed, Kilosbayan truly deserves commendation for its continued vigilance against any and all forms of government corruption that cost this country not only the funds gravely needed to afford each Filipino a decent and honorable life, but also the moral resolve to unite with each other and resist and eradicate the growing culture of greed, abuse of power and blatant disregard for basic human dignity and social responsibility. But it must guard against arrogance in trumpeting its causes, if not recklessness in its advocacy.<br><br>The claim of petitioner Kilosbayan that it is merely the “informant” and not the private complainant with the burden to prove probable cause, borders on the ridiculous. Kilosbayan filed before the Comelec a letter-complaint dated December 14, 1993 in support of which documentary evidences like copies of Teodoro Benigno’s newspaper articles on the SHO’s use of PYHSDFI-obtained CDF, of respondent Enriquez’s testimony before the Commission on Appointments, of DILG Budget Officer Barata’s testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, and of Norberto Gonzales’ affidavit, were likewise submitted by petitioner. The letter-complaint not being verified, it is not disputed that petitioner Kilosbayan subsequently caused its verification; when later asked to give the names of the other John Does in its letter-complaint, petitioner Kilosbayan obliged with a list, under oath, of additional respondents. Petitioner Kilosbayan initiated the complaint against herein respondents, hence the docketing thereof as E.O. Case No. 93—193; it filed numerous pleadings before the Comelec as a private complainant in E.O. Case No. 93-193; its proceeded in the case in accordance with the Comelec Rules of Procedure pertinent to the prosecution of cases of election offenses. After all, the Kilosbayan should have presented evidence and not proceeded and relied on mere conjecture and hearsay evidence.<br><br>The contention of petitioner Kilosbayan – that it is the Comelec that is duty-bound to search for evidence to prove its letter-complaint – is downright erroneous. The task of the Comelec as investigator and prosecutor, acting upon any election offenses complaint, is not the physical searching and gathering of proof in support of a complaint for an alleged commission of an election offense. A complainant, who in effect accuses another person of having committed an act constituting an election offense, has the burden, as it is his responsibility, to follow through his accusation and prove his complaint. If the complainant fails to proffer the necessary evidence to show probable cause, notwithstanding the lack of denial or any evidence in controversion, of the accusation, the complaint must be dismissed, since any person accused of a crime is presumed innocent and does not at all have to make a response or reaction to charges against him.<br><br>The Comelec, is acting upon an election offense complaint in the course of preliminary investigation, initially facilitates the confrontation process between the complainant and the respondents by requiring the submission of and interfacing, their respective evidences. Ultimately, the Comelec passes upon the contending parties' respective submissions and proof and weighs the fact and circumstances established therefrom. Contrary to the asseveration of petitioner Kilosbayan, the preliminary investigation is not an occasion for Comelec to, as a duty, spoonfeed the complainant with evidence needed to prove its case.<br><br>Finally, we cannot avoid the point out that no novel legal theory can distract even an ordinary layman from the plain dearth of evidence of respondents’ culpability on the record.<br><br>There is no proof of the electioneering activities alleged by petitioner Kilosbayan to have been perpetrated by PYHSDFI during the May 11,1992 elections. Petitioner claims the PYHSDFI distributed medical kits and sports equipment to several youth groups in certain Metro Manila barangays for purposes of influencing their vote during the May 11, 1992 elections. Petitioner, however, vaguely states the places where, the dates when, the particular candidate for whose cause, and the general description of the people for whose consumption, the distribution of election propaganda materials was undertaken. In fact, there is no proof that the medical kits and sports equipment were election propaganda materials. This is not surprising for there is the barest evidence that this distribution had taken place at all.<br><br>There is no proof that PYHSDFI used its cash allocations as an accredited non-governmental organization in order to undertake electioneering activities. Petitioner likewise did not present proof that said distribution of medical kits and sports equipment was for purposes of influencing the votes of certain groups of people during the May 11, 1992 elections. Brushing aside these fatal evidentiary lapses, petitioner insists that PYHSDFI is guilty of using public funds for electioneering purposes simply because it received its CDF allocation within a time frame suspiciously so near the May 11, 1992 elections. This CDF allocation, however, has been convincingly shown to be a legal disbursement of public funds. Significantly, PYHSDFI neither presented rebuttal evidence nor even attempted to argue against the presumption of regular performance of official duty on the part of respondents like Franklin Drilon, Cesar Sarino, and Salvador Enriquez who were then acting in their official capacity as heads of their respective departments.<br><br>It may even be conceded that petitioner tells a credible story, it being too much of coincidence for there to be, on the one hand, rumors of electioneering activities on the part of PYHSDFI and on the other, genuine cash allotments showing disbursement of public funds to the latter so coincidentally close to the May, 1992 elections. However, no matter how believable a story may be, no matter how possible it could really have been that PYHSDFI was financial conduit for criminal elements working for the interest of a particular candidate in the 1992 elections, criminal charges cannot ever be sanctioned by mere possibilities or coffee shop rumors.<br><br>In other words, said cash allocations appear to be evidence of perhaps, a thousand hypothetical, though, possible scenarios. But, they are evidence of only one fact: that a certain amount of public money was made available to PYHSDFI as it is rightfully entitled thereto as an accredited non-governmental organization at around the same time that the synchronized elections of 1992 were to be held. But this one fact is certainly no justification to indict herein respondents for election offenses imputed to them.<br><br>Lastly, there is no proof that respondents conspired to have PYHSDFI accredited as non-government organization in order to avail itself of public funds to spend for electioneering purposes. In order for there to be reasonable ground to believe that a conspiracy exists among (1) the government officials who set up the mechanism for the accrediting NGOs to implement the project under the CDF and to qualify the latter to receive CDF allocations; (2) the incorporators and officers of the PYHSDFI; and (3) the SHO implicated by Teodoro Benigno in his newspaper articles in alleged electioneering activities during the May 11, 1992 elections, there must be a semblance of evidence linking them to each other. There is none, however, except for hearsay evidence consisting of the aforementioned newspaper articles. Suffice it is say that although only a low quantum and quanlity of evidence is needed to support a finding of probable cause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>, the same cannot be justified upon hearsay evidence that is never given any evidentiary or probative value in this jurisdiction.<br><br>Incidentally, we note that although made party respondents in this case, Benito Catindig and Manuel Calupitan III were not officially made respondents in E.O. Case No. 93-193 and accordingly not served with subpoena at any time during the pendency of said case before the Comelec. There is no ground, therefore, to implead Benito Catindig and Manuel Calupitan III in the instant case.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, </span>the instant petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED,</span> without any pronouncement as to costs.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, and Torres, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., J.,</i> in the result.<br><i>Regalado, and Francisco, JJ.,</i> on leave.<br><i>Romero, J., </i>took no part due to personal reasons.<br><i>Puno, and Panganiban, JJ.,</i> took no part due to relationship to one of the parties.<br><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Reproduced in the Comment of respondent Franklin Drilon dated April 11, 1997.
