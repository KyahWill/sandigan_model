				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">May possession of a lot encroached upon by a part of another's house be recovered in an action for ejectment?<br><br>This is the main question raised by the petition for review on certiorari assailing the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, Sixth Division,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 24, 1992, in CA-G.R. SP No. 26853 denying due course to petitioner's appeal and affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig in Civil Case No. 61004, which in turn affirmed the decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court of San Juan, Metro Manila, Branch 58.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>On January 22, 1986, petitioners Rafael and Avelina Benitez purchased a 303-square-meter parcel of land with improvement from the Cavite Development Bank, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 41961 (now, TCT No. 55864).<br><br>Subsequently, private respondents Renato and Elizabeth Macapagal bought a 361-square-meter lot covered by TCT No. 40155. On September 18, 1986, they filed Civil Case No. 53835 with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Branch 157 against petitioners for the recovery of possession of an encroached portion of the lot they purchased. The parties were able to reach a compromise in which private respondents sold the encroached portion to petitioners at the acquisition cost of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) per square meter.<br><br>On July 17, 1989, private respondents purchased still another property, a 285.70 square-meter-lot covered by TCT No. 3249-R, adjacent to that of petitioners. After a relocation survey was conducted, private respondents discovered that some 46.50 square meters of their property was occupied by petitioners' house. Despite verbal and written demands, petitioners refused to vacate. A last notice to vacate was sent to petitioners on October 26, 1989.<br><br>On January 18, 1990, private respondents filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of San Juan, Branch 58, Civil Case No. 61004 for ejectment against petitioners. The MeTC of San Juan decided in favor of the former, with the following disposition:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered for the plaintiffs and against the defendants ordering them and all persons claiming rights under them to vacate and surrender possession of the subject premises to the plaintiffs as well as to pay the following:<br><br>1. The amount of P930.00 a month starting July 17, 1989 until they finally vacate the subject premises;<br><br>2. The amount of P5,000.00 for and as attorney's fees; and<br><br>3. Cost of suit."</blockquote>On appeal, the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Branch 167, affirmed said decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The RTC said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><blockquote> "The controversy in this case is not an encroachment or overlapping of two (2) adjacent properties owned by the parties. It is a case where a part of the house of the defendants is constructed on a portion of the property of the plaintiffs. So that as new owner of the real property, who has a right to the full enjoyment and possession of the entire parcel covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 41961, plaintiffs have the right to demand that defendants remove the portion of the house standing on plaintiff's realty. . . ."</blockquote>The dispositive portion thereof reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, it being more consistent with the facts and the law applicable, the same is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. Costs against the defendant-appellants.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>On further appeal, the respondent Court found no merit in petitioners' plea. In a Resolution dated March 24, 1992, the Sixth Division of said Court found the petition to be a mere rehash of the issues and arguments presented before the lower courts. It ruled in part that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote>"3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners were fully aware that part of their house encroached on their neighbor's property, while respondents became aware of it only after purchasing said property. Petitioners cannot claim good faith as against the respondents.<br><br>"4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since petitioners are not builders in good faith, they cannot demand that respondents sell the disputed portion; what the law provides is that the builders in bad faith can be ordered to dismantle said structure at their own expense. In the interim period that petitioners' structure remains, they should pay reasonable rent until they remove the structure."</blockquote>The dispositive portion thereof reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"For reasons indicated, We find the appeal without merit and deny it due course, with costs against the petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Hence, this petition.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>The main issue is whether the possession of the portion of the private respondents' land encroached by petitioners' house can be recovered through an action of ejectment, not accion publiciana. Corollarily, petitioners question (a) the validity of the imposition of "rental" for the occupancy of the encroached portion, (b) the denial of their claimed pre-emptive right to purchase the encroached portion of the private respondents' land, and (c) the propriety of a factual review of the CA's finding of bad faith on the part of petitioners.<br><br>In a nutshell, petitioners insist that the MeTC had no jurisdiction over the case at bar because its real nature is accion publiciana or recovery of possession, not unlawful detainer. It is not forcible entry because private respondents did not have prior possession of the contested property as petitioners possessed it ahead of private respondents. It is not unlawful detainer because petitioners were not the private respondents' tenants nor vendee unlawfully withholding possession thereof. Said court also has no jurisdiction to impose payment of "rentals" as there is no lessor-lessee relationship between the parties. They pray for a review of the factual finding of bad faith, insisting that the facts uphold their position. Due to their alleged good faith, they claim the pre-emptive right to purchase the litigated portion as a matter of course. Finally, they insist that the award of attorney's fees is unwarranted as private respondents allegedly had knowledge of the encroachment prior to their acquisition of said land.<br><br>Private respondents counter that petitioners are estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the MeTC after they voluntarily participated in the trial on the merits and lost; that there is no law giving petitioners the option to buy the encroached property; and that petitioners acted in bad faith because they waived in their deed of sale the usual seller's warranty as to the absence of any and all liens and encumbrances on the property, thereby implying they had knowledge of the encroachment at the time of purchase .<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></div><br>The petition lacks merit and should be denied.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Issue: MeTC Has Jurisdiction</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><br>The jurisdictional requirements for ejectment, as borne out by the facts, are: after conducting a relocation survey, private respondents discovered that a portion of their land was encroached by petitioners' house; notices to vacate were sent to petitioners, the last one being dated October 26, 1989; and private respondents filed the ejectment suit against petitioners on January 18, 1990 or within one (1) year from the last demand.<br><br>Private respondents' cause of action springs from Sec. 1, Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Who may institute proceedings, and when</i> -- Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal representatives or assigns of any such landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person, may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper inferior court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs. . . ."</blockquote><br>That petitioners occupied the land prior to private respondents' purchase thereof does not negate the latter's case for ejectment. Prior possession is not always a condition sine qua non in ejectment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This is one of the distinctions between forcible entry and unlawful detainer. In forcible entry, the plaintiff is deprived of physical possession of his land or building by means of force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth; thus, he must allege and prove prior possession. But in unlawful detainer, the defendant unlawfully withholds possession after the expiration or termination of his right thereto under any contract, express or implied. In such a case, prior physical possession is not required. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Possession can also be acquired, not only by material occupation, but also by the fact that a thing is subject to the action of one's will or by the proper acts and legal formalities established for acquiring such right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Possession of land can be acquired upon the execution of the deed of sale thereof by its vendor. Actual or physical occupation is not always necessary.<br><br>In the case before us, considering that private respondents are unlawfully deprived of possession of the encroached land and that the action for the recovery of possession thereof was made within the one- year reglementary period, ejectment is the proper remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The MeTC of San Juan had jurisdiction.<br><br>In addition, after voluntarily submitting themselves to its proceedings, petitioners are estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of the MeTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This Court will not allow petitioners to attack the jurisdiction of the trial court after receiving a decision adverse to their position.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Issue: Compensation For Occupancy</span><br></div><br>Petitioners erroneously construed the order of the MeTC to pay private respondents Nine Hundred Thirty Pesos (P930.00) a month starting July 17, 1989 until they (petitioners) finally vacate the subject premises as "rentals". Technically, such award is not rental, but damages. Damages are recoverable in ejectment cases under Section 8, Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> These damages arise from the loss of the use and occupation of the property, and not the damages which private respondents may have suffered but which have no direct relation to their loss of material possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Damages in the context of Section 8, Rule 70 is limited to "rent" or "fair rental value" for the use and occupation of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>There is no question that petitioners benefited from their occupation of a portion of private respondents' property. Such benefit justifies the award of the damages of this kind. Nemo cum alterius, detrimenti locupletari potest. No one shall enrich himself at the expense of another.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Issue: Option To Sell Belongs To Owner</span><br></div><br>Article 448 of the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is unequivocal that the option to sell the land on which another in good faith builds, plants or sows on, belongs to the landowner.<br><br>The option is to sell, not to buy, and it is the landowner's choice. Not even a declaration of the builder, planter, or sower's bad faith shifts this option to him per Article 450 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This advantage in Article 448 is accorded the landowner because "his right is older, and because, by the principle of accession, he is entitled to the ownership of the accessory thing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> There can be no pre-emptive right to buy even as a compromise, as this prerogative belongs solely to the landowner. No compulsion can be legally forced on him, contrary to what petitioners asks from this Court. Such an order would certainly be invalid and illegal. Thus, the lower courts were correct in rejecting the petitioners' offer to buy the encroached land.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourth Issue: A Review of Factual Findings Is Unwarranted</span><br></div><br>Petitioners ask this Court to review the alleged error of the respondent Court in appreciating bad faith on their part. According to them, this is contradictory to the fact that private respondents acquired their lot and discovered the encroachment after petitioners bought their house. After careful deliberation on this issue, this Court finds this petition for review inadequate as it failed to show convincingly a reversible error on the part of the respondent Court in this regard. Thus, for very good reasons, this Court has consistently and emphatically declared that review of the factual findings of the Court of Appeals is not a function that is normally undertaken in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Such findings, as a general rule, are binding and conclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The jurisdiction of this Court is limited to reviewing errors of law unless there is a showing that the findings complained of are totally devoid of support in the records or that they are so glaringly erroneous as to constitute reversible error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Even respondent Court has taken note of the inadequacy of the petition before it, as it wryly said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>"The Petition for Review is not certainly a manifestation of clarity nor an example of a well-organized summation of petitioners' cause of action. . . . . .<br><br>xxx xxx xxx<br><br>A careful scrutiny of the above issues discloses that they are mere repetitions in a rehashed form of the same issues with the same supporting arguments raised by petitioners when they appealed from the decision of the (MeTC) to the RTC. x x x."<br><br>This petition is no different. We share the foregoing sentiments of the respondent Court. In essence, respondent Court merely affirmed the decision of the MeTC. The Court of Appeal's finding of petitioners' bad faith did not alter nor affect the MeTC's disposition. Petitioners want this Court to declare them in good faith and to determine their rights under Article 448, Civil Code. However, the mere fact that they bought their property ahead of the private respondents does not establish this point. Nor does it prove that petitioners had no knowledge of the encroachment when they purchased their property. Reliance on the presumption in Article 526 of the Code is misplaced in view of the declaration of the respondent Court that petitioners are not builders in good faith.<br><br>What petitioners presented are mere allegations and arguments, without sufficient evidence to support them. As such, we have no ground to depart from the general rule against factual review.<br><br>In sum, the petition has not shown cogent reasons and sufficient grounds to reverse the unanimous ruling of the three lower courts. The MeTC, RTC and the Court of Appeals were all in agreement in sustaining private respondents' rights. And we uphold them.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
