				<BR><STRONG>FRANCISCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Sometime in 1987, petitioner Aboitiz Shipping Employees Association filed a complaint for non-compliance with the mandated minimum wage under P.D. Nos. 1713,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 1751,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Wage Order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 against Aboitiz Shipping Corporation (ASC) before the National Capital Region (NCR) Regional Office of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Upon receipt of the complaint, an inspection of the ASC’s premises and employment records was accordingly conducted by the NCR Regional Director<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> who after and evaluation of the evidence adduced by the parties, issued an order the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Aboitiz Shipping Corporation is hereby Ordered to pay herein listed complainants the total amount of ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT and 00/100 PESOS (P1, 350,828.00) representing underpayment of daily allowance of TWO (P2.00) pesos per day reckoned from 16 February 1982 to 15 February 1985.<br><br>“FURTHER, the Aboitiz Shipping Corporation is hereby Ordered to pay each and every one of its employees the deficiency in allowance of TWO (P2.00) Pesos per day from 16 February 1985 onward until this Order is fully complied with.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>ASC interposed an appeal, which the Secretary of Labor dismissed. ASC’s subsequent motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.<br><br>On petition for certiorari, we affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the foregoing order with modification, as we excluded Mr. Elizardo Manuel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> from the list of complainants entitled to the monetary award. Dissatisfied, ASC filed a motion for reconsideration raising both jurisdictional and factual issues. We denied with finality the said motion in our Resolution promulgated on July 25, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On August 6, 1991, petitioner filed a motion for the issuance of an alias writ of execution before the Regional Director which granted the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> However, on appeal by ASC, public respondent Secretary of Labor “set aside” the order of execution and declared the creation of a Special Committee that will compute the exact amount of ASC’s liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The committee then proceeded to re-evaluate the records of the case, together with ASC’s newly adduced evidence consisting of company payrolls.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereafter, it submitted a Report reducing the original award form P1,350,828.00 to P209,183.42, which public respondent approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that an order of execution in not appealable and that public respondent has no jurisdiction to reduce the Regional Director’s award, it being already final and executory. The motion, however, was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In this petition, petitioner insists that public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in modifying the final and executory decision of the Regional Director awarding petitioner the sum of P1,350,828.00.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><blockquote>Public respondent justified the reduction of the Regional Director’s award on the basis of the Special Committee’s findings that, “except for a minimal adjustment due to the late implementaion of some of the Wage Orders, ASC has complied with P.D. 1678,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> P.D. 1751, and Wage Order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> We cannot, however, approve the said findings considering that ASC’s liability to petitioner under the aforementioned laws and wage orders has long been settled by no less than this Court in Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Hon. Dionisio de la Serna, et. al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> where we affirmed the Regional Director’s order awarding the sum of P1,350,828.00 to herein petitioner. Thus, as correctly held by the Regional Director, the aforementioned judgment having been already final and executory, the amount adjudged therein should be the subject of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>We are of course well aware of the rule authorizing the court to modify or alter a judgment even after the same has become executory, whenever circumstances transpire rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, this rule, we must emphasize, applies only to cases where the facts or circumstances authorizing such modification or alteration transpired after the judgment has become final and executory. It does not apply in this case wherein public respondent’s basis for the modification of the final and executory judgment was clearly the very same evidence which ASC, despite having been given opportunity, failed to adduce during the hearing on the merits of the case.<br><br>We thus reiterate our settled rule that, except for correction of clerical errors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> or the making of nunc pro tunc entries which causes no prejudice to any party<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or where the judgment is void, after the judgment has become final and executory, the same can neither be amended nor altered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> even if the purpose is to correct a perceived conclusion of fact or of law. This is true regardless of whether the modification is to be made by the magistrate that rendered the judgment, or by the appellate magistrate that reviewed the same. Indeed, all litigation must come to an end however unjust the result of error may appear. Otherwise, litigation would even be more intolerable than the wrong or injustice it is designed to correct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the instant petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.
