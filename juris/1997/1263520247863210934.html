(sic)&nbsp; That while urinating, he heard voices of people coming from the communal water system.&nbsp; That he fell asleep at about 4:00 in the afternoon and woke up between 5:00 and 6:00 in the same afternoon.&nbsp; That when he woke up, he went home and noticed BBB and CCC in their yard.&nbsp; That when he reached home, he took a bath and changed his clothes to go to his stall at the ‘talipapa’ in xxx.&nbsp; That it is not true that he raped AAA.&nbsp; That it is not also true that he was on top of AAA and inserted his sex organ inside her private part.&nbsp; That he was then sleeping.&nbsp; That there was no occasion that (sic) BBB confronted him on that day.&nbsp; That there was a misunderstanding that existed between him and BBB and/or his children in the past because they envy (sic) him since their (accused) financial standing improved.&nbsp; That there are (sic) times that they fought with each other that resulted to (sic) bodily harm/physical injuries.<br><br>PURIFICACION ROLDAN substantially testified that on September 30, 1988 between 5:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon she was at the artesian well located along the roadside fetching water.&nbsp; That there were many people fetching water at that time.&nbsp; That she the accused sleeping in the house of his (accused) sister located about two meters away from the faucet with the door and windows opened. (sic)&nbsp; That the accused was sleeping because he was drunk.&nbsp; That she saw AAA entered (sic) the house and stood (sic) inside the house and after about 30 seconds, her (AAA’s) father and CCC arrived and took her.&nbsp; That the house of the sister of the accused and the house of AAA is around four to five meters away.&nbsp; That after AAA was brought home, there was altercation between AAA’s father BBB and the accused.&nbsp; That they had a long time grudge and she saw them having heated argument on the New Year of 1988.<br><br>DOMINGO JUBILLA substantially testified that on September 30, 1988 at 9:00 in the morning he was in the house of the accused at xxx, Metro Manila on occasion of the baptismal party of the child of his (witness) elder brother Renato alias Boy held in the house of the accused because his brother do (sic) not own yet a house.&nbsp; That upon arriving in the house of the accused, he, his elder brother, the accused and the latter’s elder brother had a drinking spree at the terrace of the house of the accused that lasted up to 5:00 in the afternoon.&nbsp; That at 5:00 in the afternoon, they left the accused sleeping in the house of his sister about one house away to (sic) the house of the accused.&nbsp; That he know (sic) that the accused was sleeping because they located him upon his (accused) wife (sic) request and found him sleeping inside his sister’s house.&nbsp; That upon seeing the accused sleeping, they prepared to leave and go home.&nbsp; That they left the house of the accused at about 5:30 in the afternoon.&nbsp; That while in the house of the accused, he saw BBB and AAA in their house looking out their window.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Trial Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>Granting full credence and probative weight to the prosecution witnesses’ testimonies, the trial court, on September 2, 1991, rendered its Decision convicting the appellant, viz.:<br><br>“In sum, the Court is convinced beyond doubt of the existence and commission of the offense.&nbsp; AAA’s mental deficiency, her lack of sufficient discretion, judgment and moral courage to seriously resist was taken advantage of by the accused who is experienced in the ways of life.<br><br>WHEREFORE, finding the accused Rodolfo San Juan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged in the complaint, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law and to pay the costs.<br><br>Accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the offended party the sum of P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><center><br><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>In his appeal brief, appellant through Counsel Manuel A.

Her positive identification of Rodolfo San Juan as the one who raped her is credible because she knew and recognized Appellant San Juan, her neighbor.<br><br>Furthermore,&nbsp; AAA’s mental age lends credence to her testimony. Considering her childlike naiveté and innocence, it is indeed highly unlikely for her to testify so tenaciously and convincingly on the details of the rape if she has not in fact suffered such crime at the hands of appellant.&nbsp; It has been held that “no woman especially one who is of tender age would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter permit herself to be subjected to a public trial, if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>No Fixed Reaction to a Shocking Crime</i></b><br></center><br>The defense assails the credibility of BBB and AAA’s testimonies by asserting that some portions thereof are “at odd (sic) with natural human experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> BBB allegedly saw the appellant raping his daughter for one or two minutes, yet he and his son<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> who was then with him did not stop the alleged rape or utter a word of outrage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Appellant argues further that “[i]f it were true that she was raped and shouted for help, then the people present in the artesian well fetching water should have heard her considering that the well is only 3 or 4 meters away from the place of the incident.&nbsp; Experience has proved beyond cavil that when a lady is being abused, she will shout on the top of her voice to attract the attention of the persons around the vicinity to lend a helping hand.&nbsp; This is specially true in the present case considering that AAA never testified that the appellant covered her mouth during the incident.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>After a thorough study of the records in this case, the Court is convinced that the reaction of BBB and his son, CCC, when they witnessed the rape of AAA, is not contrary to human experience as to be unbelievable.&nbsp; We have repeatedly ruled that “the workings of the human mind placed under a great deal of emotional and psychological stress (such as during rape) are unpredictable, and different people react differently.&nbsp; There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling, frightful or traumatic experience -- some may shout, some may faint, and some may be shocked into insensibility.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In People vs. Villaruel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Appellant Villaruel assailed Eyewitness Rosaleo Cagado’s “supposed unusual behavior in just watching appellant assault his victim instead of putting a stop to it, or at least calling for help.”&nbsp; The Court ruled there that “(w)hile it may be true that Rosaleo Cagado acted in a rather odd manner, he could not be faulted for being indecisive.&nbsp; <i>There is no standard rule by which witnesses to a crime may react thereto.</i>”&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)&nbsp; In the present case, that Eyewitnesses BBB and CCC had probably been shocked into inaction at the sight of Appellant San Juan raping AAA should not detract from the credibility of their testimonies.<br><br>Nonetheless, it should be observed that BBB and his son subsequently recovered from their shock and sprang in pursuit of the appellant. This may be gleaned from the testimonies of both father and daughter.&nbsp; AAA testified to the following:<br><blockquote>“FISCAL xxx:<br><br>That is very fair to the witness, I am only asking if (she) had seen her father.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Witness may answer.<br><br>WITNESS:<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him through the window.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about Mang Rudy, what did he do when he saw your father through the window?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mang Rudy saw my father, he ran away.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>This confirms the following testimony of BBB:<br><br>“Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened when you arrived at that house finding your daughter and the accused in that position and appearance?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he rose up and put on his pair of short pants his brief and short pants and jumped out of the window.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What did you do when you saw the accused jumped out of the window?</span><br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We chased him.</span><br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you said ‘we’, who was your companion in chasing the accused?</span><br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son CCC.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did the accused go?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He jumped over the fence, I did not follow him anymore and he proceeded to his house.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you do when you desisted from chasing the accused up to his house?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned to the place where my daughter was.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Corollarily, in stating that he watched the rape for one or two minutes, BBB did not necessarily determine the duration on the basis of a timepiece.&nbsp; He merely gave an estimate of what then felt to him to be one or two minutes.&nbsp; His subjective sense of time under such distressful circumstances cannot be deemed exactly accurate.<br><br>Equally bereft of merit is the argument of the defense that AAA’s testimony is incredible.&nbsp; Appellant contended that her alleged cries for help would have been heard by the people fetching water from the artesian well just three or four meters from the nearby house.&nbsp; But as the Solicitor General astutely and correctly states, “(b)eing a mentally retarded woman, and in a state of shock and surprise, AAA may have mistaken her plea for help as loud outcries albeit in truth, her voice was muffled.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Her voice could have been silenced by shock.&nbsp; This was supported by the fact that at no instance did AAA testify that her mouth had been covered by appellant.<br><br>Parenthetically, that the rape took place in a house with people nearby does not diminish the credibility of AAA’s rape charge.&nbsp; “In a long line of rape cases, the Court has held that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises and even inside a house where there are other occupants or where other members of the family are also sleeping.&nbsp; Lust is no respecter of time and place.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Hymenal Laceration Not Vital to Proving Rape<br></div><br>The defense submits that “Dr. xxx, the Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI who conducted the medical examination on the victim, x x x ruled out the commission of rape on the date complained of and alleged in the Information instituted by the Fiscal.&nbsp; The victim was examined on October 1, 1988 whereas, the alleged commission of the rape took place on September 30, 1988.&nbsp; And Dr. xxx found out that the injury in the hymen of the victime (sic) was inflicted more than three (3) months before the medical examination.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>This argument does not defeat AAA’s assertion that Appellant San Juan raped her that fateful afternoon.&nbsp; We reiterate the well-settled doctrine that “x x x lack of lacerated wounds does not negate sexual intercourse.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that hymenal lacerations were found to be ‘healed round edge’ and that no spermatozoa was found does not necessarily negate rape.&nbsp; A freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.&nbsp; For that matter, in crimes against chastity, the medical examination of the victim is not an indispensable element for the successful prosecution of the crime, as her testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict the accused thereof,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> as in this case.&nbsp; The fact that AAA had an old, healed hymenal laceration only gives credence to her testimony that she was raped several times before by the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Mental Retardate Incapable of Giving Consent<br></div><br>The mere fact that AAA was mentally retarded, the defense argues, “should not work against the appellant as the former is a normal person after all.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In support of this contention, the defense cites the testimony of prosecution witness and psychiatrist, Dr. xxx:<br><blockquote>“Fiscal xxx:&nbsp; (To the witness)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to solicit your opinion on this matter whether a person although 26 years old but with a mental state of 5 years and 10 months child, can resist seriously a sexual abuse on her person?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a mental age of 5 years old, but she can be placed in equal footing to a normal person.&nbsp; (TSN, December 17, 1990, p. 13).”<br><br>The defense then quotes from her cross-examination as follows:<br><br>“Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if your actual age is 26 but your mental age is 5 years old only, is there still coherency (of) action or intelligence in the answer that you can extract from the subject?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that would be equivalent to her mental age (TSN, December 17, 1990, p. 24).<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in layman’s language, please explain to us your findings on the subject that she is coherent.<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coherent is tama ang sinasabi (TSN, December 17, 1990, pp. 25-26).”<br></blockquote>Dr. xxx’s testimony, that AAA was coherent and able to communicate her perceptions on the stand, cannot in any way support the submission that she was a “normal person” capable of giving lawful consent to a sexual intercourse.&nbsp; The defense overlooked well-entrenched doctrines laid down by this Court, to wit:<br><br>“The issue x x x that a mentally retarded woman could not have given valid and legal consent to the sexual act is not new.&nbsp; In the case of People vs. Manlapaz, 88 SCRA 704, We held that the victim, 13 years old at the time of the commission of the act but with the mentality of a 5-year old child, ‘is incapable of giving rational consent to the carnal intercourse.’&nbsp; And in the case of People vs. Gallano, 108 SCRA 405, the judgment of conviction by the trial court was affirmed by Us because complainant DDD, who was then 31 years old at the commission of the act but had the mentality of a 7-year old child, ‘is a retardate or one mentally ill, such that she was incapable of offering any effective or real resistance to appellant’s sexual assault (p.407, Id.). x x x Her mental condition was such that she would not resist sexual advances because she was so deprived of reason to make any effective resistance.&nbsp; Hence, by being so deprived, the act is made possible in the same way when there is active resistance but same is overcome by force and threat, which is the essence of the crime of rape (p. 413, Id).’<br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assuming that complainant x x x voluntarily submitted herself to the bestial desire of appellant still the crime committed is rape under paragraph 3 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; This is so even if the circumstances of force and intimidation, or of the victim being deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious are absent. The victim has the mentality of a child below seven years old.&nbsp; If sexual intercourse with a victim under twelve years of age is rape, then it should follow that carnal knowledge with a seventeen-year old girl whose mental age is that of a seven year old child would constitute rape.”</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">[30]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)<br></div><br>In any case, Dr. xxx’s assertions support the earlier conclusion regarding the admissibility of AAA’s testimony in view of the quality of her perceptions and her ability to communicate these to the court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">No False Accusation of Rape<br></div><br>The contention of the defense that “the complaint was initiated merely because of the long time grudge by BBB on (sic) the appellant,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> deserves scant consideration.&nbsp; We reiterate that “it is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an engine of malice, especially if it will subject a daughter to embarrasment and even stigma.”&nbsp; It is plainly inconceivable that BBB would expose his mentally retarded daughter AAA, whom he had loved and cared for through the years, to the travails and indignities accompanying a rape trial out of mere spite for his neighbor Rodolfo San Juan over some petty spats.&nbsp; Indeed, it is improbable that a father would prejudice his own daughter if he “was not motivated by an honest desire to have the culprit punished.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence<br></div><br>In sum, the Court finds AAA’s testimony, together with the testimonies of the other witnesses of the prosecution, overwhelmingly straightforward, logical and convincing as to be worthy of belief and impervious to a mere denial by Appellant San Juan.&nbsp; “It is a well-settled rule that an affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony, especially so when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Therefore, we agree with the trial court that the evidence for the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Appellant Rodolfo San Juan is guilty of the crime of rape.&nbsp; This conclusion is reached pleno jure.&nbsp; However, the indemnity of P20,000.00 awarded by the trial court to AAA must be increased to P50,000.00 pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED and the questioned Decision of the trial court, finding Appellant Rodolfo San Juan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and imposing on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua, is hereby AFFIRMED.&nbsp; The indemnity in favor of Complainant AAA is hereby INCREASED to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Melo,</i> and <i>Francisco,JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="left" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 19-26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Judge Adriano R.
