Each applicant was to be charged a placement fee of P45,000.00. The parties agreed to meet again on 12 April 1992 at the Dr. Yares Clinic in Baguio City. On the appointed date and time, Mona Gabres alone showed up to meet with the applicants. The latter were joined, in this meeting, by Tarciso Dacsig, Jr., Jonard Dulay and Ronaldo Mirabueno, who all promised to also come up with the required "placement fees."<br><br>At the respective dates stated below, the accused spouses received the following amounts from each of the applicants; thus:<br><br><table Â ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" height="21" width="36%"><div align="left">"DATE OF PAYMENT </div></th><td width="34%"><div align="left"><strong>NAME OF PAYOR</strong></div></td><td width="30%"><div align="left"><strong>AMOUNT</strong></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">1.

The promise was not fulfilled. Then, in order to appease the applicants, the spouses explained that it was only the call of the Korean employer, Mr. Kim, that was being awaited so as to firm up the flight schedule. The call never came. After a series of follow-ups, the applicants were directed by the spouses to confer with the latter's supposed associate in Manila, one Rebecca (Vicky) Naval, who was said to be managing the Bachs and Cochs Travel Agency. Naval initially denied any association with the Gabreses; she later, however, told the group that she had been engaged by the spouses to process the travel documents, plane tickets and flight bookings of the applicants, and that the required visas were already being applied for.<br><br>After several more months of waiting and still getting nowhere, the applicants finally demanded the return of their money from the spouses.

It is, of course, unfortunate that the husband, at least momentarily, is able to ward off the long arm of the law; nevertheless, it should, in the end, still catch up with him.<br><br>Accused-appellant has indeed committed estafa by means of deceit punishable under Article 315 (2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The trial court's brief ratiocination is well taken; viz:<br><br>"There is no dispute that damages have been incurred by the complainants. They parted with their money in consideration of deployment for work in a foreign country, but which unfortunately remains unrestituted despite the failure in that regard of the person or persons who promised that they will be sent off to work abroad."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant is likewise guilty of illegal recruitment in large scale, an offense under Article 38(b), in relation to Article 39, of the Labor Code which provides:<br><br>"ART. 38. Illegal Recruitment. - (a) Any recruitment activities, including the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority shall be deemed illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this Code.

Penalties. - (a) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein." <br><br>Quite appropriately, the trial court has observed:<br><br>"(T)here are two elements of the crime (of illegal recruitment), namely: (1) that the offender is a non-licensee or non-holder of authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers; and (2) that the offender undertakes any of the recruitment activities defined under Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code, as amended, or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the same code. (PEOPLE vs. CORAL, G.R. Nos. 97849-54, March 1, 1994, 230 SCRA 499). Without any doubt, this Court finds the two elements of the crime present in the case at bar. That the accused are non-licensees or non-holders of authority to lawfully recruit is evident in the certification issued by Atty. Justinian Lichnachan of the POEA-CAR Regional Extension Office of Baguio City (Exhibit `D,' 93-CR-1800). Article 13(b) of the Labor Code defines recruitment and placement as `any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, that any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.' The act of the accused in holding out a placement fee of P45,000.00 per applicant in exchange for an employment abroad; the several collections made by them; and their promise to send off the applicants for work in Korea were just some of the circumstances that would qualify the acts of the accused under the definition of recruitment and placement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, would have to reduce the award of actual damages to Oreta Nisperos from P55,000.00 to P50,000.00. Oreta concededly could not present any receipt for the supposed payments she allegedly made on 26 April 1992 and on 05 May 1992, for P5,000.00 each, on behalf of Ramil Nisperos. Joel Panida, in his testimony, attested to the payment made on 26 April 1992[18] but no similar evidence was presented to prove the payment made on 05 May 1992.<br><br>Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br>"ART 315. Swindling (estafa). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:<br><br>"1st. The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period to prision mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such case, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be;<br><br>"2nd.

By arresto mayor in its medium and maximum periods, if such amount does not exceed 200 pesos, provided that in the four cases mentioned, the fraud be committed by any of the following means."<br><br>Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum term of the penalty shall be "that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed" under the Revised Penal Code, and the minimum shall be "within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed" for the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The penalty next lower should be based on the penalty prescribed by the Code for the offense, without first considering any modifying circumstance attendant to the commission of the crime.[20] The determination of the minimum penalty is left by law to the sound discretion of the court and it can be anywhere within the range of the penalty next lower without any reference to the periods into which it might be subdivided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup>The modifying circumstances are considered only in the imposition of the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The fact that the amounts involved in the instant case exceed P22,000.00 should not be considered in the initial determination of the indeterminate penalty; instead, the matter should be so taken as analogous to modifying circumstances in the imposition of the maximum term of the full indeterminate sentence. This interpretation of the law accords with the rule that penal laws should be construed in favor of the accused. Since the penalty prescribed by law for the estafa charge against accused-appellant is prision correccional maximum to prision mayor minimum, the penalty next lower would then be prision correccional minimum to medium. Thus, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence should be anywhere within six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months while the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence should at least be six (6) years and one (1) day because the amounts involved exceeded P22,000.00, plus an additional one (1) year for each additional P10,000.00.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court thus finds some need to modify in part the penalties imposed by the trial court; viz:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 93-CR-1800, the amount involved is P45,000.00. Hence, the minimum penalty should be reduced to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional, which is the maximum of the allowable minimum penalty of the indeterminate sentence. The maximum penalty imposed by the court a quo is within lawful range.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 93-CR-1801, the amount involved, as so modified by this Court, is P50,000.00. The minimum penalty should then be reduced to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional (the maximum of the minimum of the indeterminate sentence).
