When arraigned, Ramos and Disipulo pleaded not guilty to the charges.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The evidence for the prosecution. -</span><br><br></div><br>On 12 January 1991, Fidel Manio and Saturnina Boiser, with eight-year old Mark Anthony Malinao, were on board a "Toyota Tamaraw" on their way to Calumpit, Bulacan. When the vehicle momentarily stopped at the "Malolos crossing," Manuzon, a distant relative and former worker of Manio, approached the vehicle and asked Manio if he (Manuzon) and his three companions, namely, Bayan, Ramos and Disipulo, could be allowed to hitchhike. Manio acceded. The "hitchhikers" took the backseat of the vehicle. At the Alido Heights along MacArthur Highway, however, Disipulo abruptly pointed a gun at Manio while Bayan held a bladed weapon against Saturnina Boiser. Ramos showed that he was armed with a hand grenade. Disipulo directed Manio to proceed to Heritage Subdivision. Arriving at the place, Manuzon and Bayan demanded from Manio the payroll cash intended for his shop workers. Manio instructed posthaste Saturnina Boiser to hand over the money, amounting to P18,000.00, to the accused. Disipulo asked Manuzon, "Totodasin ko na ba?" Manuzon replied, “Todasin mo na." Bayan, after getting Manio's wallet, ring, wristwatch and other personal belongings, forthwith stabbed Manio. Saturnina Boiser attempted to grab the weapon from Bayan but Ramos held her. Struggling to get free, she fell to the ground. Instantly, Ramos delivered three stab blows on her. The four malefactors took the vehicle and sped away. Young Malinao was on board the vehicle. After some time, the group returned to the scene but they failed to find Manio and Saturnina Boiser. The two managed to hide from the group.<br><br>Manio and Saturnina Boiser were brought by good samaritans to the Calumpit District Hospital and, from there, to the Makati Medical Center.<br><br>The culprits tied and gagged Malinao and left him on board the vehicle which the malefactors abandoned at some deserted place. Malinao somehow succeeded in freeing himself and, later, reaching for help. He was taken to the police station, and later to the house of his Lola Conching.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The evidence for the defense. -</span><br></div><br>Disipulo and Ramos admitted that they, together with Bayan and Manuzon whom they only met at the Malolos crossing, hitched a ride with Manio but denied knowing any preconceived plan of their companions. The accused claimed that they were merely forced by Bayan and Manuzon to join them and that they, in fact, saved the life of Malinao from Bayan and Manuzon who had intended to kill him. When they learned that they were implicated in the robbery incident, they immediately and voluntarily surrendered to the authorities.<br><br>The decision of the trial court. -<br><br>On 08 October 1993, after a joint trial, the Regional Trial Court (Branch 6) of Malolos, Bulacan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> rendered a joint (partial) decision, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, this Court finds accused Ricardo Disipulo and Celestino Ramos, Jr., GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Robbery with Serious Physical Injuries under Criminal Case No. 451-M-91 and the crime of Kidnapping with Serious Illegal Detention under Criminal Case No. 865-M-91.<br><br>"Accordingly, accused Ricardo Disipulo and Celestino Ramos, Jr. are hereby SENTENCED:<br><br>"(a) To suffer the penalty of imprisonment from TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor in its maximum period to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS and FOUR (4) MONTHS of reclusion temporal in its medium period in Criminal Case No. 451-M-91;<br><br>"(b) To suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA in Criminal Case No. 865-M-91;<br><br>"(c) To indemnify complaining witness Fidel Manio the amount of P42,476.50 as actual damages; and<br><br>"(d) To pay the costs of the suit.<br><br>"For insufficiency of evidence, this Court ACQUITS them of violation of R.A. 6539, otherwise known as the Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972 under Criminal Case No. 452-M-91.<br><br>"The preventive imprisonment of the two (2) accused starting from the time they were incarcerated shall be deducted from their sentence.<br><br>"As far as accused Noli Manuzon and Jesus Bayan are concerned, let the records of these cases be sent to the ARCHIVES, without prejudice to their revival at any time said accused are apprehended.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Appeal. -<br></div><br>Unsatisfied with the verdict, Disipulo and Ramos appealed their conviction, contending that -<br><br><blockquote>"The lower court erred:<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I</span><br></div><br>IN HOLDING THAT CONSPIRACY EXISTED AMONG ALL THE ACCUSED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME;<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"II</span><br></div><br>IN HOLDING THAT A SEPARATE CRIME OF KIDNAPPING AND SERIOUS ILLEGAL DETENTION WAS COMMITTED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY;<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"III</span><br></div><br>IN HOLDING THAT THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF ABUSE OF STRENGTH, EVIDENT PREMEDITATION, CRAFT AND ABUSE OF CONFIDENCE ATTENDED THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The appeal cannot be sustained.<br><br>Unquestionably, established in evidence was the fact of robbery during which commission Manio and Saturnina Boiser were seriously injured.

Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>"ART. 267. <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention.</i> - Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death:<br><br>"1. If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than five days.<br><br>"2. If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.<br><br>"3. If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.<br><br>"4. If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, female or a public officer.<br><br>"The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense." </blockquote>Neither did the trial court err in appreciating abuse of confidence, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength against accused-appellants.<br><br>Clearly, the victims had trusted the malefactors when the latter were allowed to hitchhike with the former. The accused were no strangers to Manio; Manuzon and Bayan were distant relatives, Ramos was his former worker and Disipulo was a “CAFGU” member in their place. Had he not been that confident and assured of safe company, Manio would not have allowed them to board the vehicle. Manio's misplaced trust enabled the accused to execute their criminal intent.<br><br>Evident premeditation is likewise present. The actions of the malefactors had obviously been all well-planned. The accused waited for the victims at the Malolos crossing, hitchhiked with them and then, at the right moment, proceeded to rob them. The group was well-armed. These circumstances, the trial court observed, were "clear indicia of outward acts of their criminal intent." Ordinarily, evident premeditation is inherent in robbery. When, however, there is evident premeditation not only to steal but also to kill, an aggravation of the penalty could be proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General correctly points out that the evident premeditation to kill the victims can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the latter knew the malefactors well, and the injuries inflicted on Manio and Boiser, as well as the abandonment of Malinao, were obviously designed to eliminate witnesses to the unlawful deeds.<br><br>Abuse of superior strength was also properly considered. The victims, all unarmed, one of whom was a woman and the other a child, were no match to the four well-armed malefactors. The notorious “inequality of forces” between the victims and the aggressors was adequately shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court does not share the view of the Solicitor General that fraud, instead of craft, attended the commission of the offenses. Craft involves intellectual trickery and cunning on the part of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When there is a direct inducement by insidious words or machinations, fraud is present. In the case before us, however, the accused tricked the victims by pretending that they needed a ride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Craft was used in order not to arouse the suspicion of the victims and thus made them vulnerable to the accused's criminal minds.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the decision of the trial court is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED </span>in toto.<br><br>Costs against accused-appellants.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><i>Padilla, Bellosillo, Kapunan, and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 42-44.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Through Judge Felipe C.
