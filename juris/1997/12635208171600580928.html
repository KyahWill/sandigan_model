				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div align="JUSTIFY">Consistent with our oft-repeated pronouncement in criminal cases, minor inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses serve to strengthen, rather than weaken, their narration. We also reiterate the time-settled doctrine that the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is best assessed by trial courts, absent any clear showing of bias, mistake or misappreciation of any matter of substance, the correction of which may change the disposition of the case. We take this occasion to remind (a) prosecutors to carefully formulate informations in order to comply with the Rules of Court and (b) judges to precisely state the legal terminology of the penalties they impose.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Statement of the Case</span><br><br></div><br>Brought for resolution before this Court are the separate appeals of Benjamin Cabanog,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Dione Palomar,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Nabor Ceriales,Patricio Ceriales, Hermie Ceriales and Jose Ceriales<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> from the trial court’s Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated May 22, 1992 but promulgated on July 29, 1992, finding all of them guilty of multiple murder, attempted homicide and frustrated murder.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 6753, appellants, together with Romeo Cadeliña and Dominador Balasabas alias “Bulay-og,” were charged by 2nd Assistant Provincial Fiscal Augusto R.

Candabong, Manjuyod, Negros Oriental (TSN, October 15, 1985, TSN, November 19, 1985; pp. 15-16). They were gathering vegetables as well as pulling nails from their house for re-use in another house they were building in Cabcaban (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 16-17). Afterwards, they proceeded on foot towards their house at Talukanon, Cabcaban, Bindoy, Negros Oriental (TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 10-12). While on their way home, Pedro’s group was waylaid by the group of Benjamin Caba[ñ]og alias ‘Dungkoy’ who suddenly appeared and announced ‘Pedro dela Peña, we are ready to kill you’ (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 17-19). Caba[ñ]og was accompanied by appellants Diony Palomar, Hermie Ceriales and Jose Ceriales, as well as Dominador Balasabas, Romeo ‘Romy’ Cadelina and Patricio alias ‘Ising’ Ceriales and Nabor Ceriales (TSN, November 19, 1985, p. 8-12). Afterwards, stones rained on Pedro and his companions (TSN, November 19, 1985, p. 8). Subsequently, Susan saw her father’s forehead hit by a stone about 3 to 4 inches in diameter thrown by appellant Hermie Ceriales which caused her father to fall face down on the ground (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 9-10; TSN, December 4, 1986, pp. 4-6). Thereupon, Benjamin Caba[ñ]og jumped on him and hacked Pedro’s neck with a ‘pinuti’ (bolo) (TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 14-15). Aniano later tried to move his father to assure himself if he was still alive (TSN, January 23, 1986, pp. 9-11). However, Patricio Ceriales alias ‘Ising’ shot Aniano with an air rifle hitting him on his right thigh (TSN, January 23, 1986, pp. 8-10; TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 15-16). Appellant Diony Palomar subsequently hacked him on the left arm with a long bolo ‘pinuti’ which caused him to lose his middle finger and have a disfigured hand (TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 15-16). Aniano managed to hit appellant Diony Palomar with a dull working bolo used for weeding (TSN, March 6, 1986, pp. 9-10). Subsequently, Romeo Cadelina hacked him on his left forearm with a ‘pinuti’ (TSN, October 15, 1985, p. 16). Aniano then ran away towards the bush of tall cogon grass to hide from his attackers while he recovered from the pain caused by his wounds (TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 13-14). When he left the bush, Aniano saw appellants Jose and Hermie Ceriales pursuing him so he ran towards the house of Nardo, a barangay tanod (TSN, ibid., pp. 15-17). Eventually, Aniano escaped from his pursuers (TSN, January 23, 1986, pp. 11-18).<br><br>Meanwhile, Susan who was left near the place where her father collapsed, ran towards him and covered him with her own body for fear that Caba[ñ]og would further hack him (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 14-15). Forthwith, Caba[ñ]og hacked Susan on her left arm (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 15-16). Fearing for her life, she ran down the hill towards her two (2) younger brothers Jasper and Fernando (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 36-37; TSN, February 5, 1987, pp. 5-6). Her husband Gaudencio was unable to help her since he was also being stoned by appellants Hermie and Jose Ceriales and by the brothers Nabor and Patricio Ceriales. Her husband then tried to run towards the woods away from his attackers as they were armed but Benjamin Caba[ñ]og followed him there (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 23-26). Appellants Hermie and Jose Ceriales and their brothers Nabor and Patricio were then carrying stones (TSN, November 19, 1985, ibid.) Patricio Ceriales was also armed with an air gun while appellants Jose Ceriales and Diony Palomar carried long bolos (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 25-26). Caba[ñ]og aside from a long bolo, also carried a spear (ibid.).<br><br>Subsequently, Susan saw that appellant Diony Palomar had given up chasing her brother Aniano and that he was moving towards her and her younger brothers Jasper and Fernando (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 18-19). Thereafter, appellant Diony Palomar hacked Jasper on his back with a long bolo causing his death (TSN, ibid., p. 19). Consequently, she and Fernando continued running towards the creek and tried to hide themselves there (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 19-21; TSN, September 2, 1986, pp. 22-23). However, appellant Diony Palomar saw them and told them to come back (TSN, September 2, 1985, pp. 22-23). Susan and Fernando later came out of hiding (ibid.). Fernando then walked ahead of her towards the spot where their father died. Appellant Fernando then asked Diony Palomar, ‘Uncle Diony, why are you doing this to us, we have not done anything wrong to you’ but appellant Diony Palomar did not answer and hacked Fernando with a long bolo almost severing Fernando’s head from his body (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 19-20; Exhibits ‘A’ and ‘B’).<br><br>Romeo Cadeli[ñ]a also hacked Susan on the head and at her back while Patricio Ceriales shot her with an air rifle but he missed (TSN, November 19, 1985, pp. 27-28; TSN, February 5, 1987, pp. 6-11). Subsequently, Susan who was lying on the ground on her left side, saw the other companions of appellant Diony Palomar come back and hack the dead bodies of her younger brothers (TSN, September 2, 1986, pp. 25-29; TSN, November 19, 1985, p. 22). She also saw Caba[ñ]og extract with his bolo the adam’s apple of her father and thereafter divided it into eight pieces and distributed the same to his seven (7) companions (TSN, February 5, 1987; pp. 9-11). Subsequently, Caba[ñ]og touched her on her right shoulder saying ‘We know that a woman is weak so how could we expect a woman to last long.’ Afterwards, Caba[ñ]og and his seven (7) companions left the place (TSN, ibid., pp. 10-11). Several minutes later, Susan left the site.<br><br>Meanwhile Susan’s older brother Aniano managed to reach the house of Nardo, a barangay Tanod (TSN, January 23, 1986, pp. 15-16). Later, he went to Manjuyod to report to the police that his family was ambushed (TSN, October 15, 1985, pp. 16-20). Subsequently, Aniano was hospitalized at the Bais District Hospital in Bais City where he was attended to by the resident physician Dr. Maria Corazon Roxas for the following injuries: metacarpaphalangeal joint middle finger, left; ring finger of the left; incise wound, 4 cm. forearm, left; incise wound, 5 cm. dorsum hand, left and gunshot wound on the right lateral thigh 2 mm. (TSN, May 26, 1987, pp. 9-23; Exhs. ‘A’ and ‘C’; TSN, August 17, 1987, pp. 3-17).<br><br>At about one o’clock at dawn of May 1, 1985, the police went to the scene of the ambush (TSN, October 15, 1985; pp. 18-19). Thereafter, Dr. Romeo Kadili, Municipal Health Officer of Manjuyod, who was summoned by the chief of police, examined the bodies of Pedro dela Peña, Gaudencio Cadiente, Jasper dela Peña and Fernando dela Peña at the sitio of Barangay Candabong. Thereafter, he issued their respective Medical Certificates (TSN, September 30, 1987, pp. 16-27; Exhs. ‘D’, ‘D-1’, ‘E’, ‘E-1’ to ‘E-3’, ‘F’ and ‘G’).<br><br>At about 1:25 in the afternoon of May 1, 1985, Susan dela Peña was brought to the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital for treatment and confinement (TSN, June 13, 1988, pp. 3-5). She was attended to by Dr. Henry Calledo, then resident physician of the hospital’s Department of Surgery (ibid.). His findings revealed that Susan sustained the following wounds: ‘hacking wounds multiple curvilinear parieto occipital left, 20 cm. long, 5 cm. deep, with chip fracture outer table of skull; (a) 16 cm. long suprascapular right; (b) 20 cm. upper arm middle 3rd left and (c) middle 3rd forearm left with fracture of ulna, 20 cm. circular’ (TSN, June 13, 1988, pp. 5-7).<br><br>During the trial, Dr. Rogelio Kadili, Municipal Health Officer of Manjuyod, Negros Oriental identified the death certificates he issued after examining the bodies of Pedro dela Peña, Gaudencio Cadiente, Fernando and Jasper dela Peña (TSN, September 30, 1987, pp. 19-27; Exhibits ‘D’ to ‘D-4’, ‘E’, ‘E-1’, ‘F’ and ‘G’). The death certificate of Pedro dela Peña showed that the case of his death was ‘Hemorrhagic shock due to the stab wound and hack wound’ and the date thereof was April 30, 1985 (Exhs. ‘D’ to ‘D-4’). Cadiente’s Medical Certificate showed that his death was due to ‘Hemorrhagic shock due to stab and hack wound’ and the date of death is April 30, 1985 (Exhs. ‘F’, ‘F-1’ to ‘F-4’). The death certificate of Fernando dela Peña stated that the cause of death was ‘hemorrhagic shock due to stab wound and hack wound’ and the date of death is April 30, 1985 (Exhibits ‘F’, ‘F-1’ to ‘F-4’). The death certificate of Jasper dela Peña similarly stated that his death was due to ‘hemorrhagic shock due to stab and hack wound’ and the date of his death is April 30, 1985 (Exhibits ‘G’, ‘G-1’ to ‘G-4’).<br><br>Dr. Kadili also identified the Medical Certificates of Pedro dela Peña, Gaudencio Cadiente, Fernando and Jasper dela Peña (Exhibits ‘H’, ‘I’, ‘J’, ‘K’; TSN, March 17, 1988, pp. 2-22). Dr. Kadili testified that Pedro dela Peña’s wounds included the following: (1) injury at the interior part of the neck involving all the muscle layers, major blood vessels and cervical bones located at the neck which is a fatal wound; (2) wound at the posterior part of the head involving the scalp bones and outer part of the brain tissue which is also fatal; (3) wound at the medical part of the anterior left afrm (sic) involving the muscle layer and outer part of the bones of the lower left arm which is not fatal; and (4) an incise wound at the medial part of the posterior right arm involving the muscle layer and outer part of the bone which is not also fatal (TSN, March 17, 1988, pp. 6-7) Dr. Kadili testified that it is possible that the wounds were inflicted with the use of a bolo, a sharp instrument and it is also possible that several persons inflicted the injuries (TSN, ibid., pp. 7-8).<br><br>With respect to the medical certificate of Gaudencio Cadiente (Exh. ‘I’), Dr. Kadili testified that his wounds involve 3 incise wounds and 1 punctured wound, to wit: incise wound located at the left side of the neck involving the major blood vessels which is fatal; wound at the left side of the face involving the left cheek or zygomatic bones which is fatal as it involved the bones; incise wound located at the posterior part of the head involving the scalp layer and brain tissue, which is also a fatal wound; and a punctured wound located at the lumbar area involving the abdominal cavity (waist) which is also fatal (TSN, ibid., pp. 8-9). He declared that it is possible that the lacerated wounds were inflicted with a bolo, a sharp-bladed instrument (ibid., p. 10). He also testified that the punctured wound at the patient’s back was caused by a hard wood with a pointed end which could serve as a spear and that he saw said wood still stuck at the back of Cadiente (TSN, March 17, 1988, p. 11).<br><br>Anent the medical certificate of Fernando dela Peña, Dr. Kadili testified that per the certificate, Fernando sustained three (3) incise wounds which included the following: (1) incise wound located at the posterior part of the head involving the scalp layer, which is not fatal; (2) an incise wound located at the posterior part of the neck involving the cervical bones (nape) which is fatal; (3) an incise wound located the (sic) (3) incise wound located at the scapular area involving the scapular bone which is also fatal; and (4) a punctured wound at the right upper buttocks which is not fatal (TSN, March 17, 1988, pp. 12-13). He also stated that Fernando sustained an amputated wound located at the posterior part of the left wrist (ibid.). Dr. Kadili testified that it is possible that the wounds no. 1 and 2 on Fernando’s body were inflicted with a sharp-bladed instrument like a bolo while the wound no. 3 was probably inflicted with a sharp-pointed instrument like a spear (TSN, ibid., p. 14). Dr. Kadili also declared that it is possible that the spear stuck to the body of Gaudencio was the same spear used in inflicting Fernando’s punctured wound.<br><br>With respect to the wounds of Susan dela Peña, Dr. Calledo testified during the trial that her wounds described as a ‘hacking wound multiple curvilinear parieto occipital left, 20 cm. long, 5 cm. deep, with chip fracture outer table of skull’ could be fatal when there is no medical intervention due to blood loss or infection, while her hacking wound, 16 cm. long suprascapular right (located at the back of the head), can also be fatal because it can cause hemorrhage and infection (TSN, June 13, 1988, pp. 5-6). Dr. Calledo further testified that her wound at 20 cm. upper arm middle 3rd left (middle portion of the left upper arm, 20 cm. long) is also a hacking wound which was inflicted by a hard blow of a sharp-edged instrument possibly a bolo (TSN, June 13, 1988; Exhs. ‘I’ to ‘I-2’).”</blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Evidence for the Defense</span><br></div><br>Appellants Jose and Hermie Ceriales presented their version as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“In mid-afternoon of April 30, 1985, Pedro dela Peña and his family consisting of his sons Aniano, Jesper and Fernando, daughter Susan and the latter’s husband, Gaudencio Cadiente were on their way home to Talukabon, Cabcaban, Bindoy, Negros Oriental from Sitio Mamok, Candabong, Manjuyod, Negros Oriental when they were waylaid by a group of persons. The ambush resulted in the killing of Pedro dela Peña, his sons Jesper and Fernando and his son-in-law Gaudencio Cadiente. Wounded, Aniano dela Peña and his sister, Susan, lived to tell their story of the gory incident. Brother and sister testified in court and pointed to appellants Jose Ceriales and Hermie Ceriales as two of the perpetrators of their horrible experience and the brutal slaying of their kinsfolk.<br><br>At about 7:00 o’ clock in the evening of April 30, 1985, Susan dela Peña, alone and blodied (sic), arrived at the house of her uncle, Francisco Cadayona. She told her uncle that they were waylaid at Sitio Mamok, Candabong earlier that afternoon and their ambushers, among whom was a woman, were responsible for her injuries and the killing of her father, husband and two brothers. She, however, did not recognize their assailants. Cadayona, then, bade his niece to spend the night in his house and rest.<br><br>In the morning of the following day, May 1, 1985, Cadayona, after having caused Susan to be conducted to the provincial hospital of Negros Oriental, then proceeded with fifteen others to Mamok, the scene of the ambush slaying as pointed out by Susan. (TSN, June 15, 1989, pp. 4-6).<br><br>Mamok is really not a sitio. It is a river. It was along a footpath leading to this river that the massacre took place. The footpath is bordered on both sides with plenty of huge trees[,] the trunks of which reach to 50 cm. in diameter and grasses six feet tall. The broad leaves of these trees overlap and form a thick foliage that effectively screens off the sunlight, so that, the degree of illumination on the ground at anytime of the day is reduced to ‘s[a]linga-ob’, that degree of illumination after twilight. Under such degree of illumination, a person can hardly be recognized beyond one meter (Ibid., pp. 7 and 13-14; TSN, September 28, 1989, p. 11; TSN, October 9, 1986, pp. 3-7). It was in this place that Cadayona and his companions found the dead bodies of Pedro dela Peña, Jesper dela Peña, Fernando dela Peña and Gaudencio Cadiente.<br><br>While Cadayona was busy attending to Susan and her family, his stepsons, the brothers Jose Ceriales and Hermie Ceriales, were in his farm at Sitio Lumantao, Candabong, Manjuyod, some four kilometers from his house at Sitio Palay. The brothers arrived at the farm on April 29, 1985 in obedience to Cadayona’s summons for help to work on the said farm. On April 30, 1985, Cadayona stayed with the brothers working on the farm the whole day. He took his lunch with them together with his wife on that date. They stopped working after 4:00 o’ clock in the afternoon of said date. He then went home to Sitio Palay leaving the two brothers in the farm where the latter could sleep in a hut erected thereat for the purpose. The brothers stayed in the farm until May 2, 1985 when work therein was completed. (TSN, June 15, 1989, pp. 5 and 7-8; TSN, September 26, 1989, pp. 8-10). It was on this last date that Jose and Hermie Ceriales knew about the Mamok incident for the first time when Cadayona came back to the farm and told the brothers about Susan’s horrible experience.<br><br>To their utter surprise, Jose and Hermie Ceriales were arrested by the police on May 8, 1985. The police did not tell them the reason for their arrest. It was only during the preliminary investigation conducted by the Municipal Trial Court of Manjuyod that they knew they were being indicted for the killing of Pedro dela Peña, Jesper dela Peña, Fernando dela Peña and Gaudencio Cadiente and the wounding of Susan dela Peña and Aniano dela Peña.<br><br>The brothers were placed inside the Manjuyod municipal jail where they met the other accused. Except for the brothers Nabor and Patricio Ceriales who were their first cousins, appellants met their other co-accused for the first time in jail, as they were hauled in one after the other.<br><br>Of the victims, appellants knew only Aniano dela Peña, Susan dela Peña and Pedro dela Peña. The first two are his first cousins while the other one is the latter’s father and the husband of their mother’s sister. Aniano and Susan were still quite small when appellants last saw them prior to their meeting during the preliminary investigation of the instant cases on May 25, 1985.<br><br>During the aforesaid preliminary investigation, appellants asked Susan why they were being indicted for the crimes charged in the instant cases and Susan told them not to be bothered as she was only advised by Manjuyod policeman investigator Felipe Somoza to implicate them and that she had been promise[d] by Somoza that they (appellants) would be released as soon as the same would be forwarded to Dumaguete City.<br><br>The promise, of course, was a police ploy as appellants stayed on in jail until they were convicted. (TSN, September 28, 1989, pp. 3-14; TSN, September 14, 1990, pp. 8-15)</blockquote>In his Brief, Appellant Diony Palomar presented the following version of the facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“For his defense, accused-appellant Diony Palomar testified that on April 30, 1985, the day the incident happened in Mamok, he was working in Kabugan, Bindoy, Negros Oriental, at the fishpond of Municipal Councilor Bernabe Carriaga, which is about fifteen (15) mountainous kilometers away from the said place of incident. In fact, he started working at the said fishpond on April 15, 1985 and continued to so work everyday thereafter without interruption up to and beyond the date of the incident. His testimony on this point was confirmed and corroborated by fishpond owner Bernabe Carriaga, a Municipal Councilor of Bindoy, and Sergio de la Peña, a co-laborer of Diony Palomar at the fishpond. Incidentally, the said Sergio dela Peña was the godfather of deceased-victim Pedro dela Peña and had every reason to be biased for said deceased and his family. Likewise, Sergio de la Peña testified that Aniano de la Peña told him that he was hacked during the incident but he could not identify the culprits.<br><br>Accused-appellant Diony Palomar further testified that he met his co-accused only at the Municipal Jail of Manjuyod.” (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Appellant Dione Palomar raises a “lone assignment of error”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>“The lower Court erred in convicting accused-appellant Diony Palomar considering that his guilt has not been established by a sufficient amount of evidence.”<br><br>On the other hand, Appellants Jose Ceriales and Hermie Ceriales, in their own brief, allege the following errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“I</span><br></div><br>The trial court erred in giving undue weight to the improbable[,] inconsistent and contradcitory (sic) testimonies of Prosecutoin (sic) Witnesses Aniano dela Peña and Susan dela Peña Cadiente.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br></div><br>The trial court erred in not giving exculpatory weight to Accused-Appellants Jose Ceriales and Hermie Ceriales’ defense of alibi.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><br>The trial court erred in not acquitting Accused-Appellants Jose Ceriales and Hermie Ceriales on the ground that their guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>The separately assigned errors boil down to the issue of whether the trial court correctly convicted appellants on the basis of the allegedly inconsistent, improbable and contradictory testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses Aniano dela Peña and Susan dela Peña Cadiente. Appellants argue, by reason of such inconsistencies, Aniano’s and Susan’s testimonies should be rejected and that their defense of alibi should be accorded credence. Consistent with the foregoing, the Court will discuss separately the following topics: (1) credibility of the prosecution eyewitnesses, (2) alleged inconsistencies in their testimonies, (3) probative weight of the appellants’ alibi, and (4) the presence of conspiracy, and attending circumstances.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The separate appeals are bereft of merit but the penalties imposed by the trial court in Crim.

Defense Witness Francisco Cadayuna who helped the victims “immediately after the incident,” testified that Susan allegedly told him that “she did not know the persons who hacked them.” Citing the testimony of Cadayuna, Appellant Palomar also argues that it was not really possible for Susan Cadiente to have identified the culprits, considering that the setting of the incident was a forest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, Susan’s testimony holding Palomar responsible for the killing of her brothers does not conform with her affidavit dated May 30, 1985 in which she “did not point to [A]ccused-appellant Diony Palomar as the person who hacked his [sic] younger brothers Jasper and Fernando.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In addition, Susan’s brother Aniano, in answer to the question “who killed them [referring to his younger brothers Fernando and Jasper], according to Susan?” testified; “Those people, the seven of them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Appellant Palomar also argues that Susan Cadiente’s testimony is “very incredible because during the preliminary investigation in the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Manjuyod, she testified” that even if the head of her brother Jasper was already severed, he was still able to say “Nang, don’t leave me.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>He finally submits that “the defense of alibi of [A]ppellant Diony Palomar is strengthened by the weakness of [W]itness Susan Cadiente” and that the trial court should have given full credence to his defense of alibi and should have acquitted him of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant Palomar’s contentions are unacceptable. The story of Francisco Cadayuna cannot overcome the positive and detailed testimony of Susan dela Peña. In their defense, appellants resort to bare denial which constitutes self-serving negative evidence. This cannot be accorded evidentiary weight when compared with the declaration of credible witnesses who testified on affirmative matters. Firm is the rule that affirmative testimony has greater value than negative ones for the reason that he who denies a certain fact may not remember exactly the circumstances on which he bases his denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The allegation that the locus criminis was dark and shrouded was clearly rebutted by Susan’s testimony that the place was sufficiently illuminated for her to see the attack on her father. In any case, it should not be forgotten that the crime was committed around 2:00 p.m. when the sun was at its brightest. Susan testified on cross-examination as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“Atty.

On the other hand, Susan testified that the victims were on a lower ground when Accused Cabañog made known his presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>That the locus criminis was “forestal” did not affect Aniano’s credibility and his ability to identify the malefactors, considering that the incident happened “about two o’clock in the afternoon” of April 30, 1985 and that Appellant Hermie Ceriales -- his “close neighbor” and first cousin -- was known to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Aniano also pointed out that the trees made the site “shady” but not dark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In this light, Susan Cadiente was able to identify Appellant Hermie Ceriales. She even testified that Jose, the brother of Hermie, was her cousin and she knew their father to be Emiliano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Truly, Appellants Hermie and Jose Ceriales were not strangers to her.<br><br>The fact that only Susan’s father was hit by the hurled stones does not render her testimony incredible. Susan firmly testified during the cross-examination:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote>“Court:<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, there were no stones smaller than that?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were stones bigger than that?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And only your father was hit?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the rest of you were away from your father?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.”</blockquote>Aniano also corroborated Susan’s testimony that the stone thrown by Hermie hit only his father, Pedro dela Peña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Aniano’s declaration, like Susan’s, was not successfully rebutted by the defense.<br><br>Appellants Jose and Hermie Ceriales further protest that the following testimonies are marked by “inconsistencies and contradictions”:<br><br>1. Aniano’s testimony that after his father fell “he immediately went over to his father’s side and shook him (father),” whereas, according to Susan “she was the first and only one who rushed” to her father’s side even when she was last in the group walking in single file.<br><br>2. Susan’s testimony that when “she and her two younger brothers Jesper and Fernando were running to escape their assailants, she was running ahead of the two.” Later, “in her testimony,” she claimed that “her two younger brothers were ahead of her as they were running away from their assailants.”<br><br>3. While both “Aniano and Susan dela Peña” agreed that their group walked in a single file,” the two “gave different accounts of the order in which the members of the group were walking.” Susan “said that order was as follows: Pedro dela Peña, Gaudencio Cadiente, Aniano dela Peña, Jesper dela Peña, Fernando dela Peña, Susan dela Peña while Aniano claimed that the order was as follows: Pedro dela Peña, Aniano dela Peña, Gaudencio Cadiente, Susan dela Peña, Fernando dela Peña, Jesper dela Peña.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>We hold that these alleged “inconsistencies and contradictions” pertain to minor matters. Besides, Aniano did not testify that he was the first to reach his father after the latter fell down. He merely said that he immediately approached his father who fell after being hit by a stone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> On the other hand, Susan testified that when her father fell, she was the first to help him. However, she did not testify that she alone helped her father:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>“Atty. Cempron:<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when your father fell down face down, the first to go to his help was you, is that correct?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your husband Gaudencio was next to your father did not do anything despite the fact that your father already fell?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir.<br><br>Court:<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, while you were rushing towards your father for more than fifteen (15) meters behind them you overtook your brothers the rest of your group including your husband because it was you who reached the side of your fallen father?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.”</blockquote>Thus the inconsistency is more apparent than real. Both Aniano and Susan approached their father. Susan did so first, and Aniano followed her.<br><br>The alleged inconsistency in Susan’s testimony in regard to her position--- relative to her younger brothers Jasper and Fernando, while she was running away from her attackers--- pertains to an inconsequential matter. We have held that inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses which refer to minor and insignificant details do not destroy their credibility. Such minor inconsistencies even manifest truthfulness and candor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and erase any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In the present case, the alleged “inconsistencies and contradictions” in the testimonies of the prosecution eyewitnesses are not substantial enough to impair their credibility. The indelible fact remains that Susan and Aniano were present at the crime scene, that they themselves were attacked by the culprits; and that they identified appellants as the assailants.<br><br>Alibi as Defense<br><br>Alibi is one of the weakest defenses not only because it is inherently frail and unreliable, but also because it is easy to fabricate and difficult to check or rebut. It cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by eyewitnesses who had no improper motive to testify falsely. Appellant Dione Palomar was positively identified by Susan Cadiente as the culprit who mercilessly hacked her two younger brothers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> She also pointed to Hermie Ceriales as the killer of her father<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and to Jose Ceriales as a member of the group who ganged up on her husband, Gaudencio Cadiente. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Appellant Jose Ceriales testified that on April 30, 1985, the day of the massacre, he was in Sitio Lumantao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Appellant Hermie Ceriales also testified that he was sowing rice in Sitio Lumantao at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Well-settled is the rule that alibi can prevail only if it is shown that it was physically impossible for the accused to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Whether the walking time from Sitio Lumantao to Sitio Mamok where the crime was committed was one hour as testified to by Hermie, or 30 minutes as stated by Jose, appellants clearly failed to prove the physical impossibility of their presence at the crime scene . Under the circumstances, appellants’ alibis are clearly untenable.<br><br>For his part, Appellant Dione Palomar denied that he knew Pedro, Jasper or Fernando dela Peña, He also denied knowing where Sitio Mamok was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Appellants denials are bereft of merit. Such denials, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing proof, are negative, self-serving evidence which deserve no weight in law. They cannot be accorded credence greater than that given to the narration of credible witnesses who testified on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Conspiracy and Qualifying Circumstances<br><br>For collective responsibility to be established, it is not necessary that conspiracy be proven by direct evidence of a prior agreement to commit the crime. Only rarely would such an agreement be demonstrable because criminal undertakings, in the nature of things, are rarely documented by written agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The concerted actions of the accused, however, clearly evince conspiracy. Leading off with the challenge hurled by Benjamin Cabañog and the stones thrown by Appellant Hermie Ceriales; followed by Appellant Cabañog’s hacking of the prostrate body of Pedro dela Peña and the arm of the hapless Susan Cadiente; then pursuit and killing of young Jasper and Fernando dela Peña by Appellant Dione Palomar; and finally, the ganging up on Gaudencio Cadiente by Hermie, Jose, Patricio and Nabor Ceriales--- all these acts of the accused sufficiently prove beyond reasonable doubt that they conspired to consummate the killing of the members of the dela Peña family.<br><br>Treachery was also duly proven. The deadly and successive actions of the accused did not allow the victims any opportunity to put up a defense. Rather, the victims were like scampering mice chased by big, ugly cats on their tails. One after another, the victims were stoned, mauled, hacked and shot. While the victims may have realized a possible danger to their persons, the attack was executed in such a manner as to make defense, not to say counterattack, impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Treachery is likewise manifested in the brutal killings of Jasper and Fernando, 13 and 10 years old, respectively. The killing of minor children who, by reason of their tender years, could not be expected to put up a defense, is considered treacherous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, however, was not established. For this qualifying circumstance to be appreciated, there must be shown a period sufficient to afford full opportunity for meditation and reflection and time adequate to allow the conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The premeditation to kill must be plain and notorious; it must be sufficiently proven by evidence of outward acts showing the intent to kill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In the absence of clear and positive evidence, mere presumptions and inferences of evident premeditation, no matter how logical and probable, are insufficient. In the present case, there is no evidence of planning or preparation to kill. Neither is there proof of the time when the plot was conceived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 6764, abuse of superior strength was not established in the in the hacking of Susan Cadiente. This aggravating circumstance is is present when there is an obvious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, and the aggressor took advantage of this superiority in the commission of the crime. Susan was hacked by Benjamin Cabañog when she tried to shield her fallen father with her body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> There is no evidence that Cabanog conciously took advantage of his superior situation.<br><br>Although only a single felony--- multiple murder--- was alleged in Criminal Case No. 6753, the Court observes that the prosecution had actually proven four separate counts of murder. It was not shown that accused-appellants were motivated by a single criminal impulse to kill the dela Pena family. If such were the case, the accusation of the complex crime of multiple murder would find support in Article 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code. This “single criminal impulse” has been clearly illustrated in People vs. Lawas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> “where on a single occasion there was a multiple killing of around 50 Maranaos by a group of home guards (former Constabulary soldiers), the killing was held to be only one offense (multiple homicide) because it resulted from a single criminal impulse and it was not possible to determine how many victims were killed by each of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In the present case, however, it was proven that Appellant HermieCeriales first stoned Pedro dela Pena; Appellants Hermie, Jose, Nabor and Patricio Ceriales then mobbed Gaudencio; and Dione Palomar followed by hacking Jasper and decapitating Fernando dela Pena. These overt criminal acts were committed separately by appellants, each of whom was motivated by a separate criminal intent. However, the Information in Criminal Case No. 6753 charged only the complex crime of multiple murder without specifying the participation of each accused in the killing of each victim; thus, the appellants cannot be convicted of four counts of murder. To do so would contravene appellants’ right to “be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It is a basic right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and, if found guilty, to be penalized only for the offense specified in the information or necessarily included in such offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>We note further that trial court did not mention the legal designation of the penalties it imposed in Criminal Case No. 6756 and 6764. Rather, the trial court stated only the duration of the sentences. This is erroneous. As opined by former Chief Justice Ramon C. Aquino:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“It is desirable to employ the proper legal terminology in the imposition of the imprisonment penalties provided in the Code, such as reclusion perpetua, prision or arresto, because each penalty has its distinct accessory penalties and effects. Thus, instead of sentencing the accused to ‘imprisonment for life’ or ‘cadena perpetua’, the term reclusion perpetua should be used. [fn: Mobe, 81 Phil. 58; Saik and Akan, 106 Phil. 957; Segovia, 92 Phil. 1080; Rodriguez and Bacutan, 108 Phil. 118; Gonzales, 58 SCRA 265; Dereje, 56 SCRA 554; Abletes, 58 SCRA 241). The penalties prescribed in the Code should be imposed in the form and manner in which they are prescribed. The courts should not attempt to substitute equivalents for such penalties in the form of imprisonment for a term of years in a designated jail. Where the three defendants were convicted of theft and each of them was sentenced to ‘five years in Bilibid,’ it was held that the sentence was defective because it did not specify the exact penalty prescribed in the Penal Code. A sentence ‘to four years’ imprisonment in Bilibid’ is also defective. [Avillar, 28 Phil. 131; Pantaleon Mariano, 27 Phil. 132; Emilio Sevilla, 30 Phil. 288. A penalty of ‘life imprisonment at hard labor, without hope of any pardon of reprieve whatsoever,’ is not quite correct (Limaco, 88 Phil. 35). But in case of an erroneous designation of the penalty, the duration thereof is controlling (Pontillas, 65 Phil. 659).]”</blockquote>The penalty for homicide is reclusion temporal; that for attempted homicide, on the other hand is two degrees lower, i.e., prision correcional. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum of the correct penalty for attempted homicide is prision correcional, while the minimum term is within the range of the penalty one degree lower than that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code, i.e., arresto mayor. The trial court should have imposed this penalty in Criminal Case No. 6756.<br><br>In the case of frustrated murder in Criminal Case No. 6764, the proper penalty is one degree lower than that prescribed for murder, which is reclusion temporal maximum to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Thus, the penalty for frustrated murder is prision mayor in its maximum period to reclusion temporal in its medium period. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term for frustrated murder is within the range of prision correcional maximum to prision mayor in its medium period.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the disposition of the trial court in Criminal Case 6753 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.
