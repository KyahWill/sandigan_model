				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.PABLITO ANDAN Y HERNANDEZ @ BOBBY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="left">Accused-appellant Pablito Andan y Hernandez alias "Bobby" was accused of the crime of rape with homicide committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 19th day of February 1994, in the municipality of xxx, province of xxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, by means of violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one AAA against her will and without her consent; and the above-named accused in order to suppress evidence against him and delay (sic) the identity of the victim, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill the said AAA, attack, assault and hit said victim with concrete hollow blocks in her face and in different parts of her body, thereby inflicting upon her mortal wounds which directly caused her death.<br><br>Contrary to Law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution established that on February 19, 1994 at about 4:00 P.M., in xxx, AAA, twenty years of age and a second-year student at the xxx, left her home for her school dormitory in xxx. She was to prepare for her final examinations on February 21, 1994. AAA wore a striped blouse and faded denim pants and brought with her two bags containing her school uniforms, some personal effects and more than P2,000.00 in cash.<br><br>AAA was walking along the subdivision when appellant invited her inside his house.&nbsp; He used the pretext that the blood pressure of his wife's grandmother should be taken. AAA agreed to take her blood pressure as the old woman was her distant relative.&nbsp; She did not know that nobody was inside the house.&nbsp; Appellant then punched her in the abdomen, brought her to the kitchen and raped her.&nbsp; His lust sated, appellant dragged the unconscious girl to an old toilet at the back of the house and left her there until dark.&nbsp; Night came and appellant pulled AAA, who was still unconscious, to their backyard.&nbsp; The yard had a pigpen bordered on one side by a six-foot high concrete fence. On the other side was a vacant lot. Appellant stood on a bench beside the pigpen and then lifted and draped the girl's body over the fence to transfer it to the vacant lot. When the girl moved, he hit her head with a piece of concrete block. He heard her moan and hit her again on the face. After silence reigned, he pulled her body to the other side of the fence, dragged it towards a shallow portion of the lot and abandoned it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>At 11:00 A.M. of the following day, February 20, 1994, the body of AAA was discovered. She was naked from the chest down with her brassiere and T-shirt pulled toward her neck. Nearby was found a panty with a sanitary napkin.<br><br>The autopsy conducted by Dr. xxx revealed that AAA died of "traumatic injuries" sustained as follows:<br><br>"1. Abrasions:<br><blockquote>1.1 chest and abdomen, multiple, superficial, linear, generally oblique from right to left.<br></blockquote>2. Abrasions/contusions:<br><blockquote>2.1 temple, right.<br>2.2 cheek, right.<br>2.3 upper and lower jaws, right.<br>2.4 breast, upper inner quadrant, right.<br>2.5 breast, upper outer quadrant, left.<br>2.6 abdomen, just above the umbilicus, rectangular, approximate 3 inches in width, from right MCL to left AAL.<br>2.7. elbow joint, posterior, bilateral.<br></blockquote>3. Hematoma:<br><blockquote>3.1 upper and lower eyelids, bilateral.<br>3.2 temple, lateral to the outer edge of eyebrow, right.<br>3.3 upper and lower jaws, right.<br></blockquote>4. Lacerated wounds:<br><blockquote>4.1 eyebrow, lateral border, right, 1/2 inch.<br>4.2 face, from right cheek below the zygoma to midline lower jaw, 4 inches.<br></blockquote>5. Fractures:<br><blockquote>5.1 maxillary bone, right.<br>5.2 mandible, multiple, complete, right, with avulsion of 1st and 2nd incisors.<br></blockquote>6. Cerebral contusions, inferior surface, temporal and frontal lobes, right.<br><br>7. External genitalia<br><blockquote>7.1 minimal blood present.<br>7.2 no signs of recent physical injuries noted on both labia, introitus and exposed vaginal wall.<br></blockquote>8. Laboratory examination of smear samples from the vaginal cavity showed negative for spermatozoa (Bulacan Provincial Hospital, February 22, 1994, by Dr. Wilfredo S. de Vera).<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH: Cardiorespiratory Arrest due to Cerebral Contusions due to Traumatic Injuries, Face."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>AAA's gruesome death drew public attention and prompted Mayor xxx of xxx to form a crack team of police officers to look for the criminal. Searching the place where AAA's body was found, the policemen recovered a broken piece of concrete block stained with what appeared to be blood. They also found a pair of denim pants and a pair of shoes which were identified as AAA's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Appellant's nearby house was also searched by the police who found bloodstains on the wall of the pigpen in the backyard. They interviewed the occupants of the house and learned from Romano Calma, the stepbrother of appellant's wife, that accused-appellant also lived there but that he, his wife and son left without a word. Calma surrendered to the police several articles consisting of pornographic pictures, a pair of wet short pants with some reddish brown stain, a towel also with the stain, and a wet T-shirt. The clothes were found in the laundry hamper inside the house and allegedly belonged to appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The police tried to locate appellant and learned that his parents live in xxx. On February 24 at 11:00 P.M., a police team led by Mayor xxx traced appellant in his parents' house. They took him aboard the patrol jeep and brought him to the police headquarters where he was interrogated. Initially, appellant denied any knowledge of AAA's death. However, when the police confronted him with the concrete block, the victim's clothes and the bloodstains found in the pigpen, appellant relented and said that his neighbors, Gilbert Larin and Reynaldo Dizon, killed AAA and that he was merely a lookout. He also said that he knew where Larin and Dizon hid the two bags of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Immediately, the police took appellant to his house. Larin and Dizon, who were rounded up earlier, were likewise brought there by the police. Appellant went to an old toilet at the back of the house, leaned over a flower pot and retrieved from a canal under the pot, two bags which were later identified as belonging to AAA. Thereafter, photographs were taken of appellant and the two other suspects holding the bags.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant and the two suspects were brought back to the police headquarters. The following day, February 25, a physical examination was conducted on the suspects by the Municipal Health Officer, Dr. xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Appellant was found to sustain:<br><br>"HEENT: with multiple scratches on the neck Rt side. Chest and back: with abrasions (scratches at the back). Extremities: freshly-healed wound along index finger 1.5 cm. in size Lt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>By this time, people and media representatives were already gathered at the police headquarters awaiting the results of the investigation. Mayor xxx arrived and proceeded to the investigation room. Upon seeing the mayor, appellant approached him and whispered a request that they talk privately. The mayor led appellant to the office of the Chief of Police and there, appellant broke down and said "Mayor, patawarin mo ako! I will tell you the truth. I am the one who killed AAA." The mayor opened the door of the room to let the public and media representatives witness the confession. The mayor first asked for a lawyer to assist appellant but since no lawyer was available he ordered the proceedings photographed and videotaped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In the presence of the mayor, the police, representatives of the media and appellant's own wife and son, appellant confessed his guilt. He disclosed how he killed AAA and volunteered to show them the place where he hid her bags. He asked for forgiveness from Larin and Dizon whom he falsely implicated saying he did it because of ill-feelings against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He also said that the devil entered his mind because of the pornographic magazines and tabloid he read almost everyday.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> After his confession, appellant hugged his wife and son and asked the mayor to help him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> His confession was captured on videotape and covered by the media nationwide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant was detained at the police headquarters. The next two days, February 26 and 27, more newspaper, radio and television reporters came. Appellant was again interviewed and he affirmed his confession to the mayor and reenacted the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On arraignment, however, appellant entered a plea of "not guilty." He testified that in the afternoon of February 19, 1994 he was at his parent's house in xxx attending the birthday party of his nephew. He, his wife and son went home after 5:00 P.M. His wife cooked dinner while he watched their one-year old son. They all slept at 8:00 P.M. and woke up the next day at 6:00 in the morning. His wife went to Manila to collect some debts while he and his son went to his parents' house where he helped his father cement the floor of the house. His wife joined them in the afternoon and they stayed there until February 24, 1994 when he was picked up by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Appellant was brought by the police to a hotel at xxx. In one of the rooms, the policemen covered his face with a bedsheet and kicked him repeatedly. They coerced him to confess that he raped and killed AAA. When he refused, they pushed his head into a toilet bowl and injected something into his buttocks. Weakened, appellant confessed to the crime. Thereafter, appellant was taken to his house where he saw two of his neighbors, Larin and Dizon. He was ordered by the police to go to the old toilet at the back of the house and get two bags from under the flower pot. Fearing for his life, appellant did as he was told.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In a decision dated August 4, 1994, the trial court convicted appellant and sentenced him to death pursuant to Republic Act No. 7659. The trial court also ordered appellant to pay the victim's heirs P50,000.00 as death indemnity, P71,000.00 as actual burial expenses and P100,000.00 as moral damages, thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, Pablito Andan y Hernandez alias "Bobby" is found guilty by proof beyond a scintilla of doubt of the crime charged in the Information (Rape with Homicide) and penalized in accordance with R.A. No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law) Sec. 11, Par. 8, classifying this offense as one of the heinous crimes and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH; to indemnify the family of AAA the amount of P50,000.00 for the death of AAA and P71,000.00 as actual burial and incidental expenses and P100,000.00 as moral damages. After automatic review of this case and the decision becomes final and executory, the sentence be carried out.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>This case is before us on automatic review in accordance with Section 22 of Republic Act No. 7659 amending Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Appellant contends that:<br><blockquote>"I&nbsp;&nbsp; THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING AND USING AS BASIS OF JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION THE TESTIMONIES OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATORS, REPORTERS AND THE MAYOR ON THE ALLEGED ADMISSION OF THE ACCUSED DURING THE CUSTODIAL INVESTIGATION, THE ACCUSED NOT BEING ASSISTED BY COUNSEL IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION;<br><br>II&nbsp; THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS RAPE WHEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND TO SUPPORT IT;<br><br>III&nbsp; THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN MAKING A FINDING OF CONVICTION WHEN THE EVIDENCE IN ITS TOTALITY SHOWS THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court based its decision convicting appellant on the testimonies of the three policemen of the investigating team, the mayor of xxx and four news reporters to whom appellant gave his extrajudicial oral confessions. It was also based on photographs and video footages of appellant's confessions and reenactments of the commission of the crime.<br><br>Accused-appellant assails the admission of the testimonies of the policemen, the mayor and the news reporters because they were made during custodial investigation without the assistance of counsel. Section 12, paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article III of the Constitution provides:<br><br>"SECTION 12.(1) Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.<br><br>(2) x x x<br><br>(3)Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this or Section 17 hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence against him.<br><br>(4) x x x"<br><br>Plainly, any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right (1) to remain silent; (2) to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice; and (3) to be informed of such rights. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this provision is inadmissible in evidence against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The exclusionary rule is premised on the presumption that the defendant is thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and runs through menacing police interrogation procedures where the potentiality for compulsion, physical and psychological, is forcefully apparent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The incommunicadocharacter of custodial interrogation or investigation also obscures a later judicial determination of what really transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It should be stressed that the rights under Section 12 are accorded to "[a]ny person under investigation for the commission of an offense." An investigation begins when it is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but starts to focus on a particular person as a suspect, i.e., when the police investigator starts interrogating or exacting a confession from the suspect in connection with an alleged offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As intended by the 1971 Constitutional Convention, this covers "investigation conducted by police authorities which will include investigations conducted by the municipal police, the PC and the NBI and such other police agencies in our government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>When the police arrested appellant, they were no longer engaged in a general inquiry about the death of AAA. Indeed, appellant was already a prime suspect even before the police found him at his parents' house. This is clear from the testimony of SPO4 xxx, the police chief investigator of the crime, viz:<br><blockquote>"COURT&nbsp; How did you come about in concluding that it was accused who did this act?<br><br>WITNESS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the place where AAA was last found is at the backyard of the house of the accused. Second, there were blood stains at the pigpen, and third, when we asked Romano Calma who were his other companions in the house, he said that, it was Pablito Andan who cannot be found at that time and whose whereabouts were unknown, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you had a possible suspect?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You went looking for Pablito Andan?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, what else did you do?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tried to find out where we can find him and from information we learned that his parents live in xxx. We went there, found him there and investigated him and in fact during the investigation he admitted that he was the culprit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant was already under custodial investigation when he confessed to the police. It is admitted that the police failed to inform appellant of his constitutional rights when he was investigated and interrogated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> His confession is therefore inadmissible in evidence. So too were the two bags recovered from appellant's house.&nbsp; SPO2 xxx, a member of the investigating team testified:<br><blockquote>"Atty. Valmores: You told the court that you were able to recover these bags marked as Exhs. B and B-1 because accused pointed to them, where did he point these bags?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the police station, sir, he told us that he hid the two (2) bags beneath the canal of the toilet.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, you were given information where these two (2) bags were located?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon being informed where the two (2) bags could be located what did you do?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We proceeded to the place together with the accused so that we would know where the two (2) bags were hidden, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did you see actually those two (2) bags before the accused pointed to the place where the bags were located?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he removed the broken pots with which he covered the canal, he really showed where the bags were hidden underneath the canal, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The victim's bags were the fruits of appellant's uncounselled confession to the police. They are tainted evidence, hence also inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The police detained appellant after his initial confession. The following day, Mayor xxx visited the appellant. Appellant approached the mayor and requested for a private talk. They went inside a room and appellant confessed that he alone committed the crime. He pleaded for forgiveness. Mayor xxx testified, viz:<br><blockquote>"Mayor xxx: x x x. During the investigation when there were already many people from the media, Andan whispered something to me and requested that he be able to talk to me alone, so what I did was that, I brought him inside the office of the chief of police.<br><br>Private Prosecutor Principe: And so what happened inside the office of the Chief of Police, mayor?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While inside the office of the headquarters he told me "Mayor patawarin mo ako,! I will tell you the truth. I am the one who killed AAA." So when he was telling this to me, I told him to wait a while, then I opened the door to allow the media to hear what he was going to say and I asked him again whether he was the one who did it, he admitted it, sir. This was even covered by a television camera."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that time that Pablito Andan whispered to you that he will tell you something and then you responded by bringing him inside the office of the Chief of Police and you stated that he admitted that he killed AAA . . .<br><br>Court:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said to you the following words . . .<br><br>Atty. Principe:&nbsp; He said to you the following words "Mayor, patawarin mo ako! Ako ang pumatay kay AAA," was that the only admission that he told you?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The admission was made twice. The first one was, when we were alone and the second one was before the media people, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else did he tell you when you were inside the room of the Chief of Police?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were the only things that he told me, sir. I stopped him from making further admissions because I wanted the media people to hear what he was going to say, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>Under these circumstances, it cannot be successfully claimed that appellant's confession before the mayor is inadmissible. It is true that a municipal mayor has "operational supervision and control" over the local police<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and may arguably be deemed a law enforcement officer for purposes of applying Section 12 (1) and (3) of Article III of the Constitution.&nbsp; However, appellant's confession to the mayor was not made in response to any interrogation by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In fact, the mayor did not question appellant at all. No police authority ordered appellant to talk to the mayor. It was appellant himself who spontaneously, freely and voluntarily sought the mayor for a private meeting. The mayor did not know that appellant was going to confess his guilt to him. When appellant talked with the mayor as a confidant and not as a law enforcement officer, his uncounselled confession to him did not violate his constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, it has been held that the constitutional procedures on custodial investigation do not apply to a spontaneous statement, not elicited through questioning by the authorities, but given in an ordinary manner whereby appellant orally admitted having committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> What the Constitution bars is the compulsory disclosure of incriminating facts or confessions. The rights under Section 12 are guaranteed to preclude the slightest use of coercion by the state as would lead the accused to admit something false, not to prevent him from freely and voluntarily telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Hence we hold that appellant's confession to the mayor was correctly admitted by the trial court.<br><br>Appellant's confessions to the media were likewise properly admitted. The confessions were made in response to questions by news reporters, not by the police or any other investigating officer. We have held that statements spontaneously made by a suspect to news reporters on a televised interview are deemed voluntary and are admissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The records show that Alex Marcelino, a television reporter for "Eye to Eye" on Channel 7, interviewed appellant on February 27, 1994. The interview was recorded on video and showed that appellant made his confession willingly, openly and publicly in the presence of his wife, child and other relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Orlan Mauricio, a reporter for "Tell the People" on Channel 9 also interviewed appellant on February 25, 1994. He testified that:<br><blockquote>"Atty. Principe: You mentioned awhile ago that you were able to reach the place where the body of AAA was found, where did you start your interview, in what particular place?<br><br>Mr. Mauricio:&nbsp; Actually, I started my newsgathering and interview inside the police station of xxx and I identified myself to the accused as I have mentioned earlier, sir. At first, I asked him whether he was the one who raped and killed the victim and I also learned from him that the victim was his cousin.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was the response of Pablito Andan?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His response was he is a cousin of the victim and that he was responsible for raping and killing the victim, sir. And then I asked him whether his admission was voluntary or that there was a threat, intimidation or violence that was committed on his person because I knew that there were five other suspects in this case and he said that he was admitting it voluntarily to the policemen. I asked him whether he was under the influence of drugs but he said no, and "nakainom lang," sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned earlier that the uncle of the accused was present, was the uncle beside him at the time that you asked the question?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uncle was there including the barangay captain whose name I cannot recall anymore. A barangay captain of the place, I don't know if it is the place of the crime scene or in the place where AAA resides but . . . All throughout the scene inside the office of the Station Commander, there was no air of any force or any threatening nature of investigation that was being done on the suspect, that is why, I was able to talk to him freely and in a voluntary manner he admitted to me that he was the one who raped and killed, so we went to the next stage of accompanying me to the scene of the crime where the reenactment and everything that transpired during the killing of AAA.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you started that interview, did you inform or ask permission from the accused Pablito Andan that you were going to interview him?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned that after interviewing the accused at the office of the xxx PNP, you also went to the scene of the crime?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who accompanied you?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was accompanied by some xxx policemen including Mayor xxx and some of the relatives of the accused.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, did you see the wife of the accused, Pablito Andan?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir, I saw her at the place where the body of AAA was recovered.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many relatives of accused Pablito Andan were present, more or less?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many, sir, because there were many wailing, weeping and crying at that time when he was already taken in the patrol jeep of the xxx police, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Mr. Mauricio, upon reaching the scene of the crime in xxx, what transpired?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started my work as a reporter by trying to dig deeper on how the crime was committed by the accused, so we started inside the pigpen of that old house where I tried to accompany the accused and asked him to narrate to me and show me how he carried out the rape and killing of AAA, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he voluntarily comply?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir, in fact, I have it on my videotape.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear, Mr. Mauricio, that from the start of your interview at the PNP xxx up to the scene of the crime, all the stages were videotaped by you?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Journalist Berteni Causing of "People's Journal Tonite" likewise covered the proceedings for three successive days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> His testimony is as follows:<br><br>"Atty. Principe: You mentioned that you had your own inquiries?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We asked first permission from the mayor to interrupt their own investigation so that we can have a direct interview with the suspect.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there people?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people present before the crowd that included the mayor, the deputy chief of police, several of the policemen, the group of Inday Badiday and several other persons. I asked the suspect after the mayor presented the suspect to us and after the suspect admitted that he was the one who killed AAA. I reiterated the question to the suspect. Are you aware that this offense which is murder with . . . rape with murder is a capital offense? And you could be sentenced to death of this? And he said, Yes. So do you really admit that you were the one who did it and he repeated it, I mean, say the affirmative answer.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was in the presence of the crowd that you mentioned a while ago?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes, sir.

A second autopsy was conducted on March 1, 1994 by Dr. xxx, a medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation. His findings affirmed the absence of spermatozoa but revealed that the victim's hymen had lacerations, thus:<br><blockquote>"Hymen -- contracted, tall, thin with fresh lacerations with clotted blood at 6 and 3 o'clock positions corresponding to the walls of the clock."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Dr. xxx testified that the lacerations were fresh and that they may have been caused by an object forcibly inserted into the vagina when the victim was still alive, indicating the possibility of penetration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> His testimony is as follows:<br><br>"Witness: When I exposed the hymen, I found lacerations in this 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock position corresponding to the walls of the clock. x x x.<br><br>Court:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include the descriptive word, fresh.<br><br>Witness: I put it in writing that this is fresh because within the edges of the lacerations, I found blood clot, that is why I put it into writing as fresh.<br><br>Atty.

So, I presumed that when the doctor examined the victim with the use of forceps or retractor, vaginal retractor, then I assumed that the victim was already dead. So it is impossible that the lacerated wounds on the hymen were caused by those instruments because the victim was already dead and usually in a dead person we do not produce any bleeding.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you would like to tell the Court is this: that the lacerations with clotted blood at 6 and 3 o'clock positions corresponding to the walls of the clock could have been inflicted or could have been sustained while the victim was alive?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clotted blood, according to you, found at the edges of the lacerated wounds, now will you kindly go over the sketch you have just drawn and indicate the edges of the lacerated wounds where you found the clotted blood?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the lacerated wound at 3 o'clock and this is the lacerated wound at 6 o'clock.
