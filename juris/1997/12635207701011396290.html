DIRECT the Fiscal Management and Budget Officer to WITHHOLD retirement benefits
of respondent Judge de Guzman to answer for any penalty that may be imposed
for: (a) not deciding Criminal Case No. 23-94 which was deemed submitted beyond
the 90 day period; (b) not taking any initial action on Criminal Cases No.

correctness of the Quarterly Report of the court for the period ending March
31, 1994 (p. 4, <i>Rollo</i>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Court Administrator was then furnished a copy
of an undated letter of Ms. Teresita Astillazo, demanding from respondent
Jamlid the release of the cash deposit made in Criminal Case No. 78-94 in the
sum of <s>P</s>30,000.00 covered by OR No. 6625649M issued on November 11,

the dismissal of the case and the cancellation of bailbond in an order dated
January 2, 1995.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting thereon, on the Office of the Court Administrator referred
the matter to respondent Jamlid for comment.  However, despite due notice, respondent Jamlid failed to file his
comment which prompted this Court’s Third Division to issue a Resolution dated
August 28, 1995 suspending him from the office for a period of one month and ordering
him to file his comment within ten days from notice, with warning that failure
to do so will be dealt with more severely.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, by way of compliance with Resolution of June 27,
1995, respondent Jamlid filed a reply-letter dated July 31, 1995 stating that:</p>

Interpreter, a copy of her certification is hereto attached.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 6, <i>Rollo</i>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent Judge de Guzman, in his letter
dated August 9, 1995, sought reconsideration of the June 27, 1995 Resolution
insofar as it withheld his retirement benefits, citing the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case
No. 23-94 was never deemed submitted for decision on the merits:  (a) because the defense has not presented
any evidence yet; (b) the court cannot decide the case on mere position paper;
(c) while admittedly the court <i>a quo</i> did not resolve the move, no formal
or unwritten motion to resolve was ever filed; (d) it is clear under the law
that the procedure in the MTC should be the same as with the RTC;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal
Cases Nos. 05-95, 90-94, and 95-94, subpoenas were issued but they were not

No. 66-94 is related to Criminal Cases Nos. 41-94, 42-94 and 43-94 which he
disposed  by amicable settlement.  The dismissal of the said cases were

anymore when the case was set for hearing;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Memorandum dated December 26, 1995,
recommended that the Informal Preliminary Inquiry (OCA I.P.I 95-28-P) be
converted into an administrative matter and that it be consolidated with A.M.
No. 95-6-55 MTC and that respondent Jamlid be directed to explain and show

insubordination and gross dishonesty and be meted the penalty of dismissal from
the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, if any, with prejudice

with the following recommendations:</p>

<blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, in view of all the foregoing, we respectfully

should be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for the filing of appropriate

<blockquote>(pp.
63-64, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court has said time and time again that the conduct and
behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the administration
and disposition of justice -- from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk --
should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility as to let them
free from any suspicion that may taint the well-guarded image of the judiciary
(<u>Gano vs. Leonen</u>, 232 SCRA 98 [1994]).  It has always been emphasized that the conduct of judges and court
personnel must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum at all times,
but also be above suspicion.  Verily,
the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct,
official or otherwise, of the men and women, from the judge to the least and
lowest of its personnel, hence, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each
and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true
temple of justice (<u>Miro vs. Ta</u>n, 235 SCRA 400 [1994], <i>citing</i> <u>Recto
vs. Raulis</u> 70 SCRA 438 [1976]).  Thus
every employee of the court should be an exemplar of integrity, uprightness,
and honesty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful scrutiny of the records, the Court finds respondent
Judge de Guzman administratively liable for failing to decide Criminal Case No.
23-94 within the 30-day reglementary period for irregular termination of
criminal cases through amicable settlements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has consistently impressed upon members of the
judiciary the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously under the
time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied (Re: <u>Judge Luis
B. Bello, Jr</u>., 247 SCRA 519 [1995]).  Every judge should decide cases with dispatch (<u>Castro vs. Malazo</u>,
99 SCRA 164 [1980]) and should be careful, punctual and observant in the
performance of his functions (<u>Secretary of Justice vs. Bidin</u>, 41, SCRA
742 [1971]; <u>Escabillas vs. Martinez</u>, 78 SCRA 367 [1977]).  Failure to decide a case within the
reglementary period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency
warranting the imposition of administrative sanction on the defaulting judge (<u>Celino
vs. Abrogar</u>, 245 SCRA 304 [1995]; <u>Re: Report on the Judicial Audit
Conducted in the Regional Trial Court Branches 61, 134 and 147, Makati Metro
Manila,</u> 248 SCRA [1995]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge de Guzman claims that Criminal Case No. 23-94
was not submitted for decision as he can not decide the case on mere position
papers, and the accused has not presented any evidence yet.  The reasons given are not compelling.  As correctly observed by the Office the
Court Administrator, it is quite logical to presume that the parties filed
their position papers upon respondent Judge de Guzman’s direction for his own
consideration and the subsequent lack of setting of the case for hearing for a
considerable length of time after the submission of the position papers clearly
and strongly indicates that there was nothing more to be done in the case
except to resolve the same.  In fact,
respondent Judge de Guzman’s contention is belied by respondent Jamlid’s
admission in his reply-letter dated July 31, 1995 that the reason why the case
was not decided by respondent Judge de Guzman within the prescribed period was
that it was forgotten by respondent Judge de Guzman despite the necessary
reminders.  The accused’s
non-presentation of evidence does not exculpate respondent Judge de Guzman for
his inaction.  On the contrary, it even
shows and bolsters respondent Judge de Guzman’s ineffieciency and negligence in
managing the cases assigned to his sala.  Based on the records, a trial was conducted on September 20, 1994 where
the prosecution presented its evidence and rested its case.  Thereafter, no more trial was scheduled and
held.  What respondent Judge de Guzman
should have done was to immediately set the case for the reception of the
evidence of the accused. But for unknown reasons, respondent Judge de Guzman
did not.  Further, what makes respondent
Judge de Guzman’s inaction more censurable is that the Criminal Case No. 23-94
is a malicious mischief case, subject to the Rule on Summary Procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the charge of irregular termination of criminal cases
through amicable settlements, such charge has not been rebutted by respondent
Judge de Guzman.  On the contrary, the
charge was admitted by him in his letter dated August 9, 1995.</p>

<p class="BODY">Every judge is mandated to be prompt in disposing all cases
pending in his sala, but he must do so in accordance with the prescribed laws
and rules.  Here, respondent Judge de
Guzman was on the right path in trying to resolve or to terminate promptly the
criminal cases assigned to him.  But the
manner he chose and pursued in furtherance thereof -- amicable settlement -- is
not generally acceptable in criminal cases.  Under Articles 89 and 94 of the Revised Penal Code, amicable settlement
is not one of those modes of extinguishing criminal liability, for crimes are
transgressions against the State and are not subject to determination of the
parties, save in cases of private crimes.  Going over the criminal cases resolved by respondent Judge de Guzman
through amicable settlement, they did not involve private crimes.  </p>

<p class="BODY">Since respondent Judge de Guzman has already resigned from the
office, the Court finds the imposition of fine in the amount of Ten Thousand (P
10,000.00) Pesos to be deducted from his retirement benefits proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court now shifts its attention to the charges against
respondent Jamlid.</p>

<p class="BODY">During its examination, the audit team called the attention of
respondent Jamlid concerning the unremitted cash amount of <s>P</s>30,000.00
covered by OR No. 6625649M dated November 11, 1994 which he admitted to be in
his possession.  In his letter-reply
dated July 31, 1995, respondent Jamlid merely stated that he had talked to
Teresita Astillazo and requested that he be given up to August 30, 1995 to
settle said obligation.  The reason
advanced by respondent Jamlid is likewise not compelling.  On the contrary, it even reveals his
liability.  As the cash amount was
covered by O.R. No. 6625649M dated November 11, 1994 issued by respondent
Jamlid himself, it became part of public funds which have to be immediately and
necessarily remitted to the Court.  Thus, said cash, being part of public funds, is not a personal
obligation of respondent Jamlid to Teresita Astillazo, and will only be
returned to latter upon proper court order.  In fact, when made to explain regarding the undated letter of Teresita
Astillazo demanding the release of the said cash amount, respondent Jamlid
failed to file any answer or comment, despite the necessary <i>caveat</i> that
failure to do so will be dealt with more severely.  Such failure strengthens, and worse, aggravates his
liability.  If only respondent Jamlid
properly remitted the said cash amount, there would have been no obstacle in
its immediate release to Teresita Astillazo.  But, for unknown reasons, respondent Jamlid has not remitted to the
Court said cash amount up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to such failure, respondent Jamlid transgressed the trust
reposed in him as cashier and disbursement officer of the Court (See Chapter
VII, Sec, B, Manual for Clerks of Court, July 1991, p. 123).  It likewise amounts to violation of the
standing circulars of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Administrative Circular No. 13-92, in this regard, pertinently
provides that all collection for bailbonds, rental deposits, and other
fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court
concerned, upon receipt thereof, with the authorized government depository bank
(Land Bank of the Philippines).  Should
there be no Land Bank of the Philippines branch in the locality, the Clerk of
Court shall deposit all collections with any rural bank in the area, furnishing
the Accounting Division of the Supreme Court such information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Administrative Circular No. 32-93 provides
that all Clerks of Court and Accountable Officers are enjoined to follow
strictly the following prescribed guidelines:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Submission

<p class="BODY">Moreover, respondent Jamlid’s failure to turn over the cash not
only constitutes gross negligence in the performance of his duty, but likewise
gross dishonesty and even malvaresation of funds which cannot be countenanced
by the Court for they diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary (see <u>Lirios
vs. Oliveros</u>, 253 SCRA 258 [1996]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>JDF Anomaly in the RTC of Ligao, Albay</u> (255 SCRA 221
[1996]), the Court re-echoed its pronouncement in <u>Gano vs. Leonen</u> (<i>supra</i>)
that “public service require the utmost integrity and strictest
discipline.  Thus, a public servant must
exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity.  No less than the Constitution sanctifies the
principle that public office is a public trust, and enjoins all public officers
and employees to serve with the highest degree of  responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.  The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards
for Public Officials and Employees additionally provides that every public
servant shall at all times uphold public interest over his or her personal
interest.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules
implementing Book V of Executive Order 292, gross negligence in the performance
of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct are classified as grave offenses for
which the penalty of dismissal is imposed.  Section 9 of the said Rule likewise provides that “the penalty of
dismissal shall carry with it cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave
credits and retirement benefits and the disqualification for re-employment in
the government service.  Further, it may
be imposed without prejudiced to criminal liability.”</p>
