				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="left">LORENZO TOPAGUEN alias Apiat&nbsp; was charged with three (3) counts of rape in separate Informations filed with the Regional Trial Court of xxx.&nbsp; After trial he was found guilty as charged and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case and to indemnify each victim P40,000.00 for moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The accused now comes to us on appeal.<br><br>The facts: At twelve o'clock noon of 15 December 1990, AAA, 9, and BBB, 9-1/2, were sitting on the stairs of the house of a certain Mendoza at xxx, when Lorenzo Topaguen approached them.&nbsp; He showed them some money and asked them to follow him.<br><br>CCC, intimately called CCC, 9, was on her way home from the xxx where she fetched water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attention was attracted by the presence of AAA and BBB sitting on the stairs of Mendoza.&nbsp; CCC saw <i>Apiat</i>&nbsp; in the act of removing the pants of AAA and BBB and&nbsp; saying, <i>"I just want to see if&nbsp; you have panties."</i>&nbsp; CCC then hurried home to bring the water she was carrying and went back to where she saw AAA and BBB earlier.&nbsp; However they were no longer there.&nbsp; CCC proceeded to the house of Apiat which was just nearby.&nbsp; As she was about to peep through the window the accused suddenly grabbed her and dragged her inside his house.&nbsp; There she saw AAA and BBB seated on the bed of accused Apiat.&nbsp; Apiat&nbsp; ordered the three (3) girls to lie down and threatened to&nbsp; kill them should they talk or disobey&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was&nbsp; armed&nbsp; with a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he took off his pants, undressed his victims and had carnal knowledge of them one&nbsp; after another - first with AAA, then with CCC,&nbsp; and finally with BBB who resisted at first.&nbsp; However, Apiat&nbsp; whipped BBB until she submitted to his lustful advances.&nbsp; He inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt pain so she begged the accused to stop but the latter continued until his lust was satisfied.<br><br>After his encounter with the three (3) victims, the accused gave BBB P16.50.&nbsp; But before sending them away he told the girls that he enjoyed his sexual intercourse with them.<br><br>The following day BBB confided their grisly experience to her mother DDD.&nbsp; DDD immediately brought AAA and BBB to the xxx Hospital where they were physically examined by Dr. xxx.&nbsp; The medical findings showed that AAA's&nbsp; vulva&nbsp; was erythematous and her hymen fully lacerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As regards BBB, the medical report likewise revealed that her vulva was&nbsp; erythematous, her hymen ruptured, and her skin on the left elbow and right knee was superficially scraped off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;On 17 December 1990&nbsp; DDD also&nbsp; brought CCC to Dr. xxx who found that her patient's vulva was also erythematous with rupture and lacerations of the hymen, and her right chest, back, as well as&nbsp; left flank swollen.&nbsp; She was in pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The physical examination conducted by Dr. xxx confirmed that there was penetration of the vaginas of AAA, BBB and CCC by a male sexual organ.<br><br>The accused had a different story to tell.&nbsp; He insisted that he never raped anyone in his life.&nbsp; He alleged that in the afternoon of 15 December 1990 he was asleep in his house as he was on a drinking spree that morning.&nbsp; He claimed that he already started to drink gin and beer earlier that day so that at eleven o'clock he had to be brought home by an acquaintance on a tricycle and went straight to bed and sleep.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was only awakened&nbsp; when&nbsp; he&nbsp; heard voices of children in gay abandon.&nbsp; They were AAA, BBB and CCC. According to him, he heard BBB say, <i>"Ka at nan kinaot mo iska borsana?"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> At&nbsp; that&nbsp; time he did not understand what the question meant as he was still groggy so he just went&nbsp; back&nbsp; to sleep.<br><br>At&nbsp; five&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; that afternoon he&nbsp; woke&nbsp; up&nbsp; to defecate&nbsp; and&nbsp; look for a cigarette.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; went&nbsp; to Mendoza's&nbsp; store but when he was about to pay for the cigarettes he discovered that his money was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; then realized that he must have been robbed by the children.<br><br><i>Apiat</i> described his room as being separated by a single wall of 3/8-inch plyboard and any noise originating therefrom could be easily heard by his neighbors.&nbsp; But he claimed that when he went out that afternoon neither the children playing in the yard nor the women playing cards accused him of molesting the three (3) girls.&nbsp; He surmised however that the motive behind the filing&nbsp; of the rape case against him was because the children disliked him as he was a drunkard and that a niece of his wanted him behind bars so she could take possession of his house.<br><br>Alfonso Mendoza, a neighbor of the accused as well as of complainants, attempted to corroborate the version of the defense.&nbsp; According to Mendoza, between eleven in the morning and twelve o'clock noon of 15 December 1990, while he was sitting on the stairs of his house, Apiat passed by.&nbsp; They teased one another.&nbsp; He called Apiat&nbsp; <i>"Commander&nbsp; Pusa."</i>&nbsp; Mendoza claimed&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; many&nbsp; children playing at that time and women playing cards&nbsp; in&nbsp; the backyard of the accused.&nbsp; He also said that he did not know of any complaint for rape against Apiat until 15 December 1990.<br><br>But the trial court was not persuaded.&nbsp; It found the accused guilty as charged.&nbsp; It observed that -<br><br>x x x x&nbsp; the clear and positive assertions of the complainants-witnesses to the effect&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused had sexual intercourse with&nbsp; them in&nbsp; his&nbsp; quarters at noon&nbsp; or thereabouts&nbsp; on December 15, 1990 are on the whole&nbsp; plausible.&nbsp; The individual testimonies of AAA, CCC, and&nbsp; BBB on how the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; inserted&nbsp; his penis into&nbsp; each of the&nbsp; girls'&nbsp; vaginas, one after the other, jibes substantially on material&nbsp; points.&nbsp; Albeit the descriptions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; alleged victims of the incidents are&nbsp; not very much&nbsp; detailed, such&nbsp; narrations&nbsp; having been made by innocent children is&nbsp; sufficient, taken&nbsp; in its entirety to establish the&nbsp; truth of&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter (<i>PP vs. Natan,</i> GR No.&nbsp; 6649, January 25, 1991).&nbsp; The minor&nbsp; inconsistencies or conflicts in the gamut of the complainants' statements do not detract from the veracity of the&nbsp; principal points.&nbsp; The discrepancies&nbsp; may even&nbsp; be considered as ear-marks&nbsp; of&nbsp; honesty.&nbsp; Given&nbsp; the tender ages of the&nbsp; children,&nbsp; they are&nbsp; expected to contradict&nbsp; themselves under extended, repetitious,&nbsp; and gruelling interrogations&nbsp; (<i>PP vs. Decena,</i> GR. No.&nbsp; 3713, February 9, 1952).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In this appeal, accused-appellant assails his conviction.&nbsp; He contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimonies&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; prosecution witnesses&nbsp; should not have been given credence.&nbsp; First, he questions the credibility of AAA because her testimony conflicts with a previously executed sworn statement.&nbsp; Secondly, he challenges the findings in the medical certificate issued by Dr. xxx as being unreliable because of her inexperience.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also claims that the trial court erred in giving weight to the bare and self-serving allegations&nbsp; of private complainants whose testimonies were not corroborated by other credible and competent evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; maintains&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was inherently impossible for him to commit the crime of rape considering his advanced age, more so that he allegedly raped all three (3) victims on a single occasion.<br><br>We cannot sustain the defense.&nbsp; It is elementary that conclusions as to the credibility of witnesses&nbsp; in rape&nbsp; cases&nbsp; lie heavily on the sound judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court which is generally accorded&nbsp; great&nbsp; weight and respect, if not conclusive effect.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the appreciation of the evidence the appellate court accords due deference to the trial court's&nbsp; views&nbsp; on who should be given credence, since the latter is in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses considering its opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; observe their&nbsp; demeanor as well as their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.&nbsp; Its findings on&nbsp; the credibility of witnesses will be sustained by the appellate court unless the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied the facts or circumstances of weight and&nbsp; substance&nbsp; which will&nbsp; alter the assailed decision or affect the&nbsp; result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In this instance, none of the excepting circumstances is availing.<br><br>The contention of accused-appellant that there are&nbsp; inconsistencies between the testimony of AAA and her sworn statement with respect to the presence of CCC as rape victim is bereft of merit.&nbsp; On&nbsp; direct examination, AAA testified -<br><blockquote>COURT:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; answer of the witness is&nbsp; Apiat&nbsp; made sexual intercourse with us, now&nbsp; what&nbsp; do&nbsp; you&nbsp; mean&nbsp; when you said that, with whom among you did Apiat&nbsp; make sexual intercourse?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and BBB.<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>&nbsp;Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the family name of BBB?<br><br>&nbsp;A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes sir.<br><br>&nbsp;Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Witness, you said that the accused had sexual&nbsp; intercourse with you, where did this happen, what particular place?<br><br>&nbsp;A:&nbsp;&nbsp; At his house.<br><br>&nbsp;Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; At the house of Apiat?<br><br>&nbsp;A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes sir.<br><br>&nbsp;Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; When you said Apiat&nbsp; are you&nbsp; referring&nbsp; to the accused in this case?<br><br>&nbsp;A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the full name?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Lorenzo Topaguen.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Witness, when he told you&nbsp; that&nbsp; you will&nbsp; (sic) go to the bed,&nbsp; did you like to&nbsp; go to the bed, Miss Witness?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; No sir.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; And what did you&nbsp; do when you did not like to go to the bed?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; He threatened us.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he say when he threatened you?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; said that if we do (sic) not&nbsp; like&nbsp; he will&nbsp; (sic) kill us.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know CCC?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Was she there in the house that time?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp; So how many of you were there&nbsp; in the house with whom&nbsp; Apiat&nbsp; had&nbsp; intercourse?<br><br>ATTY.&nbsp; PADONG:<br><br>We object to the question being suggestive , your honor.

PADONG:<br><br>We object to that line of questioning your honor, since there was never any mention of peeping at the window.<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>The question is, counsel should listen carefully to the answer of the witness so that we will not be delayed in the presentation of our evidence.&nbsp; Witness said that CCC&nbsp; was peeping&nbsp; and we are now asking what time did that happen.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; When all these things that you had testified&nbsp; to transpired, what else happened there in the house of Apiat, if any?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; No more.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; So meaning to say that when&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; Apiat allegedly had sexual intercourse&nbsp; with&nbsp; you&nbsp; and&nbsp; BBB&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; nobody&nbsp; else there and nothing&nbsp; happened&nbsp; after that?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; None sir.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; So meaning they were the only ones&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; where were you when Apiat&nbsp;&nbsp; went&nbsp; to pull CCC?<br><br>ATTY. PADONG:<br><br>No&nbsp; basis, we object to the&nbsp; questioning as having no basis.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>The objection is well taken because there&nbsp; was no mention of any CCC.<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>There was.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Probably the other witnesses can testify to&nbsp; that&nbsp; matter.&nbsp; The&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court is that she was only with BBB.<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; statement&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; three&nbsp; and she mentioned that at first&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp; two&nbsp; of&nbsp; them&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp; later&nbsp;&nbsp; came&nbsp; CCC&nbsp; peeping through the&nbsp; window&nbsp; and this Apiat went to&nbsp; pull&nbsp; her inside.&nbsp; That is&nbsp; what&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; at&nbsp; first&nbsp; which&nbsp; was not accurately translated.<br><br>ATTY. PADONG:<br><br>The witness was relating having been molested having had sexual&nbsp;&nbsp; intercourse&nbsp;&nbsp; with BBB and&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; after&nbsp; that&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; gave&nbsp; them&nbsp; P16.50&nbsp; and they&nbsp; went&nbsp; out and after&nbsp; that nobody else was there&nbsp; so&nbsp; nothing happened&nbsp; and&nbsp; they went to the&nbsp; stairs&nbsp; where&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp; were&nbsp; sitting&nbsp; and then they went home&nbsp; in the&nbsp; afternoon&nbsp; that&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; only&nbsp; narration&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as counsel has noted,&nbsp; your honor.<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>That&nbsp; is&nbsp; why&nbsp; we are saying&nbsp; your&nbsp; honor that the witness has&nbsp; also mentioned a&nbsp; certain CCC who&nbsp; was pulled inside, that is why we are trying to clarify the participation of&nbsp; this&nbsp; CCC if she was&nbsp; there&nbsp; during&nbsp; the incident.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp; were&nbsp; in the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused Lorenzo Topaguen, with you was BBB is that correct?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see anybody else also&nbsp; around&nbsp; the house when you were there?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; None sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear from the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; that AAA&nbsp; confirmed the presence of CCC at the&nbsp; scene of the crime although she did not categorically state that CCC was also raped.&nbsp; But the alleged contradiction between AAA's testimony and her sworn statement&nbsp; may be explained by&nbsp; the fact that during her direct examination AAA was&nbsp; under unfamiliar surroundings and strange atmosphere and she simply wanted to end her testimony.&nbsp; The unrelenting objections posed by defense counsel, followed by the barrage of questions from the court, caused her to wish her testimony had ended soonest, thus resulting in&nbsp; the anticlimactic termination of her testimony which&nbsp; left out CCC as another rape victim.<br><br>AAA was&nbsp; only&nbsp; nine&nbsp; (9)&nbsp; years&nbsp; old&nbsp; when&nbsp; she went through her&nbsp; traumatic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; such, error-free testimonies could not be expected&nbsp; especially when&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; recounting&nbsp; details&nbsp; of&nbsp; a terrifying ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Minor lapses&nbsp; should be&nbsp; expected when a person is made to recall&nbsp; minor details of&nbsp; an&nbsp; experience so humiliating and so painful as rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After all,&nbsp; the&nbsp; credibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; rape&nbsp; victim&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; destroyed&nbsp; by some inconsistencies in her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Moreover, testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that on direct examination AAA failed to testify regarding the presence of CCC during the rape such omission is not fatal to the cause of the prosecution.&nbsp; BBB, one of the rape victims, testified thus -<br><blockquote>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; will&nbsp; rephrase.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; CCC&nbsp; was peeping&nbsp; according to you at the&nbsp; window&nbsp; what did Apiat&nbsp; do, if any?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he went out and pulled CCC inside and placed her on his bed so we were all three whom he undressed.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; CCC,&nbsp; what&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; the complete name of CCC?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; CCC.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; The other name?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes sir.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; What is her family name?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; CCC.<br><br>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<br><br>PROSECUTOR PATNA-AN:<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; When he had sexual intercourse with AAA whom did he have sexual&nbsp; intercourse next?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; CCC and after that I was next.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant also avers that it was error for the court a quo to have relied on the testimony and findings of Dr. xxx as the latter had no experience yet in the physical examination of rape victims.&nbsp; We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not agree.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally,&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; person&nbsp; who&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; study&nbsp; or experience has acquired particular knowledge or expertise may be allowed to give in&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; his opinion upon matters of technical knowledge relating to such business or employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> While it may be that the cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; AAA, BBB and CCC were&nbsp; the&nbsp; initial cases on rape&nbsp; handled by Dr. xxx, such&nbsp; fact is not a bar to her testimony being given credence&nbsp; since the&nbsp; prosecution was&nbsp; able at the&nbsp; first&nbsp; instance&nbsp; to qualify her as a medical&nbsp; expert.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; it cannot be said that the&nbsp; prosecution relied solely on the hymenal lacerations of the victims as&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of rape but on the testimonies&nbsp; of complainants themselves which, standing alone and&nbsp; even without&nbsp; medical&nbsp; examination,&nbsp; were&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> A medical examination is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape otherwise grave and irreparable injustice would be inflicted upon&nbsp; hapless victims&nbsp; if&nbsp; the crime be committed in remote areas where&nbsp; there&nbsp; may be&nbsp; no doctors to&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; a&nbsp; medical examination&nbsp; on the rape&nbsp;&nbsp; victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;&nbsp; too,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; victim&nbsp; would&nbsp; not&nbsp; submit&nbsp; to&nbsp; physical examination&nbsp; since&nbsp; what immediately&nbsp; preoccupies her mind after her ordeal is not necessarily the filing of a complaint but the fear of what the perpetrator will further inflict upon her should she reveal his criminal act, or the embarrassment and humiliation accompanying a&nbsp;&nbsp; public disclosure&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; ignominy&nbsp; and&nbsp; dishonor&nbsp; she&nbsp; suffered in&nbsp; the hands of her tormentor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant further claims that there was no credible&nbsp; or&nbsp; competent evidence to show that&nbsp; AAA, BBB&nbsp; and CCC's vaginas had been penetrated by a male organ as their hymenal lacerations could have been caused by several factors other than sexual intercourse. Ironically, while the accused questions the&nbsp; qualifications&nbsp; of Dr. xxx as&nbsp; medical expert, he nonetheless relies on her findings as to the cause of the injuries.&nbsp; In a case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court held -<br><br>Appellant loses sight of the fact that&nbsp; while the&nbsp; prosecution had&nbsp;&nbsp; proved that the laceration&nbsp; was caused by sexual&nbsp; intercourse, contrarily he had failed to establish that the laceration was caused by other factors.&nbsp; It is elementary&nbsp; in&nbsp; our rules on evidence&nbsp; that&nbsp; a party&nbsp;&nbsp; must&nbsp;&nbsp; prove his&nbsp; own&nbsp; affirmative allegations.<br><br>Lastly, the defense posits that it was incredulous for accused-appellant to have committed the rapes considering his rather advanced age and that he supposedly raped all three (3) girls on just one occasion.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; He was only fifty-six (56) years old at the time he sexually assaulted his victims.&nbsp; But even if he was older his age would not mean that sexual intercourse was no longer possible as age is not a criterion, taken alone, in determining the sexual interest and capability of&nbsp; middle-aged&nbsp; and&nbsp; older people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision&nbsp; appealed from finding accused-appellant LORENZO TOPAGUEN&nbsp;&nbsp; alias Apiat&nbsp; guilty of three (3) counts of rape and sentencing him to<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion perpetua</span> in each&nbsp; case is AFFIRMED, with the modification&nbsp; that&nbsp; the indemnity&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; P40,000.00&nbsp; for&nbsp; each rape&nbsp; victim&nbsp; is increased to P50,000.00 conformably with existing jurisprudence.&nbsp; Costs against accused-appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, (Chairman), Vitug, Kapunan,</i> and <i>Hermosisima, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="left" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Decision penned by Judge xxx,&nbsp; RTC-Br. xxx, xxx.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Records, Crim.&nbsp; Case No. 814 , p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id., Crim.
