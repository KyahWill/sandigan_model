				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"></p><div align="JUSTIFY">The instant administrative case arose from an anonymous
letter-complaint dated April 18, 1995 addressed to the Office of the Court
Administrator charging Adela A. Geverola, Clerk of Court IV, MTCC, Davao City
of falsifying the daily time records of her two nephews who are under her
direct supervision, of continuing to collect her salary despite being abroad on
a vacation, of immorality of carrying on an affair with a married man, and for
accepting “grease” money from “Japayukis” in exchange for facilitating
marriages (pp. 1-2, <i>Rollo</i>).<p></p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the said anonymous letter-complaint, the Office of the
Court Administrator sent a letter dated August 2, 1996 to the Bureau of
Immigration and Deportation (BID) requesting information regarding the
departure from the country for the United States of America and the arrival in
the Philippines of respondent within a ten-year period from 1985 to 1995 (p. 3,
Rollo).  The BID responded thereto in a
letter dated September 6, 1996 which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>EVALUATION: Before the Leave Section of the Court approves
applications for sick leave in excess of five (5) days, the applications must
be accompanied by the required Medical Certificates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When an employee states that he or she is sick, it is presumed that
said employee is really suffering from a current ailment – not gallivanting
halfway around the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the records of the Bureau of Immigration, it is very clear
that Ms. Geverola left the country for Tokyo, Japan on June 5, 1993 and she
arrived from Seoul, South Korea on July 17, 1993.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obviously, Ms. Geverola was never in Davao City, nor any part of
the country, last July 1, 1993 when she was allegedly diagnosed  as having “Pityriasis Roseo &amp; Massive
Allergy” as she was abroad.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Simply put, Ms. Geverola FALSIFIED her application for sick leave,
induced Dr. Amoroso of the Office of the City Health Officer of Davao City to
issue a Medical Certificate to support her application for sick leave and,
likewise, induced then Executive Judge Virginia Hofilena-Europa to approve the
same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ms. Geverola and Judge Europa must be required to submit their
respective comments on this very serious matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 23-24, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Court Administrator, following up respondent’s
explanation to it (p. 22, Rollo), submitted a Memorandum dated May 13, 1997, finding
respondent guilty of falsification of her daily time record for July 1-31,
1993, and of dishonesty for accepting her basic salary and personal economic
relief allowance (PERA) for July 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, 1993 in the amount
of <s>P</s> 2,308.19, and recommending that she be suspended from the office
for six months without pay and be ordered to return the <s>P</s> 2,308.19 to
the court (p. 30, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful perusal of the records of the case, the Court fully
subscribes to the finding of the Office of the Court Administrator that
respondent is guilty of falsification of her application for sick leave dated
July 1, 1993 and of her daily time record for the month of July, 1993, which
are both official documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">An anonymous complaint is always received with great caution,
originating as it does form an unknown author.  However, a complaint of such sort does not always justify its outright
dismissal for being baseless or unfounded for such complaint may be easy of verification
and may, without difficulty, be substantiated and established by other
competent evidence, as in the present case where the complaint was forthwith
supported by competent evidence such as the Certifications of Bureau of
Immigration dated September 6 and October 9, 1996, the daily time record for
the months of June and July 1993, the applications for vacation and sick leave,
the medical certificate and the records on file with the Leave and Records
Section of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent denied the charge by alleging that her application for
sick leave  for July 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
and 9, 1993 was supported by a medical certificate issued by Doctor Natividad
A. Amorso of the Office of the City Health Officer, Davao City and approved by
Atty.  Adelaida Cabe-Baumann, Deputy
Clerk of Court, Chief Administrative officer, Office of Administrative Service
of the Court; that her daily time record for the month of July 1993 was duly
signed by Executive Judge Virginia Hofileña-Europa; that due to competent
medical care, she got well and immediately reported back to work on July 19,
1993, having in mind the exigency of the service; and that the various
administrative cases against her were intended to harass, discredit, and
besmirch her name and reputation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The explanation is far too pat, unsatisfactory, and
uncompelling.  The Certifications of the
BID reveal that the respondent left the country for Tokyo, Japan aboard a
Northwest Airlines plane on June 5, 1993 and arrived in Manila from Seoul,
South Korea on July 17, 1993.  Indeed,
respondent’s records on file with the Leave and Records Section of the Court,
on the other hand, show that she filed two leave applications -- one dated June
1, 1993 for 18 days vacation commencing June 7, until June 30, 1993 and the
other dated July 1, 1993 for 7 days sick leave for July 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9,
1993 and 5 days forced leave for July 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 1993.  Respondent, by applying for sick leave and
by stating in her daily time record for the month of July 1993 that she was ill
on July 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, 1993 when in truth and in fact she was not but
was abroad, is guilty of falsification.  Respondent’s absence from the country on July1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9,
1993 was clearly established by the Certifications of the BID.  Thus, respondent could not have been
examined and treated by Dr. Natividad A. Amoroso in the Philippines on July 1,
1993 for Pityriasis Renea and Massive Allergy, as stated in the medical
certificate, and the statement by the doctor that respondent was ill on July 1,
2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, 1993 cannot be given any weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, respondent’s actuations do not only constitute
falsification but likewise dishonesty and duplicity which deserve appropriate
sanction from the Court.  Her actuations
were further aggravated when she still received the amount of <s>P</s> 2,308.19
as over payment of her basic salary and personal economic relief allowance
(PERA) for July 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, 1993, the dates when she was allegedly
ill in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public service requires utmost integrity and discipline.  A public servant must exhibit at all times
the highest sense of honesty and integrity for no less than the Constitution
mandates the principle that “a public office is a public trust and all public
officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve
them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency” (Section 1,
Article XI, <i>1987 Constitution</i>).  As the administration of justice is a sacred task, the persons involved
in it ought to live up to the strictest standard of honesty and integrity (<i>Hernandez
vs. Borja</i>, 242 SCRA 162 [1995]).  Their conduct, at all times, must not only be characterized by propriety
and decorum but, above all else, must be above suspicion.  Thus, every employee of the judiciary should
be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty (<i>Basco vs. Gregorio</i>,
245 SCRA 614 [1995]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent, as Branch Clerk of Court of a court of justice, must
bear in mind that the office she holds and the duties as well as the
responsibilities appurtenant thereto require from its holder competence,
honesty and integrity; that , in relation to the judge, she occupies position
of confidence which should not be betrayed; and that with the prestige of the
office goes the corresponding responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the
court and its proceedings, to earn respect therefor, to maintain the authenticity
and correctness of court records, and to uphold the confidence of the public in
the administration of justice (<i>Rudas vs. Acedo</i>, 247 SCRA 237 [1995]
citing Section B, Manual for Clerks of Court, p.3).  Respondent has failed to measure up to the standards exacted by
her position.  She has not been true to
these lofty ideals so essential for the proper and effective administration of
justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the penalty imposable, considering that respondent has been
in the government service for 39 years, the last 22 years of which have been in
the judiciary, the Court finds the penalty of suspension for two (2) months
without pay commensurate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, for falsification and dishonesty, respondent
Adela A. Geverola, Clerk of Court IV, MTCC, Davao City, is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUSPENDED </span>for
