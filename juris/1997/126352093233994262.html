Neither do minor inconsistencies make their testimonies implausible. Rather, their narration of what transpired on that fateful night when the victim was slain should be weighed and compared with the other pieces of evidence presented, so that truth may be discovered and justice rendered.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Statement of the Case</span><br></div><br>Appellant Ernesto Jamiro, then a member of the Integrated National Police (now Philippine National Police or PNP) assigned to Bacoor, Cavite, was accused of killing a certain Eduardo (“Dado”) Mulingbayan. The President waived court martial jurisdiction over his case. Hence, Constabulary Judge Advocate Fortunato M. de Gracia, Jr. referred the case to the provincial prosecutor of Cavite City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for civil prosecution.<br><br>After conducting a preliminary investigation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Asst.

Thereafter, appellant told those who witnessed the incident to leave the place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Fuentes was on his way home on that fateful night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Near the store of Mang Buling,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> he saw appellant shoot Dado. He also heard appellant warn everyone against testifying on what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He added that the victim was then carried to a tricycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Ortiz testified that on December 19, 1989, between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., he was with Dado, seated on a bench and drinking beer at Mang Buling’s store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Appellant suddenly appeared with a gun and forthwith shot Dado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The gunshot was fatal. Dado succumbed to death even before his arrival at the Cavinti Clinic in Moonwalk, Las Piñas, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Postmortem Findings of Medico-Legal Officer Roberto V.

No determination could be made as to the type of firearm used due to lack of basis for identification.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Version of the Defense</span><br></div><br>For his defense, Appellant Jamiro denied authorship of the crime and set up alibi. According to him, on that tragic night he was assigned to the Zapote public market, where he reported for work at seven o’clock in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Pfc. Armando Dumali, chief of the operations department of his INP unit, even came to check on him and his colleagues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and found them at their outpost twice, first around 8:00 p.m. and second at 10:00 p.m. Dumali left the post later at 10:20 p.m. after drinking coffee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Consequently, appellant said that it was impossible for him to have been at the crime scene in Queensrow Subdivision, also in Bacoor, Cavite, which was allegedly about 45 minutes away by car from their outpost in Zapote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Defense Witnesses Police Inspector Jose B. Salamante<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and SPO1 Armando Dumali<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> substantially corroborated the alibi of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Trial Court’s Ruling</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></div><br>The court a quo gave full faith and credit to the testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses Manaois, Fuentes and Ortiz. It found the three witnesses candid and straightforward, without any ill motive to testify falsely against the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Further, the lower court dismissed the defense of alibi in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The claim of the accused was that he was not at the scene of the crime as he was assigned at Zapote Public Market Police Outpost, Bacoor, Cavite. The accused and witnesses failed to amply prove the physical impossibility for accused to reach Queensrow Subdivision, Molino, Bacoor, that late fateful night of December 19, 1989 from his place of assignment at Zapote, Bacoor, Cavite. No less than defense witness SPO1 Armando Dumali contended that it would take one-half hour to reach the place of the incident using a private vehicle at night (tsn. October 20, 1992, pp. [sic] 14). It was the same defense witness SPO1 Armando Dumali who contended that accused was a member of the Patrol Division. Moreover, having been a policeman assigned at Bacoor, Police Station since August, 1989 (tsn. January 14, 14, 1993, p. 22). without doubt, he had gained experiences and friends. He could easily hire or secure a vehicle to reach the place of incident and to accomplish his dastard act. His claim that he owns no vehicle and rides on a public conveyance (tsn. id., 48) would not in any way be a deterrent from accomplishing his evil scheme.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>The court a quo qualified the killing to murder, finding that there was treachery when Appellant Jamiro suddenly appeared from behind his unwary victim and shot the latter. It held: “The accused had consciously shot the right front ear of the victim to ensure the demise of the victim. It is stressed herein that the accused was unarmed, defenseless, unsuspecting and unaware of the impending assault done to him by the accused-policeman.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The appellant moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the trial court’s Decision, raising as issues the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the appreciation of treachery, and reiterating his defense of alibi. The appellant also moved that the judge inhibit herself from resolving the motion for reconsideration and the pleadings filed in connection therewith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The trial court, however, dismissed both motions in its Orders dated June 1, 1994<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and August 26, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In dismissing the motion for inhibition, the trial judge declared:<br><blockquote>The Court’s observation referring to the candidness and straightforwardness of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses did not limit itself to their demeanor at the witness stand but also the assessment of their testimonies, as a whole, as recorded in the transcripts of the stenographic notes that were taken when they testified. It is the firm stand of the undersigned judge that she could properly and amply evaluate, assess and look into not only on the demeanor of the witnesses at the witness stand, but also on their candor and manner of answering the questions posed at them during the conduct of their direct, cross, redirect and recross examinations, as duly recorded and reflected in the transcribed notes. She had patiently read, examined, appreciated and narrated the testimony of each of the witnesses, not only for the prosecution but that of the defense, at the 13-page challenged decision of this case. She could say with certainty that she made just findings and conclusions in the disputed decision based on the culled facts and circumstances from the evidence on record, subject, of course, to the evaluation of the same by the higher appellate courts. xxx”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assignment of Errors</span><br></div><br>Appellant Jamiro raises in his appeal brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely abused its discretion in rejecting the SC ruling that the silence of the alleged prosecution witnesses for almost two years puts in doubt their credibility and renders unreliable their story.<br><br>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely abused its discretion in giving credence to alleged eyewitnesses who where (sic) contradi[c]tory on material points, were coached, rehearsed, and evasive, and who have motives to testify falsely against accused.<br><br>“3. The trial court gravely abused its discretion when it adjudged the guilt of the accused when in the face of the evidence presented, he should be acquitted for insufficiency of evidence, or at the least, reasonable doubt.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote>In sum, his appeal hinges on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the sufficiency of evidence to convict the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The appeal is without merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Credibility of Prosecution Witnesses<br></div><br>We shall deal with the challenges posed by the appellant with respect to the credibility of the eyewitnesses, seriatim. First, Appellant Jamiro posits that the long silence (two years) of the eyewitnesses and their failure to report the incident to the authorities, to the family of the victim, or to anyone else, render their testimonies dubious; such silence shows that they acted contrary to normal human behavior.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Time and again, this Court has ruled that, when confronted with startling occurrences, behavioral responses of witnesses are diverse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Indeed, there is no uniform reaction or standard behavioral response to grisly events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In numerous instances, we have declared that the reluctance of eyewitnesses to testify on a crime and to get involved in a criminal investigation are but normal and do not by themselves affect the witnesses’ credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The sealed lips of said witnesses are but a natural and spontaneous reaction. They may opt to remain silent rather than to imperil their own lives and those of their families.<br><br>In this case, fear stifled the witnesses from immediately voicing out their knowledge of the incident. Right after shooting the victim, the accused threatened them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is not difficult to understand that a person who can deliberately kill another in a public place has the ability to carry out such threat and, thus, to create disquietude in the minds of the people who witnessed his felonious act. Moreover, Eyewitness Fuentes knew that appellant was a member of the Integrated National Police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> If a policeman threatens the citizens he is tasked by law to protect, such citizens cannot be expected to report with alacrity their supposed protector’s felony.<br><br>Moreover, neither substantive nor procedural law requires any person witnessing a crime to immediately report the matter to the proper authorities or to give his or her statement thereon. Under the circumstances, this Court cannot impute fault to the eyewitnesses for not reporting the incident to anyone or for not executing a sworn statement. In People vs. Reoveros,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we declared that the lapse of a considerable length of time before a witness comes forward to reveal the identity of the assailant does not taint the credibility of the witness and his testimony where such delay is satisfactorily explained. Besides, once apprehension is overcome by a desire to speak the truth, the witness must be welcomed by the courts in order that truth may be ascertained and justice dispensed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Witness Fuentes explained his inaction in this wise:<blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="8%"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td width="92%"><div align="left">In so far and in connection with what you have witnessed you never reported the incident to any police authorities?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></th><td><div align="left"> No Sit [sic], I was not able considering that I was thinking that the victim has a realtive [sic] who can make reports to the authorities.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">And you did not also tell or report what you witnessed to any relatives of the victims [sic]?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">No Sir, because I thought that even [if] the news will not come from he [sic], the other people will inform them what happened.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">And you did not also tell to any person what you have witnesses [sic] during that night?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">No Sir, I did not considering the treat [sic] made by the accused and besides I am not a woman who is fond of gossips.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp; <br><p>Ortiz, on the other hand, justified his failure to immediately report the incident in this manner:</p>&nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="8%" height="40"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td width="92%"><div align="left">You did not give any statement to the police authorities despite the fact that you were the only companion of Dado Mulingbayan at the time of the incident?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></th><td><div align="left">Yes sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">And you will also agree with me that you did not report that happened to your friend?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></th><td><div align="left"> And at the time of the incident did it not occur to you to report the incident?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">When this thing happened I was feeling bothered but considering that we were given a threat I was then thinking of my family.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">When did you leave for Saudi Arabia for 1989?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">December 29, 1989.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><br></th><td><div align="left"><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did you arrive in the Philippines?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left"></div></th><td><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; November 15, 1991.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>After they conquered their fear and broke their silence, the eyewitnesses positively identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.

Appellant claims that said witnesses were never mentioned in the sworn statements of Noli Guevarra or Edwin Mulingbayan, or even in the police investigation report. Furthermore, said witnesses were not listed as such in the information filed by the prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>We discard this argument as a desperate but nonetheless futile attempt to discredit the prosecution eyewitnesses. Ex parte affidavits are almost always incomplete and inaccurate, resulting from partial or inadequate suggestions which are necessary for eyewitnesses’ accurate recollection of all that pertains to the subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> A sworn statement does not purport to contain a complete compendium of the details of the events narrated by the affiant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Hence, the mere fact that the sworn statements failed to mention the names of Manaois, Fuentes and Ortiz as witnesses to the killing is not a conclusive proof that the said persons were not witnesses to the crime or that they were “afterthought witnesses.” Besides, Edwin Mulingbayan could not have pointed to Manaois, Fuentes and Ortiz as having witnessed the crime, for he himself was not present when the killing took place. The sworn statement of Guevarra, on the other hand, cannot be given probative value for he was not presented as a witness during the trial.<br><br>On the other hand, the investigation report was prepared by the police investigators merely to determine whether appellant could be held liable for the death of Eduardo Mulingbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It was not intended to present a complete brief for the prosecution or to identify all the eyewitnesses to the incident. The non-inclusion of some of the names of the eyewitnesses in the information filed before the RTC does not preclude the prosecutor from presenting them during the trial. The selection and the subsequent presentation of witnesses are prerogatives of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The latter has the liberty to present such other witnesses or evidence in order to carry out his duty to establish the guilt of the accused beyond doubt. The enumeration of witnesses in the information is not necessarily exhaustive; it is not meant to absolutely limit or lessen the prerogative of the prosecutor.<br><br>Third, appellant maintains that the testimonies of the eyewitnesses were inconsistent with the findings of the expert witness for the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> When asked about the possible position of the killer in relation to the location of the wound inflicted upon the deceased, Dr. Garcia opined that the assailant was “standing on the same level or direction with the right side of the deceased.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, in the post-mortem findings, the trajectory of the bullet was “slightly backward, slightly downward and from right to left.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Eyewitness Manaois, meanwhile, testified that the accused was “slightly sidewise” when the latter shot Dado who was seated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Fuentes and Ortiz also declared that Dado was seated when shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>We find no material inconsistency in the above declarations of the prosecution witnesses. Dr. Garcia merely stated that the shooter and the victim were on “the same level.” It is difficult to discern how this can discredit the statement of the eyewitnesses that the victim was seated when he was shot. In any event, this alleged contradiction pertains to an insignificant matter; it cannot discredit the eyewitness accounts that appellant shot the victim.<br><br>Lastly, appellant avers that the prosecution witnesses did not actually see the shooting, based on the alleged variance in their testimonies regarding what Appellant Jamiro uttered right after he shot Dado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Eyewitness Manaois testified that the accused told the witnesses to leave the place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Eyewitness Fuentes declared under oath that the appellant threatened to kill anyone who would testify about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Eyewitness Ortiz, on the other hand, told the court that Appellant Jamiro pointed his gun at the people who saw the incident and told them not to report to any police authority what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Because they refer only to minor details, such inconsequential differences do not impair the credibility of the prosecution eyewitnesses’ testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Forthright witnesses are not immune from committing minor inaccuracies and making some inconsistent statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The appellant also imputes ill motive to the prosecution witnesses, alleging that the latter were members of a gang to which the victim also belonged. The accused was in “a hot pursuit against these persons. By testifying falsely, the gang members will ward off the barrier to their illegal activities.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>We rule that the allegation of ill motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses is not sufficiently established by clear, substantial and convincing evidence. The defense presented certifications issued by Clerk of Court Catalino B. Cuevas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> showing that Dado Mulingbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> was charged with various offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Appellant Jamiro also testified that prior to the death of Dado, the latter and his friends were charged with murder as a result of the former’s relentless efforts at pursuing the said group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> However, the foregoing testimonial and documentary evidence do not conclusively establish that the prosecution witnesses, in testifying against the appellant, were moved by a desire to retaliate against the policeman’s actions. In the absence of sufficient proof of improper motive, the presumption is that said witnesses were not so moved and their testimonies are thus entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, relatives of a victim (like his brother Edwin) would not implicate a person other than the real culprit. They are expected to be motivated by no other reason than to seek justice for the death of a loved one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Treachery</span><br></div><br>The essence of treachery is that the attack, carried out swiftly, deliberately and unexpectedly, rendered the unarmed and unsuspecting victim without opportunity to flee or defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The prosecution must conclusively show that the offender deliberately employed means, method or manner of attack which tended directly and specially to insure the execution of his felonious design without risk to himself arising from the defense which his victim might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Deceased Dado Mulingbayan was sitting and drinking beer when Appellant Jamiro suddenly appeared from behind and shot him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> No conversation took place between the assailant and his victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The assailant purposely approached his victim with no design other than to kill him. Unarmed and unaware of the impending danger, the victim could not have defended himself against the attack from his rear.
