In accordance with contract provisions, outstanding advances totalling P93.9 million are to be deducted from said billings which will leave a net amount due to PNCC of only P4.5 million.<br><br>At the same time, PNCC has potential escalation claims amounting to P99 million in the following stages of approval/evaluation:<br><br>Approved by Price Escalation Committee (PEC) but pended for lack of funds P 1.9 million<br><br>Endorsed by project consultants and currently being evaluated by PEC 30.7 million<br><br>Submitted by PNCC directly to PEC and currently under evaluation 66.5 million<br><br>T o t a l P99.1 million<br><blockquote> There has been no funding allocation for any of the above escalation claims due to budgetary constraints.<br><br>The MIA Project has been completed and operational as far back as 1982 and yet residual amounts due to PNCC have not been paid, resulting in undue burden to PNCC due to additional cost of money to service its obligations for this contract.<br><br>To allow PNCC to collect partially its billings, and in consideration of its pending escalation billings, may we request for His Excellency’s approval for a deferment of the repayment of PNCC’s advances to the extent of P30 million corresponding to about 30% of P99.1 million in escalation claims of PNCC, of which P32.5 million has been officially recognized by MIADP consultants but could not be paid due to lack of funding.Korte<br><br>Our proposal will allow BAT to pay PNCC the amount of P34.5 million out of existing MIA Project funds.

ROBERTO V. ONGPIN<br><br>Minister”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></div></blockquote><br>In obedience to President Marcos’ verbal instruction and memorandum, Tabuena, with the help of Dabao and Peralta, caused the release of P55 Million of MIAA funds by means of three (3) withdrawals.<br><br>The first withdrawal was made on January 10, 1986 for P25 Million, following a letter of even date signed by Tabuena and Dabao requesting the PNB extension office at the MIAA - the depository branch of MIAA funds, to issue a manager’s check for said amount payable to Tabuena. The check was encashed, however, at the PNB Villamor Branch. Dabao and the cashier of the PNB Villamor branch counted the money after which, Tabuena took delivery thereof. The P25 Million in cash were then placed in peerless boxes and duffle bags, loaded on a PNB armored car and delivered on the same day to the office of Mrs. Gimenez located at Aguado Street fronting Malacañang. Mrs. Gimenez did not issue any receipt for the money received.<br><br>Similar circumstances surrounded the second withdrawal/encashment and delivery of another P25 Million, made on January 16, 1986.<br><br>The third and last withdrawal was made on January 31, 1986 for P5 Million. Peralta was Tabuena’s co-signatory to the letter- request for a manager’s check for this amount. Peralta accompanied Tabuena to the PNB Villamor branch as Tabuena requested him to do the counting of the P5 Million. After the counting, the money was placed in two (2) peerless boxes which were loaded in the trunk of Tabuena’s car. Peralta did not go with Tabuena to deliver the money to Mrs. Gimenez’ office at Aguado Street. It was only upon delivery of the P5 Million that Mrs. Gimenez issued a receipt for all the amounts she received from Tabuena. The receipt, dated January 30, 1986, reads:<br><br>“Malacañang Manila<br><br>January 30, 1986<br><br>RECEIVED FROM LOUIE TABUENA THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION PESOS (P55,000,000.00) as of the following dates:<br><br>Jan. 10 - P25,000,000.00<br><br>Jan. 16 - 25,000,000.00<br><br>Jan. 30 - 5,000,000.00<br><br>(Sgd.) Fe Roa-Gimenez”<br><br>The disbursement of the P55 Million was, as described by Tabuena and Peralta themselves, “out of the ordinary” and “not based on the normal procedure”. Not only were there no vouchers prepared to support the disbursement, the P55 Million was paid in cold cash. Also, no PNCC receipt for the P55 Million was presented. Defense witness Francis Monera, then Senior Assistant Vice President and Corporate Comptroller of PNCC, even affirmed in court that there were no payments made to PNCC by MIAA for the months of January to June of 1986.<br><br>The position of the prosecution was that there were no outstanding obligations in favor of PNCC at the time of the disbursement of the P55 Million. On the other hand, the defense of Tabuena and Peralta, in short, was that they acted in good faith. Tabuena claimed that he was merely complying with the MARCOS Memorandum which ordered him to forward immediately to the Office of the President P55 Million in cash as partial payment of MIAA’s obligations to PNCC, and that he (Tabuena) was of the belief that MIAA indeed had liabilities to PNCC. Peralta for his part shared the same belief and so he heeded the request of Tabuena, his superior, for him (Peralta) to help in the release of P5 Million.<br><br>With the rejection by the Sandiganbayan of their claim of good faith which ultimately led to their conviction, Tabuena and Peralta now set forth a total of ten (10) errors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> committed by the Sandiganbayan for this Court’s consideration. It appears, however, that at the core of their plea that we acquit them are the following:<br><blockquote>1) the Sandiganbayan convicted them of a crime not charged in the amended informations, and<br><br>2) they acted in good faith</blockquote>Anent the first proposition, Tabuena and Peralta stress that they were being charged with intentional malversation, as the amended informations commonly allege that:<br><br>“x x x accused x x x conspiring, confederating and confabulating with each other, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously, and with intent to defraud the government, take and misappropriated the amount of x x x.”<br><br>But it would appear that they were convicted of malversation by negligence. In this connection, the Court’s attention is directed to p. 17 of the December 20, 1991 Resolution (denying Tabuena’s and Peralta’s motion for reconsideration) wherein the Sandiganbayan said:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “x x x x x x x x x<br></div><br>On the contrary, what the evidence shows is that accused Tabuena delivered the P55 Million to people who were not entitled thereto, either as representatives of MIAA or of the PNCC.Sclaw<br><br>It proves that Tabuena had deliberately consented or permitted through negligence or abandonment, some other person to take such public funds. Having done so, Tabuena, by his own narration, has categorically demonstrated that he is guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of P55 Million of public funds.” (Underscoring supplied.)<br><br>To support their theory that such variance is a reversible flaw, Tabuena and Peralta argue that:</blockquote>1) While malversation may be committed intentionally or by negligence, both modes cannot be committed at the same time.<br><br>2) The Sandiganbayan was without jurisdiction to convict them of malversation of negligence where the amended informations charged them with intentional malversation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>3) Their conviction of a crime different from that charged violated their constitutional right to be informed of the accusation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>We do not agree with Tabuena and Peralta on this point. Illuminative and controlling is “Cabello v. Sandiganbayan”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> where the Court passed upon similar protestations raised by therein accused-petitioner Cabello whose conviction for the same crime of malversation was affirmed, in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>“x x x even on the putative assumption that the evidence against petitioner yielded a case of malversation by negligence but the information was for intentional malversation, under the circumstances of this case his conviction under the first mode of misappropriation would still be in order. Malversation is committed either intentionally or by negligence. The dolo or the culpa present in the offense is only a modality in the perpetration of the felony. Even if the mode charged differs from the mode proved, the same offense of malversation is involved and conviction thereof is proper. x x x.<br><br>In Samson vs. Court of Appeals, et. al., we held that an accused charged with willful or intentional falsification can validly be convicted of falsification through negligence, thus:</blockquote>‘While a criminal negligent act is not a simple modality of a willful crime, as we held in Quizon vs. Justice of the Peace of Bacolor, G.R. No. L-6641, July 28, 1995, but a distinct crime in our Penal Code, designated as a quasi offense in our Penal Code, it may however be said that a conviction for the former can be had under an information exclusively charging the commission of a willful offense, upon the theory that the greater includes the lesser offense. This is the situation that obtains in the present case. Appellant was charged with willful falsification but from the evidence submitted by the parties, the Court of Appeals found that in effecting the falsification which made possible the cashing of the checks in question, appellant did not act with criminal intent but merely failed to take proper and adequate means to assure himself of the identity of the real claimants as an ordinary prudent man would do. In other words, the information alleges acts which charge willful falsification but which turned out to be not willful but negligent. This is a case covered by the rule when there is a variance between the allegation and proof, and is similar to some of the cases decided by this Tribunal.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>‘Moreover, Section 5, Rule 116, of the Rules of Court does not require that all the essential elements of the offense charged in the information be proved, it being sufficient that some of said essential elements or ingredients thereof be established to constitute the crime proved. <br>x x x.<br><br>‘The fact that the information does not allege that the falsification was committed with imprudence is of no moment for here this deficiency appears supplied by the evidence submitted by appellant himself and the result has proven beneficial to him. Certainly, having alleged that the falsification has been willful, it would be incongruous to allege at the same time that it was committed with imprudence for a charge of criminal intent is incompatible with the concept of negligence.’<br><br>“Subsequently, we ruled in People vs. Consigna, et. al., that the aforestated rationale and arguments also apply to the felony of malversation, that is, that an accused charged with willful malversation, in an information containing allegations similar to those involved in the present case, can be validly convicted of the same offense of malversation through negligence where the evidence sustains the latter mode of perpetrating the offense.”<br><br>Going now to the defense of good faith, it is settled that this is a valid defense in a prosecution for malversation for it would negate criminal intent on the part of the accused. Thus, in the two (2) vintage, but significant malversation cases of “US v. Catolico”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and “US v. Elviña,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court stressed that:<br><blockquote>“To constitute a crime, the act must, except in certain crimes made such by statute, be accompanied by a criminal intent, or by such negligence or indifference to duty or to consequences as, in law, is equivalent to criminal intent. The maxim is actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea - a crime is not committed if the mind of the person performing the act complained of is innocent.</blockquote>The rule was reiterated in “People v. Pacana,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> although this case involved falsification of public documents and estafa:<br><blockquote>“Ordinarily, evil intent must unite with an unlawful act for there to be a crime. Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea. There can be no crime when the criminal mind is wanting.”</blockquote>American jurisprudence echoes the same principle. It adheres to the view that criminal intent in embezzlement is not based on technical mistakes as to the legal effect of a transaction honestly entered into, and there can be no embezzlement if the mind of the person doing the act is innocent or if there is no wrongful purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The accused may thus always introduce evidence to show he acted in good faith and that he had no intention to convert.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> And this, to our mind, Tabuena and Peralta had meritoriously shown.<br><br>In so far as Tabuena is concerned, with the due presentation in evidence of the MARCOS Memorandum, we are swayed to give credit to his claim of having caused the disbursement of the P55 Million solely by reason of such memorandum. From this premise flows the following reasons and/or considerations that would buttress his innocence of the crime of malversation.<br><br>First. Tabuena had no other choice but to make the withdrawals, for that was what the MARCOS Memorandum required him to do. He could not be faulted if he had to obey and strictly comply with the presidential directive, and to argue otherwise is something easier said than done. Marcos was undeniably Tabuena’s superior – the former being then the President of the Republic who unquestionably exercised control over government agencies such as the MIAA and PNCC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In other words, Marcos had a say in matters involving inter-government agency affairs and transactions, such as for instance, directing payment of liability of one entity to another and the manner in which it should be carried out. And as a recipient of such kind of a directive coming from the highest official of the land no less, good faith should be read on Tabuena’s compliance, without hesitation nor any question, with the MARCOS Memorandum. Tabuena therefore is entitled to the justifying circumstance of “Any person who acts in obedience to an order issued by a superior for some lawful purpose.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The subordinate-superior relationship between Tabuena and Marcos is clear. And so too, is the lawfulness of the order contained in the MARCOS Memorandum, as it has for its purpose partial payment of the liability of one government agency (MIAA) to another (PNCC). However, the unlawfulness of the MARCOS Memorandum was being argued, on the observation, for instance, that the Ongpin Memo referred to in the presidential directive reveals a liability of only about P34.5 Million. The Sandiganbayan in this connection said:<br><br><blockquote>“Exhibits “2” and “2-a” (pages 1 and 2 of the memorandum of Min. Ongpin to the President dated January 7, 1985) were mainly:<br><br>a.) for the approval of eight Supplemental Contracts; and<br><br>b.) a request for partial deferment of payment by PNCC for advances made for the MIAA Development Project, while at the same time recognizing some of the PNCC’s escalation billings which would result in making payable to PNCC the amount of P34.5 million out of existing MIAA Project funds.<br><br>Thus:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">‘xxx<br></div><br>To allow PNCC to collect partially its billings, and in consideration of its pending escalation billings, may we request for His Excellency’s approval for a deferment of repayment of PNCC’s advances to the extent of P30 million corresponding to about 30% of P99.1 million in escalation claims of PNCC, of which P32.6 million has been officially recognized by MIADP consultants but could not be paid due to lack of funding.<br><br>Our proposal will allow BAT to pay PNCC the amount of P34.5 million out of existing MIA Project funds. This amount represents the excess of the gross billings of PNCC of P98.4 million over the undeferred portion of the repayment of advances of P63.9 million.’<br><br>While Min. Ongpin may have, therefore recognized the escalation claims of the PNCC to MIAA to the extent of P99.1 million (Exhibit 2a), a substantial portion thereof was still in the stages of evaluation and approval, with only P32.6 million having been officially recognized by the MIADP consultants.<br><br>If any payments were, therefore, due under this memo for Min. Ongpin (upon which President Marcos’ Memo was based) they would only be for a sum of up to P34.5 million.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>“V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pres. Marcos’ order to Tabuena dated January 8, 1986 baseless.<br><br>Not only was Pres. Marcos’ Memo (Exhibit “1”) for Tabuena to pay P55 million irrelevant, but it was actually baseless.<br><br>This is easy to see.<br><br>Exhibit “1” purports to refer itself to the Ongpin Memorandum (Exhibit “2”, “2-a”); Exhibit “1”, however, speaks of P55 million to be paid to the PNCC while Exhibit “2” authorized only P34.5 million. The order to withdraw the amount of P55 million exceeded the approved payment of P34.5 million by P20.5 million. Min. Ongpin’s Memo of January 7, 1985 could not therefore serve as a basis for the President’s order to withdraw P55 million.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Granting this to be true, it will not nevertheless affect Tabuena’s good faith so as to make him criminally liable. What is more significant to consider is that the MARCOS Memorandum is patently legal (for on its face it directs payment of an outstanding liability) and that Tabuena acted under the honest belief that the P55 million was a due and demandable debt and that it was just a portion of a bigger liability to PNCC. This belief is supported by defense witness Francis Monera who, on direct examination, testified that:<br><br><br>“ATTY ANDRES<br><br>Q Can you please show us in this Exhibit “7” and “7-a” where it is indicated the receivables from MIA as of December 31, 1985?<br><br>A As of December 31, 1985, the receivables from MIA is shown on page 2, marked as Exhibit “7-a”, sir, P102,475,392.35.<br><br>x x x x x x x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>ATTY.

People”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the facts of which, in brief, are as follows:<br><blockquote>“Accused was charged with falsification of commercial document. A mere employee of R.J. Campos, he inserted in the commercial document alleged to have been falsified the word “sold” by order of his principal. Had he known or suspected that his principal was committing an improper act of falsification, he would be liable either as a co-principal or as an accomplice. However, there being no malice on his part, he was exempted from criminal liability as he was a mere employee following the orders of his principal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>Second. There is no denying that the disbursement, which Tabuena admitted as “out of the ordinary”, did not comply with certain auditing rules and regulations such as those pointed out by the Sandiganbayan, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>a) [except for salaries and wages and for commutation of leaves] all disbursements above P1,000.00 should be made by check (Basic Guidelines for Internal Control dated January 31, 1977 issued by COA)<br><br>b) payment of all claims against the government had to be supported with complete documentation (Sec. 4, P.D. 1445, “State Auditing Code of the Philippines). In this connection, the Sandiganbayan observed that:</blockquote>“There were no vouchers to authorize the disbursements in question. There were no bills to support the disbursement. There were no certifications as to the availability of funds for an unquestionably staggering sum of P55 Million.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>c) failure to protest (Sec. 106, P.D. 1445)<br><br>But this deviation was inevitable under the circumstances Tabuena was in. He did not have the luxury of time to observe all auditing procedures of disbursement considering the fact that the MARCOS Memorandum enjoined his “immediate compliance” with the directive that he forward to the President’s Office the P55 Million in cash. Be that as it may, Tabuena surely cannot escape responsibility for such omission. But since he was acting in good faith, his liability should only be administrative or civil in nature, and not criminal. This follows the decision in “Villacorta v. People”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> where the Court, in acquitting therein accused municipal treasurer of Pandan, Catanduanes of malversation after finding that he incurred a shortage in his cash accountability by reason of his payment in good faith to certain government personnel of their legitimate wages, leave allowances, etc., held that:<br><blockquote> “Nor can negligence approximating malice or fraud be attributed to petitioner. If he made wrong payments, they were in good faith mainly to government personnel, some of them working at the provincial auditor’s and the provincial treasurer’s offices. And if those payments ran counter to auditing rules and regulations, they did not amount to a criminal offense and he should only be held administratively or civilly liable.”</blockquote>Likewise controlling is “US v. Elviña”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where it was held that payments in good faith do not amount to criminal appropriation, although they were made with insufficient vouchers or improper evidence. In fact, the Dissenting Opinion’s reference to certain provisions in the revised Manual on Certificate of Settlement and Balances - apparently made to underscore Tabuena’s personal accountability, as agency head, for MIAA funds - would all the more support the view that Tabuena is vulnerable to civil sanctions only. Sections 29.2 and 29.5 expressly and solely speak of “civilly liable” to describe the kind of sanction imposable on a superior officer who performs his duties with “bad faith, malice or gross negligence”’ and on a subordinate officer or employee who commits “willful or negligent acts x x x which are contrary to law, morals, public policy and good customs even if he acted under order or instructions of his superiors.”<br><br>Third. The Sandiganbayan made the finding that Tabuena had already converted and misappropriated the P55 Million when he delivered the same to Mrs. Gimenez and not to the PNCC, proceeding from the following definitions/concepts of “conversion”:<br><blockquote>“‘Conversion’, as necessary element of offense of embezzlement, being the fraudulent ‘appropriation to one’s own use’ of another’s property which does not necessarily mean to one’s personal advantage but every attempt by one person to dispose of the goods of another without right as if they were his own is ‘conversion to his own use.’ (Terry v. Water Improvement Dist. No. 5 of Tulsa County, 64 p. 2d 904, 906, 179 Okl. 106)<br><br>- At p. 207, Words and Phrases,<br><br>Permanent Edition 9A.<br><br>Conversion is any interference subversive of the right of the owner of personal property to enjoy and control it. The gist of conversion is the usurpation of the owner’s right of property, and not the actual damages inflicted. Honesty of purpose is not a defense. (Ferrera v. Parks, 23 p. 883, 885 19 Or. 141)<br><br>- At page 168, id.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>The words ‘convert’ and ‘misappropriate’ connote an act of using or disposing of another’s property as if it were one’s own. They presuppose that the thing has been devoted to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To appropriate to one’s own use includes not only conversion to one’s personal advantage but every attempt to dispose of the property of another without right.<br><br>People vs. Webber, 57 O.G.<br><br>p. 2933, 2937<br><br>By placing them at the disposal of private persons without due authorization or legal justification, he became as guilty of malversation as if he had personally taken them and converted them to his own use.<br><br>People vs. Luntao, 50 O.G.<br><br>p. 1182, 1183”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><br>We do not agree. It must be stressed that the MARCOS Memorandum directed Tabuena “to pay immediately the Philippine National Construction Corporation, thru this office, the sum of FIFTY FIVE MILLION....”, and that was what Tabuena precisely did when he delivered the money to Mrs. Gimenez. Such delivery, no doubt, is in effect delivery to the Office of the President inasmuch as Mrs. Gimenez was Marcos’ secretary then. Furthermore, Tabuena had reasonable ground to believe that the President was entitled to receive the P55 Million since he was certainly aware that Marcos, as Chief Executive, exercised supervision and control over government agencies. And the good faith of Tabuena in having delivered the money to the President’s office (thru Mrs. Gimenez), in strict compliance with the MARCOS Memorandum, was not at all affected even if it later turned out that PNCC never received the money. Thus, it has been said that:<br><br><blockquote>“Good faith in the payment of public funds relieves a public officer from the crime of malversation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x x x x<br></div><br>Not every unauthorized payment of public funds is malversation. There is malversation only if the public officer who has custody of public funds should appropriate the same, or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, or through abandonment or negligence shall permit any other person to take such public funds. Where the payment of public funds has been made in good faith, and there is reasonable ground to believe that the public officer to whom the fund had been paid was entitled thereto, he is deemed to have acted in good faith, there is no criminal intent, and the payment, if it turns out that it is unauthorized, renders him only civilly but not criminally liable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Fourth. Even assuming that the real and sole purpose behind the MARCOS Memorandum was to siphon-out public money for the personal benefit of those then in power, still, no criminal liability can be imputed to Tabuena. There is no showing that Tabuena had anything to do whatsoever with the execution of the MARCOS Memorandum. Nor is there proof that he profited from the felonious scheme. In short, no conspiracy was established between Tabuena and the real embezzler/s of the P55 Million. In the cases of “US v. Acebedo”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and “Ang v. Sandiganbayan”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> both also involving the crime of malversation, the accused therein were acquitted after the Court arrived at a similar finding of non-proof of conspiracy. In “Acebedo”, therein accused, as municipal president of Palo, Leyte, was prosecuted for and found guilty by the lower court of malversation after being unable to turn over certain amounts to the then justice of the peace. It appeared, however, that said amounts were actually collected by his secretary Crisanto Urbina. The Court reversed Acebedo’s conviction after finding that the sums were converted by his secretary Urbina without the knowledge and participation of Acebedo. The Court said, which we herein adopt:<br><br><blockquote>“No conspiracy between the appellant and his secretary has been shown in this case, nor did such conspiracy appear in the case against Urbina. No guilty knowledge of the theft committed by the secretary was shown on the part of the appellant in this case, nor does it appear that he in any way participated in the fruits of the crime. If the secretary stole the money in question without the knowledge or consent of the appellant and without negligence on his part, then certainly the latter can not be convicted of embezzling the same money or any part thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>In “Ang”, accused-petitioner, as MWSS bill collector, allowed part of his collection to be converted into checks drawn in the name of one Marshall Lu, a non-customer of MWSS, but the checks were subsequently dishonored. Ang was acquitted by this Court after giving credence to his assertion that the conversion of his collections into checks were thru the machinations of one Lazaro Guinto, another MWSS collector more senior to him. And we also adopt the Court’s observation therein, that:<br><blockquote>“The petitioner’s alleged negligence in allowing the senior collector to convert cash collections into checks may be proof of poor judgment or too trusting a nature insofar as a superior officer is concerned but there must be stronger evidence to show fraud, malice, or other indicia of deliberateness in the conspiracy cooked up with Marshall Lu. The prosecution failed to show that the petitioner was privy to the conspirational scheme. Much less is there any proof that he profited from the questioned acts. Any suspicions of conspiracy, no matter how sincerely and strongly felt by the MWSS, must be converted into evidence before conviction beyond reasonable doubt may be imposed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>The principles underlying all that has been said above in exculpation of Tabuena equally apply to Peralta in relation to the P5 Million for which he is being held accountable, i.e., he acted in good faith when he, upon the directive of Tabuena, helped facilitate the withdrawal of P5 Million of the P55 Million of the MIAA funds.<br><br>This is not a sheer case of blind and misguided obedience, but obedience in good faith of a duly executed order. Indeed, compliance to a patently lawful order is rectitude far better than contumacious disobedience. In the case at bench, the order emanated from the Office of the President and bears the signature of the President himself, the highest official of the land. It carries with it the presumption that it was regularly issued. And on its face, the memorandum is patently lawful for no law makes the payment of an obligation illegal. This fact, coupled with the urgent tenor for its execution constrains one to act swiftly without question. Obedientia est legis essentia. Besides, the case could not be detached from the realities then prevailing. As aptly observed by Mr. Justice Cruz in his dissenting opinion:<br><blockquote> “We reject history in arbitrarily assuming that the people were free during the era and that the judiciary was independent and fearless. We know it was not; even the Supreme Court at that time was not free. This is an undeniable fact that we can not just blink away. Insisting on the contrary would only make our sincerity suspect and even provoke scorn for what can only be described as our incredible credulity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>But what appears to be a more compelling reason for their acquittal is the violation of the accused’s basic constitutional right to due process. “Respect for the Constitution”, to borrow once again Mr. Justice Cruz’s words, “is more important than securing a conviction based on a violation of the rights of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> While going over the records, we were struck by the way the Sandiganbayan actively took part in the questioning of a defense witness and of the accused themselves. Tabuena and Peralta may not have raised this as an error, there is nevertheless no impediment for us to consider such matter as additional basis for a reversal since the settled doctrine is that an appeal throws the whole case open to review, and it becomes the duty of the appellate court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from whether they are made the subject of assignments of error or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Simply consider the volume of questions hurled by the Sandiganbayan. At the taking of the testimony of Francis Monera, then Senior Assistant Vice President and Corporate Comptroller of PNCC, Atty. Andres asked sixteen (16) questions on direct examination. Prosecutor Viernes only asked six (6) questions on cross-examination in the course of which the court interjected a total of twenty-seven (27) questions (more than four times Prosecutor Viernes’ questions and even more than the combined total of direct and cross-examination questions asked by the counsels). After the defense opted not to conduct any re-direct examination, the court further asked a total of ten (10) questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The trend intensified during Tabuena’s turn on the witness stand.

In Peralta’s case, the Justices, after his cross-examination, propounded a total of forty-one (41) questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>But more importantly, we note that the questions of the court were in the nature of cross examinations characteristic of confrontation, probing and insinuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (The insinuating type was best exemplified in one question addressed to Peralta, which will be underscored.) Thus we beg to quote in length from the transcripts pertaining to witness Monera, Tabuena and Peralta. (Questions from the Court are marked with asterisks and italicized for emphasis.)<br><br>(MONERA)<br><br>(As a background, what was elicited from his direct examination is that the PNCC had receivables from MIAA totalling P102,475,392.35, and although such receivables were largely billings for escalation, they were nonetheless all due and demandable.

Hardly in fact can one avoid the impression that the Sandiganbayan had allied itself with, or to be more precise, had taken the cudgels for the prosecution in proving the case against Tabuena and Peralta when the Justices cross-examined the witnesses, their cross-examinations supplementing those made by Prosecutor Viernes and far exceeding the latter’s questions in length. The “cold neutrality of an impartial judge” requirement of due process was certainly denied Tabuena and Peralta when the court, with its overzealousness, assumed the dual role of magistrate and advocate. In this connection, the observation made in the Dissenting Opinion to the effect that the majority of this Court was “unduly disturbed” with the number of court questions alone, is quite inaccurate. A substantial portion of the TSN was incorporated in the majority opinion not to focus on “numbers” alone, but more importantly to show that the court questions were in the interest of the prosecution and which thus depart from that common standard of fairness and impartiality. In fact, it is very difficult to be, upon review of the records, confronted with “numbers” without necessarily realizing the partiality of the Court. In “US v. De Sisto” (2 Cir., 1961, 289 F 2d 833), for example, a new trial was required because the trial judge, as in this case, indulged in extensive questioning of defendant and his witnesses, and the reviewing court also had to amplify on “numbers” to bolster this. It was pointed out in the “De Sisto” case that the judge asked 3,115 questions of all witnesses, the prosecutor asked but 1,381, defense counsel 3,330. The judge’s questions to the defendant De Sisto totalled 306, the prosecutor’s 347, and the defense counsel’s, 201. After referring to these figures, the court stated:<br><br>“. . . It is indeed an impressive proportion, but no such mathematical computation is of itself determinative. However, taking all this in conjunction with the long and vigorous examination of the defendant himself by the judge, and the repeated belittling by the judge of defendant’s efforts to establish the time that Fine left the pier, we fear that in its zeal for arriving at the facts the court here conveyed to the jury too strong an impression of the court’s belief in the defendant’s probable guilt to permit the jury freely to perform its own function of independent determination of the facts. x x x”<br><br>The majority believes that the interference by the Sandiganbayan Justices was just too excessive that it cannot be justified under the norm applied to a jury trial, or even under the standard employed in a non-jury trial where the judge is admittedly given more leeway in propounding questions to clarify points and to elicit additional relevant evidence. At the risk of being repetitious, we will amplify on this via some specific examples. Based on the evidence on record, and on the admission of Tabuena himself, the P55 million was delivered to the President’s Office thru Mrs. Gimenez, in obedience to the Presidential directive. One Sandiganbayan Justice, however, hurled the following questions to Peralta:<br><br>“AJ DEL ROSARIO<br><br>Q: Since the payment was made on January 31, 1986, and that was very close to the election held in that year, did you not entertain any doubt that the amounts were being used for some other purposes?<br><br>ATTY. ESTEBAL<br><br>With due respect to the Honorable Justice, We are objecting to the question on the ground that it is<br><br>improper.<br><br>AJ DEL ROSARIO<br><br>I will withdraw the question.<br><br>PJ GARCHITORENA<br><br>What is the ground for impropriety?<br><br>ATTY.

How then, can this be considered even relevant? What is the connection between the payment made to the President’s office and the then forthcoming presidential “snap election”? In another instance, consider the following questions of Presiding Justice Garchitorena:<br><br>*PJ GARCHITORENA<br><br>*Q&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Peralta, are not Journal Vouchers merely entries in the Journals to correct certain statements of accounts earlier made in the same journal?<br><br>xxx<br><br>*Q&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, really what you are telling us is that, a Journal Voucher is to explain a transaction was otherwise not recorded.<br><br>xxx<br><br>*Q&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, when you said that a Journal Voucher here is proper, you are saying it is proper only because of the exceptional nature of the transactions?<br><br>xxx<br><br>*Q&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, as an Accountant, you would not normally authorize such a movement of money unless it is properly documented?<br><br>ATTY.

Thus, the Dissenting Opinion’s focus on the distinction between the two kinds of trial to justify the Sandiganbayan’s active participation in the examination of petitioners Tabuena and Peralta and witness Monera, with due respect, appears insignificant to this case. Let it, therefore, be emphasized anew that:<br><br>“A trial judge should not participate in the examination of witnesses as to create the impression that he is allied with the prosecution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>“We doubt not that the sole motive of the learned judge was to ascertain the truth of the transaction, but it is never proper for a judge to discharge the duties of a prosecuting attorney. However anxious a judge may be for the enforcement of the law, he should always remember that he is as much judge in behalf of the defendant accused of crime, and whose liberty is in jeopardy, as he is judge in behalf of the state, for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of society.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>“Ordinarily it is not good practice for the presiding judge himself to examine witnesses at length. The circumstances may be such in a given case as to justify the court in so doing....This court, however, has more than once said that the examination of witnesses is the more appropriate function of counsel, and the instances are rare and the conditions exceptional which will justify the presiding judge in conducting an extensive examination. It is always embarrassing for counsel to object to what he may deem improper questions by the court. Then, in conducting a lengthy examination, it would be almost impossible for the judge to preserve a judicial attitude. While he is not a mere figurehead or umpire in a trial, and it is his duty to see that justice is done, he will usually not find it necessary to conduct such examinations. The extent to which this shall be done must largely be a matter of discretion, to be determined by the circumstances of each particular case, but in so doing he must not forget the function of the judge and assume that of an advocate....”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>“While it is true that the manner in which a witness shall be examined is largely in the discretion of the trial judge, it must be understood that we have not adopted in this country the practice of making the presiding judge the chief inquisitor.

It must never be forgotten, however, that we render justice on a case to case basis, always in consideration of the evidence that is presented. Thus, where the evidence warrants an acquittal, as in this case, we are mandated not only by the dictates of law but likewise of conscience to grant the same. On the other hand, it does not follow that all those similarly accused will necessarily be acquitted upon reliance on this case as a precedent. For the decision in this case to be a precedent, the peculiar circumstances and the evidence that led to the petitioner’s acquittal must also be present in subsequent cases.<br><br>Furthermore, as between a mere apprehension of a “dangerous precedent” and an actual violation of constitutionally enshrined rights, it is definitely the latter that merits our immediate attention.

This is the immediate impression anyone can get from the following sweeping pronouncement in the ponencia:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the order emanated from the office of the President and bears the signature of the President himself, the highest official of the land.

The meaning of EDSA and its message for history would thus be obliterated. The acquittal then perpetuates a sad day for this Court – a day of mourning for those who fought against the dictatorship and of triumph and joy for the dictator’s collaborators, nominees, associates and friends.<br><br>I cannot join the majority in these cases.<br><br>My analysis of the ponencia indicates that the acquittal is based on the following:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused-appellants merely acted in obedience to an order by a superior for some lawful purpose; hence, they incur no criminal liability pursuant to Article 11(6) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even granting that the order was not for a lawful purpose, they acted in good faith.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their basic constitutional right to due process was violated by the way the Sandiganbayan actively took part in the questioning of a defense witness and of the accused themselves.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><br></div><br>I shall first take up the third.<br><br>The ponencia admits that the appellants did not raise as an issue the Sandiganbayan’s violation of their right to due process; nevertheless, it ruled that such failure is not an impediment to the consideration of the violation “as additional basis for a reversal since the settled doctrine is that an appeal throws the whole case open to review, and it becomes the duty of the appellate court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from whether they are made the subject of assignments of error or not”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>I beg to disagree.<br><br>First, there is no showing at all that the extensive participation by the Justices of Sandiganbayan in questioning the appellants and their witness indicated prejudgment of guilt, bias, hatred, or hostility against the said appellants. On the contrary, the quoted portions of the questions propounded by the Justices manifest nothing but a sincere desire to ferret out the facts to arrive at the truth which are crucial in the determination of the innocence or guilt of the appellants. These Justices, as trial magistrates, have only exercised one of the inherent rights of a judge in the exercise of judicial function. What this Court stated eighty-three years ago in United States v. Hudieres<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> needs repeating:<br><br>It is very clear, however, from a review of the whole proceedings that the only object of the trial judge in propounding these questions was to endeavor as far as possible to get the truth a to the facts to which the witnesses were testifying. The right of a trial judge to question the witnesses with a view to satisfying his mind upon any material point which presents itself during the trial of a case over which he presides is too well established to need discussion. The trial judges in this jurisdiction are judges of both the law and the facts, and they would be negligent in the performance of their duties if they permitted a miscarriage of justice as a result of a failure to propound a proper question to a witness which might develop some material fact upon which the judgement of the case should turn. So in a case where a trial judge sees that the degree of credit which he is to give the testimony of a given witness may have an important bearing upon the outcome, there can be no question that in the exercise of a sound discretion he may put such questions to the witness as will enable him to formulate a sound opinion as to the ability or willingness of the witness to tell the truth. The question asked by the trial judge in the case at bar were in our own opinion entirely proper, their only purpose being to clarify certain obscure phases of the case; and while we are inclined to agree with counsel that some of the observations of the trial judge in the course of his examination might as well have been omitted, there is no reason whatever to believe that the substantial rights of the defendants were in anywise prejudiced thereby.<br><br>The appellants themselves did not find any impropriety in the conduct of the Justices, or that if they did find nothing therein to prejudice their right to due process is best proven by their failure to assign it as error.<br><br>Second, even granting arguendo that the conduct of the Justices constituted such a violation, the appellants are forever estopped from raising that issue on ground of waiver. This Court would risk an accusation of undue partiality for the appellants were it to give them the premium for their torpor and then reward them with acquittal. Such waiver is conclusively proven in these cases. From the quoted portions of the testimonies of the witnesses for the appellants, it is clear that their counsel did not object to, or manifest on record his misgivings on, the active participation of the Justices in the examination (or cross examination) of the witnesses. Nothing could have prevented the counsel for the appellants from doing so.

I submit that the 8 January 1986 Memorandum of President Marcos can by no means be considered “lawful” order to pay P55 Million to the PNCC as alleged partial payment of the MIAA’s account to the former. The alleged basis of such memorandum is the 7 January 1985 Memorandum of Trade and Industry Minister Roberto Ongpin, which even conforms the absence of any factual basis for the order of payment of P55 Million:<br><br>In this connection, please be informed that Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), formerly CDCP, has accomplishment billings on the MIA Development Project aggregating P98.4 million inclusive of accomplishments for the aforecited contracts. In accordance with contract provisions, outstanding advances totalling P93.9 million are to be deducted from said billings which will leave a net amount due to PNCC of only P4.5 million, thus:<br><br>At the same time, PNCC has potential escalation claims amounting to P99 million in the following states of approved/evaluation:<br><br>Approved by Price Escalation Committee (PEC) but pended for lack of funds<br><br>P 1.9 million<br>Endorsed by project consultants and currently being evaluated by PEC<br><br>30.7 million<br>Submitted by PNCC directly to PEC and currently under evaluation<br><br>66.5 million<br>T o t a l<br><br>P99.1 million<br><br>There has been no funding allocation for any of the above escalation claims due to budgetary constraints.<br><br>The MIA Project has been completed and operational as far back as 1982 and yet residual amounts due to PNCC have not been paid, resulting in undue burden to PNCC due to additional cost of money to service its obligations for this contract.<br><br>To allow PNCC to collect partially its billings, and in consideration of its pending escalation billings, may we request for His Excellency’s approval for a deferment of the repayment of PNCC’s advances to the extent of P30 million corresponding to about 30% of P99.1 million in escalation claims of PNCC, of which P32.5 million has been officially recognized by MIADP consultants but could not be paid due to lack of fundings.<br><br>Our proposal will allow BAT to pay PNCC the amount of P34.5 million out of existing MIA Project funds. This amount represents the excess of the gross billings of PNCC of P98.4 million over the undeferred portion of the repayment of advances of P63.9 million.<br><br>If Ongpin’s memorandum is given full faith, it is clear that PNCC’s “accomplishment billings” for work accomplished, including accomplishments on the “supplemental contracts” (whose authority therefor was just sought for), aggregated to P98.4 million. Since there were advances given to PNCC in the total amount of P93.9 million, the net amount due the PNCC was only P4.5 million.<br><br>However, in view of the approval by President Marcos of Ongpin’s request “for deferment of the repayment of PNCC’s advances to extent of 30 million,” only P63.9 million of PNCC’s advances was to be deducted from the accomplishment billings of P98.4 million. The net amount due thus became P34.5 million. Hence, as pointed out by the Sandiganbayan, if any payments were due under Ongpin’s Memorandum, they would only be for that amount (P34.5 million). The Order of then President Marcos to withdraw has, therefore, exceeded by P20.5 million. Clearly, the order of payment of P55 million had no factual and legal basis and was thereful unlawful.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br></div><br>Not an iota of good faith was shown in the conduct of the appellants.<br><br>Being responsible accountable officers of the MIAA, they were presumed to know that, in light of “the undeferred portion of the repayment” of PNCC’s advances in the amount of P63.9 million, the MIAA’s unpaid balance was only P34.5 million. They also ought to know the procedure to be followed in the payment of contractual obligations. First and foremost there were the submission by the PNCC of its claims with the required supporting documents and the approval of the claims by the appropriate approving authority of MIAA. When the President Marcos ordered immediate payment, he should not have been understood as to order suspension of the accepted budgeting, accounting and auditing rules on the matter. Parenthetically, it may be stated here that although President Marcos was a dictator, he was reported to be and even projected himself as, a “faithful” advocate of the rule of law. As a matter of fact, he did not hesitate to issue a decree, letter of instruction, or any presidential issuance in anticipation of any planned actions or activities to give the latter the façade or semblance of legality, wisdom, or propriety. When he made the order to appellant Tabuena, President Marcos must only be understood to order the money. There was no way for Tabuena to entertain any fear that disobedience to the order because of its lawfulness or delay in the execution of the order due to compliance with the requirements would cause his head or life. He offered no credible evidence for such fear. This Court should not provide one for him. That Tabuena served Mr. Marcos until the end of the latter’s regime and even beyond only proved a loyalty not based on fear but on other considerations.<br><br>Moreover, the manner the appellant effected the withdrawal was most unusual, irregular, and anomalous. He has not shown any evidence that what he did was the usual practice in his office.<br><br>What happened in this case showed the appellants’ complicity as principal by direct participation in the malversation of the MIAA’s funds. The appellants should, therefore, be thankful to the Sandiganbayan for holding them liable therefor only through negligence.<br><br>I vote then to AFFIRM in toto the assailed decision.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

Marcos to deliver “thru this Office, the sum of FIFTY FIVE MILLION (P55,000,000.00) PESOS in cash as partial payment of MIAA’s account” with the Philippine National Construction Company. In their Dissenting Opinion, Justices Romero, Davide and Puno have shown how weak and unpersuasive this ruling is under applicable Philippine laws and jurisprudence. I will not repeat their illuminative discussions. Let me just stress three more points:<br><br>(1) The defense of “obedience to superior’s order” as already obsolete. Fifty years ago, the Nazi war criminals tried to justify genocide against the Jews and their other crimes against humanity by alleging they were merely following the orders of Adolf Hitler, their adored fuehrer. However, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in its Judgment dated October 1, 1946,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> forcefully debunked this Nazi argument and clearly ruled that (t)he true test x x x is not the existence of the order but whether moral choice was in fact possible.”<br><br>In 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Resolution firmly entrenching the principle of moral choice, inter alia, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>“The fact that a person acted pursuant to an order of his government or of superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.”<br><br>In the Nuremberg trials, the defendants were military officers of the Third Reich who were duty-bound to obey direct orders on pain of court martial and death at a time when their country was at war. Nonetheless, they were meted out death sentence by hanging or long-term imprisonments. In the present case, the accused are civilian officials purportedly complying with a memorandum of the Chief Executive when martial law had already been lifted and the nation was in fact just about to vote in the “snap” presidential election in 1986. The Sandiganbayan did not impose death but only imprisonment ranging from seventeen years and one day to twenty years. Certainly a moral choice was not only possible. It was in fact available to the accused. They could have opted to defy the illegal order, with no risk of court martial or death. Or they could have resigned. They knew or should have known that the P55 million was to be paid for debt that was dubious<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and in a manner that was irregular. That the money was to be remitted in cold cash and delivered to the private secretary of the President, and not by the normal crossed check to the alleged creditor, gave them a moral choice to refuse. That they opted to cooperate compounded their guilt to a blatant conspiracy to defraud the public treasury.<br><br>(2) resurring this internationally discredited Nazi defense will , I respectfully submit, set a dangerous precedent in this country. Allowing the petitioners to walk deprives this Court of the moral authority to convict any subaltern of the martial law dictator who was merely “following orders.” This ludicrous defense can be invoked in all criminal cases pending not only before this Court but more so before inferior courts, which will have no legal option but to follow this Court’s doctrine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>(3) Mercy and compassion are virtues which are cherished in every civilized society. But before they can invoked, there must first be justice. The Supreme Court’s duty is to render justice. The power to dispense pardon lies elsewhere. Verily, the Constitution ordains a final conviction by the courts before the President can exercise his power to wipe away penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Such is the legal and natural precedence and order of things: justice first before mercy. And only he who sincerely repents his sin, restitutes for it, and reforms his life deserves forgiveness and mercy.<br><br>I therefore vote to AFFIRM the assailed Sandiganbayan Decision convicting the petitioners of malversation.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 41 AJIL 172, 221 (1947).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> For the full text of the Resolution, please see Salonga and Yap, Public International Law, Third Edition, p. 235-236.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Submitted before the Sandiganbayan was Memorandum of then Minister of Trade Roberto Ongpin dated January 7, 1985, stating that the MIAA had total account of P98.4 million due the PNCC.

I am, however, constrained to write this brief dissent in view of the impact of the majority decision to our criminal justice system which many perceive leaves much to be desired.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><br></div><br>It should be immediately stressed that petitioners were convicted of the crime of malversation by negligence. The felony was committed by petitioners not by means of deceit (dolo) but by fault (culpa). According to Article 3 of the Revised Penal Code, there is fault when the wrongful act results from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, lack of skill. Justice J.B.L Reyes explains the difference between a felony committed by deceit and that committed by fault in this wise: “x x x In intentional crimes, the act itself is punished; in negligence or imprudence, what is principally penalized is the mental attitude or condition behind the act, the dangerous recklessness, lack of care or foresight, the imprudencia punible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In light of this well-carved distinction, the long discourse of the majority decision hailing petitioners’ good faith or lack of intent to commit malversation is off-line. To justify the acquittal of petitioners, the majority should strive to show that petitioners did not commit any imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill in obeying the order of former President Marcos. This is nothing less than mission impossible for the totality of the evidence proves the utter carelessness of petitioners in the discharge of their duty as public officials. The evidence and their interstices are adequately examined in the dissent of Madame Justice Romero and they need not be belabored.<br><br>For the same reason, the majority cannot rely on the doctrine of mistake of fact as ground to aquit petitioners. It found as a fact that “ x x x Tabuena acted under the honest belief that the P55 million was due and demandable debt x x x .“ This court has never applied the doctrine of mistake of fact when negligence can be imputed to the accused. In the old, familiar case of People vs. Ah Chong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Mr. Justice Carson explained that ignorance or mistake of fact, if such ignorance or mistake of fact is sufficient to negative a particular intent which under the law is a necessary ingredient of the offense charge (e.g., in larceny animus furendi, in murder, malice, etc.), cancels the presumption of intent and works an acquittal, except in those cases where the circumstances demand a conviction under the penal provisions touching criminal negligence. Hence, Ah Chong was acquitted when he mistook his houseboy as a robber and the evidenced showed that his mistake of fact was not due to negligence. In the case at bar, the negligence of the petitioners screams from page to page of the records of the case. Petitioners themselves admitted that the payments they made were “out of the ordinary” and “not based on normal procedure.”<br><br>As aforestated, the cornerstone of the majority decision is its finding of good faith on the part of the petitioners. Viewed from a more critical lens, however, the evidence cannot justify a finding a good faith The violation of auditing rules are too many yet the majority merely winks at them by ruling that petitioner Tabuena “ x x x did not have luxury of time to observe all auditing procedures of disbursement considering the fact that the Marcos Memorandum enjoined ‘immediate compliance’ with the directive that he forward to the President’s office the P55 million cash.” With due respect, I am disquieted by the mischiefs that will be mothered by this ruling. To begin with, the country was no longer under martial rule in 1986 and petitioners were under no compulsion to violate our laws. It also ought to be obvious that the order for immediate compliance even if made by the former Presidentcannot be interpreted as a green signal by a subordinate official to disregard our laws. Indeed, no person, not even the President can order the violation of our laws under any excuse whatsover. The first and foremost duty of the President is to uphold the sanctity of our laws. Thus, the Constitution requires the President to take an oath or affirmation where he makes the solemn pledge to the people: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President of the Philippines, preserve and defend its constitution, execute its laws, do justice to every man, and consecrate myself to the service of the Nation. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> To be sure, the need for petitioners to make an immediate payment is really not that immediate. The facts shows that former President Marcos first called petitioner Tabuena by telephone and asked him to make the payment. One week after or on January 8, 1986, the former President issued a written memorandum reiterating the order to pay. Payments were made in three tranches – first on January 10, 1986, the second on January 16, 1986 and the third on January 31, 1986. Clearly then, it took petitioner one month to comply with the Order. Given the personnel of petitioner Tabuena in his office, one month provides enough time to comply with the rules. In any event, petitioner did not request former President Marcos for additional time to comply with the rules if they felt in good faith that they need more time. Petitioner short-circuited the rules by themselves. Nothing in the Marcos Memorandum compelled them to disregard the rules. The Memorandum merely stated “Your immediate compliance is appreciated”. The language of the Memorandum was as polite as it could be. I fail to discern any dures in the request as the majority did.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br></div><br>The determination of the degree of participation that should be allowed to a judge in the questioning of a witness is a slippery slope in constitutional law. To a certain extent, I agree with the majority that some of the questions propounded by the justices of the respondent Court crossed the limits of propriety. Be that as it may, I am not prepared to conclude with certainty that the next and tone of the questions denied petitioners the right to an impartial trial. Bias is a state of mind which easily eludes evidence. On the basis of the evidence before us we cannot hold that we have plumbed the depth of prejudice of the justices and have unearthed their partiality. The more telling evidence against the petitioners are documentary in nature. They are not derived from the answers elicited by questions from the justices which the majority, sua sponte, examined and condemned as improper.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br></div><br>Finally, I can not but view with concern the probability that the majority decision will chill complaints against graft pending before the respondent Court. From the majority decision, it is crystalline that petitioners blindly obeyed the Marcos Memorandum despite its fatal and facial flaws. The majority even quotes these inculpatory admissions of petitioner Tabuena, viz:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>“x x x<br><br>“AJ del Rosario<br><br>“x x x<br><br>“Q If it was for the payment of such obligation why was there no voucher to cover such payment? In other words, why was the delivery of the money not covered by any voucher?<br>“A The instruction to me was to give it to the Office of the President, your Honor.<br><br>“PJ Garchitorena<br><br>“Q Be that as it may, why was there no voucher to cover this particular disbursement?<br>“A I was just told to bring it the Office of the President, your honor.<br><br>“AJ del Rosario<br><br>“Q Was that normal procedure for you to pay in cash to the office of the President for obligations of the MIAA in payment of its obligation to another entity?<br>“A No, you Honor, I was just following the Order to me of the President.<br><br>“PJ Garchitorena<br><br>“Q So the Order was out of the ordinary?<br><br>“bb Yes, your Honor.<br><br>“AJ del Rosario<br><br>“Q Did you file any written protest with the manner with which such payment was being ordered?<br>“A No, your Honor.<br><br>“Q Why not?<br>“A Because with that instruction of the President to me, I followed your Honor.<br><br>“AJ Hermosisima<br><br>“Q Why were you not made to pay directly to the PNCC considering that you are the manager of MIA at that time and the PNCC is separate corporation, not an adjunct of Malacañang?<br>“A I was just basing it from the Order of the Malacañang to pay PNCC through the Office of the President, your Honor.<br><br>“x x x<br><br>“A You agreed to the order of the President notwithstanding the fact that this was not the regular course of Malacañang was not the creditor?<br><br>“A I saw nothing wrong with that because that is coming from the President, your Honor.”<br><br>In effect, petitioners’ shocking submission is that the President is always right, a frightening echo of the antediluvian idea that the King can do no wrong. By allowing the petitioners to walk, the majority has validated petitioners’ belief that the President should always be obeyed as if the President is above and beyond the law. I cannot accept this dangerous ruling even if I look at it through the eyes of faith. One of the gospels in constitutional law is that the President is powerful but not more paramount than the law. And in criminal law, our catechism teaches us that it is loyalty to the law that saves, not loyalty to any man.

The informations filed on three separate dates in 1986 accused them, as accountable officers, of intentionally withdrawing said amount for the ostensible purpose of paying a non-existent obligation of MIAA to the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), but which they misappropriated and converted for their personal use and benefit.<br><br>In their defense, petitioners claimed they acted in good faith and in compliance with a verbal and later , a written order from no less than the former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. In a Presidential Memorandum (the Marcos Memorandum) dated January 8, 1986, the latter allegedly commanded petitioner Tabuena, in his capacity as General Manager of MIAA, " to pay immediately the Philippine National Construction Corporation, thru this Office (Office of the President), the sum of FIFTY FIVE MILLION (P55,000,000.00) PESOS in cash as partial payment of MIAA's account with said company mentioned in a Memorandum of (Trade and Industry) Minister Roberto Ongpin to this Office dated January 7, 1985…."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (The Ongpin Memorandum). On the assumption that MIAA indeed had a due and demandable debt to PNCC for work done on the airport, Tabuena, with the help of Gerardo G. Dabao and Adolfo M. Peralta, MIAA Assistant General Manager and Financial Services Department Acting Manager, respectively, made three withdrawals from the account of MIAA with the Philippine National Bank first, on January 10, 1986 for P25 million, then on January 16, 1986 for another P25 million and lastly, on January 31, 1986 for P5 million. The three manager's check covering the withdrawals were all applied for and issued in the name of Tabuena. Curiously, while the checks were issued by the MIA extension office of PNB, they were encashed at the Villamor airbase branch. Each time the cash was delivered directly to the office of Marcos' private secretary, Fe Roa-Gimenez. The latter issued a receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> signed by her but only after the last delivery. No PNCC receipt was ever given to petitioners.<br><br>On October 22, 1990, the Sandiganbayan's First Division rendered a decision finding petitioners guilty.<br><br>Petitioners raise two issues, namely, that they were charged with intentional malversation (which they labelled as malversation by direct appropriation) but were convicted of malversation by negligence, and that they acted in good faith.<br><br>As regards the first argument, the variance between the crime charged and that proved by the prosecution is immaterial, as stated by the ponente.<br><br>As regards the second issue, it is argued that good faith is a valid defense in malversation for it negates criminal intent. Petitioners claim that when they committed the acts complained of, they were merely following then President Marcos' oral and written directives. They rely on Article 11, paragraph 6 of the Code which states, inter alia:<br><br>"ART. 11. Justifying circumstances. - the following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>6. Any person who acts in obedience to an order issued by a superior for some lawful purpose."<br><br>For an act to be justified under the abovequoted provision, therefore, three requisites must concur: (a) an order must have been issued by a superior; (b) the order must be for a lawful purpose; and (c) the means used by the subordinate in carrying out such order must itself be lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Tabuena was allegedly ordered by President Marcos to pay the PNCC from MIAA's fund, thus ostensibly meeting the first requirement but not the others. For there is a qualification which significantly changes the picture. The payment was to be in cash and immediately made through the Office of the President. It is to be pointed out that it is one thing to be ordered to pay a due and demandable obligation; it is another to make such payment to someone other than the lawful obligee and worse, when the subordinate is forced to breach official channels to comply with the order.<br><br>It must be stressed that Tabuena and his co-accused, Peralta and Dabao, disregarded standard operating procedures in following the President's order. As observed by the Sandiganbayan, "there were no vouchers to authorize the disbursements in question. There were no bills to support the disbursement. There were no certifications as to the availability of funds for an unquestionably staggering sum of P55 Million." Disbursement vouchers are specifically required under Sec. 4 (5) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (P.D. No. 1445), while the certificate of availability of funds is needed to comply with Sec. 47, Title I-B, Bk. V of the Administrative Code of 1987<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and Sec. 344 of the Local Government Code of 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> To compound the duplicity, the checks, issued by one branch of PNB were encashed in another - all made in cash instead of by crossed check payable to PNCC! Conspicuously, such cash outlay was made without prior approval or authority of the Commission on Audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Finally, the last two payment were made despite the non-issuance of a receipt for the first. In fact, the receipt given after the delivery of the last installment was not even issued by the PNCC, the legal Obligee and avowed recipient of the money. Instead it emanated from the office of Roa-Gimenez, a complete stranger to the alleged contract between MIAA and PNCC, who did not even indicate in what capacity she signed it. To compound the mystery, the money was even delivered to her office, not in Malacanang, but at nearby Aguado Street. The entire process, done with haste and with a total disregard of appropriate auditing requirements was , in the words of petitioners themselves, "an extraordinary transaction,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> admittedly "out of the ordinary" and "not based on normal procedure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Disbursement of government funds, especially one as gargantuan as the one made by petitioners, is a complex process, unlike the basic over-the-counter transactions that they purportedly made it to appear. Far from being lawful, the payment of the alleged obligation of MIAA to PNCC through the Office of the President may at best be labelled as irregular. "The term 'irregular expenditure' signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in law. Irregular expenditures are incurred without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline.

The instructions in the President’s order should have sufficed to put any accountable head of an office, Tabuena included, on guard. Why was he being required to pay MIAA’s obligation to the PNCC, if needed there were any, and not directly to he latter but through the Office of the President? Why was the entire transaction not coursed through proper channels, viz., the accounting office? Why was such a huge disbursement to be made in cash, instead of by crossed check, which is not only safer, faster, and more convenient, but in accord with auditing requirements?<br><br>Obedience to a superior’s order does not connote blind obedience. Being the general manager of such a mamoth organization like the MIAA, he should, at the very least, have exercised ordinary prudence by verifying with the proper official under him whether the agency had indeed an outstanding indebtedness to the PNCC before ordering any payment to be made through official channels. Such routines measures were cavalierly disregarded. The whole process seemed no different from a petty, personal transaction.<br><br>As evidence later revealed, PNCC’s receivables from MIAA amounted to P102,475,392.35, the bulk which comprised escalation charges. From that time until Corazon C. Aquino assumed the Presidency, a total of P44.4 million was paid, but only P2 million of this in cash; the rest was set off or compensated against other debts, or assigned to other creditors. The financial records did not show that PNCC received any sums of money from MIAA during the period January to June, 1986 when the block payments were being made in quarter millions. Only on September 25, 1986, long after President Marcos had gone, was an assignment of P23 million actually made by MIAA in favor of PNCC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Even the Ongpin memorandum, which is the basis of the Marcos Memorandum, failed to show where the amount of P55 million cropped up. The former contained, inter alia, the following matters: (a) it requested the President’s approval of Minister Ongpin’s recommendation “for eight (8) supplemental contracts pertaining to the MIA Development Project (MIADP) between the Bureau of Air Transport (BAT) and Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), formerly CDCP…”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (b) it informed the President that PNCC had collectibles from MIAA only in the amount of P4.5 million, which is the difference between the accomplishment billings on the MIADP totalling to P98.4 million and PNCC’s advances of P93.9 million; and (c) it informed the President that PNCC had potential escalation claims against MIAA in the amount of P99 million, “potential” because they have yet to be approved by the Price Escalation Committee (PEC).<br><br>The only remaining piece of evidence which would show that MIAA owed PNCC anything as of the date of the Marcos Memorandum is MIAA’s balance sheet,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which indicates its liability to PNCC as of December 31, 1985 to be P27,931,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> How can petitioners claim to have acted in good faith when they withdrew the P55 million from MIAA’s fund knowing fully well that the amount due PNCC was only a little over half the amount, as shown by their own evidence?<br><br>The ponencia states that “. . . . the good faith of Tabuena . . . . was not at all affected even if it later turned out that PNCC never received the money.”<br><br>It is precisely our thesis that Tabuena did not act in good faith in complying with the President’s orders because of the reasons aforestated, summarized as follows:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; The President’s order was “out of the ordinary” and “not based on normal procedure,” which would have entailed making an “extraordinary transaction,” as admitted by petitioners themselves. This proves that they were at the time they received the order, aware that paying MIAA’s supposed P55 million obligation to PNCC through the Office of the President in cash was questionable.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; As the head of MIAA, Tabuena should have been more cautious in disbursing the funds. He did not even stop to think about the legality of the entire process even when he did not receive any kind of receipt for the first two deliveries of money worth P50 million. When he did get a receipt, it was not an official receipt from PNCC, the legal creditor, but from the President’s private secretary. It must also be noted that the cash was all delivered to Gimenez’ office at Aguado St., not ot her office at Malacañang.<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Tabuena breached official channels to procure the money. There was no vounchers not bills to authorize or support the disbursements. There was also no certificate of availability of funds. The payment was made in cash without COA’s approval, at a time when the ceiling for cash payments was merely P5,000.00. As stated earlier, no official receipt from PNCC supported the payment. The entire process was “done with haste and with a total disregard of appropriate auditing requirements.”<br><br>As regards the payments to Roa-Gimenez, these were absolutely unwarranted because whatever “authority” she claimed to have emanated, not from the creditor PNCC but from the President. Petitioners were required by law to settle their indebtedness with PNCC directly, the Party whose in favor th eobligation was constituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The only instance when such questionable payments could have been valid was if it had redounded to PNCC’s benefit, which was not proved at all in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As creditor, the PNCC was not even bound to accept payment, if any, from the President’s private secretary, the latter being a third person who had no interest whatsoever in the discharge of MIAA’s obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The ponencia states that the Marcos Memorandum was “patently lawful for no law makes the payment of an obligation illegal.”<br><br>This statement is premised on the existence of an established creditor-debtor relationship between the payor and the payee. In this, case, however, the obligor was being made to pay to a party other that the legal obligee when no novation of the obligation has taken place. How can such an arrangement be possibly accord with law?<br><br>The preceeding established facts clearly show that petitioners were remiss in discharging their duties as accountable officers. As correctly observed by the court a quo:<br><br>“. . . (T)he Ongpin Memorandum could not justify Pres. Marcos’ memorandum of January 8, 1986; this in turn could not justify Luis Tabuena’s payment of P55 million to Fe Roa Gimenez.<br><br>. . . (T)he amount which could be payable by Tabuena in his capacity as the head of MIAA in January of 1986 could not be in excess of P27.931 million – until other claims had been duly approved. This approva, on the other hand, could not come from the President but from the Price Escalation Committee (PEC) before which, accoriding to the Ongpin Memorandum itself, these claims for escalation had been submitted for approval.<br><br>The PEC was not shown to have approved these amounts as of the time Tabuena made any of the withdrawals for P55 million.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>Tabuena says he had properly accounted for the P55 million he had withdrawn from the MIAA’s funds. By this Tabuena means he gave the money to Fe Roa Gimenez, presumably in representation of Pres. Ferdinand Marcos.<br><br>Neither Pres. Marcos, however, nor Fe Roa Gimenez was entitled to received or issue acquittance for a debt in favor of the PNCC. Tabuena’s claim, therefore, that he delivered the P55 million to her is not properly accounting for P55 million.<br><br>In fact, when we come right down to it, nobody has issued an acquittance in behalf of the PNCC for the P55 million paid by Luis Tabuena. Since Tabuena says he was paying P55 million to the PNCC, it was incumbent upon him to show a receipt from or in behalf of PNCC. Tabuena has shown no receipt.<br><br>Tabuena was not authorized to part with government money without any receipt.<br><br>When Tabuena gave P55 million intended for the PNCC to Fe Roa Gimenez or to Pres. Marcos, Tabuena was paying government funds to persons not entitled to receive those funds. He was therefore, guilty of malversation of those funds.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>Tabuena says he has accounted for the money because he has told us where the money went. But to account, on more prolper use of the term, injects a sense of responsibility for the disposition of funds for which one is answerable.<br><br>So when one asks if Tabuena has accounted for the P55 million belonging to MIAa, the question really is whether accused Tauena disposed of the sum in a responsible manner consistent with his duty. The answer must be in negative.<br><br>Payments must be delivered to payees. Payments intended for the PNCC must be delivered to the PNCC or to someone authorized by the PNCC to accepts payments for it. Neither Pres. Marcos not Fe Roa Gimenez are show to have been authorized to accept money for the PNCC nor to deliver money to the PNCC (or to any creditor of th MIAA for that matter). In fact, though Pres. Marcos may have been the Supreme Magistrate of the land and the chief enforcer of the law, the law neither authorized him to pay for the MIAA not to accept money for the PNCC.<br><br>Accused Tabuena’s statement therefore, that he represented overwhelming evidence of the delivery of the P55 million to Pres. Marcos’ private secretary does not prove that he has accounted for the money, that is, that he has properly disposed of that sum according to law.<br><br>On the contrary, what the evidence shows is that accused Tabuena delivered the P55 million to people who were not entitled thereto, either as representatives of MIAA or of the PNCC.<br><br>It proves that Tabuena had deliberately consented or permited through negligence or abandonment, some other person to take such public funds. Having done so, Tabuena, by his own narration, has categorically demonstrated that he is guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of P55 million of public funds.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Time and again, this Court has deferred to the findings of fact of the trial court, owing its enviable position of having seent the physical evidence and observed the witnesses as they testified. We see no reason to depart now from this policy.<br><br>Tabuena was also personally accountable for the funds in his custody, being the head of a governmetn agency such as MIAA and discharging fiscal functions as such. In this regard, the Manual on Certificate of Settlement and Balances (Rev. 1993) (The Manual) states, inter alia:<br><br>“TITLE IV.

It must be borne in mind tha said reference was made after the conclusion was reached that Tabuena was indeed criminally liable for his acts. It is hornbook knowledge that criminal liability carries with it the civil, specially when, as in this case, the latter arose from the former. Hence, the statement: “Tabuena was also personally accountable for the funds in his custody, . . .”<br><br>Sections 29.2 and 29.5 of the Manual, which the ponente uses to illustrate his point, actually includes exceptions to the grant of immunity from civil liability of a public officer for acts done in the performance of his official duties: (a) The preceding statement itself says that the acts must be done “in the performance of his official duties;” (b) Sec. 29.2 exempts him from civil liability, “unless there is a clear showing of bad faith, malice or gross negligence;” and (c) Sec. 29.5 states that “he shall be liable for willful or negligent acts done by him which are contrary to law, morals, public policy and good customs even if he acted under order or instructions of his superiors.” The quoted provision have been once more underscored herein.<br><br>The ponencia futher states that “(t)here is no showing that Tabuena has anything to do whatsoever with the execution of the MARCOS memorandum.” But very clearly, the admitted facts show that it was precisely Tabuena who implemented or executed the said Memorandum.<br><br>The ponencia cites Acebedo where the accused was acquitted afterit was shown that it was actually the latter’s secretary who collected and converted the money. Tabuena’s case is starkly different, for her it was Tabuena himself who personally turned over the money to the President’s secretary. It was done with his full knowledge and consent, the obvious irregularity thereof notwithstanding.<br><br>In petitioner Peralta’s case, we again yield to the factual findings of the trial court. It said:<br><br>“. . . . The question is wheter or not Peralta properly signed the third application for the issuance of a Manager’s Check drawn against the MIAA’s savings account with the Villamor Office of the Philippine National Bank.<br><br>At the time that accused Peralta signed the request for the issuance of a Manager’s Check, he was the Acting Financial Services Manager of the MIAA and all withdrawals of funds required is (sic) co-signature.<br><br>The reason for the designation of more than one co-signatory is not merely useless ceremony; it is to seve as a counter check for the propriety of the disbursement.<br><br>While, indeed, accused Luis Tabuena was the highest official in the MIAA and had authority to cisburse its funds, this authority was not absolute. It had to be for properly subsisting obligations and the disbursement had to be against funds existing for that purpose. This is one reason for the need of supporting documentation before disbursements of funds are authorized. And this is the special need for finance officers such as Adolfo Peralta, as Financial Services Manager, to be co-signatories (sic): to particular instance, the existence of the balance to be covered by the manager’s check the application for which had been presented for his co-signature.<br><br>In this case, Adolfo Peralta speaks of the existence of (the) P27.9 million liability in favor of the PNCC as justification for his acts herein. True enough, for that amount was the liability as of December 31, 1985. As finance officer, however, he could not claim ignorance of the fact that as of January 29, 1986, the date of the application for a manager’s check which he signed, two previous manager’s checks worth P25 million each had already been applied for and the total amount of P50 million had already been withdrawn….<br><br>It was only two weeks after these two withdrawals when Peralta, as Finance Service Manager, participated in the authorization for the disbursement of another P5 million. This last withdrawal brought up the total of withdrawals to P55 million for the payment of a P27.9 million obligation.<br><br>Thus while it is true, as Adolfo Peralta claims, that there was a liability in favor of the PNCC, there was no way Peralta could disclaim the responsibility for the excessive withdrawals to the extent of P5 million thereof allegedly to pay that liability. There was no way Peralta could justify his co-signing the application for a manager’s check for P5 million on January 29, 1986.”<br><br>The ponente cites a dissenting opinion of Justice Isagani A. Cruz in Development Bank of the Philippines v. Pandogar to uphold his ponencia. Need we remind our respected colleague that the corroborative value of a dissenting opinion is minimal? Precisely, it supports a position contrary to, and obviously unacceptable to the majority.<br><br>Petitioners were found guilty of malversation by negligence which is possible even if the charge was for intentional malversation. This does no negate, however, their criminal liability; it merely declares that negligence takes the place of malice. Article 3 of the Code provides the rationale when it explicitly states that “felonies are committed not only by means of deceit but also by means of fault.”<br><br>The Sandiganbayan’s finding that petitioners converted and misappropriated the P55 million cannot simply be brushed aside upon’s petitioner’s claim that the money was delivered in good faith to the office of the President under the mistaken assumption that the President was entitled to receive the same. They rely on the case of People v. Fabian,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which declared that “(g)ood faith in the payment of public funds relieves a public officer from the crime of malversation.” But the very same decision also cites Article 217 to the effect that malversation may be committed by an accountable public officer by negligence if he permits any other person to take the public funds or property in his custody. It is immaterial if petitioners actually converted or misappropriated MIAA’s funds for their own benefit, for by their very negligence, they allowed another person to appropriate the same.<br><br>The fact that no conspiracy was established between petitioners and the true embezzlers of the P55 million is likewise no moment. The crime of malversation, as defined under Article 217 of the Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> was consummated the moment petitioners deliberately turned over and allowed the President’s private secretary to take custody of public funds intended as payment of MIAA’s obligation to the PNCC, if obligation there was at all. That petitioner Tabuena who was then the General Manager of MIAA personally and knowingly participated in the misfeasance compounds the maleficence of it all. Rank may have its privileges but certainly a blatant disregard of law and administrative rules is not one of them. It must be etched in the minds of public officials that the underside of privileges is responsibilities.<br><br>As accountable officers, petitioners clearly transgressed administrative and legal bounds. Even on the pretest of obeying a superior’s seemingly legitimate orders, their actuations can hardly be justified. To rule otherwise would set an alarming precedent where all that public officials who have unlawfully enriched themselves at the people’s expense and those accused of graft and corruption would have to exculpate themselves from any wrong doing would to be invoke Article 11, paragraph 6 of the Code, thus gaining instant immunity from criminal prosecution.<br><br>Government officials, particularly heads of their agencies who, by virtue of their exalted positions exude power and authority but pay blind obeisance to orders of those higher up in the bureaucratic hierarchy regardless of the illegality, impropriety or immorality of such orders, would do well to internalize this prayer for national leaders delivered by former Senate President Jovito R. Salonga in Malacanang on November 24, 1996:<br><br>“x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>When they begin to think of how much power they can possess, help them to know the many things that are beyond their power – the change of season, sum and rain, moonlight and starlight and all the wonders of Your creation;<br><br>When they are led to believe that they are exempt from public accountability, help them to know that they are ultimately accountable to You, the God of truth and justice and mercy;<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>The ponencia makes the final observation that the limitations on the right of judges to ask questions during the trial were not observed by respondent court; that the three Justices who heard the testimonies asked 37 questions of witness Francis Monera, 67 of Tabuena, and 41 of Peralta – more than what the prosecutors and defense counsels propounded.<br><br>While such numbers unduly disturbed the ponente, it cannot be gainsaid that such action by the member of the First Division of respondent Sandiganbayan was, under the circumstances, not only necessary and called for, but likewise legally acceptable.<br><br>In the first place, even the ponente makes the observation that petitioners did not raise this matter as error. In other words, they did not fell prejudiced by the respondent court’s actuations; nor did they construe the series of questions asked of them by the Justices as indicative of any unfairness or partiality violative of their right to due process.<br><br>Then, too, it must be noted that there is a difference in the right of a judge in a non-jury system, like that obtaining in the Philippines, to question witness or parties themselves, and that of a judge in a jury trial. The bulk of jurisprudence used in the ponencia was decided in the United States, where the jury system is extensively utilized in civil as well as in criminal trials. In this regard, “(I)t has been noted that the opinion of the judge, on account of his position and respect and confidence reposed in him and in his learning and assumed impartiality, is likely to have great weight with the jury and such fact of necessity requires impartial conduct on his part. The judge is a figure of overpowering influence, whose every change in facial espression is noted, and whose every word is received attentively and acted upon with alacrity an without question.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Thus, while a trial judge is expected to be circumspect in his choice of words lest they be construed as signs of partiality, he “is not, however, required to remain silent and passive throughout a jury trial;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> he should, instead, “conduct a trial in an orderly way with a vies to eliciting the truth and to attaining justice between the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as it is the jury which has the burden of meting our justice, it is acceptable for a judge in a jury trial to “ask any question which would be proper for the prosecutor or defense counsel to ask so long as he does not depart from a standard fairness and impartiality.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> “Questions designed to clarify points and to elicit additional relevant evidence, particularly in a non-jury trial, are not improper.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The numerous questions asked by the court a quo should have been scrutinized for any possible influence it may have had in arriving at the assailed decision. The true test for the appropriateness or inappropriateness of court queries is not their quantity but their quality, that is, whether the defendant was prejudiced by the trial court’s actions; otherwise, they would have raised this issue in the instant petition.<br><br>The ponencia states that he is “well aware of the fear entertained by some that this decision may set a dangerous precedent in that those guilty of enriching themselves at the expense of the public would be able to escape criminal liability by the mere expedient of invoking “good faith”. Our position has been either misinterpreted or misread for we do not merely speak of “good faith”. In fact, our main trust is that such a breed of people who enriched themselves the expense of the public might handily use as an excuse or a justifying circumstance to escape liability their having obeyed the “lawful orders” of their superior under Article 11, paragraph 6 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The ponente makes a plea towards the close of his decision, that we should not act impulsively in the instant case. “In our eagerness to bring to justice the malefactors of the Marcos regime, we must not succumb to the temptation to commit the greatest injustice of visiting the sins of the wrongdoers upon an innocent.”<br><br>In our opinion, precisely, Tabuena and Peralta are wrongdoers, guilty of acts punishable by law. Needless to say, under our system of laws, they must be meted out the corresponding penalty. We draw attention to the fact that nowhere in this dissent do we single out the so-called “malefactors of the Marcos Regime” alone. We addressed ourselves to all who commit venalities at the expense of the people, as defined and punished by law but who try to justify their actions by invoking the very law which they violated.<br><br>For the reasons stated above, I vote to affirm petitioners’ conviction by respondent court.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exh.
