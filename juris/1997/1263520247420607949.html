Allegedly, these witnesses were not able to enter the store upon hearing the gunshot because they were prevented by a man who wore dark eyeglasses and who poked a gun at them.<br><br>The records will show that Bacani and Caliguiran positively identified Diaz, Luto and Angquilo as the perpetrators of the crime:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MELCHOR BACANI</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECT EXAMINATION</u><br></div><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="left"> Now, on such date (October 30, 1992) and time (6:00 p.m.), Mr. Witness, was there any untoward incident that happened? </div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td><div align="left"> What was this untoward incident (sic) happened, Mr. Witness?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A</div></th><td><div align="left">While I was washing the car, I noticed a person enter, sir.<br><br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td><div align="left">Where did this person enter, Mr. Witness?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A</div></th><td><div align="left">Inside the store, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td><div align="left">Is this person whom you said on such date and time, if he is present in court, can you identify him?

My question is, was anyone of them wearing a (sic) dark eyeglasses when you saw them?<br>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them (sic) wearing a (sic) colored eyeglasses but you can see thru the lenses, they were not really dark glasses." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>In light of the positive identification by witnesses who have no motive to falsely testify, accused-appellants' alibis and denials are worthless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Trite too is the jurisprudence that where an accused's alibi is established only by himself, his relatives and friends, his denial of culpability should be given the strictest scrutiny.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, accused-appellants' alibis are supported by the testimonies of their wives,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> close friends<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and a business partner for two decades.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> They are necessarily suspect and cannot prevail over the testimonies of the more credible witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>Appellants further allege that the prosecution has failed to prove conspiracy among them. They maintain that evidence merely showed that on October 30, 1992, the accused-appellants Eddie Luto and Arnald Angquilo were seen standing by the door of the victim's establishment when the crime was committed. By this conduct alone, they argue that no conspiracy can be inferred.<br><br>We hold otherwise. The finding of conspiracy made by the trial court is well-grounded. We quote with approval its ratiocination, viz:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "x x x as Manuel entered the establishment as well as office of Ferdinand, Eddie and Arnald stood guard beside the establishment's door, apparently to ensure for Manuel all the freedom he needed to execute the job, and as soon as it appeared that Manuel was finished with the job inside, the trio (not to mention their other cohorts) together and as one fled from the crime scene."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote>It is settled that to hold an accused liable as co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the conspiracy. That overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime or moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> One who participates in the material execution of the crime by standing guard or lending moral support to the actual perpetrator is criminally responsible to the same extent as the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Luto and Angquillo were not innocent bystanders when the crime at bar was committed. They were there on purpose. They stood as guards while Diaz robbed and shot the victim.<br><br>Finally, accused-appellants assert that the trial court gravely erred when it admitted in evidence the gun (Exh. E), five bullets (Exhs. F-F-4) and magazine (Exh. G) taken from them by the police at the time of their arrest. Allegedly, they were obtained during a warrantless arrest.<br><br>Their objection is too late. The records show that they failed to object to the admissibility of said evidence during their formal offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, they waived their right against their admissibility. Amidst a waiver, the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the decision appealed from is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED </span>in toto.
