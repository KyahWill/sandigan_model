This was considered insignificant and will not in any way affect the soundness of the item.<br><br>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NPC’s Mangosing confirmed Agcaoili’s findings in a separated report, thus:<br><br>x x x The two pieces of piston skirt inspected were packed in a single Palo China crate. The description of the delivery was written on a piece of plywood specifying the corresponding Code No. and Plate No. which is similar to that in the P.O. The piston skirts were covered with plastic material. The bolts and nuts which are included in the delivery were similarly wrapped with plastic material and musking [sic] tape which is place [sic] in one of the piston skirts.<br><br>x x x The piston skirt was provided with a wax protective coating. A look through the open and uncovered spaces between the piston skirt and the crating material show[s] that the wax protective coating is thoroughly applied. However, scratches and dents were noted on the pheriphery [sic] of the piston pin holes.<br><br>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Growth Link’s] foreign suppliers, Fuji and I&amp;N International, are highly respected and prominent companies x x x.<br><br>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NPC’s Osilla in his report dated September 10, 1985 x x x stated: further verification revealed that the rejected items by GSDP were not the ones[s] supplied by the principal of Growth Link Inc.<br><br>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the Pielstick Piston Rings ordered by NPC from petitioner on February 23, 1984 under I.O. 07600 for Panay Diesel Power Plant (PDPP), same were shipped from Japan direct to conisgnee [sic], the NPC, and were accepted and received by the end-user, PDPP, on May 30, 1985. On June 3, 1986, or almost a year later, Romeo A. Perlado, NPC VP-Visayas Region, addressed a Memo to Ms. C. V.

Naciancino T. Caballero, NPC Manager, CMTS Dept. Visayas Regional Office, in a communication dated April 6, 1987 to Mr. Guadarrama, NPC Manager, Materials Management Dept. stated that: our inspection failed to produce the rejected pieces as there are no available damaged piston at the plant to be presented to Procurement per Memo of Ms. Daplas and that operating indicators and maintenance data fail to completely show evidence that will substantiate reports of premature damage x x x.<br><br>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged piston rings remained with x x x NPC x x x for reason that NPC refuses to issue the authorization to obtain possession of the subject item with complete description/identification/marking for manufacturer[‘s] purposes.<br><br>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the exhaust valve bodies, which were delivered to NPC Old Warehouse, Port Area, Manila, on October 13, 1986, these were rejected by NPC Quality Assurance Group on ground that they are manufactured by Fuji Diesel Co., Ltd., which is not a licensee of S.E.M.T.

The writ of preliminary mandatory injunction dated September 28, 1988 which directed NPC, among other things, to refrain, cease or desist from cancelling the standing accreditation of [Growth Link] with the [NPC] and allow the former to participate in any bidding or award like any other accredited suppliers, was honored by NPC more in its breach that in its compliance. NPC continued to disallow [Growth Link] to participate in any bidding.<br><br>x x x<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of warranty for hiddent defects or implied warranty on the quality or fitnes of the items delivered by petitioner and received by NPC could have been avoided had NPC complied with the requirement of law x x x.<br><br>NPC never filed any action against [Growth Link] within six months period from the delivery of the piston skirts, piston rings and other despite the fact that it was in possession, control, and disposition of the items x x x and [Growth Link] could not do anything to prevent switching, damaging, and/or pilferage as the items are in full possession and control of NPC. Thus [Growth Link] was left at the mercy of NPC who [sic] arbitrarily withheld payment or deducted payment from other items unless the items which NPC concluded as defective be replaced by [Growth Link].<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due process was denied by NPC to [Growth Link]. NPC just received with deaf ears and closed eyes, the several letters of explanation of [Growth Link], and the latter’s request for reconsideration and/or investigation was simply wastebasketed. And yet there was strong ground [for Growth Link’s] request considering that the items alleged to be defective were not the same items delivered or shipped by [Growth Link's] foreign supplier direct to NPC or NPC’s end-user. But NPC condemned [Growth Link] as a blacklisted bidder and supplier without hearing and deprived [Growth Link] of its rights without due process.’<br><br><blockquote>Additionally, We find the action of NAPOCOR in requiring [Growth Link] to replace the two (2) pielstick piston skirts x x x unjustified. x x x [T]he pielstick skirts when delivered on January 16, 1985 were inspected by the Quality Assurance Group of Napocor itself composed of Engrs. A.C. Mangosing, Jr. and Roberto Agcaoili whose report stated that said piston skirts were subjected to ‘actual visual inspection and were found conforming to technical specifications per P.O.’ On the basis of such findings, the piston skirts were accepted and approved for payment and February 25, 1985, Napocor paid Growth Link the net amount of P227,470.00 x x x.<br><br>In the fact-finding report and verification of the delivery of the pielstick piston skirts, we note with significance the findings of R.E. Agcaoili, Chief Engineer, Inspection/Test of Napocor as approved by L.F. Osilla, Manager of Napocor Assurance Group Utility Operations, that the delivered items are definitely piston skirts intended for Pielstick Diesel Engine for General Santos Plant; both items (in one crate) appeared new; they were adequately provided with protective wax covering and further preserved with pellucid plastic sheet wrappers; closer scrutiny on the piston skirt x x x showed that there were no signs of damages and/or unusual imperfection except for slight dents on the pheriphery [sic] of the piston pin hole which was considered insignificant and will not in any way affect the soundness of the item. x x x When these pielstick piston skirts arrived at the Gen. Santos Diesel Plant and re-inspected x x x the inspection report of Mr. Padilla stated that the delivered items were second hand with damages, hence, they were rejected by the end-user and reshipped to Manila x x x.<br><br>During the negotiations with Napocor, Mr. Teodoro Miguel of Growth Link committed to replace the rejected items x x x otherwise, Growth Link would be required to refund the amount of P227,470.00. On top of that, Napocor deducted the sum of P16,870.50 from [Growth Link’s] outstanding collectibles as evidenced by PNB Check No. 102690 per NPC Credit Memo No. 030910.<br><br>x x x [Growth Link] was [also] made to answer for an alleged discrepancy in the Pielstick Engine Piston Rings for the Panay Diesel Power Plant (PDPP-Dingle) which x x x was shipped from Japan direct to Napocor and accepted and received by the end-user on May 30, 1985 but was questioned after a year later on June 3, 1986 by Mr. Romeo Perlado, NPC VP-Visayas Region claiming that said piston rings ‘did not reach itsz normal expected life of 12,000 RH’ and requested that they be replaced, otherwise, they will put on record that its supplier has a bad supply of materials. [Growth Link] was treated similarly by Napocor with regard to x x x (4) pieces of Right Hand Exhaust Valve Body which, upon delivery to NPC’s old warehouse at Port Area, Manila on October 13, 1986, were immediately rejected by the Quality Assurance Group on the ground that they were manufactured by Fuji Diesel Co., Ltd., which is not a licensee of S.E.M.T.<br><br>The above instances are in addition to the grounds mentioned by the trial court as constitutive of the pressure imposed by Napocor upon [Growth Link]. Because of the admission of Napocor’s witness, A.C. Mangosing, Jr. that he knew of instances of switching cargoes in the Port of Manila x x x We cannot fault [Growth Link] for entertaining the idea that there was a switching of the brand new pielstick with old ones considering the lapse of time between the delivery and the rejection x x x coupled with the fact that when they were originally landed and inspected, the same were found by Napocor’s own engineers to be brand new x x x. We therefore, agree and affirm the lower court’s finding that Napocor’s gross evident bad faith was reflected in the aforecited actions taken against [Growth Link].<br><br>Moreover, we find no merit in Napocor’s contention that the trial court erred in applying Art. 1571 of the Civil Code x x x. x x x We cannot accept this argument especially considering the facts clearly show that the pielsticks piston skirts in question when delivered to Napocor were inspected, accepted and certified to by Napocor’s representative as brand new and in accordance with its P.O. No. 086653. As a matter of fact, that shipment was recommended for payment and actually paid for by Napocor. Moreover, the manufacturer’s certificate of authenticity and warranty cited by Napocor that allows a rejected item to be returned for repair and replacement provides that the ‘claim (of defect) must be reported within a reasonable period from the date of delivery’ precisely to prevent a substitution of the thing delivered x x x.<br><br>On the question of the lower court’s findings that the Napocor breached its writ of preliminary injunction, another factor upon which the lower court based its finding that Napocor committed gross evident bad faith, We only have to cite by reference that portion of the decision appealed from x x x. Additionally, on the basis of the facts established, it can readily be seen that Napocor virtually dragged its feet to thwart the effectivity of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the lower court.”</blockquote>But while respondent appellate court affirmed the trial court’s finding of gross evident bad faith on the part of NPC, it reversed the trial court insofar as it is found NPC liable for amounts claimed by Growth Link to be unrealized commissions properly accruing to them had the NPC recognized them as the lowest and the most advantageous bidder under several foreign inquiries. The Court of Appeal’s ruled:<br><blockquote>“An invitation to bid is not an offer which, if accepted, matures into a contract. In the language of Article 1326 of the Civil Code,’advertisements for bidders are simply invitations to make proposals and the advertiser is not bound to accept the highest or lowest bidder, unless the contrary appears.’ The reservation in the Invitaiton to Bid, of the advertiser’s right ‘to reject any and all bids’ is one of the terms and conditions therein which the bidder has accepted. (Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel, 25 SCRA 491) and such reservation does not make it obligatory for a government agency to award its contract to the lowest bidder. (C&amp;C Commercial Corp. vs. Menor, 120 SCRA 112)<br><br>Under the guidance of the aforecited authorities, We find no justification for the award given by the trial court to [Growth Link] in paragraphs ‘g’ ‘h’ and 'i' of the decision appealed from, which supposedly represent commissions unrealized by [Growth Link] on the basis of mere Foreign Inquiries for the reason that Unlike the Puchase of Indent Orders which are the result of approved bids and, therefore, give the winning bidder a vested right to its earnings and commissions arising therefrom, [Foreign Inquiries] as mere invitations to make offers or proposals, do not, by itself, produce a contract that would ensure earnings and/or commissions for the bidder. Hence the amounts awarded by the trial court merely on the basis of [Growth Link’s] various unapproved bids are too speculative and uncertain to justify the award.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>As to the awards for compensatory, moral and exemplary damages, the respondent Court of Appeals found valid basis therefor under the circumstance of these consolidated cases, but respondent appellate court was no less struck by the enormity of the amounts awarded by the trial court as damages. Thus it reduced the same in this wise:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;“ x x x [ W]hile we affirm the findings and conclusion of the trial court as valid basis of the award for damages, We find the awards of P2,000,000.00 and P1,500,000.00 for compensatory damages and for moral and exemplary damages, respectively, to be too huge, under the circumstances of this case that calls for this court’s duty to tone down petitioner’s fantastic claims (Baluyot vs. Lopez, 51 O.G. #2, p. 784). They are, therefore, hereby reduced to P1,000,000.00 for compensatory damages and to P500,000.00 for moral and exemplary damages.”</blockquote>Likewise finding NPC’s objection to the trial court’s finding of solidarity liability to be justified, considering that the officers and members of the Board of Directors of NPC were sued in their official capacities, the respondent of the Court of Appeals held:<br><blockquote>Finally, We find that the lower court erred in holding the individual respondents ‘jointly and severally’ liable with Napocor. It is significant to point out that both the original Petition and Amended Petition for Mandamus filed by [Growth Link], contain identical allegations in identifying the individual respondents in this case, thus:</blockquote>‘2. Respondent, NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION xxx; Respondents-Members of the NPC Board of Directors; HON. EDGARDO B. ESPIRITU x x x is being sued in his official capacity as Chairman of the NPC Board of Directors; HON. ERNESTO M. ABOITIZ x x x is being sued in his official capacity as the Vice-Chairman of the NPC Board of Directors and President of the Respondent firm; HON. JUANITO N. FERRER, HON. NESTOR M. NOGUERRA, HON.

Neither did the petitioner show much less claim, any circumstance which would neccessitate the piercing of Napocor’s corporate veil so as to make the individual respondents personally liable for Napocor’s obligation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>From the Decision fo the Court of Appeals, both Growth Link and the NPC and its officers and members of the Board of Directors invoke this court’s review powers: Growth Link prays for the restoration of the amounts awarded by the trial court as unrealized commissions in bids where it was the lowest and the most advantageous bidder but which were disregarded in the face of NPC’s unilateral and arbitrary blacklisting of Growth Link, for the upgrading of the amounts granted as compensatory, moral and exemplary damages to their original amounts as awarded by the trial court for the reinstatement of the finding of solidary liability among NPC and its officers and members of the Board of Directors; while NPC prays only for the reduction of the amount granted as and by way of attorney’s fees, which prayer, should we point out, is significally premised on the acceptance of all the other findings and conclusions of the Court of Appeals, including its affirmance of the trials court’s finding of gross evident bad faith on the part of NPC.<br><br>We find the instant consolidated petitions to be both wanting in merit.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 113103</span><br></div><br>A cursory review of the above errors raised by the NPC before the Court of Appeals, show that the NPC never assigned the issue of the exorbitant amount awarded to Growth Link as and by way of attorney’s fees, as an error on appeal. Thus, insofar as the amount of the attorney’s fees granted by the trial court is concerned, the same must be deemed no longer open to modification, much less, reduction, the person supposedly aggrieved thereby having resonantly been silent on this issue in its appeal before the respondent court.<br><br>At any rate, this court, in at least two (2) occassions, has allowed an award of 20%<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to 25%<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the total indebtedness involved in the litigation. In fact, the NPC cites these cases in the Petition.<br><br>In this case, Growth Link prayed for and was awarded by the trial court, the amount of P30,000.00 and 30% of the amount recoverable, as and by way of attorney’s fees. While said amount may itself be huge by ordinary standards, we believe that the same is warranted when tested against the criteria that serve as reglementary guide for the courts to determine the proper amount of attorney’s fees due the winning party.<br><br>Thus, we agree with Growth Link when it pleads that:<br><br><blockquote>“We take the citations as an implied admission by [the NPC] that an award of 25% of the obligation, is not itself a gargantuan, exorbitant and unconscionable. The matter of 5% differential will not make it so, if we consider the complexities of the instant case, the determination, now conclusive, that [the NPC] acted with gross and evident bad faith, in blacklisting private respondent x x x.<br><br>The determination of amount of attorney’s fees largely depends on the court’s discretion. So long as it has sound basis, it will not be interfered with. x x x<br><br>Here the lower court was further guided by the complex nature of this case, involving as it did several causes of action each of which proved difficult to establish, and made more so by petitioner’s sustained albeit unjustified, resistance. x x x<br><br>Thus this suit was a compelled recourse against arbitrary and capricious conduct and the denial of the rudimentary requirements of due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Anent the claim of NPC that the decision of he trial court does not contain any discussion of the basis for the award of attorney’s fees, suffice it to say that the trial court undisputedly awarded exemplary damages, which award is itself a legal justification, under Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Civil Code, for the award of attorney’s fees.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 116000</span><br></div><br>First. Growth Link insists that the decision of the trial court should be deemed final and executory insofar as NPC’s officers and members of the Board of Directors are concerned, because they did not appeal the trial court’s decision. Growth Link specifically cites the Notice of Appeal filed by the NPC to be personal only to the NPC.<br><br>This submission, however, is, in the first place, belied by the caption of the Notice of Appeal in question, which states, “NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, ET AL., Respondents.” This same caption can be found in NPC’s Motion for Reconsideration. Significantly, Growth Link’s Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration made reference to the NPC officers and members of the Board of Directors, in its arguments. At any rate, technicalities that defeat substantial justice are, by this court’s policy, an unpreffered basis to deprive parties of their statutory right to appeal a decision that is fatally flawed in certain respects.<br><br>In the second place, the finding solidarity liability among the NPC and its officers and Members of the Board of Directors, is patently baseless. The decision of the trial court contains no such allegation, finding or conclusion regarding particular acts committed by said officers and members of the Board of Directors that show them to have individually guilty of unmistakable malice, bad faith, or ill-motive in their personal dealings with Growth Link. In fact, it was only in the dispositive portion of the decision of the court a quo that solidary liability as such was first mentioned.<br><br>NPC’s officers and members of the Board of Directors were sued merely as nominal parties in their official capacities as such. They were impleaded by Growth Link not in their personal capacities as individuals but in their official capacities as officers and members of the Board of Directors through whom the NPC conducts business and undertakes its operations pursuant to its avowed corporate purposes. Therefore, as a bonafide government corporation, NPC should alone be liable for its corporate acts as duly authorized by its officers and directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote>&nbsp;“This is so, because a corporation ‘is invested by law with a separate personality, separate and distinct from that of the person composing it as well as from any other legal entity to which it may be related.’ (Tan Boon Be &amp; Co. v. Jarencio, 163 SCRA 205 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1988]</sup> citing Yutivo and Sons Hardware Company v. Court of Tax Appeals, 1 SCRA 160 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1961]</sup>; Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations, 13 SCRA 290 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1965]</sup>). A corporation is an artificial person and can transact its business only through its officers and agents. Necessarily, somebody has to act for it. Separate personality of the corporation may be disregarded, or the veil of corporate fiction pierced and the individual stockholders may be personally liable to obligations of the corporation only when the corporation is used ‘as a cloak or cover from fraud or illegality, or to work an injustice, or where necessary to achieve equity or when necessary for the protection of creditors.’ (Sulo ng Bayan, Inc. v. Araneta, Inc., 72 SCRA 347 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1976]</sup> xxx).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>We repeat, there was nothing in Growth Link’s petition not in the mass of evidence proffered, before the court a quo that established the factual or legal basis to hold the officers and members of the Board of Directors of the NPC jointly and severally liable with the NPC for the damages suffered by Growth Link because of acts of gross evident bad faith on the part of the NPC as a corporate entity acting through its officers and directors. The records even bear out that every single offense taken by the NPC against Growth Link arose from a corporate decision and was executed as a corporate act. Thus, the trial court gravely erred in holding said officers and directors to be jointly and severally liable with the NPC for the damages suffered by Growth Link but caused by the NPC alone as a corporate entity.<br><br>Second. Growth Link takes exception to the reduction made by the respondent Court of Appeals of the award compensatory, moral and exemplary damages. It submits that “the damages awarded by the lower court are not even adequate compensation for the injuries visited upon petitioner by the precipitate and irresponsible conduct of private respondent” and that the amounts as determined by the trial court were “even conservative in view of the demonstrated income-potential of petitioner.”<br><br>We empathize with Growth Link, especially in its owner-president, Teodoro Miguel, whose sincere testimony as to irreparable damage wrought on his business and personal reputation by NPC’s act of blacklisting his company, does call for some reparation in the form of substantial damages.<br><br>However, substantial damages do not translate into excessive damages. It is well-settled that the award of damages as well as attorney’s fees lies upon the discretion of the court in the context of the facts and circumstances of each case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and this judicial discretion is largely addressed towards tempering any tendency to award excessive damages so much so that it stands vulnerable to and actually magnetizes, attacks as to its being a result of passion, prejudice and corruption.<br><br>Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) as compensatory damages and one and a half million pesos (P1,500,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages, are too much. While NPC may be accountable for lost profits that Growth Link may have gained from its dealings with the NPC itself, NPC cannot be made to bear the burden of answering for what other profits that Growth Link may have earned from another contracts with other companies. NPC may have accredited Growth Link as a supplier, but it did not thereby become Growth Link’s insurer for all and any profitable contracts that Growth Link may obtain. Thus, we find the reduction of the awards of damages by the respondent Court of Appeals, to be warranted under the facts and circumstances of the instant case.<br><br>Third. Growth Link contests the deletion by the respondent Court of Appeals of the awards made by the trial court for unrealized commissions form bids disregarded by the NPC albeit Growth Link was the lowest and most advantageous bidder, on the ground that the said amounts were “too speculative and uncertain”. Growth Link cites two (2) reasons: first, that the NPC admitted its liability for such unrealized commissions in its Answer; and second, that the basis for the unrealized commissions was not necessarily contract but quasi-delict.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Growth Link insists that because the NPC allegedly, in its Answer, failed to deny the claims for unrealized commissions as laid out in Growth Link’s petition, it had, in effect, admitted the existence and merit of such claims. Growth link apparently relied on the general rule that non-denial of allegations in the complaint results in admission thereof. This rule however, is, just like any other rule, not absolute and correspondingly admits of exceptions.<br><blockquote>“x x x [I]n spite of the presence of judicial admission in a party’s pleading, the trial court is still given leeway to consider other evidence presented. This rule should apply with more reason when the parties had agreed to submit an issue for resolution of the trial court on the basis of the evidence presented.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Statements made in Answer are merely statements of fact which the party filing it expect to prove, but they are not evidence. With more reason, statement made in the complaint, or in this case, in the Petition for Mandamus with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and Damages, which are not directly refuted in the Answer, are deemed admissions but neither are they evidence that will prevail over documentary proofs.<br><br>Assuming arguendo that the NPC did not deny the claims for unrealized commissions as alleged by Growth Link in its mandamus petition with damages, and that consequently these claims have been transmuted into judicial admissions, these admissions cannot still prevail over the rules and regulation governing the bidding for NPC contracts, which necessarily and inherently include the reservation by the NPC of its right to reject any or all bids. By its own assertion, Growth Link has been a regular bidder for NPC contracts. It cannot deny, much less pretend ignorance of, the reserved discretion of the NPC to accept or reject any bid. Neither could Growth Link have forgotten the well-settled rule that this descretion is of such wide latitude that the courts will not generally interfere with the exercise thereof by the government, unless it is apparent that it is used as a shield to fraudulent award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or an unfairness or injustice clearly shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>We thus quote, with approval, the following postulations of the Solicitor General, in behalf of the NPC:<br><blockquote>“Clearly, it is not NAPOCOR’s ministerial duty to make an automatic award to [Growth Link] even if it was the lowest bidder. As foresaid, NAPOCOR reserved the ‘right to reject the bid of any bidder.' Thus, [Growth Link] has no cause of action xxx xxx. Mandamus will not lie to compel the acceptance of the bid of an unsuccessful bidder (Borromeo vs. City of Manila, et al., 62 Phil. 512 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1935]</sup>).<br><br>By participating in the public bidding, after NAPOCOR was ordered to cease from cancelling [Growth Link] submitted itself to the conditions laid down by NAPOCOR, among which is the reservation of its right to reject any and all bids to be made therein. x x x<br><br>Furthermore, Sec. 393 of the National Accounting and Auditing Manual provides:</blockquote>‘Sec 393. Reservation of rights to reject any or all bids, - The contract will be awarded to the contractor whose proposal appears to be more advantageous to the Government, but the right shall be reserved to reject any or all bids, to waive any informality in the bids received, and to acceptor reject any items of any bid unless such bid is qualified by specific limitations; also to disregard the bid of any failing bidder, known as such to the agency head or director, or any bid which is obviously unbalanced or below what the work can be done for. The right shall also be reserved to reject the bid of the bidder who has previously failed to perform properly or complete on time contracts of a similar nature, or a bid of a bidder who is not in position to perform the contract. x x x’<br><blockquote> In fine, NAPOCOR has the right to reject any and all bids, not only fo [Growth Link] but of all other bidders, as well, if warranted”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>And then there’s Growth Link submission that it claims for unrealized commisions are made proceeding not from facts founded on contract but from facts establishing NPC’s culpability under quasi-delict.<br><br>We however, find no allegation in Growth Link’s petition, no factual finding in the decision of the trial court and no error assigned before the Court of Appeals, as to anything about NPC’s liability for unrealized commissions based on quasi-delict. We are hardly surprised, however, by this change of theory at this belated stage of proceedings, because Growth Link indeed has no perfected contract whatsoever to show in order to prove that its claims for unrealized commissions are anything more that an attempt to collect on mere proposal bids that may have been the lowest and most advantageous in their class but nonetheless remain subject to the explicit reservation by the NPC of its prerogative to reject any or all bids.<br><br>All told, we find the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
