				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant Eliza D. Bagus was charged in an information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated December 17, 1990, for violating Section 4 of Republic Act 6425. When arraigned, appellant entered a plea of “Not Guilty”. Trial, thereafter, ensued. On September 7, 1992, the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> found the appellant guilty as charged and sentenced her “to suffer life imprisonment, to pay a fine of P 20,000.00 and pay the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Aggrieved, appellant interposed the instant appeal maintaining her innocence and arguing that the evidence against her “is doubtful”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The facts of the case as narrated by the Office of the Solicitor General are as follows:<br><blockquote>“The evidence for the prosecution shows that on December 12, 1990, about 9:00 a.m., at the Bagong Silang police Sub-Station, Kalookan City, Lt. Norberto Surara conducted a “briefing” wherein a team composed of P/Cpl. Perfecto Sobejana, Pat. Alfredo Antonio and P/Aide Bonifacio Lapuz, who was designated as the poseur-buyer, was formed in order to Gatchalian (TSN, January 24, 1992, pp.16-17). On the same day, at 5:00 p.m. said team police officers went to Barrio San Lorenzo, Tala, Kalookan City and saw Danilo Gatchalian, who was smoking and acting suspiciously (TSN, January 24, 1993, p. 8; TSN, August 14, 1991, p. 9). Pat. Antonio asked Gatchalian “to bring out everything out inside his pocket” and he (Gathalian) brought out five (5) tea bags of Marijuana from the pocket of his pants (TSN, August 14, 1991, p.9). The size of each tea bags of marijuana was one inch by one inch (TSN, October 16, 1991, p. 16). Gatchalian was arrested by the police officers and he informed them that he had purchased the five (5) tea bag of marijuana from Rodel San Pedro (TSN, August 14, 1991, p. 10). The police officers agreed to pursue their plan to conduct a buy-bust operation AGAINST San Pedro (TSN October 16,1991, p. 7). Hence, they proceeded to the house of San Pedro at Barrio San Roque, Tala Kalookan City, where from a distance, Gatchalian pointed appellant to them. Appelant is the wife of San Pedro and was then standing near the aforesaid house (TSN, October 16, 1991, p. 8; TSN January 14, 1992, p. 10). Since San Pedro could not be seen by the police officers, they agreed to conduct the buy-bust operation against appellant (TSN, October 16, 1991, pp. 9-10). While the (sic) P/Cpl. Sobejana, Pat. Antonio and Gatchalian hid in strategic places, P/Aide Lapuaz approached appellant and told her that she was a friend of her husband and would like to buy two (2) tea bags of marijuana (TSN, October 16, 1991, p. 9 ; TSN October 30, 1991 p. 7; TSN, January 24, 1992, p, 10). P/Aide Lapuz handed the marked P 20.00 bill to appellant, who went inside the house and gave Lapuz two (2) tea bags of marijuana in return (TSN, January 24, 1991, p. 10). When P/Aide Lapuz, by raising his hand , signalled to P/Cpl. Sobejana and Pat. Antonio that the sale of marijuana had been consummated, appellant ran out of the house and tried to escape, but Lapuz overtook and arrested her (TSN, October 16, 1991, p. 11). Appellant “confessed” that her husband was the drug pusher and pointed to the police officers the sixty- five tea bags of marijuana hidden under the dogs cage inside the house (TSN, October 16, 1991, pp. 12-13; TSN, January 24, 1992, p.13). Thereafter, the police officers, brought appellant to their head quarters at Bagong Silang Police Sub-Station, Kalookan City (TSN, August 14, 1991, p. 15).<br><br>“The seventy-two (72) tea bags of marijuana (5) were taken from Danilo Gatchalian and sixty-seven (67) from the appellant, each of which had the same size of one inch by one inch, were sent to the Natioanl Bureu of Investigation for laboratory examination, which showed that they were positive for marijuana (TSN, July 17, 1991, p.5).<br><br>“In her defense, appellant presented herself, Alfredo Santos and Fernando Bagus, Jr. as witnesses.”<br><br>"Appellant’s main defense is denial. She denied that a buy-bust operation was conducted by the police officers against her on December 12, 1990 (TSN, April 24, 1992, p. 7). She gave a different version of the incident. She testified that on December 12,1990, from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., two (2) security guards of Daily Security Forces , who were Resty delos Santos and Rodel Gingco, and an unidentified man, who was handcuffed, arrive at her house at Barrio San Roque, Tala, Kalookan City (TSN, April 24, 1992, pp. 7-8). Restry delos Santos, Rodel Ginco and the handcuffed man were looking for appellant’s husband, Rodel San Pedro (TSN April 24, 1992, p. 8). Not finding Rodel San Pedro in his house, they (Santos, Gingco, and the handcuffed man) brought appellant to the Bagong Silang Police Station for investigation, where he was detained for three (3) days (TSN, April 24, 1992, pp. 9-10). She did not know why the law enforcers testified against her (TSN, April 24, 1992, p.12).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>“[Defense] Witness, Alfredo Santos, testified that on or about December 12, 1990, between 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. three (3) male persons, one of them was in handcuffs, arrived at the house of their neighbor, the appellant herein. He knows the two (2) as security guards of the Daily Security Force (Tala Security Force) but not the one in handcuffs. At the time of their arrival, he was picking camote tops at the yard of the appellant and he was around three(3) meters away from the latter.<br><br>“The security guards were looking for Rodel San Pedro , live-in partner of appellant but they were informed by the latter that he (R. San Pedro) was out; One of the security guards entered the house of appellant and later came out saying that Rodel San Pedro was not there.<br><br>“Pointblank, witness declared that he did not witness any buy busting that take place during the time. Neither did he see any plastic bag of marijuana taken within the premises nor in chicken cage, nor dog house, by the by the security guards.<br><br>“Further testifying, witness started that he knows, as neighbor of appellant, that the latter has no dog house or chicken cage or any dog or chicken. Likewise, there are no tree/s around the place of the appellant and from the time the two (2) security guards and the person in handcuffs arrived and up to the time they left together with the appellant, he was at the yard of the latter.<br><br>“On cros-examination, same witness testified, that –<br><br>“He knows appellant about three (3) years, since the time that she became his neighbor; his family relationship with appellant’s is harmonious, as what he knows, appellant was invited by the two (2) security guards of Tala Security Force at the Tala Security Force at the Tala Headquarters; and that, he did not have a chance to see appellant at the office of the security personnel.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>The appeal is impressed with merit.<br><br>The Court Generally respect the trial court’s finding on the credibility of the witnesses, but where certain facts of substance and value are overlooked which if considered would affect the result of the case then such finding is not conclusive to us,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> as in this present appeal.<br><br>In the case of bench, there was three (3) alleged eyewitnesses, viz: P/Cpl. Sobejana Pat Cpl. Sobejana, Pat. Antonio, and poseur-buyer Lapuz. While these witnesses planned and conducted, as a group, the supposed entrapment of herein appellant the Court is disturbed on the material differences of their accounts. Hereunder are the substantial parts of the testimony of P/Cpl. Sobejana contrasted with the testimony of Pat. Antonio, thus:<br><br><blockquote>P/Cpl. Sobejana<br><br>Pat.

Sobejana and Pat. Antonio are accentuated by the testimony of the assigned poseur-buyer, Lapuz. Thus, While the two policeman are united in stating that there were only three persons in the group tasked to conduct the "buy-bust" operation Lapuz insist otherwise, hence:</p><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="105%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="left">So there were 3 of you in the group by Lt.

I do not know the names of the other members, sir”. (TSN, January 24, 1992, p.6)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>A marked disagreement among the witnesses on the source of the “buy-bust” money also exists. P/Cpl. Sobejana asserts that the money came from Lapuz, while Pat. Antonio’s testimony impliedly points to Lt. Surara as the the one who doled-out the peso bills. Lapuz, for his part, had this to say:<br>&nbsp;<br><table  ="" border="0" width="105%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="left">Who provided the P20.00 you used to buy 2 tea-bags of marijuana from San Pedro’s wife?<br><br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A</div></th><td><div align="left">Cpl. Sobejana, sir.” (TSN January 24, 1992, p.10)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>Moreover, it appears to be the standard operating procedure in “buy-bust” operations that the marked money bills are normally photocopied before their use. In the case at bench the authorities deviated from this procedure for no cogent reason.

Antonio and poseur-buyer Lapuz, alleged eyewitnesses, leave much to be desired. They are fraught with irreconcilable contradictions and substantial inconsistencies which thereby cast serious doubt over the veracity of the charge against herein appellant. Indeed, the Court is baffled how P/Cpl. Sobejana and Pat. Antonio who were situated outside the house at a distance of five (5) to eight (8) meters can see and clearly observe the supposed transaction or sale of marijuana inside appellant’s residence. Worse, such scenario was incompatible with the narrative of poseur-buyer Lapuz who indicated that the sale took place not inside but outside the house. The exclusion in the information, with no tenable reason, of the sixty five (65) tea bags supposedly taken from the custody of the appellant adds suspicion on the authenticity of the prosecution’s case. The credibility of the poseur-buyer also appears unreliable as shown by the following passage in his testimony, thus:<br>&nbsp;<table  ="" border="0" width="105%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="10%"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td width="90%"><div align="left">But you remember that you executed a Joint Affidavit of Apprehension in connection with this case?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A</div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td><div align="left"> And if that will be shown to you, will you be able to identify the same?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A</div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q</div></th><td><div align="left"> Will you please look in this Joint Affidavit of Apprehension if this was the same which you have said you executed in connection with this case?

Appellant’s averment that “the prosecution” is in a hurry “to beat the deadline of (sic) the filing of the case and avoid the possible offense of arbitrary detention”<sup style="">[8]</sup> and that perhaps her incarceration is a ploy to entice and force her husband to surrender to the police is far credible than the conjured tale of the apprehending officers and alleged poseur-buyer. We find that the appellant’s assertion was corroborated not only by the testimony of disinterested witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> but also by the testimony of PO3 Dioso, a police investigator and an additional prosecution witness.

Mere suspicion of guilt should not sway judgment. Every evidence favoring the accused must be duly considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In People v. Sadie<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and Perez v. Sandiganbayan and People of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this Court reiterated the ancient principle that “no one shall be found guilty of crime except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt .” We note that the presumption of innocence in favor of the appellant was not successfully rebutted, hence her acquittal is inevitable. In closing, the Court takes this opportunity to reiterate its admonition in People v. Cruz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on the trial of drug cases especially on buy-bust operations, thus:<br><blockquote>“Trial courts are admonished to always require precise and convincing testimony in cases involving buy-bust operations. x x x. Except for influential persons or those who can afford the best lawyers, it is well nigh impossible to refute a charge that drugs were ‘planted’ and not possessed or ‘pushed’. The complaints of mulcting activities by unscrupulous policemen, especially by those who are assigned to traffic duties or some other chores but who somehow stumble on possession of prohibited drugs by teenagers or provincianos, are legion. It is for this reason that trial courts should be more wary and careful in assessing conflicting, ambiguous, or non-relevant testimony. More important than apprehending and convicting criminals is faithful adherence to due process, the need to accord to every accused the protections guaranteed to him or her by the Constitution.”</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the appealed decision is <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE.</span> Appellant ELISA BAGUS Y DACAYAN is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">ACQUITTED </span>on reasonable doubt. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Her IMMEDIATE RELEASE IS ORDERED,</span> unless there is other valid ground for her continued incarceration.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span><br><i>Narvasa, C.J.
