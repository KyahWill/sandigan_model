Mears of Nasipit Lumber, reminding him of their verbal agreement in 1955 xxx that Mr. Mears in a Reply dated December 3, 1973, appears to have referred the matter to Mr. Noriega, the corporate general manager, but the new set of corporate officers refused to recognize (Villaflor’s) claim, for Mr. Florencio Tamesis, the general manager of Nasipit Lumber, in a letter dated February 19, 1974, denied Villaflor’s itemized claim dated January 5, 1974 (exh.

At any rate, the question whether an applicant is qualified to apply for the acquisition of public lands is a matter between the applicant and this Office to decide and which a third party like Villaflor has no personality to question beyond merely calling the attention of this Office thereto.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>Villaflor offered no evidence to support his claim of non-payment beyond his own self-serving assertions and expressions that he had not been paid said amount. As protestant in this case, he has the affirmative of the issue. He is obliged to prove his allegations, otherwise his action will fail. For, it is a well settled principle (‘) that if plaintiff upon whom rests the burden of proving his cause of action fails to show in a satisfactory manner the facts upon which he bases his claim, the defendant is under no obligation to prove his exceptions or special defenses (Belen vs. Belen, 13 Phil. 202; Mendoza vs. Fulgencio, 8 Phil. 243).<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>Consequently, Villaflor’s claim that he had not been paid must perforce fail.<br><br>On the other hand, there are strong and compelling reasons to presume that Villaflor had already been paid the amount of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos.<br><br>First, xxx What is surprising, however, is not so much his claims consisting of gigantic amounts as his having forgotten to adduce evidence to prove his claim of non-payment of the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos during the investigation proceedings when he had all the time and opportunity to do so. xxx The fact that he did not adduce or even attempt to adduce evidence in support thereof shows either that he had no evidence to offer xxx that NASIPIT had already paid him in fact. What is worse is that Villaflor did not even bother to command payment, orally or in writing, of the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos which was supposed to be due him since August 17, 1950, the date when the order of award was issued to Nasipit, and when his cause of action to recover payment had accrued. The fact that he only made a command (sic) for payment on January 31, 1974, when he filed his protest or twenty-four (24) years later is immediately nugatory of his claim for non-payment.<br><br>But Villaflor maintains that he had no knowledge or notice that the order of award had already been issued to NASIPIT as he had gone to Indonesia and he had been absent from the Philippines during all those twenty-four (24) years. This of course taxes credulity. xxx.<br><br>Second, it should be understood that the condition that NASIPIT should reimburse Villaflor the amount of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos upon its receipt of the order of award was fulfilled as said award was issued to NASIPIT on August 17, 1950. The said deed of relinquishment was prepared and notarized in Manila with Villaflor and NASIPIT signing the instrument also in Manila on August 16, 1950 (p.77, (sic)). The following day or barely a day after that, or on August 17, 1950, the order of award was issued by this Office to NASIPIT also in Manila. Now, considering that Villaflor is presumed to be more assiduous in following up with the Bureau of Lands the expeditious issuance of the order of award as the payment of the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos (consideration) would depend on the issuance of said order to award NASIPIT, would it not be reasonable to believe that Villaflor was at hand when the award was issued to NASIPIT on August 17, 1950, or barely a day which (sic) he executed the deed of relinquishment on August 16, 1950, in Manila? xxx.<br><br>Third, on the other hand, NASIPIT has in his possession a sort of “order” upon itself -- (the deed of relinquishment wherein he (sic) obligated itself to reimburse or pay Villaflor the xxx consideration of the relinquishment upon its receipt of the order of award) for the payment of the aforesaid amount the moment the order of award is issued to it. It is reasonable to presume that NASIPIT has paid the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos to Villaflor.<br><br>‘A person in possession of an order on himself for the payment of money, or the delivery of anything, has paid the money or delivered the thing accordingly. (Section 5(k) B-131-Revised Rules of Court.’<br><br>It should be noted that NASIPIT did not produce direct evidence as proof of its payment of the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos to Villaflor. Nasipit’s explanation on this point is found satisfactory.<br><br>‘x x x (I)t was virtually impossible for NASIPIT, after the lapse of the intervening 24 years, to be able to cope up with all the records necessary to show that the consideration for the deed of relinquishment had been fully paid. To expect NASIPIT to keep intact all records pertinent to the transaction for the whole quarter of a century would be to require what even the law does not. Indeed, even the applicable law itself (Sec. 337, National Internal Revenue Code) requires that all records of corporations be preserved for only a maximum of five years.<br><br>NASIPIT may well have added that at any rate while ‘there are transactions where the proper evidence is impossible or extremely difficult to produce after the lapse of time xxx the law creates presumptions of regularity in favor of such transactions (20 Am. Jur. 232) so that when the basic fact is established in an action the existence of the presumed fact must be assumed by force of law. (Rule 13, Uniform Rules of Evidence; 9 Wigmore, Sec. 2491).<br><br>Anent Villaflor’s claim that the 140-hectare land relinquished and awarded to NASIPIT is his private property, little (need) be said. xxxx The tracks of land referred to therein are not identical to the lands awarded to NASIPIT. Even in the assumption that the lands mentioned in the deeds of transfer are the same as the 140-hectare area awarded to NASIPIT, their purchase by Villaflor (or) the latter’s occupation of the same did not change the character of the land from that of public land to a private property. The provision of the law is specific that public lands can only be acquired in the manner provided for therein and not otherwise (Sec. 11, C.A. No. 141, as amended). The records show that Villaflor had applied for the purchase of the lands in question with this Office (Sales Application No. V-807) on December 2, 1948. xxxx There is a condition in the sales application signed by Villaflor to the effect that he recognizes that the land covered by the same is of public domain and any and all rights he may have with respect thereto by virtue of continuous occupation and cultivation are relinquished to the Government (paragraph 6, Sales Application No. V-807 xxx) of which Villaflor is very much aware. It also appears that Villaflor had paid for the publication fees appurtenant to the sale of the land. He participated in the public auction where he was declared the successful bidder. He had fully paid the purchase prive (sic) thereof (sic). It would be a (sic) height of absurdity for Villaflor to be buying that which is owned by him if his claim of private ownership thereof is to be believed. The most that can be said is that his possession was merely that of a sales applicant to when it had not been awarded because he relinquished his interest therein in favor of NASIPIT who (sic) filed a sales application therefor.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>x x x During the investigation proceedings, Villaflor presented as his Exhibit ‘(sic)’ (which NASIPIT adopted as its own exhibit and had it marked in evidence as Exhibit ‘1’) a duly notarized ‘agreement to Sell’ dated July 7, 1948, by virtue of which Villaflor undertook to sell to Nasipit the tracts of land mentioned therein, for a consideration of Twenty-Four Thousand (P24,000.00) Pesos. Said tracts of land have been verified to be identical to the parcels of land formerly applied for by Villaflor and which the latter had relinquished in favor of NASIPIT under a deed of relinquishment executed by him on August 16, 1950. In another document executed on December 7, 1948 xxx Villaflor as ‘FIRST PARTY’ and NASIPIT as ‘SECOND PARTY’ confirmed the ‘Agreement to Sell’ of July 7, 1948, which was maintained ‘in full force and effect with all its terms and conditions x x x’ (Exh. ‘38-A’); and that ‘for and in consideration of xxx TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND (P24,000.00) PESOS that the Second Party shall pay to the First Party xxx the First Party hereby sells, transfers and conveys unto the Second Party xxx his right interest and participation under and by virtue of the Sales Application No. V-807’ and, in its paragraph 8, it made stipulations as to when part of the said consideration xxx was paid and when the balance was to be paid, to wit:<br><br>‘a) the amount of SEVEN THOUSAND xxx PESOS has already been paid by the Second Party to the First Party upon the execution of the Agreement to Sell, on July 17, 1948;<br><br>b) the amount of FIVE THOUSAND xxx PESOS shall be paid upon the signing of this present agreement; and<br><br>c) the amount of TWELVE THOUSAND xxx PESOS, shall be paid upon the execution by the First Party of the Absolute Sale of the Two parcels of land in question in favor of the Second Party of the Certificate of Ownership of the said two parcels of land.’ (Exh. 38-B). (Emphasis ours)<br><br>It is thus clear from this subsequent document marked Exhibit ’38 ANALCO’ that of the consideration of the ‘Agreement to Sell’ dated July7, 1948, involving the 140-hectare area relinquished by Villaflor in favor of NASIPIT, in the amount of Twenty-Four Thousand (P24,000.00) Pesos:<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of Seven Thousand (P7,000.00) Pesos was already paid upon the execution of the ‘Agreement to Sell’ on July 7, 1948, receipt of which incidentally was admitted by Villaflor in the document of December 7, 1948;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos was paid when said document was signed by Vicente J.

Inasmuch as applicant-assignor was not able to obtain a Torrens Title over the land in question he could not execute an absolute Deed of (sic) Nasipit Lumber Co., Inc. Hence, the Agreement to Sell was not carried out and no Twelve Thousand (P12,000.00) Pesos was overpaid either to the applicant-assignor, much less to Howard J. Nell Company.

On the other hand, there is strong evidence to show that said Twelve Thousand (P12,000.00) Pesos had been paid by (private respondent) to Edward J. Nell Company by virtue of the Deed of Assignment of Credit executed by Villaflor (Exh. ‘41 NALCO’) for the credit of the latter.<br><br>Atty.

Nell Company (Exh. ‘41 NALCO’) whereby Villaflor ceded to the latter his receivable for NASIPIT corresponding to the remaining balance in the amount of Twelve Thousand xxx Pesos of the total consideration xxx stipulated in both the ‘Agreement to Sell’ (Exh. ‘F’) and the document dated December 7, 1948 (Exh. ‘39’); xxx.

Nell Company xxx. Atty. Banaag’s aforesaid testimony stand unrebutted; hence, must be given full weight and credit. xxx Villaflor and his counsel were present when Atty.

Said the Honorable Justice Secretary:<br><br>‘On the second question, (referring to the questions when may a public land be considered to have been acquired by purchase before the effectivity of the new Constitution posed by the Director of Lands in his query on the effect on pending applications for the issuance of sales patent in the light of Section 11, Art.

The trial court ordered his widow, Lourdes D. Villaflor, to be substituted as petitioner. After trial in due course, the then Court of First Instance of Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, Branch III,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dismissed the complaint on the grounds that: (1) petitioner admitted the due execution and genuineness of the contract and was estopped from proving its nullity, (2) the verbal lease agreements were unenforceable under Article 1403 (2)(e) of the Civil Code, and (3) his causes of action were barred by extinctive prescription and/or laches. It ruled that there was prescription and/or laches because the alleged verbal lease ended in 1966, but the action was filed only on January 6, 1978. The six-year period within which to file an action on an oral contract per Article 1145 (1) of the Civil Code expired in 1972. The decretal portion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the trial court’s decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises duly considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff.

The decretal portion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the assailed 49-page, single-spaced Decision curtly reads:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from, is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against plaintiff-appellants.”</blockquote><br><br>Not satisfied, petitioner’s heirs filed the instant 57-page petition for review dated December 7, 1990. In a Resolution dated June 23, 1991, the Court denied this petition “for being late.” On reconsideration -- upon plea of counsel that petitioners were “poor” and that a full decision on the merits should be rendered -- the Court reinstated the petition and required comment from private respondent. Eventually, the petition was granted due course and the parties thus filed their respective memoranda.<br><br>The Issues<br><br>Petitioner, through his heirs, attributes the following errors to the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>“I. Are the findings of the Court of Appeals conclusive and binding upon the Supreme Court?<br><br>II.

Did the Court of Appeals, in construing the subject contracts, consider the contemporaneous and subsequent act of the parties pursuant to article 1371 of the Civil Code?<br><br>VII. Did the Court of Appeals consider the fact and the unrefuted claim of Villaflor that he never knew of the award in favor of Nasipit?<br><br>VIII. Did the Court of Appeals correctly apply the rules on evidence in its findings that Villaflor was paid the P5,000.00 consideration because Villaflor did not adduce any proof that he was not paid?<br><br>IX.

Is the Court of Appeals‘ conclusion that the lease agreement between Villaflor is verbal and therefore, unenforceable supported by the evidence and the law?”</blockquote><br><br>After a review of the various submissions of the parties, particularly those of petitioner, this Court believes and holds that the issues can be condensed into three as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err in adopting or relying on the factual findings of the Bureau of Lands, especially those affirmed by the Minister (now Secretary) of Natural Resources and the trial court?<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err in upholding the validity of the contracts to sell and the deed of relinquishment?

It basically questions the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the Court of Appeals, alleging that public respondent’s factual findings were based on speculations, surmises and conjectures. Petitioner insists that a review of those findings is in order because they were allegedly (1) rooted, not on specific evidence, but on conclusions and inferences of the Director of Lands which were, in turn, based on misapprehension of the applicable law on simulated contracts; (2) arrived at whimsically -- totally ignoring the substantial and admitted fact that petitioner was not notified of the award in favor of private respondent; and (3) grounded on errors and misapprehensions, particularly those relating to the identity of the disputed area.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Issue: Primary Jurisdiction of the Director of Lands and Finality of Factual Findings of the Court of Appeals</span><br><br>Underlying the rulings of the trial and appellate courts is the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; i.e., courts cannot and will not resolve a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, especially where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In recent years, it has been the jurisprudential trend to apply this doctrine to cases involving matters that demand the special competence of administrative agencies even if the question involved is also judicial in character. It applies “where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such case, the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its view.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In cases where the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is clearly applicable, the court cannot arrogate unto itself the authority to resolve a controversy, the jurisdiction over which is initially lodged with an administrative body of special competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In Machete vs. Court of Appeals, the Court upheld the primary jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudicatory Board (DARAB) in an agrarian dispute over the payment of back rentals under a leasehold contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In Concerned Officials of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System vs. Vasquez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court recognized that the MWSS was in the best position to evaluate and to decide which bid for a waterworks project was compatible with its development plan.<br><br>The rationale underlying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction finds application in this case, since the questions on the identity of the land in dispute and the factual qualification of private respondent as an awardee of a sales application require a technical determination by the Bureau of Lands as the administrative agency with the expertise to determine such matters. Because these issues preclude prior judicial determination, it behooves the courts to stand aside even when they apparently have statutory power to proceed, in recognition of the primary jurisdiction of the administrative agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“One thrust of the multiplication of administrative agencies is that the interpretation of contracts and the determination of private rights thereunder is no longer a uniquely judicial function, exercisable only by our regular courts”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner initiated his action with a protest before the Bureau of Lands and followed it through in the Ministry of Natural Resources and thereafter in the Office of the President. Consistent with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the trial and the appellate courts had reason to rely on the findings of these specialized administrative bodies.<br><br>The primary jurisdiction of the director of lands and the minister of natural resources over the issues regarding the identity of the disputed land and the qualification of an awardee of a sales patent is established by Sections 3 and 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, also known as the Public Land Act:<br><br><blockquote>“Section 3. The Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce (now Secretary of Natural Resources) shall be the executive officer charged with carrying out the provisions of this Act through the Director of Lands, who shall act under his immediate control.”<br><br>“Section 4. Subject to said control, the Director of Lands shall have direct executive control of the survey, classification, lease, sale or any other form of concession or disposition and management of the lands of the public domain, and his decision as to questions of fact shall be conclusive when approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce.”</blockquote><br><br>Thus, the Director of Lands, in his decision, said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“x x x It is merely whether or not Villaflor has been paid the Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos stipulated consideration of the deed of relinquishment made by him without touching on the nature of the deed of relinquishment. The administration and disposition of public lands is primarily vested in the Director of Lands and ultimately with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (now Secretary of Natural Resources), and to this end--</blockquote><br><br>‘Our Supreme Court has recognized that the Director of Lands is a quasi-judicial officer who passes on issues of mixed facts and law (Ortua vs. Bingson Encarnacion, 59 Phil 440). Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Land Law thus mean that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources shall be the final arbiter on questions of fact in public land conflicts (Heirs of Varela vs. Aquino, 71 Phil 69; Julian vs. Apostol, 52 Phil 442).‘<br><br>The ruling of this Office in its order dated September 10, 1975, is worth reiterating, thus:<br><br>‘x x x it is our opinion that in the exercise of his power of executive control, administrative disposition and allegation of public land, the Director of Lands should entertain the protest of Villaflor and conduct formal investigation xxx to determine the following points: (a) whether or not the Nasipit Lumber Company, Inc. paid or reimbursed to Villaflor the consideration of the rights in the amount of P5,000.00 and what evidence the company has to prove payment, the relinquishment of rights being part of the administrative process in the disposition of the land in question xxx.<br><br>xxxx Besides, the authority of the Director of Lands to pass upon and determine questions considered inherent in or essential to the efficient exercise of his powers like the incident at issue, i.e. , whether Villaflor had been paid or not, is conceded by law.‘”<br><br>Reliance by the trial and the appellate courts on the factual findings of the Director of Lands and the Minister of Natural Resources is not misplaced. By reason of the special knowledge and expertise of said administrative agencies over matters falling under their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon; thus, their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded great respect, if not finality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The findings of fact of an administrative agency must be respected as long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant.

Otherwise, this Court will not disturb such findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>We mention and quote extensively from the rulings of the Bureau of Lands and the Minister of Natural Resources because the points, questions and issues raised by petitioner before the trial court, the appellate court and now before this Court are basically the same as those brought up before the aforesaid specialized administrative agencies. As held by the Court of Appeals:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“We find that the contentious points raised by appellant in this action, are substantially the same matters he raised in BL Claim No. 873 (N).

Indeed, petitioner has not given us sufficient reason to deviate from them.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land in Dispute Is Public Land</span><br></div><br>Petitioner argues that even if the technical description in the deeds of sale and those in the sales application were not identical, the area in dispute remains his private property. He alleges that the deeds did not contain any technical description, as they were executed prior to the survey conducted by the Bureau of Lands; thus, the properties sold were merely described by reference to natural boundaries. His private ownership thereof was also allegedly attested to by private respondent’s former field manager in the latter’s February 22, 1950 letter, which contained an admission that the land leased by private respondent was covered by the sales application.<br><br>This contention is specious. The lack of technical description did not prove that the finding of the Director of Lands lacked substantial evidence. Here, the issue is not so much whether the subject land is identical with the property purchased by petitioner. The issue, rather, is whether the land covered by the sales application is private or public land. In his sales application, petitioner expressly admitted that said property was public land. This is formidable evidence as it amounts to an admission against interest.<br><br>In the exercise of his primary jurisdiction over the issue, Director of Lands Casanova ruled that the land was public:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“x x x Even (o)n the assumption that the lands mentioned in the deeds of transfer are the same as the 140-hectare area awarded to Nasipit, their purchase by Villaflor (or) the latter’s occupation of the same did not change the character of the land from that of public land to a private property. The provision of the law is specific that public lands can only be acquired in the manner provided for therein and not otherwise (Sec. 11, C.A. No. 141, as amended). The records show that Villaflor had applied for the purchase of lands in question with this Office (Sales Application No. V-807) on December 2, 1948. xxx There is a condition in the sales application xxx to the effect that he recognizes that the land covered by the same is of public domain and any and all rights he may have with respect thereto by virtue of continuous occupation and cultivation are relinquished to the Government (paragraph 6, Sales Application No. V-807 of Vicente J. Villaflor, p. 21, carpeta) of which Villaflor is very much aware. It also appears that Villaflor had paid for the publication fees appurtenant to the sale of the land. He participated in the public auction where he was declared the successful bidder. He had fully paid the purchase prive (sic) thereor (sic). It would be a (sic) height of absurdity for Villaflor to be buying that which is owned by him if his claim of private ownership thereof is to be believed. xxx.”</blockquote><br><br>This finding was affirmed by the Minister of Natural Resources:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“Firstly, the area in dispute is not the private property of appellant (herein petitioner).<br><br>The evidence adduced by (petitioner) to establish his claim of ownership over the subject area consists of deeds of absolute sale executed in his favor xxx.<br><br>However, an examination of the technical descriptions of the tracts of land subject of the deeds of sale will disclose that said parcels are not identical to, and do not tally with, the area in controversy.</blockquote><br><br>‘It is a basic assumption of our policy that lands of whatever classification belong to the state.

Hence, the property must be held to be public domain.</blockquote><br><br>‘There being no evidence whatever that the property in question was ever acquired by the applicants or their ancestors either by composition title from the Spanish Government or by possessory information title or by any other means for the acquisition of public lands, the property must be held to be public domain.’<br><br><blockquote>Be that as it may, [petitioner], by filing a sales application over the controverted land, acknowledged unequivocably [sic] that the same is not his private property.</blockquote><br><br>‘As such sales applicant manifestly acknowledged that he does not own the land and that the same is a public land under the administration of the Bureau of Lands, to which the application was submitted, xxx All of its acts prior thereof, including its real estate tax declarations, characterized its possessions of the land as that of a ‘sales applicant’. And consequently, as one who expects to buy it, but has not as yet done so, and is not, therefore, its owner.’(Palawan Agricultural and Industrial Co., Inc. vs. Director of Lands, L-25914, March 21, 1972, 44 SCRA 15).”<br><br>Clearly, this issue falls under the primary jurisdiction of the Director of Lands because its resolution requires “survey, classification, xxx disposition and management of the lands of the public domain.” It follows that his rulings deserve great respect. As petitioner failed to show that this factual finding of the Director of Lands was unsupported by substantial evidence, it assumes finality. Thus, both the trial and the appellate courts correctly relied on such finding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> We can do no less.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Issue: No Simulation of Contracts Proven</span><br></div><br>Petitioner insists that contrary to Article 1371<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the Civil Code, Respondent Court erroneously ignored the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties; hence, it failed to ascertain their true intentions. However, the rule on the interpretation of contracts that was alluded to by petitioner is used in affirming, not negating, their validity. Thus, Article 1373,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which is a conjunct of Article 1371, provides that, if the instrument is susceptible of two or more interpretations, the interpretation which will make it valid and effectual should be adopted. In this light, it is not difficult to understand that the legal basis urged by petitioner does not support his allegation that the contracts to sell and the deed of relinquishment are simulated and fictitious. Properly understood, such rules on interpretation even negate petitioner’s thesis.<br><br>But let us indulge the petitioner awhile and determine whether the cited contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties support his allegation of simulation. Petitioner asserts that the relinquishment of rights and the agreements to sell were simulated because, first, the language and terms of said contracts negated private respondent’s acquisition of ownership of the land in issue; and second, contemporaneous and subsequent communications between him and private respondent allegedly showed that the latter admitted that petitioner owned and occupied the two parcels; i.e., that private respondent was not applying for said parcels but was interested only in the two hectares it had leased, and that private respondent supported petitioner’s application for a patent.<br><br>Petitioner explains that the Agreement to Sell dated December 7, 1948 did not and could not transfer ownership because paragraph 8 (c) thereof stipulates that the “balance of twelve thousand pesos (P12,000.00) shall be paid upon the execution by the First Party [petitioner] of the Absolute Deed of Sale of the two parcels of land in question in favor of the Second Party, and upon delivery to the Second Party [private respondent] of the Certificate of Ownership of the said two parcels of land.” The mortgage provisions in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement state that the P7,000.00 and P5,000.00 were “earnest money or a loan with antichresis by the free occupancy and use given to Nasipit of the 140 hectares of land not anymore as a lessee.” If the agreement to sell transferred ownership to Nasipit, then why was it necessary to require petitioner, in a second agreement, to mortgage his property in the event of nonfulfillment of the prestations in the first agreement?<br><br>True, the agreement to sell did not absolutely transfer ownership of the land to private respondent. This fact, however, does not show that the agreement was simulated. Petitioner’s delivery of the Certificate of Ownership and execution of the deed of absolute sale were suspensive conditions, which gave rise to a corresponding obligation on the part of the private respondent, i.e., the payment of the last installment of the consideration mentioned in the December 7, 1948 Agreement. Such conditions did not affect the perfection of the contract or prove simulation. Neither did the mortgage.<br><br>Simulation occurs when an apparent contract is a declaration of a fictitious will, deliberately made by agreement of the parties, in order to produce, for the purpose of deception, the appearance of a juridical act which does not exist or is different from that which was really executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Such an intention is not apparent in the agreements. The intent to sell, on the other hand, is as clear as daylight.<br><br>Petitioner alleges further that the deed of relinquishment of right did not give full effect to the two agreements to sell, because the preliminary clauses of the deed allegedly served only to give private respondent an interest in the property as a future owner thereof and to enable respondent to follow up petitioner’s sales application.<br><br>We disagree. Such an intention is not indicated in the deed. On the contrary, a real and factual sale is evident in paragraph 6 thereof, which states: “That the Nasipit Lumber Co., Inc., xxx is very much interested in acquiring the land covered by the aforecited application to be used for purposes of mechanized farming” and the penultimate paragraph stating: “xxx VICENTE J. VILLAFLOR, hereby voluntarily renounce and relinquish whatever rights to, and interests I have in the land covered by my above-mentioned application in favor of the Nasipit Lumber Co., Inc.”<br><br>We also hold that no simulation is shown either in the letter, dated December 3, 1973, of the former field manager of private respondent, George Mear. A pertinent portion of the letter reads:<br><br><blockquote>“(a)s regards your property at Acacia, San Mateo, I recall that we made some sort of agreement for the occupancy, but I no longer recall the details and I had forgotten whether or not we actually did occupy your land. But if, as you say, we did occupy it, then I am sure that the Company is obligated to pay a rental.”</blockquote><br><br>The letter did not contain any express admission that private respondent was still leasing the land from petitioner as of that date. According to Mear, he could no longer recall the details of his agreement with petitioner. This cannot be read as evidence of the simulation of either the deed of relinquishment or the agreements to sell. It is evidence merely of an honest lack of recollection.<br><br>Petitioner also alleges that he continued to pay realty taxes on the land even after the execution of said contracts. This is immaterial because payment of realty taxes does not necessarily prove ownership, much less simulation of said contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nonpayment of the Consideration</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Did Not Prove Simulation</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><br>Petitioner insists that nonpayment of the consideration in the contracts proves their simulation. We disagree. Nonpayment, at most, gives him only the right to sue for collection. Generally, in a contract of sale, payment of the price is a resolutory condition and the remedy of the seller is to exact fulfillment or, in case of a substantial breach, to rescind the contract under Article 1191 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, failure to pay is not even a breach, but merely an event which prevents the vendor’s obligation to convey title from acquiring binding force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also argues that Respondent Court violated evidentiary rules in upholding the ruling of the Director of Lands that petitioner did not present evidence to show private respondent’s failure to pay him.

The demand letters dated January 2 and 5, 1974 (Exhs. “J” and “U”), adduced in evidence by petitioner, were for the payment of back rentals, damages to improvements and reimbursement of acquisition costs and realty taxes, not payment arising from the contract to sell.<br><br>Thus, we cannot fault Respondent Court for adopting the finding of the Director of Lands that petitioner “offered no evidence to support his claim of nonpayment beyond his own self-serving assertions,” as he did not even demand “payment, orally or in writing, of the five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos which was supposed to be due him since August 17, 1950, the date when the order of award was issued to Nasipit, and when his cause of action to recover payment had accrued.” Nonpayment of the consideration in the contracts to sell or the deed of relinquishment was raised for the first time in the protest filed with the Bureau of Lands on January 31, 1974. But this protest letter was not the demand letter required by law.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that the assignment of credit and the letter of the former field manager of private respondent are contemporaneous and subsequent acts revealing the nonpayment of the consideration. He maintains that the P12,000.00 credit assigned pertains to the P5,000.00 and P7,000.00 initial payments in the December 7, 1948 Agreement, because the balance of P12,000.00 was not yet “due and accruing.” This is consistent, he argues, with the representation that private respondent was not interested in filing a sales application over the land in issue and that Nasipit was instead supporting petitioner’s application thereto in Mear’s letter to the Director of Lands dated February 22, 1950 (Exh. “X”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>This argument is too strained to be acceptable. The assignment of credit did not establish the nondelivery of these initial payments of the total consideration. First, the assignment of credit happened on January 19, 1949, or a month after the signing of the December 7, 1948 Agreement and almost six months after the July 7, 1948 Agreement to Sell. Second, it does not overcome the recitation in the Agreement of December 7, 1948: “xxx a) The amount of SEVEN THOUSAND (P7,000.00) PESOS has already been paid by the Second Party to the First Party upon the execution of the Agreement to Sell, on July 7, 1948; b) The amount of FIVE THOUSAND (P5,000.00) PESOS shall be paid upon the signing of this present agreement; xxx.”<br><br>Aside from these facts, the Director of Lands found evidence of greater weight showing that payment was actually made:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“x x x (T)here is strong evidence to show that said xxx (P12,000.00) had been paid by NASIPIT to Edward J.

Indeed, even the applicable law itself (Sec. 337, National Internal Revenue Code) requires that all records of corporations be preserved for only a maximum of five years.<br><br>NASIPIT may well have added that at any rate while there are transactions where the proper evidence is impossible or extremely difficult to produce after the lapse of time xxx the law creates presumptions of regularity in favor of such transactions (20 Am.

At the time of its writing, private respondent had not perfected its ownership of the land to be able to qualify as a sales applicant. Besides, although he was a party to the July 7, 1948 Agreement to Sell, Mear was not a signatory to the Deed of Relinquishment or to the December 7, 1948 Agreement to Sell. Thus, he cannot be expected to know the existence of and the amendments to the later contracts.

Dans. Petitioner also posits that Public Land Inspector Sulpicio A. Taeza irregularly received the copies for both private respondent and the city treasurer of Butuan City. The lack of notice for petitioner can be easily explained. Plainly, petitioner was not entitled to said notice of award from the Director of Lands, because by then, he had already relinquished his rights to the disputed land in favor of private respondent. In the heading of the order, he was referred to as sales applicant-assignor. In paragraph number 4, the order stated that, on August 16, 1950, he relinquished his rights to the land subject of the award to private respondent. From such date, the sales application was considered to be a matter between the Bureau of Lands and private respondent only. Considering these facts, the failure to give petitioner a copy of the notice of the award cannot be considered as suppression of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Furthermore, this order was in fact available to petitioner and had been referred to by him since January 31, 1974 when he filed his protest with the Bureau of Lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Issue: Private Respondent Qualified</span> <br><br>for an Award of Public Land<br><br>Petitioner asserts that private respondent was legally disqualified from acquiring the parcels of land in question because it was not authorized by its charter to acquire disposable public agricultural lands under Sections 121, 122 and 123 of the Public Land Act, prior to its amendment by P.D. No. 763. We disagree. The requirements for a sales application under the Public Land Act are: (1) the possession of the qualifications required by said Act (under Section 29) and (2) the lack of the disqualifications mentioned therein (under Sections 121, 122, and 123). However, the transfer of ownership via the two agreements dated July 7 and December 7, 1948 and the relinquishment of rights, being private contracts, were binding only between petitioner and private respondent. The Public Land Act finds no relevance because the disputed land was covered by said Act only after the issuance of the order of award in favor of private respondent. Thus, the possession of any disqualification by private respondent under said Act is immaterial to the private contracts between the parties thereto. (We are not, however, suggesting a departure from the rule that laws are deemed written in contracts.) Consideration of said provisions of the Act will further show their inapplicability to these contracts. Section 121 of the Act pertains to acquisitions of public land by a corporation from a grantee, but petitioner never became a grantee of the disputed land. On the other hand, private respondent itself was the direct grantee. Sections 122 and 123 disqualify corporations, which are not authorized by their charter, from acquiring public land; the records do not show that private respondent was not so authorized under its charter.<br><br>Also, the determination by the Director of Lands and the Minister of Natural Resources of the qualification of private respondent to become an awardee or grantee under the Act is persuasive on Respondent Court. In Espinosa vs. Makalintal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court ruled that, by law, the powers of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources regarding the disposition of public lands -- including the approval, rejection, and reinstatement of applications – are of executive and administrative nature. (Such powers, however, do not include the judicial power to decide controversies arising from disagreements in civil or contractual relations between the litigants.) Consequently, the determination of whether private respondent is qualified to become an awardee of public land under C.A. 141 by sales application is included therein.<br><br>All told, the only disqualification that can be imputed to private respondent is the prohibition in the 1973 Constitution against the holding of alienable lands of the public domain by corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> However, this Court earlier settled the matter, ruling that said constitutional prohibition had no retroactive effect and could not prevail over a vested right to the land. In Ayog vs. Cusi, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>“We hold that the said constitutional prohibition has no retroactive application to the sales application of Biñan Development Co., Inc. because it had already acquired a vested right to the land applied for at the time the 1973 Constitution took effect.<br><br>That vested right has to be respected. It could not be abrogated by the new Constitution. Section 2, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution allows private corporations to purchase public agricultural lands not exceeding one thousand and twenty-four hectares. Petitioner’s prohibition action is barred by the doctrine of vested rights in constitutional law.<br><br>‘A right is vested when the right to enjoyment has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present interest.’ (16 C.J.S. 1173). It is ‘the privilege to enjoy property legally vested, to enforce contracts, and enjoy the rights of property conferred by existing law’ (12 C.J. 955, Note 46, No. 6) or ‘some right or interest in property which has become fixed and established and is no longer open to doubt or controversy’ (Downs vs. Blount, 170 Fed. 15, 20, cited in Balboa vs. Farrales, 51 Phil. 498, 502).<br><br>The due process clause prohibits the annihilation of vested rights. ‘A state may not impair vested rights by legislative enactment, by the enactment or by the subsequent repeal of a municipal ordinance, or by a change in the constitution of the State, except in a legitimate exercise of the police power’ (16 C.J.S. 1177-78).<br><br>It has been observed that, generally, the term ‘vested right’ expresses the concept of present fixed interest, which in right reason and natural justice should be protected against arbitrary State action, or an innately just an imperative right which an enlightened free society, sensitive to inherent and irrefragable individual rights, cannot deny (16 C.J.S. 1174, Note 71, No. 5, citing Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc. vs. Rosenthal, 192 Atl. 2nd 587).<br><br>Secretary of Justice Abad Santos in his 1973 opinion ruled that where the applicant, before the Constitution took effect, had fully complied with all his obligations under the Public Land Act in order to entitle him to a sales patent, there would seem to be no legal or equitable justification for refusing to issue or release the sales patent (p. 254, Rollo).<br><br>In Opinion No. 140, series of 1974, he held that as soon as the applicant had fulfilled the construction or cultivation requirements and has fully paid the purchase price, he should be deemed to have acquired by purchase the particular tract of land and to him the area limitation in the new Constitution would not apply.<br><br>In Opinion No. 185, series of 1976, Secretary Abad Santos held that where the cultivation requirements were fulfilled before the new Constitution took effect but the full payment of the price was completed after January 17, 1973, the applicant was, nevertheless, entitled to a sales patent (p. 256, Rollo).<br><br>Such a contemporaneous construction of the constitutional prohibition by a high executive official carries great weight and should be accorded much respect. It is a correct interpretation of section 11 of Article XIV.<br><br>In the instant case, it is incontestable that prior to the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution the right of the corporation to purchase the land in question had become fixed and established and was no longer open to doubt or controversy.<br><br>Its compliance with the requirements of the Public Land Law for the issuance of a patent had the effect of segregating the said land from the public domain. The corporation’s right to obtain a patent for that land is protected by law. It cannot be deprived of that right without due process (Director of Lands vs. CA, 123 Phil. 919).”</blockquote><br><br>The Minister of Natural Resources ruled, and we agree, that private respondent was similarly qualified to become an awardee of the disputed land because its rights to it vested prior to the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“Lastly, appellee has acquired a vested right to the subject area and, therefore, is deemed not affected by the new constitutional provision that no private corporation may hold alienable land of the public domain except by lease.<br><br>It may be recalled that the Secretary of Justice in his Opinion No. 64, series of 1973, had declared, to wit:</blockquote><br><br>‘On the other hand, with respect to sales application ready for issuance of sales patent, it is my opinion that where the applicant had, before, the constitution took effect, fully complied with all his obligations under the Public Land act in order to entitle him to sales patent, there would seem to be not legal or equitable justification for refusing to issue or release the sales patent.’<br><br><blockquote>Implementing the aforesaid Opinion No. 64 xxx, the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources issued a memorandum, dated February 18, 1974, which pertinently reads as follows:</blockquote><br><br>‘In the implementation of the foregoing opinion, sales application of private individuals covering areas in excess of 24 hectares and those of corporations, associations, or partnership which fall under any of the following categories shall be given due course and issued patents, to wit:<br><br>Sales application for fishponds and for agricultural purposes (SFA, SA and IGPSA) wherein prior to January 17, 1973,<br><br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the land covered thereby was awarded;<br><br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultivation requirements of law were complied with as shown by investigation reports submitted prior to January 17, 1973;<br><br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land was surveyed and survey returns already submitted to the Director of Lands for verification and approval; and<br><br>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purchase price was fully paid.‘<br><br><blockquote>From the records, it is evident that the aforestated requisites have been complied with by appellee long before January 17, 1973, the effectivity of the New Constitution. To restate, the disputed area was awarded to appellee on August 17, 1950, the purchase price was fully paid on July 26, 1951, the cultivation requirements were complied with as per investigation report dated December 31, 1949, and the land was surveyed under Pls-97.”</blockquote><br><br>The same finding was earlier made by the Director of Lands:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“It is further contended by Villaflor that Nasipit has no juridical personality to apply for the purchase of public lands for agricultural purposes. The records clearly show, however, that since the execution of the deed of relinquishment of August 16, 1950, in favor of Nasipit, Villaflor has always considered and recognized Nasipit as having the juridical personality to acquire public lands for agricultural purposes. In the deed of relinquishment xxx, it is stated:</blockquote><br><br>‘6. That the Nasipit Lumber Co., Inc., a corporation duly organized in accordance with the laws of the Philippines, x x x.’<br><br><blockquote>Even this Office had not failed to recognize the juridical personality of Nasipit to apply for the purchase of public lands xxx when it awarded to it the land so relinquished by Villaflor (Order of Award dated August 17, 1950) and accepted its application therefor. At any rate, the question whether an applicant is qualified to apply for the acquisition of public lands is a matter between the applicant and this Office to decide and which a third party like Villaflor has no personality to question beyond merely calling the attention of this Office thereto.”</blockquote><br><br>Needless to say, we also agree that the November 8, 1946 Lease Agreement between petitioner and private respondent had been terminated by the agreements to sell and the relinquishment of rights. By the time the verbal leases were allegedly made in 1951 and 1955,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the disputed land had already been acquired and awarded to private respondent.
