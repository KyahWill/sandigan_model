				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The late Doña Demetria Cacho applied for the registration of two
parcels of land situated in what was then Lanao, Moro Province. Both parcels
were within the limits of Military Reservation No. 43, known as "Camp
Overton".</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions were docketed as GLRO Record No. 6908 &amp; 6909
and were jointly tried and decided by Judge Jesse Jorge on December 10, 1912.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the said decision, which was affirmed <i>in toto</i> by this
Court in Cacho <i>vs</i>. Government of the United States (28 Phil. 616 [1914])
the trial court made the following pronouncements:</p>

<blockquote><u>Re: Case No. 6908<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The parcel object of Case No. 6908 is
small. It was purchased by the applicant, Doña Demetria Cacho y Soriano from
Gabriel Salzos. The title of Gabriel Salzos is founded on a deed of sale in his
favor, executed and signed by a Moro woman named Alanga, who acted for her
husband, a Moro named Dorondon. It appears that the husband of Alanga, Datto
Dorondon is alive yet and before admitting this parcel to registration, it is
ordered that a deed from Dorondon be presented, renouncing all his rights in
the small parcel of land object of Case No. 6908. It is further ordered that
the applicant present the corresponding deed from Datto Dorondon on or before
March 30, 1913.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Re: Case No. 6909<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The parcel of land claimed by the
applicant in Case No. 6909 is the larger of two parcels and contains 37.87
hectares or more than 90 acres. This was purchased by the applicant from the
Moro Datto Bunglay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Datto Bunglay claims to have acquired part
of it by inheritance from his uncle Datto Anandog who died without issue and
the balance by his own possession and cultivation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A tract of land 37 hectares in area, is
larger than is cultivated by the Christian Filipinos. In the Zamboanga
cadastral case of thousands of parcels now on trial before this court, the
average size of the parcels is not above 3 or 4 hectares, and the court doubts
very much if a Moro with all his family could cultivate as extensive a parcel
of land as the one in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court therefore finds that the applicant
Doña Demetria Cacho is owner of the portion of land occupied and planted by the
deceased Datto Anandog in the southern part of the large parcel object of
expediente No. 6909 only; and her application as to all the rest of the land
solicited in said case is denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the 8th day of December, the court was
at Camp Overton and had another ocular inspection for the purpose of fixing the
limits of the part cultivated by Datto Anandog. The court set stakes marking
the N.E., S.E., &amp; N.W. corners of the land found to have been cultivated by
Anandog.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And it is ordered that the new survey be
made in accordance with the points mentioned. It is further ordered that one
half of the costs of the new survey be paid by the applicant and the other half
by the Government of the United States.<span style="font-family: Symbol;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Re: Cases 6908 &amp; 6909<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Final decision in these cases is reserved
until the presentation of the said deed and the new plan.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 29, 1978, Teofilo Cacho, herein petitioner, as the son
and sole heir of the late Doña Demetria Cacho, filed a petition for
reconstitution of two original certificates of title under Republic Act 26, and
docketed under the original GLRO Record No. 6908 and 6909.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was opposed by herein respondents Republic of the
Philippines, National Steel Corporation (NSC), and the City of Iligan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for judgment on demurrer to evidence filed
by the Republic and the NSC, the lower court dismissed the petition because it
found the evidence inadequate to show the prior existence of the titles sought
to be restored. The same order stated further that the proper remedy was for
the reconstitution of decrees since it is undisputed that in Cases No. 6908 and
6909, Decrees No. 10364 and 18969, respectively, were already issued. The same
trial court specifically found that since the decrees had, in fact, been
issued, the judgment of this Court in Cacho <i>vs</i>. U.S., <i>supra</i>,
although by itself expressly dependent upon some conditions, must have
indisputably become final.<span style="font-family: Symbol;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioner filed an omnibus motion for leave of court to
file and to admit amended petition, but this was denied. Petitioner elevated
the matter to this Court (docketed as Teofilo Cacho <i>vs</i>. Hon. Manindiara
P. Mangotara, G.R. No. 85495) but we resolved to remand the case to the lower
court, ordering the latter to accept the amended petition and to hear it as one
for re-issuance of decrees under the following guidelines:</p>

<blockquote>Considering the doctrines in Sta. Ana
vs. Menla, 1 SCRA 1297 (1961) and Heirs of Cristobal Marcos vs. de Banuvar, 25
SCRA 315 (1968), and the lower court findings that the decrees had in fact been
issued, the omnibus motion should have been heard as a motion to re-issue the
decrees in order to have a basis for the issuance of the titles and the
respondents being heard in their opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the foregoing, we resolve to
order the lower court to accept the amended petition subject to the private
respondents being given the opportunity to answer and to present their defenses.
The evidence already on record shall be allowed to stand but opportunity to
controvert existing evidence shall be given the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 59, <i>Rollo</i>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the lower court accepted the amended petition and heard it
as one for re-issuance of the decrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their "Consolidated Answer and/or Opposition" to the
amended petition, respondents Republic of the Philippines and NSC raised the
defenses that the petition suffered from jurisdictional infirmities; that
petitioner was not the real party in interest; that petitioner was guilty of
laches; that Demetria Cacho was not the registered owner of the subject parcels
of land; that no decrees covering the properties were ever issued in the name
of Demetria Cacho; and that the issuance of the decrees was dubious and
irregular.<span style="font-family: Symbol;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 9, 1993, the lower court (RTC-City of Iligan, Branch 1)
rendered its decision decreeing the reconstitution and re-issuance of Decrees
No. 10364 and 18969. The pertinent portion of the said decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>The third issue is whether sufficient
legal and factual basis exist for the issuance of the subject decrees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court has already ruled that Decrees
Nos. 10364 and 18959 were issued in these LRC Cases Nos. 6908 and 6909,
respectively, and that the issuance of the decrees presupposed a prior judgment
that had already become final. Oppositors never disputed the cited
pronouncements and therefore these should now be considered final and
conclusive</blockquote>

<blockquote>In fine, the Land Registration Commission
(now) National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration (NALTDRA),
through its then Acting Commissioner Santiago M. Kapunan, its Deputy Clerk of
Court III, the Head Geodetic Engineer, and the Chief of Registration, all
certified that according to the Record Book of Decrees for Ordinary Land
Registration Case, Decree No. 18969 was issued in GLRO Record No. 6909 and
Decree No. 10364 was issued in GLRO Record No. 6908. (Exhibits "C",
"D", "E" and "M").</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the manifestation submitted by the then
Acting LRC Commissioner Santiago Kapunan in compliance with an order of this
Court, confirmed that the proceedings undertaken by the LRC in the original
petition for reconstitution have been regularly and properly done based on
existing records; that Decrees 10364 and 18969 have been issued and recorded in
LRC's Record Book of Decrees; that the plan and technical description of the
lots involved were found to be correct, approved by the LRC and transmitted to
this Court, (Exh. "M").</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Record also is the decision in the
Military Reservation Nos. 43 and 63 in which this Court affirmed the issuance
of Decrees Nos. 10364 and 18969 in the name of Demetria Cacho.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the testimony by way of
deposition of one Ricardo A. Arandilla, Deputy Clerk of Court of the LRC which
identified and validated the report of the LRC to this Court on the present
petition, (Exh. "M"), shows that the decrees registry of the LRC had
recorded the fact and date of issuance of Decrees No. 10364 and 18969 in GLRO
Rec. No. 6908 and 6909 and the approval of the plans and corresponding
technical descriptions of the lots involved in the aforesaid record numbers and
decrees (Exh. "T").<span style="font-family: Symbol;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is worthy to note that on
cross-examination by Oppositors' counsel, Arandilla produced for scrutiny the
LRC Registry Book of Ordinary Registration Cases, which contained therein the
entries showing that Decree No. 10364 was issued on May 9, 1913 in Case No.
6908 and Decree No. 18969 was issued on July 7, 1915 in Case No. 6909. (Exhs.
"T", "P" and "19").</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing environmental facts, the
Court finds that the existence of the decrees have been established
sufficiently and indubitably by the evidence submitted by the petitioner, and
therefore, said amended petition has to be granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises
considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  The amended petition is hereby granted and approved. Declaring Decrees
No. 10364 and No. 18969 as reconstituted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Ordering the National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration
(NALTDRA), (formerly Land Registration Commission) to reissue Decrees No. 19364
and No. 16869 existing at the LRC Registry Book of Ordinary Registration Cases
in the name of Demetria Cacho upon payment by the petitioner of the required
legal fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 62-65, <i>Rollo</i>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the aforesaid decision, respondents appealed to the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the Philippines and the National Steel
Corporation in their joint brief assigned the following errors:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals sustained the validity of the proceedings
below and brushed aside respondents' claim of jurisdictional infirmities. It
also acknowledged the issuance and existence of the registration decrees in
favor of Demetria Cacho, to wit: </p>

<blockquote>As to the second issue, we can not do
otherwise but hold that Decree Nos. 10364 and 18969 were issued in GLRO Record
No. 6908 and GLRO Record No. 6909, on May 9, 1913 and July 8, 1915,
respectively, according to the Record Book of Decrees for Ordinary Land
Registration Case. Then Acting Commissioner of the Land Registration Commission
Santiago M. Kapunan (now Justice of the Supreme Court), submitted a
Manifestation, dated November 2, 1978, in compliance with an order at the lower
court, confirming that the plan and technical description of the land involving
both Lots 1 and 2 were correct, that said lots are decreed properties, and that
all the proceedings undertaken by the LRC were regularly done based on existing
records.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 49-50, <i>Rollo</i>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision
of the lower court and dismissed the petition for re-issuance of Decrees No.
10364 and 18969, with prejudice, for the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>First. The decision of the Supreme Court in Cacho <i>vs</i>.
Government of the United States on December 10, 1914, now appearing in 28 Phil.
617, regarding GLRO Record Nos. 6908 and 6909, denied in part and granted in
part the application for adjudication and registration of the two parcels of
land of Demetria Cacho, appellee's predecessor-in-interest. Final decision on
the cases was reserved pending compliance with conditions set forth therein.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 25.5pt 0.1in 22.5pt; text-indent: 22.5pt;">1.)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Re:
Case 6908, "x x x before admitting this parcel to registration, it is
ordered that a deed from Dorondon . . . be presented, renouncing all his rights
in the small parcel of land object of Case No. 6908" (28 Phil. 629).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 25.5pt 0.1in 22.5pt; text-indent: 22.5pt;">2.)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Re:
Case No. 6909, "the parcel of land claimed by the applicant in Case No.
6909 is the larger of two parcels and contains 37.87 hectares . . . (28 Phil.
619). The court therefore finds that the applicant Doña Demetria Cacho is owner
of the portion of land occupied and planted by the deceased Datto Anandog <u>in
the southern part of the large parcel object of expediente No. 6909 only; and
her application as to all the rest of the land solicited in said case is
denied."</u> (28 Phil. 629) On the 8th day of December, the court was at
Camp Overton and had another ocular inspection for the purpose of fixing the
limits of the part cultivated by Datto Anandog . . . with previous notice to
the applicant and her husband and representative Señor Vidal. Having arrived
late, Señor Vidal did not assist in the ocular inspection . . . But the court,
nevertheless, set stakes marking the N.E., S.E., and N.W. corners of the land
found to have been cultivated by the deceased Anandog" (28 Phil. 630);
"<u>And it is ordered that the new survey be made in accordance with the
points mentioned</u> . . ." (28 Phil. 630).</p>

<blockquote>The Court notes that the plan and technical description
referred to in the Manifestation dated November 2, 1978 of the Acting
Commissioner of the Land Registration Commission and the plan submitted by
Demetria Cacho in Case No. 6909 are the same as to the area, which is 37.87
hectares, and as to the date of approval, which is November 15, 1910. Since the
Supreme Court decision in Cacho vs. US "ordered that the new survey be
made in accordance with the points mentioned"; that applicant Demetria
Cacho is owner only of the portion of land occupied and planted by the deceased
Datto Anandog; and that her application as to all the rest of the land
solicited in case No. 6909 is denied, it follows that the new survey, if it was
made, must have a smaller area and a later date of approval.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it is, although there is proof that Decree No. 18969 was
issued in GLRO No. 6909, re-issuance of the decree cannot be made in the
absence of the "new survey" on which to base the area and technical
description of the parcel of land in Case No. 6909.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second. While a person may not acquire title to registered
property through continuous adverse possession, in derogation of the title of
the original registered owner, the heir of the latter, however, may lose his
right to recover back the possession of such property and the title thereto, by
reason of laches.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to appellee, appellants failed to prove:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any conduct on
their part that would have impelled appellee to act earlier;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that they were
misled by appellee's inaction into believing that appellee would not assert the
right on which he bases his suit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the nature of
extent of injury or prejudice that would accrue to them in the event that
relief is accorded to the appellee or that the suit is not held barred; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>d.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that their
claims fall within the metes and bounds of the property covered by the decree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The above need not be proven by appellants. Under the
Regalian doctrine, all lands of whatever classification belong to the state.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rule applies even to privately owned unregistered lands
which, unless the contrary is shown, are presumed to be public lands, under the
principle that all "lands belong to the Crown which have not been granted
by (the King), or in his name, or by the kings who preceded him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, petitioner failed to establish his identity and
existence and that he is a real party interest. To qualify a person to be a
real party in interest in whose name an action must be prosecuted, he must
appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having been denied, he
filed the present petition because allegedly, the Court of Appeals decided
questions of substance in a way not in accord with the law and applicable
decisions of this Court:</p>

<blockquote>First: Respondent Court of Appeals erroneously embarked upon a reopening
of Decree Nos. 10364 and 18969 issued on May 9, 1913 and July 8, 1915,
respectively, when it required proof of compliance with conditions for their
issuance. These conditions are conclusively presumed to have been complied with
before the original decrees were issued and can no longer be inquired into.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second: Respondent Court of Appeals contravened settled and
standing doctrines pronounced in Sta. Ana <i>v</i>. Menla, 1 SCRA 1297 and
Heirs of Cristobal Marcos <i>v</i>. de Banuvar, 25 SCRA 315, when it applied laches
as a bar to the reissuance of decrees.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Third: Respondent Court of Appeals ignored standing decisions of
this Honorable Court when it applied laches despite the total absence of proof
to establish the requisite elements for its application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fourth: Respondent Court of Appeals erroneously applied the
"Regalian doctrine" to dispense with proof of the essential elements
of laches.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fifth: Respondent Court of Appeals abjured the judicial responsibility
to uphold the stability and integrity of the Torrens system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixth: Respondent Court of Appeals ignored uncontroverted proof on
the identity and existence of petitioner and allowed itself to be swayed by
wild and gratuitous allusions to the contrary.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 328.5pt;">(pp. 21-22, <i>Rollo</i>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition having been given due course and the parties having
filed their respective memoranda, we shall now resolve the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We vote to grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">A land registration proceeding is "<i>in rem</i>," and,
therefore, the decree of registration is binding upon and conclusive against
all persons including the Government and its branches, irrespective of whether
or not they were personally notified of the filing of the application for
registration or have appeared and filed an answer to said application, because
all persons are considered as notified by the publication required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, a decree of registration that has become final shall
be deemed conclusive not only on the questions actually contested and determined
but also upon all matters that might be litigated or decided in the land
registration proceedings. With the certification duly issued by the then Land
Registration Commission, now National Land Titles and Deeds Registration
Administration (NALTDRA), through then Acting Commissioner Santiago M. Kapunan
(now a distinguished member of this Court), its Deputy Clerk of Court III, the
Head Geodetic Engineer, and the Chief of Registration, the lower court and the
Court of Appeals correctly found there is no doubt that decrees of registration
had in fact been issued in the case at bench. It is likewise beyond dispute
that such decrees attained finality upon the lapse of one year from entry
thereof. To allow the final decrees to once again be subject to the conditions
set forth in the 1914 case of Cacho <i>vs</i>. U.S. would be tantamount to
setting aside the decrees which cannot be reopened after the lapse of one year
from the entry thereof (Lapore <i>vs</i>. Pascual, 107 Phil. 695 [1960]). Such
action would definitely run counter to the very purpose of the Torrens System.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, to sustain the Court of Appeals ruling as regards
requiring petitioners to fulfill the conditions set forth in Cacho <i>vs</i>.
U.S. would constitute a derogation of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>.
Significantly, the issuance of the subject decrees presupposes a prior final
judgment because the issuance of such decrees is a mere ministerial act on part
of the Land Registration Commission (now the NALTDRA), upon presentation of a
final judgment. It is also worth noting that the judgment in Cacho <i>vs</i>.
U.S. could not have acquired finality without the prior fulfillment of the
conditions in GLRO Record No. 6908, the presentation of the corresponding deed
of sale from Datto Dorondon on or before March 30, 1913 (upon which Decree No.
10364 was issued on May 9, 1913); and in GLRO Record No. 6909, the presentation
of a new survey per decision of Judge Jorge on December 10, 1912 and affirmed
by this Court on December 10, 1914 (upon which Decree No. 18969 was issued on July
8, 1915).</p>

<p class="BODY">Requiring the submission of a new plan as a condition for the
re-issuance of the decree would render the finality attained by the Cacho <i>vs</i>.
U.S. case nugatory, thus, violating the fundamental rule regarding <i>res
judicata</i>. It must be stressed that the judgment and the resulting decree
are <i>res judicata</i>, and these are binding upon the whole world, the
proceedings being in the nature of proceedings in <i>rem</i>. Besides, such a
requirement is an impermissible assault upon the integrity and stability of the
Torrens System of registration because it also effectively renders the decree
inconclusive. </p>

<p class="BODY">As to the issue of laches, suffice it to state that the settled
doctrine in this jurisdiction is that laches cannot bar the issuance of a
decree. The reason therefor may be gleaned from Sta. Ana <i>vs</i>. Menla (1
SCRA 1294 [1961]):</p>

<blockquote>. . . This provision of the Rules (Sec. 6, Rule 39) refers
to civil actions and is not applicable to special proceedings, such as a land
registration case. This is so because a party in a civil action must
immediately enforce a judgment that is secured against the adverse party, and
his failure to act to enforce the same within a reasonable time as provided in
the Rules makes the decision unenforceable against the losing party. In special
proceedings the purpose is to establish a status, condition or fact; in land
registration proceedings, the ownership of a parcel of land is sought to be
established. After the ownership has been proved and confirmed by judicial
declaration, no further proceeding to enforce said ownership is necessary,
except when the adverse or losing party had been in possession of the land and
the winning party desires to oust him therefrom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . There is nothing in the law that limits the period
within which the court may order or issue a decree. The reason is . . . that
the judgment is merely declaratory in character and does not need to be
asserted or enforced against the adverse party. Furthermore, the issuance of a
decree is a ministerial duty both of the judge and of the Land Registration
Commission ...<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was held in Heirs of Cristobal Marcos <i>v</i>. de
Banuver (25 SCRA 316 [1968]) that a final decision in land registration cases
can neither be rendered inefficacious by the statute of limitations nor by
laches. This was reiterated in Vda. De Barroga <i>vs</i>. Albano (157 SCRA 131
[1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, anent the issue of identity and existence of petitioner
and his being a real party in interest, records show that petitioner has
sufficiently established his existence and identity as well as his legal
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">By an Affidavit of Adjudication as sole heir of Demetria Cacho,
the property in question were adjudicated in favor of petitioner under Doc.
1355, Page 128, Series of 1985 of the Consulate General of the Philippines in
Chicago. The fact of adjudication of the estate of Demetria Cacho was published
in the Times Journal. Petitioner also appeared personally before Vice Consul
Stephen V. David of the Philippine Consulate General of the Republic of the
Philippines in Chicago and executed a Special Power of Attorney in favor of
Atty. Godofredo Cabildo to represent him in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The execution of public documents, as in the case of the
Affidavit of Adjudication, is entitled to a presumption of regularity and proof
is required to assail and controvert the same. Thus, the burden of proof rests
upon him who alleges the contrary and respondents cannot shift the burden to
petitioner by merely casting doubt as to his existence and his identity without
presenting preponderant evidence to controvert such presumption. With more
reason shall the same rule apply in the case of the Special Power of Attorney
duly sworn before the Philippine Consulate General of the Republic of the
Philippines in Chicago, the act of the administering oath being of itself a
performance of duty by a public official.</p>
