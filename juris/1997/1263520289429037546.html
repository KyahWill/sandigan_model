				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The two petitions before us raise a common question: How long is the term of office of barangay chairmen and other barangay officials who were elected to their respective offices on the second Monday of May 1994? Is it three years, as provided by RA 7160 (the Local Government Code) or five years, as contained in RA 6679? Contending that their term is five years, petitioners ask this Court to order the cancellation of the scheduled barangay election this coming May 12, 1997 and to reset it to the second Monday of May, 1999.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">The Antecedents</i><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 127116</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><br>In his capacity as barangay chairman of Barangay 77, Zone 7, Kalookan City and as president of the Liga ng mga Barangay sa Pilipinas, Petitioner Alex L. David filed on December 2, 1996 a petition for prohibition docketed in this Court as G.R. No. 127116, under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, to prohibit the holding of the barangay election scheduled on the second Monday of May 1997. On January 14, 1997, the Court resolved to require the respondents to comment on the petition within a non-extendible period of fifteen days ending on January 29, 1997.<br><br>On January 29, 1997, the Solicitor General filed his four-page Comment siding with petitioner and praying that “the election scheduled on May 12, 1997 be held in abeyance.” Respondent Commission on Elections filed a separate Comment, dated February 1, 1997 opposing the petition. On February 11, 1997, the Court issued a Resolution giving due course to the petition and requiring the parties to file simultaneous memoranda within a non-extendible period of twenty days from notice. It also requested former Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to act as amicus curiae and to file a memorandum also within a non-extendible period of twenty days. It noted but did not grant petitioner’s Urgent Motion for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated January 31, 1997 (as well as his Urgent Ex-Parte Second Motion to the same effect, dated March 6, 1997). Accordingly, the parties filed their respective memoranda. The Petition for Leave to Intervene filed on March 17, 1997 by Punong Barangay Rodson F. Mayor was denied as it would just unduly delay the resolution of the case, his interest like those of all other barangay officials being already adequately represented by Petitioner David who filed this petition as “president of the Liga ng mga Barangay sa Pilipinas.”<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 128039</span><br></div><br>On February 20, 1997, Petitioner Liga ng mga Barangay Quezon City Chapter represented by its president Bonifacio M. Rillon filed a petition, docketed as G.R. No. 128039, “to seek a judicial review by certiorari to declare as unconstitutional:<br><br>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 43(c) of R.A. 7160 which reads as follows:<br><br>‘(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term of office of barangay officials and members of the sangguniang kabataan shall be for three (3) years, which shall begin after the regular election of barangay officials on the second Monday of May 1994.’<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMELEC Resolution Nos. 2880 and 2887 fixing the date of the holding of the barangay elections on May 12, 1997 and other activities related thereto;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budgetary appropriation of P400 million contained in Republic Act No. 8250 otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act of 1997 intended to defray the costs and expenses in holding the 1997 barangay elections;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Comelec Resolution 2880,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> promulgated on December 27, 1996 and referred to above, adopted a “Calendar of Activities and List and Periods of Certain Prohibited Acts for the May 12, 1997 Barangay Elections.” On the other hand, Comelec Resolution 2887 promulgated on February 5, 1997 moved certain dates fixed in Resolution 2880.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Acting on the petition, the Court on February 25, 1997 required respondents to submit their comment thereon within a non-extendible period of ten days ending on March 7, 1997. The Court further resolved to consolidate the two cases inasmuch as they raised basically the same issue. Respondent Commission filed its Comment on March 6, 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and the Solicitor General, in representation of the other respondent, filed his on March 6, 1997. Petitioner’s Urgent Omnibus Motion for oral argument and temporary restraining order was noted but not granted. The petition was deemed submitted for resolution by the Court without need of memoranda.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Both petitions though worded differently raise the same ultimate issue: How long is the term of office of barangay officials?<br><br>Petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> contend that under Sec. 2 of Republic Act No. 6653, approved on May 6, 1988, “(t)he term of office of barangay officials shall be for five (5) years x x x.” This is reiterated in Republic Act No. 6679, approved on November 4, 1988, which reset the barangay elections from “the second Monday of November 1988” to March 28, 1989 and provided in Sec. 1 thereof that such five-year term shall begin on the “first day of May 1989 and ending on the thirty-first day of May 1994.” Petitioners further aver<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>that although Sec. 43 of RA 7160 reduced the term of office of all local elective officials to three years, such reduction does not apply to barangay officials because (1) RA 6679 is a special law applicable only to barangays while RA 7160 is a general law which applies to all other local government units; (2) RA 7160 does not expressly or impliedly repeal RA 6679 insofar as the term of barangay officials is concerned; (3) while Sec. 8 of Article X of the 1987 Constitution fixes the term of elective local officials at three years, the same provision states that the term of barangay officials “shall be determined by law”; and (4) thus, it follows that the constitutional intention is to grant barangay officials any term, except three years; otherwise, “there would be no rhyme or reason for the framers of the Constitution to except barangay officials from the three year term found in Sec. 8 (of) Article X of the Constitution.” Petitioners conclude (1) that the Commission on Elections committed grave abuse of discretion when it promulgated Resolution Nos. 2880 and 2887 because it “substituted its own will for that of the legislative and usurped the judicial function x x x by interpreting the conflicting provisions of Sec. 1 of RA 6679 and Sec. 43 (c) of RA 7160; and (2) that the appropriation of P400 million in the General Appropriation Act of 1997 (RA 8250) to be used in the conduct of the barangay elections on May 12, 1997 is itself unconstitutional and a waste of public funds.<br><br>The Solicitor General agrees with petitioners, arguing that RA 6679 was not repealed by RA 7160 and thus “he believes that the holding of the barangay elections (o)n the second Monday of May 1997 is without sufficient legal basis.”<br><br>Respondent Commission on Elections, through Chairman Bernardo P. Pardo, defends its assailed Resolutions and maintains that the repealing clause of RA 7160 includes “all laws, whether general or special, inconsistent with the provisions of the Local Government Code,” citing this Court’s dictum in Paras vs. Comelec<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that “the next regular election involving the barangay office is barely seven (7) months away, the same having been scheduled in May 1997.” Furthermore, RA 8250 (the General Appropriations Act for 1997) and RA 8189 (providing for a general registration of voters) both “indicate that Congress considered that the barangay elections shall take place in May, 1997, as provided for in RA 7160, Sec. 43 (c).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Besides, petitioners cannot claim a term of more than three years since they were elected under the aegis of the Local Government Code of 1991 which prescribes a term of only three years. Finally, Respondent Comelec denies the charge of grave abuse of discretion stating that the “question presented x x x is a purely legal one involving no exercise of an act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>As amicus curiae, former Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr. urges the Court to deny the petitions because (1) the Local Autonomy Code repealed both RA 6679 and 6653 “not only by implication but by design as well”; (2) the legislative intent is to shorten the term of barangay officials to three years; (3) the barangay officials should not have a term longer than that of their administrative superiors, the city and municipal mayors; and (4) barangay officials are estopped from contesting the applicability of the three-year term provided by the Local Government Code as they were elected under the provisions of said Code.<br><br>From the foregoing discussions of the parties, the Court believes that the issues can be condensed into three, as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which law governs the term of office of barangay officials: RA 7160 or RA 6679?<br><br>2.&nbsp; Is RA 7160 insofar as it shortened such term to only three years constitutional?<br><br>3.&nbsp; Are petitioners estopped from claiming a term other than that provided under RA 7160?<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The petitions are devoid of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief Historical Background of Barangay Elections</span><br></div><br>For a clear understanding of the issues, it is necessary to delve briefly into the history of barangay elections.<br><br>As a unit of government, the barangay antedated the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. The word “barangay” is derived from the Malay “balangay,” a boat which transported them (the Malays) to these shores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Quoting from Juan de Plasencia, a Franciscan missionary in 1577, Historian Conrado Benitez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> wrote that the barangay was ruled by a dato who exercised absolute powers of government. While the Spaniards kept the barangay as the basic structure of government, they stripped the dato or rajah of his powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Instead, power was centralized nationally in the governor general and locally in the encomiendero and later, in the alcalde mayor and the gobernadorcillo. The dato or rajah was much later renamed cabeza de barangay, who was elected by the local citizens possessing property. The position degenerated from a title of honor to that of a “mere government employee. Only the poor who needed a salary, no matter how low, accepted the post.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After the Americans colonized the Philippines, the barangays became known as “barrios.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> For some time, the laws governing barrio governments were found in the Revised Administrative Code of 1916 and later in the Revised Administrative Code of 1917.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Barrios were granted autonomy by the original Barrio Charter, RA 2370, and formally recognized as quasi-municipal corporations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup>by the Revised Barrio Charter, RA 3590. During the martial law regime, barrios were “declared” or renamed “barangays” -- a reversion really to their pre-Spanish names -- by PD. No. 86 and PD No. 557. Their basic organization and functions under RA 3590, which was expressly “adopted as the Barangay Charter,” were retained. However, the titles of the officials were changed to “barangay captain,” “barangay councilman,” “barangay secretary” and “barangay treasurer.”<br><br>Pursuant to Sec. 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 222,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> “a Punong Barangay (Barangay Captain) and six Kagawads ng Sangguniang Barangay (Barangay Councilmen), who shall constitute the presiding officer and members of the Sangguniang Barangay (Barangay Council) respectively” were first elected on May 17, 1982. They had a term of six years which began on June 7, 1982.<br><br>The Local Government Code of 1983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> also fixed the term of office of local elective officials at six years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Under this Code, the chief officials of the barangay were the punong barangay, six elective sangguniang barangay members, the kabataang barangay chairman, a barangay secretary and a barangay treasurer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>B.P. Blg. 881, the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> reiterated that barangay officials “shall hold office for six years,” and stated that their election was to be held “on the second Monday of May nineteen hundred and eighty eight and on the same day every six years thereafter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>This election scheduled by B.P. Blg. 881 on the second Monday of May 1988 was reset to “the second Monday of November 1988 and every five years thereafter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> by RA 6653. Under this law, the term of office of the barangay officials was cut to five years<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and the punong barangay was to be chosen from among themselves by seven kagawads, who in turn were to be elected at large by the barangay electorate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>But the election date set by RA 6653 on the second Monday of November 1988 was again “postponed and reset to March 28, 1989” by RA 6679,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and the term of office of barangay officials was to begin on May 1, 1989 and to end on May 31, 1994. RA 6679 further provided that “there shall be held a regular election of barangay officials on the second Monday of May 1994 and on the same day every five (5) years thereafter. Their term shall be for five years x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Significantly, the manner of election of the punong barangay was changed. Sec. 5 of said law ordained that while the seven kagawads were to be elected by the registered voters of the barangay, “(t)he candidate who obtains the highest number of votes shall be the punong barangay and in the event of a tie, there shall be a drawing of lots under the supervision of the Commission on Elections.”<br><br>Under the Local Government Code of 1991, RA 7160,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> several provisions concerning barangay officials were introduced:<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term of office was reduced to three years, as follows:<br><br>“SEC. 43. Term of Office. --<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term of office of barangay officials and members of the sangguniang kabataan shall be for three (3) years, which shall begin after the regular election of barangay officials on the second Monday of May, 1994” (Underscoring supplied.)<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of the Sangguniang Barangay and the manner of electing its officials were altered, inter alia, the barangay chairman was to be elected directly by the electorate, as follows:<br><br>SEC. 387. Chief Officials and Offices. -- (a) There shall be in each barangay a punong barangay, seven (7) sanggunian barangay members, the sanggunian kabataan chairman, a barangay secretary and a barangay treasurer.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>SEC. 390. Composition. -- The Sangguniang barangay, the legislative body of the barangay, shall be composed of the punong barangay as presiding officer, and the seven (7) regular sanguniang barangay members elected at large and the sanguniang kabataan chairman as members.”<br><br>SEC. 41. Manner of Election. -- (a) The x x x punong barangay shall be elected at large x x x by the qualified voters” in the barangay.” (Underscoring supplied.)<br><br>Pursuant to the foregoing mandates of the Local Autonomy Code, the qualified barangay voters actually voted for one punong barangay and seven (7) kagawads during the barangay elections held on May 9, 1994. In other words, the punong barangay was elected directly and separately by the electorate, and not by the seven (7) kagawads from among themselves.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The First Issue: Clear Legislative Intent and Design to Limit Term to Three Years</span><br></div><br>In light of the foregoing brief historical background, the intent and design of the legislature to limit the term of barangay officials to only three (3) years as provided under the Local Government Code emerges as bright as the sunlight. The cardinal rule in the interpretation of all laws is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the law.[30] And three years is the obvious intent.<br><br>First.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RA 7160, the Local Government Code, was enacted later than RA 6679. It is basic that in case of an irreconciliable conflict between two laws of different vintages, the later enactment prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Legis posteriores priores contrarias abrogant. The rationale is simple: a later law repeals an earlier one because it is the later legislative will. It is to be presumed that the lawmakers knew the older law and intended to change it. In enacting the older law, the legislators could not have known the newer one and hence could not have intended to change what they did not know. Under the Civil Code, laws are repealed only by subsequent ones --<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and not the other way around.<br><br>Under Sec. 43-c of RA 7160, the term of office of barangay officials was fixed at “three (3) years which shall begin after the regular election of barangay officials on the second Monday of May 1994.” This provision is clearly inconsistent with and repugnant to Sec. 1 of RA 6679 which states that such “term shall be for five years.” Note that both laws refer to the same officials who were elected “on the second Monday of May 1994.”<br><br>Second.&nbsp; RA 6679 requires the barangay voters to elect seven kagawads and the candidate obtaining the highest number of votes shall automatically be the punong barangay. RA 6653 empowers the seven elected barangay kagawads to select the punong barangay from among themselves. On the other hand, the Local Autonomy Code mandates a direct vote on the barangay chairman by the entire barangay electorate, separately from the seven kagawads. Hence, under the Code, voters elect eight barangay officials, namely, the punong barangay plus the seven kagawads. Under both RA 6679 and 6653, they vote for only seven kagawads, and not for the barangay chairman.<br><br>Third.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the barangay elections held on May 9, 1994 (second Monday), the voters actually and directly elected one punong barangay and seven kagawads. If we agree with the thesis of petitioners, it follows that all the punong barangays were elected illegally and thus, Petitioner Alex David cannot claim to be a validly elected barangay chairman, much less president of the national league of barangays which he purports to represent in this petition. It then necessarily follows also that he is not the real party-in-interest and on that ground, his petition should be summarily dismissed.<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In enacting the general appropriations act of 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Congress appropriated the amount of P400 million to cover expenses for the holding of barangay elections this year. Likewise, under Sec. 7 of RA 8189, Congress ordained that a general registration of voters shall be held “immediately after the barangay elections in 1997.” These are clear and express contemporaneous statements of Congress that barangay officials shall be elected this May, in accordance with Sec. 43-c of RA 7160.<br><br>Fifth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Paras vs. Comelec,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this Court said that “the next regular election involving the barangay office concerned is barely seven (7) months away, the same having been scheduled in May, 1997.” This judicial decision, per Article 8 of the Civil Code, is now a “part of the legal system of the Philippines.”<br><br>Sixth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners pompously claim that RA 6679, being a special law, should prevail over RA 7160, an alleged general law pursuant to the doctrine of generalia specialibus non derogant. Petitioners are wrong. RA 7160 is a codified set of laws that specifically applies to local government units. It specifically and definitively provides in its Sec. 43-c that “the term of office of barangay officials x x x shall be for three years.” It is a special provision that applies only to the term of barangay officials who were elected on the second Monday of May 1994. With such particularity, the provision cannot be deemed a general law. Petitioner may be correct in alleging that RA 6679 is a special law, but they are incorrect in stating (without however giving the reasons therefor) that RA 7160 is necessarily a general law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It is a special law insofar as it governs the term of office of barangay officials. In its repealing clause,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> RA 7160 states that “all general and special laws x x x which are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Code are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.” There being a clear repugnance and incompatibility between the two specific provisions, they cannot stand together. The later law, RA 7160, should thus prevail in accordance with its repealing clause. When a subsequent law encompasses entirely the subject matter of the former enactments, the latter is deemed repealed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup>[37]<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Second Issue: Three-Year Term Not Repugnant to Constitution</span><br></div><br>Sec. 8, Article X of the Constitution states:<br><br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “SEC. 8. The term of office of elective local officials, except barangay officials, which shall be determined by law, shall be three years, and no such official shall serve for more than three consecutive terms. Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time shall not be considered as an interruption in the continuity of his service for the full term for which he was elected.”</blockquote>Petitioner Liga ng mga Barangay Quezon City Chapter posits that by excepting barangay officials whose “term shall be determined by law” from the general provision fixing the term of “elective local officials” at three years, the Constitution thereby impliedly prohibits Congress from legislating a three-year term for such officers. We find this theory rather novel but nonetheless logically and legally flawed.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the Constitution did not expressly prohibit Congress from fixing any term of office for barangay officials. It merely left the determination of such term to the lawmaking body, without any specific limitation or prohibition, thereby leaving to the lawmakers full discretion to fix such term in accordance with the exigencies of public service. It must be remembered that every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> For a law to be nullified, it must be shown that there is a clear and unequivocal (not just implied) breach of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> To strike down a law as unconstitutional, there must be a clear and unequivocal showing that what the fundamental law prohibits, the statute permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The petitioners have miserably failed to discharge this burden and to show clearly the unconstitutionality they aver.<br><br>There is absolutely no doubt in our mind that Sec. 43-c of RA 7160 is constitutional. Sec. 8, Article X of the Constitution -- limiting the term of all elective local officials to three years, except that of barangay officials which “shall be determined by law” -- was an amendment proposed by Constitutional Commissioner (now Supreme Court Justice) Hilario G. Davide, Jr. According to Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., the amendment was “readily accepted without much discussion and formally approved.” Indeed, a search into the Record of the Constitutional Commission yielded only a few pages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of actual deliberations, the portions pertinent to the Constitutional Commission’s intent being the following:<br><br>“MR.

DAVIDE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam President, the voting that we had on the terms of office did not include the barangay officials because it was then the stand of the Chairman of the Committee on Local Governments that the term of barangay officials must be determined by law. So it is now for the law to determine whether the restriction on the number of reelections will be included in the Local Government Code.<br><br>MR. RODRIGO.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is up to Congress to decide.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>MR. RODRIGO.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted that clear in the record.”<br><br>Although the discussions in the Constitutional Commission were very brief, they nonetheless provide the exact answer to the main issue. To the question at issue here on how long the term of barangay officials is, the answer of the Commission was simple, clear and quick: “As may be determined by law”; more precisely, “(a)s provided for in the Local Autonomy Code.” And the Local Autonomy Code, in its Sec. 43-c, limits their term to three years.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Third Issue: Petitioners Estopped From Challenging Their Three-Year Terms</span><br></div><br>We have already shown that constitutionally, statutorily, logically, historically and commonsensically, the petitions are completely devoid of merit.

The Constitution and the laws do not support them. Extant jurisprudence militates against them. Reason and common sense reject them. Equity and morality abhor them. They are subtle but nonetheless self-serving propositions to lengthen governance without a mandate from the governed. In a democracy, elected leaders can legally and morally justify their reign only by obtaining the voluntary consent of the electorate. In this case however, petitioners propose to extend their terms not by seeking the people’s vote but by faulty legal argumentation. This Court cannot and will not grant its imprimatur to such untenable proposition. If they want to continue serving, they must get a new mandate in the elections scheduled on May 12, 1997.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petitions are <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED </span>for being completely devoid of merit.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., Padilla, Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Francisco, and Torres, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Vitug, J.,</i> concurs except that on the matter of estoppel he reserved his vote.<br><i>Hermosisima, Jr., J.,</i> on leave.<br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sen.
