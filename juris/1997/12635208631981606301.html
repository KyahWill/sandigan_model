				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"></p><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court to annul and set aside the resolution of the National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC) dated 28 November 1994 in NCR Case No.
00-08-0453-91 which affirmed the decision of labor arbiter Edgardo Madriaga
dated 18 February 1994 holding the strike held by GMA Channel 7 Employees Union
(GMAEU) on 2 August 1991 as illegal and declaring the fourteen (14) GMAEU union
officers who knowingly participated in the illegal strike to have lost their
employment status.<p></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that of the fourteen (14) GMAEU officers
involved in the strike, ten (10) officers did not appeal the labor arbiter’s
decision and opted to avail of the optional retirement benefits under the
collective bargaining agreement with private respondent Republic Broadcasting
System Inc. (RBS).  The remaining four
(4) union officers, namely: Mario Tiu, Nani Hayuhay, Bong Cerezo and Virgilio
Santoyo, appealed to the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the NLRC decision, Virgilio Santoyo filed a separate
petition for <i>certiorari</i> before this Court, docketed as G.R. No.
122613.  In a resolution dated 31
January 1996, the Court dismissed Santoyo’s petition “for failure to
sufficiently show that the respondent Commission (NLRC) had committed a grave
abuse of discretion in rendering the questioned judgment.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that Santoyo and herein petitioners were dismissed
under the same factual circumstance, the Court reviewed the records of G.R. No.
122613 to determine whether the ruling laid therein applies in the case at
bar.  The Court notes that the issues
raised by Santoyo in his petition were procedural in character.  Santoyo alleged that he was never
represented by counsel in the proceedings both before the labor arbiter and the
NLRC and was denied the opportunity to present his evidence.  This allegation, however, had no factual
basis as the records showed that he was represented by counsel during the
entire proceedings below.  In contrast,
the present petition raised substantive issues concerning the legality or
illegality of the strike conducted by GMAEU on 2 August 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court required both public and private respondents to file
their comment on the petition.  Private
respondent RBS filed its comment on 23 April 1996 and public respondent NLRC
filed its own comment on 9 December 1996.  Petitioners filed a reply to both comments on 4 March 1997.  Since the parties have exhaustively argued
their position in their respective pleadings, the Court dispensed with the
filing of memoranda and considered this case submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material and relevant facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">RBS had a collective bargaining agreement with GMAEU which took
effect on 2 July 1989.  After the first
quarter of 1991, RBS management noted the huge amount of overtime expense it
incurred during the said period, which averaged to <s>P</s>363,085.26
monthly.  To streamline its operations,
the president of RBS created a committee to formulate guidelines on the
availment of leaves and rendering of overtime work. </p>

<p class="BODY">  On 11 June 1991, RBS,
through its personnel department, furnished GMAEU a copy of the new guidelines
and requested the latter to comment thereon.  The union did not file any comment.  On 25 June 1991, RBS officially issued the implementing guidelines “on
the availment of leaves and rendering of overtime services.”  The following day, GMAEU sent a letter to
the president of RBS wherein it argued that:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union was not
consulted in the formulation of said guidelines which was clear violation under
Sec. 3(c) of the collective bargaining agreement;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guidelines would
render nugatory the collective bargaining agreement provisions on the same
subject;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The diminution of
benefits being enjoyed by all employees with respect to the mid-year bonuses
(from 2-1/2 months to 1-1/2 months constitutes a withdrawal of an existing
company policy).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, RBS management and GMAEU officials met on 3 July 1991
and on 10 July 1991 to thresh out the issues raised by GMAEU in its 26 June
1991 letter.  Both talks, however, were
short lived as the union refused to hold further talks with RBS.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 July 1991, GMAEU filed a Notice of Strike with the National
Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) based on unfair labor practices
allegedly committed by RBS, as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gross violation of the
existing collective bargaining agreement;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employees (members and
officers) coercion;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Union interference; and</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discrimination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NCMB set a conciliation meeting on 19 July 1991, but as early
as 16 July 1991 the Union held a strike vote among its members and submitted
the results thereof to the NCMB on 18 July 1991 which showed that majority of
the union members voted to go on strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the conciliation meeting held on 19 July 1991, RBS,
through counsel, informed GMAEU’s officers that RBS did not violate any
provision in the collective bargaining agreement since the issuance of the
guidelines was a management prerogative duly recognized in their
agreement.  As regards GMAEU’s charges
of coercion, union interference and discrimination, RBS argued that these alleged
unfair labor practices were neither raised by the union in its 26 June 1991
letter nor during their 3 July and 10 July 1991 talks. RBS’ counsel requested
GMAEU’s officers to name the persons or officers of RBS involved in the alleged
unfair labor practices and to state the specific act or acts complained of so
that RBS management could adequately refute said allegations or impose
appropriate disciplinary actions against its erring officers.  GMAEU’s officers, however, ignored both RBS’
and the labor conciliator’s requests for a bill of particulars.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a second conciliation meeting held on 25 July 1991, RBS
reiterated its request to GMAEU’s officers to furnish RBS the details of the
alleged unfair practices committed by RBS’ officers.  Again, the Union denied RBS’ request and refused to hold any further
talks with RBS management.  On the same
day, RBS filed a motion to dismiss GMAEU’s notice of strike and forewarned the
Union about the consequences of an illegal strike.  </p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 August 1991, the union struck.  On the same day, RBS filed a complaint for illegal strike and
unfair labor practice against GMAEU and its fourteen (14) officers (hereafter,
illegal strike case).  The case was
docketed as NLRC Case 00-08-04531-91.  Meanwhile, the Secretary of Labor immediately assumed jurisdiction over
the case, issued a return-to-work order, and certified the case to the NLRC for
compulsory arbitration (hereafter, certified case).  The case was docketed as NCMB-NCR-050-7-488-91.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the certified case, the labor arbiter found no factual and
legal ground to hold RBS guilty of unfair labor practices against the
Union.  On appeal (docketed as NLRC-NCR
CC No 00076-01), the NLRC affirmed the labor arbiter’s decision in a resolution
dated 31 July 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the labor arbiter continued to hear the illegal strike
case filed by RBS against GMAEU.  On 18
February 1994, the labor arbiter rendered judgment declaring the strike illegal
and the union officers who knowingly participated in the illegal strike to have
validly lost their employment status based on the following reasons:</p>

<p class="BODY">a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“The notice of strike
did not specifically charge the company (RBS) of unfair labor practices, only <i>pro
forma</i> allegations of gross violation of the collective bargaining
agreement, employees coercion, union interference, and discrimination”.  It is defective as it consisted of vague and
general charges which could not be substantiated and which the company could
not properly defend itself against.”</p>

<p class="BODY">b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“The absence of evidence
on record that the mandatory cooling-off period and strike vote under the law
were complied which renders the strike staged by the respondents illegal <i>per
se</i> on technical grounds.”</p>

<p class="BODY">c.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“On the merits x x x
there are no strikeable grounds as there was no bargaining deadlock between the
parties.  The alleged gross violation of
the collective bargaining agreement cannot constitute an unfair labor practice
because said charges were bereft of factual and legal basis.”  “There being no unfair labor practice, it follows
that there is no strikeable issue to support the strike conducted by herein
respondents (the Union).”</p>

<p class="BODY">d.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union violated the
no strike-no lockout clause of the CBA with RBS; thus rendering the strike held
on 2 August 1991 illegal.  As
aforementioned, the NLRC affirmed the labor arbiter’s decision in a resolution
dated 28 November 1994.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their petition, petitioner raised six (6) alleged NLRC errors
which ultimately narrow down to one issue-</p>

<p class="BODY">WHETHER OR NOT THE NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN
IT UPHELD THE LABOR ARBITER’S DECISION THAT PETITIONERS STAGED AN ILLEGAL
STRIKE ON 2 AUGUST 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that any defect in their <i>pro-forma</i>
notice of strike was cured when the NCMB took cognizance of the case and
conducted conciliation proceedings on 19 July and 25 July 1991.  In addition, upon assumption by the
Secretary of Labor of jurisdiction over the dispute and certification of the
same for compulsory arbitration, it is presumed that the union had complied
with the procedural requirements under the labor code for a valid notice of
strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the alleged unfair labor practices committed by RBS,
petitioners assert that this issue was thoroughly discussed with sufficient
particularity in their position papers filed in the certified case and in the
illegal strike case; hence, “there notice of strike was sufficient in form and
in substance.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further argue that they believed in good faith that
RBS had committed acts of unfair labor practice which induced them to proceed
with the strike on 2 August 1991.  Since
it was an unfair labor practice strike, the no-strike clause in the collective
bargaining agreement with RBS does not apply.  They also showed good faith by their immediate compliance with the
return-to-work order issued by the Secretary of Labor upon assuming
jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent RBS refutes these arguments and asserts that
the factual findings of the labor arbiter and the NLRC, being supported by
substantial evidence, should be upheld by this Court.  This means that petitioners cannot invoke the protective mantle
of the good faith strike doctrine because the alleged issues in the notice of
strike were never substantiated by the union either before or during the
conciliation proceedings.  The union
violated the no strike clause under the collective bargaining agreement and
should be held accountable for their acts by considering them validly dismissed
from their employment with RBS.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the petition at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The notice of strike filed by the union before the NCMB on 12
July 1991 contained general allegations that RBS management committed unfair labor
practices by its gross violation of the economic provisions in their collective
bargaining agreement and by alleged acts of coercion, union interference and
discrimination which amounted to union busting.  It is the union, therefore, who had the burden of proof to
present substantial evidence to support these allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that prior to 12 July 1991, the union treated
RBS’ issuance of the “guidelines on the availment of leaves and rendering of
overtime services” as “gross” violations of the existing collective bargaining
agreement.  In its talks with the union,
RBS painstakingly explained that the said allegation was unfounded because the
issuance of said guidelines was RBS’ management prerogative.  Up to that point, the union never raised the
issue of unfair labor practices allegedly committed by RBS’ official under
Article 248 of the Labor Code.  But in
its notice of strike filed two days later, the union raised issues of coercion,
discrimination, and union interference for the first time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the union had two (2) conciliatory meetings
arranged by the NCMB <u>at</u> which it could have substantiated these
additional allegations.  However, the
fact that it had submitted the results of the strike vote even ahead of the
conciliatory meetings, and continuously refused to substantiate its allegations
in its notice of strike thereafter, lends credence to the NLRC’s observation
that these charges were indiscriminately hurled against RBS to give a semblance
of validity to its notice of strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Rule XIII Sec. 4 Book V of the Implementing Rules of the
Labor Code –</p>

<blockquote>“x x x x.  In cases of
unfair labor practices, the notice of strike <u>shall as far as practicable,
state the acts complained of and he efforts </u>to resolve the dispute
amicably.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Rule III Sec. 6 provides that –</p>

<p class="XXX">“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<blockquote>During the (conciliation) proceeding, the parties shall not do any
act which may disrupt or impede the early settlement of the dispute.  They are obliged, as part of their duty to
bargain collectively in good faith, <u>to participate fully and promptly</u> in
the conciliation meetings called by the regional branch of the board. x x x.”
(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners plead that their contemporaneous acts, reckoned from
their June 1991 letter to RBS up to the actual strike held on 2 August 1991,
were justified based on its honest belief that RBS was committing unfair labor
practices.  Stated otherwise, “the
presumption of legality (of the strike) prevails even if the allegations of
unfair labor practices are subsequently found out to be untrue.”  (citing Master Iron Labor Union <i>v.</i>
NLRC, 219 SCRA 47)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not unmindful of this rule, but in the case at bar
the facts and the evidence did not establish even at least a rational basis why
the union would wield a strike based on alleged unfair labor practices it did
not even bother to substantiate during the conciliation proceedings.  It is not enough that the union believed
that the employer committed acts of unfair labor practice when the
circumstances clearly negate even a <i>prima facie</i> showing to warrant such
a belief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court affirms the factual finding of the labor arbiter and
the NLRC that “there was no strikeable issue to support respondent’s (the
Union) subject strike.”  The evidence
show that the union anchored its position on alleged unfair labor practices in
order to evade not only the grievance machinery but also the no strike clause
in their collective bargaining agreement with RBS.</p>

<p class="BODY">RBS did not issue is implementing guidelines dated 24 June 1991
concerning the availment of leaves and rendering of overtime services in an
arbitrary manner.  The union was
promptly informed that RBS’ decision was based on its management prerogative to
regulate all aspects of employment, subject of course to well-defined
limitations imposed by law or by contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that in the issuance of said
guidelines RBS may have violated some provisions in the collective bargaining
agreement, there was no palpable showing that the same was a <u>flagrant</u>
and/<u>or malicious refusal to comply with its economic provisions</u>.  (Book V Implementing Rules of the Labor
Code, Rule XIII, Section 1)  Hence, the
law mandates that said violation “shall not be considered unfair labor practice
and shall not be strikeable.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The bottom line is that the union should have immediately
resorted to the grievance machinery established in their agreement with
RBS.  In disregarding said procedure the
union leaders who knowingly participated in the illegal strike “have acted
unreasonably, and, as such, the law cannot interpose its hand to protect them
from the consequences of their behavior.”  (National labor Union <i>v</i>. Philippine Match Factory, 70 Phil. 300;
United Seamen’s Union <i>v</i>. Davao Shipowner’s Association, 20 SCRA 1226)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby
