				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case is the derivative of G.R. No. 73794, which was decided by the Second Division of this Court on September 19, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The antecedents are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Petitioner EGMPC and private respondent NPUM entered into a Land Development Agreement dated October 6, 1976. Under the agreement, EGMPC was to develop a parcel of land owned by NPUM into a memorial park subdivided into lots. The parties further agreed -<br><br><blockquote>(d) THAT the FIRST PARTY shall receive forty (40%) percent of the gross collection less Perpetual Care Fees (which in no case shall exceed 10% of the price per lot unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing) or Net Gross Collection (NGC) from this project. This shall be remitted monthly by the SECOND PARTY in the following manner: (i) Forty (40%) percent of the NGC, plus (ii) if it becomes necessary for the FIRST PARTY to vacate the property earlier than two years from the date of this agreement, at the option of the FIRST PARTY, an additional amount equivalent to twenty (20%) percent of the NGC as cash advance for the first four (4) years with interest at twelve (12%) percent per annum which cash advance shall be deductible out of the proceeds from the FIRST PARTY’s 40% from the 5th year onward. The SECOND PARTY further agrees that if the FIRST PARTY shall desire to have its projected receivables collected at the 5th year, the SECOND PARTY shall assist in having the same discounted in advance.<br><br>The P1.5 million initial payment mentioned in the Deed of Absolute Sale, covering the first phase of the project, shall be deducted out of the proceeds from the FIRST PARTY’s 40% at the end of the 5th year. Subsequent payments made by the SECOND PARTY on account of the stated purchase price in said Deed of Absolute Sale shall be charged against what is due to the FIRST PARTY under this LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Later, two claimants of the parcel of land surfaced - Maysilo Estate and the heirs of a certain Vicente Singson Encarnacion. EGMPC thus filed an action for interpleader against Maysilo Estate and NPUM, docketed as Civil Case No. 9556 before the Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City, Branch 120. The Singson heirs in turn filed an action for quieting of title against EGMPC and NPUM, docketed as Civil Case No. C-11836 before Branch 122 of the same court.<br><br>From these two cases, several proceedings ensued. One such case, from the interpleader action, culminated in the filing and subsequent resolution of G.R. No. 73794. In G.R. No. 73794, EGMPC assailed the appellate court’s resolution requiring “petitioner Eternal Gardens [to] deposit whatever amounts are due from it under the Land Development Agreement with a reputable bank to be designated by the respondent court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In the Decision of September 19, 1988, the court ruled thus:<br><blockquote> PREMISES CONSIDERED, (a) the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit; (b) this case (together with all the claims of the intervenors on the merits) is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings; and (c) the Resolution of the Third Division of this Court of July 8, 1987 requiring the deposit by the petitioner (see footnote 6)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the amounts contested in a depository bank STANDS (the Motion for Reconsideration thereof being hereby DENIED for reasons already discussed) until after the decision on the merits shall have become final and executory.</blockquote>Entry of judgment was made on April 24, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sometime thereafter, the trial court rendered decisions in Civil Case Nos. 9556 (interpleader) and C-11836 (quieting of title). These decisions were appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the appeals were consolidated.<br><br>The appellate court rendered judgment in the consolidated case on December 17, 1991 as follows: (a.) the trial court’s decision in Civil Case No. 9556 was affirmed insofar as it dismissed the claims of the intervenors, including the Maysilo Estate, and the titles of NPUM to the subject parcel of land were declared valid; and (b.) the trial court’s decision in Civil Case No. C-11836 in favor of the Singson heirs was reversed and set aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>From the consolidated decision, the Singson heirs, Maysilo Estate and EGMPC each filed with this Court their petitions for review on certiorari. The petition filed by the Singson heirs docketed as G.R. No. 103247-48 was denied for failure to comply with Circular No. 28-91,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and entry of judgment made on July 27, 1992. G.R. No. 105159 filed by the Maysilo Estate was denied for failure of petitioner to raise substantial legal issues,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and entry of judgment made on August 19, 1992. G.R. Nos. 103230-31 filed by EGMPC was denied for failure to comply with Circular No. 19-91,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and entry of judgment made on July 20, 1993. EGMPC’s other petition, this time under Rule 65, docketed as G.R. Nos. 107646-47 was dismissed for having been filed out of time and for lack of merit.<br><br>Following these, the Court, through the Third Division, issued a Resolution dated December 1, 1993 in G.R. No. 73794, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, considering that the ownership of the property in dispute has now been settled with finality, the Court sees no further legal obstacle in carrying out the respective covenants of the parties to the Land Development Agreement. x x x. In respect to the mutual accounting required to determine the remaining accrued rights and liabilities of said parties, the case is hereby remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper determination and disposition.<br><br>All other incidental motions involving G.R. No. 73794, still pending with this Court, are hereby, declared MOOT and are NOTED WITHOUT ACTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>In compliance with the Supreme Court resolution, the Court of Appeals proceeded with the disposition of the case, docketed therein as CA G.R. SP No. 04869, and required the parties to appear at a scheduled hearing on June 16, 1994, “with counsel and accountants, as well as books of accounts and related records,’ to determine the remaining accrued rights and liabilities of said parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Citing the following provision of the land development agreement:<br><blockquote>(e) THAT the SECOND PARTY shall keep proper books and accounting records of all transactions affecting the sale of said memorial lots, which records shall be open for inspection by the FIRST PARTY at any time during usual office hours. The SECOND PARTY shall also render to the FIRST PARTY a monthly accounting report of all sales and cash collections effected the preceding month. It is also understood that all financial statements shall be subject to annual audit by a reputable external accounting firm which should be acceptable to the FIRST PARTY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>the appellate court required EGMPC to produce at the scheduled hearings the following documents:<br><br>(a) statements of monthly gross income from the year 1981, supported by copies of the contracts/agreements of the sale of lots to buyers/customers; and<br><br>(b) summary statements, by month, of the forty per cent (40%) share in the “net gross” income under the land development agreement between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The accounting of the parties’ respective obligations was referred to the Court’s Accountant, Ms. Carmencita Angelo, with the concurrence of the parties, to whom the documents were to be submitted. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>NPUM prepared and submitted a Summary of Sales and Total Amounts Due based on the following documents it likewise submitted to the court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A-1 Land Development Agreement executed between NPUM and EGMPC on October 6, 1976.<br><br>A-2 Submittal of requirements filed by EGMPC to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated July 26, 1976 re: its application to develop, sell and maintain a first class private cemetery part situated in Baesa, Kalookan City on the 23 has. property of PUC of NPUM.

This Court denied Eternal Garden’s motion for reconsideration in a resolution promulgated April 12, 1996, a copy of which it received on April 18, 1996. After eleven (11) days from receipt of the resolution denying its motion for reconsideration, or on April 12, 1996 (sic), it filed a motion for extension to file a petition for review with the Supreme Court.<br><br>It is quite clear that after the denial of its motion for reconsideration, Eternal Gardens had only three (3) days left of the reglementary period to file a petition for review, or only up to April 12, 1996, but Eternal Gardens allowed that period to lapse, and then filed its motion to extend to file its petition on April 29, 1996 - which is eight (8) days beyond the period of finality of the resolution sought to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Consequently, the resolution of January 15, 1996 had attained finality before Eternal Gardens filed its motion to extend before this Honorable Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>Entry of judgment was made on June 6, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Following the above incidents, on June 20, 1996, EGMPC filed in G.R.

NPUM contended that as a consequence of the appellate court’s resolutions in CA G.R. SP No. 04869 having attained finality, a writ of execution may be issued under G.R. No. 73794, and EGMPC could no longer file a separate petition such as that docketed as G.R.

No. 73794. NPUM pointed out that the reliefs sought by EGMPC in G.R.

Twelve days from such receipt, or on February 2, 1996, EGMPC filed its Motion for Reconsideration. On April 18, 1996, EGMPC received the appellate court’s Resolution of April 12, 1996 denying its Motion for Reconsideration. On April 29, 1996, or eleven days from its receipt of the denial of its motion for reconsideration, EGMPC filed a motion for extension of time to file its “Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition” and concurrently paid the legal fees.<br><br>We find that EGMPC’s Motion for Extension of Time to File a Petition for Review was timely filed on April 29, 1996, such motion having been filed eleven days from receipt of the appellate court’s denial of its motion for reconsideration. Supreme Court Circular No. 10 dated August 28, 1986 on modes and periods of appeal provides thus:<br><br>(5) APPEALS BY CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT<br><br>In an appeal by certiorari to this Court under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, Section 25 of the Interim Rules and Section 7 of PD 1606, a party may file a petition for review on certiorari of the judgment of a regional trial court, the Court of Appeals or the Sandiganbayan within fifteen days from notice of judgment or of the denial of his motion for reconsideration filed in due time, and paying at the same time the corresponding docket fee (Section 1 of Rule 45). In other words, in the event a motion for reconsideration is filed and denied, the period of fifteen days begins to run again from notice of denial (See Codilla vs. Estenzo, 97 SCRA 351; Turingan vs. Cacdad, 122 SCRA 634).<br><br>A motion for extension of time to file a petition for review on certiorari may be filed with the Supreme Court within the reglementary period, paying at the same time the corresponding docket fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>While the petition filed by EGMPC purports to be one of certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, we shall treat it as having been filed under Rule 45, considering that it was filed within the 15-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for review on certiorari. As the Court stated in Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, where the Court was liberal in its application of the Rules of Court in the interest of justice: “It cannot x x x be claimed that this petition is being used as a substitute for appeal after that remedy has been lost through the fault of petitioner. Moreover, stripped of allegations of ‘grave abuse of discretion,’ the petition actually avers errors of judgment rather than of jurisdiction, which are the subject of a petition for review.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The May 31, 1996 Report of the Court of Appeals informed the parties that the January 15, 1996 Resolution had attained finality, erroneously applying the rule applicable to petitions for review filed with the Court of Appeals from a final judgment or order of the regional trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We cannot and do not in the instant case vacate and set aside the May 31, 1996 Report. The report is not before this Court on review. We must however, within the milieu of this case, regard the report impertinent by the fact of EGMPC having timely filed its motion for extension of time to file its petition on April 29, 1996.<br><br>We also consider that the consequences of the issuance of the report, that is, the entry of judgment in the appellate court and the writ of execution issued by the trial court in the case of origin, inextricably affect the resolution of the instant case. Hence, the rationale for our restraining order of January 15, 1997.<br><br>We next consider whether, as asserted by NPUM, EGMPC’s petition must be summarily dismissed on the ground of forum shopping. NPUM points to EGMPC’s Opposition and/or Comment to the Report of the Court of Appeals dated May 31, 1996 filed in G. R. No. 73794 vis-a-vis its Petition for Review in the instant case, and the two Urgent Motions for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order filed in G.R. No. 73794 and in the instant case.<br><br>NPUM asserts that the reliefs sought by EGMPC in its opposition and in its petition are “identical.” We disagree. The petition here seeks the setting aside of the Court of Appeals’ January 15, 1996 and April 12, 1996 Resolutions.<br><br>The Opposition in G.R. No. 73794, on the other hand, sought the nullification of the May 31, 1996 Report and as a corollary, for the instant case to be “allowed or tolerated.”<br><br>The opposition and the petition do not seek to provoke from this Court the resolution of a same issue, the evil which Revised Circular No. 28-91 and its companion Administrative Circular No. 04-94 address. We read the opposition in G.R. No. 73794 as a complement to the petition here, to which it makes categorical and express reference. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> We consider it as merely a matter of discourse and emphasis that Eternal Gardens reiterated its case in the later pleading.<br><br>Regarding the motions for the issuance of a temporary restraining order filed by EGMPC on January 10, 1997 in the instant case and on January 17, 1997 in G.R. No. 73794, we consider the exigency which may have prompted EGMPC to file the motions in both cases. The trial court in the case of origin, acted favorably on NPUM’s motion for the issuance of a writ of execution, the basis of which is the alleged finality of the appellate court’s January 15, 1996 Resolution. The trial court ruled that the instant case denominated as an original action for certiorari “does not interrupt the course of the principal action G.R. No. 73794] nor the running of the period in the proceeding.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> To not stay the execution considering the trial court’s ratiocination would render moot EGMPC’s remedy in the instant case.<br><br>NPUM also contends that EGMPC has committed perjury, pointing to the certification under oath filed by EGMPC, through its President Gabriel O. Vida, where he states “that there is no other case pending in any court or tribunal in the Philippines, with the same issues in this case x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Again, we disagree. It does not appear that EGMPC was to pursue the two cases concurrently. EGMPC filed this new petition, and did not assail the appellate court’s resolution under G.R. No. 73794, as in fact the Court has informed the parties that no further pleadings were to be entertained in G.R. No. 73794 after remand to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>EGMPC next asserts that the Resolution of the Third Division dated December 1, 1993 ordering the remand to the Court of Appeals of the case for accounting “changed, modified and reversed” the September 19, 1988 Decision of the Second Division which ordered the remand of the case to the trial court. EGMPC contends that the Third Division “is in violation of the constitution which provides that no doctrine or principle of law laid down in a decision en banc or in division may be changed modified or revised by the Court except when sitting en banc.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>EGMPC had raised the very same issue in its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the December 1, 1993 Resolution. The Court, in its Resolution dated February 14, 1994 had denied the motion with finality for lack of merit.<br><br>Needless to say, the argument raised by EGMPC is utterly without consequence. At the time the September 19, 1988 Decision was rendered, the two civil cases - interpleader and quieting of title - were still pending. What was brought before the appellate courts and subject of G.R. No. 73794 were mere incidents, and not the judgment of the trial court; thus, the remand to the trial court for further proceedings on the merits of the case. The December 1, 1993 Resolution was issued after the issue of ownership of the subject parcel of land was already resolved with finality. What was left for the courts to do was to have an accounting done of the rights and liabilities of EGMPC and NPUM, thus, the remand to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>We now consider the merits of the case.<br><br>The gist of EGMPCs’ contentions is that it owes the amount of only P35,000,000.00 less advances and not P167,065,195.00 as principal and P167,235,451.00 in interest as computed by Court Accountant Carmencita C. Angelo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>EGMPC first contends that the appellate court, in appointing an accountant to make the computations, delegated judicial function, such as to determine the admissibility of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Under the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, that court has the -<br><br>d. Authority to receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary for the resolution of factual issues raised in cases falling within its original jurisdiction.<br><br>For the proper disposition of the case, the appellate court, under the above-quoted authority, designated an accountant “to receive, collate and analyze the documents to be filed by the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>No judicial function was exercised by Ms. Angelo. She was not asked to rule on the admissibility of the evidence. The documents were duly marked during the hearing of July 19, 1995, for the consideration of the appellate court, which alone had the power to decide. Ms. Angelo’s role in the proceedings was to prepare a report, which she did, culling from the documents submitted to her. While it may be true that the report, when adopted by the appellate court, became part of its decision, judicial power lies, not with the official who prepared the report, but with the court itself which wields the power of approval or rejection. Under American jurisprudence, the rule is thus -<br><br><blockquote>It would seen on principle that a commissioner, master or referee appointed by a court to aid it in the adjudication of a particular case is not a court when performing the functions assigned to him, although the court may adopt his conclusions in its decision x x x. It has, for instance, been held that a statute giving the supreme court of a state the power to appoint commissioners thereof whose duty shall be, under such rules and regulations as the court may adopt, to assist it in the performance of its functions, and in disposing of undetermined cases before it, is not unconstitutional or open to the objection that the commissioners are vested with judicial power, since the commissioners merely report facts found and conclusions reached, and the court retains the power to decide which is the only judicial power. It has also been pointed out that a chancellor does not, by referring a matter to a commissioner, delegate his judicial function to him. The commissioner is appointed for the purpose of assisting the chancellor, not to supplant or replace him, and the findings of a commissioner are merely advisory and not binding on the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br><br>EGMPC also contends that it was deprived of due process because it “was not given reasonable opportunity to know and meet the claim of [NPUM] as its counsel was not able to cross-examine the American Accountant of [NPUM].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The contention is without merit.<br><br>Contrary to EGMPC’s claim, it was given every opportunity to present its case. At the outset, the parties were asked by the appellate court to submit documents for accounting. NPUM made full utilization of the modes of discovery, asking the appellate court to subpoena documents and testimonies, and requesting admissions from EGMPC regarding documents it (EGMPC) had in its possession, documents which emanated from the corporation itself, and either sent to NPUM as communiqués, such as the Letter of Mr. Vida dated April 4, 1980 to Pastor Bienvenido Capule of NPUM stating inter alia that for 1978, EGMPC sold 2,805 memorial lots and that during the first quarter of 1980 the corporation sold 2,418 lots, totalling 10,730,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> or documents available to the general public, as in the Price Lists, or filed with government offices, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<br><br>EGMPC cannot claim that it was denied the forum to confer with NPUM and NPUM’s accountant. The appellate court had arranged conferences for the parties and their accountants to allow them to discuss with each other and with Ms. Angelo. Even Ms. Angelo, in her Letter dated November 10, 1995 covering her second and final report spoke of such a conference, to wit:<br><br><blockquote> In compliance with your instructions in the last conference-meeting with the party-litigants in Case CA-G.R. No. SP No. 04869 held last August 30, 1995, the undersigned together with the representatives of the North Philippine Union Mission (NPUM) and the Eternal Gardens Memorial, Inc. had a discussion on the computations made by each of the party of the amount due to the North Philippine Union Mission which were submitted to the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>It was not even imperative that EGMPC cross-examine the accountant who prepared EGMPC’s computation, and there was no denial of due process without such cross-examination. This computation was merely to aid Ms. Angelo, who was to make her own independent computation from the documents submitted to her.<br><br>EGMPC also asserts that “substantially if not all records, documents and papers submitted by the private respondent NPUM to the Court’s Accountant which eventually became the basis of the report and Resolution of January 15, 1996 of the public respondent Court, were not genuine and not properly identified by the persons who were supposed to have executed the same including the alleged financial statement of Eternal Gardens allegedly issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>From the transcript of stenographic notes of the proceedings in the appellate court, we find that EGMPC acquiesced to the use of the documents submitted by NPUM, including the financial statements, even actively participating in the discussion of the contents of such documents. EGMPC’s main objection was only on how the entries in these documents were to be interpreted, for example, on how payments towards the perpetual care fund would be credited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> EGMPC did not object even when counsel for NPUM read into the records the contents of the documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>It even appears that after Ms. Angelo came up with her first report, EGMPC’s counsel expressed that it was “amenable to that computation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In that report, Ms. Angelo had stressed that “[s]ince the Eternal Gardens Memorial Park, Inc. did not submit to the Court any documents pertaining to the computations of the 40% share of the North Philippine Union Mission of the Seventh Day Adventists, then we have no other recourse but to base the computation on the available figures and on the other documents as presented by the petitioner [NPUM].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>EGMPC lastly contends that it is not liable for interest. It claims that it was justified in withholding payment as there was still the unresolved issue of ownership over the property subject of the Land Development Agreement of October 6, 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The argument is without merit. EGMPC under the agreement had the obligation to remit monthly to NPUM forty percent (40%) of its net gross collection from the development of a memorial park on property owned by NPUM. The same agreement provided for the designation of a depository/trustee bank to act as the depository/trustee for all funds collected by EGMPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> There was no obstacle, legal or otherwise, to the compliance by EGMPC of this provision in the contract, even on the affectation that it did not know to whom payment was to be made.<br><br>Even disregarding the agreement, EGMPC cannot “suspend” payment on the pretext that it did not know who among the subject property’s claimants was the rightful owner. It had a remedy under the New Civil Code of the Philippines - to give in consignation the amounts due, as these fell due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Consignation produces the effect of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The rationale for consignation is to avoid the performance of an obligation becoming more onerous to the debtor by reason of causes not imputable to him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> For its failure to consign the amounts due, Eternal Gardens’ obligation to NPUM necessarily became more onerous as it became liable for interest on the amounts it failed to remit.<br><br>Notably, EGMPC filed an interpleader action, “the essence of which, aside from the disavowal of interest in the property in litigation on the part of the petitioner, is the deposit of the property or funds in controversy with the court.” Yet from the outset, EGMPC had assailed any court ruling ordering the deposit with a reputable bank of the amounts due from it under the Land Development Agreement. In G.R. No. 73794,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court made the following discourse on the disavowal of EGMPC of its obligations, thus:<br><br><blockquote> In the case at bar, a careful analysis of the records will show that petitioner admitted among others in its complaint in Interpleader that it is still obligated to pay certain amounts to private respondent; that it claims no interest in such amounts due and is willing to pay whoever is declared entitled to said amounts. Such admissions in the complaint were reaffirmed in open court before the Court of Appeals as stated in the latter court’s resolution dated September 5, 1985 in C.A. G.R. No. 04869 which states:</blockquote><br><br>‘The private respondent (MEMORIAL) then reaffirms before the Court its original position that it is a disinterested party with respect to the property now the subject of the interpleader case.<br><br>‘In the light of the willingness, expressly made before the court, affirming the complaint filed below, that the private respondent (MEMORIAL) will pay whatever is due on the Land Development Agreement to the rightful owner/owners, there is no reason why the amount due on subject agreement has not been placed in the custody of the Court.’<br><br><blockquote>Under the circumstances, there appears to be no plausible reason for petitioner’s objections to the deposit of the amounts in litigation after having asked for the assistance of the lower court by filing a complaint for interpleader where the deposit of aforesaid amounts is not only required by the nature of the action but is a contractual obligation of the petitioner under the Land Development Program.<br><br>As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, the essence of an interpleader, aside from the disavowal of interest in the property in litigation on the part of the petitioner, is the deposit of the property or funds in controversy with the court, it is a rule founded on justice and equity: ‘that the plaintiff may not continue to benefit from the property or funds in litigation during the pendency of the suit at the expense of whoever will ultimately be decided as entitled thereto.’<br><br>The case at bar was elevated to the Court of Appeals on certiorari with prohibitory and mandatory injunction. Said appellate court found that more than twenty million pesos are involved; so that on interest alone for savings or time deposit would be considerable, now accruing in favor of the Eternal Gardens. Finding that such is violative of the very essence of the complaint for interpleader as it clearly runs against the interest of justice in this case, the Court of Appeals cannot be faulted for finding that the lower court committed a grave abuse of discretion which requires correction by the requirement that a deposit of said amounts should be made to a bank approved by the Court.<br><br>Petitioner would now compound the issue by its obvious turnabout, presently claiming in its memorandum that there is a novation of contract so that the amounts due under the Land Development Agreement were allegedly extinguished, and the requirement to make a deposit of said amounts in a depository bank should be held in abeyance until after the conflicting claims of ownership now on trial before Branch CXXII RTC-Caloocan City, has finally been resolved.<br><br>All these notwithstanding, the need for the deposit in question has been established, not only in the lower courts and in the Court of Appeals but also in the Supreme Court where such deposit was required in the resolution of July 8, 1987 to avoid wastage of funds.</blockquote><br><br>Even during the pendency of G.R. No. 73794, EGMPC was required to deposit the accruing interests with a reputable commercial bank “to avoid possible wastage of funds” when the case was given due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Yet, EGMPC hedged in depositing the amounts due and made obvious attempts to stay payment by filing sundry motions and pleadings.<br><br>We thus find that the Court of Appeals correctly held Eternal Gardens liable for interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%). The withholding of the amounts due under the agreement was tantamount to a forbearance of money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING,</span> the Court Resolved to <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY </span>the petition.
