				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> are the Resolutions dated June 7, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and November 4, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 99594, which referred the records of the instant case to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) for proper disposition of the appeal taken by respondent Bureau of Customs (respondent).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The instant case arose from a collection suit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for unpaid taxes and customs duties in the aggregate amount of P46,844,385.00 filed by respondent against petitioner Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corporation (petitioner) before the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 17 (RTC), docketed as Civil Case No. 02-103763 (collection case).<br><br>Respondent alleged that from 1997 to 1998, petitioner was able to secure tax credit certificates (TCCs) from various transportation companies; after which, it made several importations and utilized said TCCs for the payment of various customs duties and taxes in the aggregate amount of P46,844,385.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Believing the authenticity of the TCCs, respondent allowed petitioner to use the same for the settlement of such customs duties and taxes.&nbsp; However, a post-audit investigation of the Department of Finance revealed that the TCCs were fraudulently secured with the use of fake commercial and bank documents, and thus, respondent deemed that petitioner never settled its taxes and customs duties pertaining to the aforesaid importations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thereafter, respondent demanded that petitioner pay its unsettled tax and customs duties, but to no avail. Hence, it was constrained to file the instant complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In its defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> petitioner maintained, <i>inter alia</i>, that it acquired the TCCs from their original holders in good faith and that they were authentic, and thus, their remittance to respondent should be considered as proper settlement of the taxes and customs duties it incurred in connection with the aforementioned importations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Initially, the RTC dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the collection case due to the continuous absences of respondent’s counsel during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On appeal to the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and eventually the Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the said case was reinstated and trial on the merits continued before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After respondent’s presentation of evidence, petitioner filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on February 10, 2012, essentially contending that respondent failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the TCCs were fraudulently procured,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and thus, prayed for the dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In turn, respondent filed an Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 7, 2012 refuting petitioner’s contentions.<br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated April 10, 2012, the RTC granted petitioner’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Evidence, and accordingly, dismissed respondent’s collection case on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It found that respondent had not shown any proof or substantial evidence of fraud or conspiracy on the part of petitioner in the procurement of the TCCs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In this connection, the RTC opined that fraud is never presumed and must be established by clear and convincing evidence, which petitioner failed to do, thus, necessitating the dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondent moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated August 3, 2012. Dissatisfied, it appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated June 7, 2013, the CA referred the records of the collection case to the CTA for proper disposition of the appeal taken by respondent. While the CA admitted that it had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of respondent’s appeal, as jurisdiction is properly lodged with the CTA, it nevertheless opted to relax procedural rules in not dismissing the appeal outright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Instead, the CA deemed it appropriate to simply refer the matter to the CTA, considering that the government stands to lose the amount of P46,844,385.00 in taxes and customs duties which can then be used for various public works and projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on June 23, 2013, arguing that since the CA does not have jurisdiction over respondent’s appeal, it cannot perform any action on it except to order its dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The said motion was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated November 4, 2013, hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA correctly referred the records of the collection case to the CTA for proper disposition of the appeal taken by respondent.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority of a court to hear, try, and decide a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In order for the court or an adjudicative body to have authority to dispose of the case on the merits, it must acquire, among others, jurisdiction over the subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is axiomatic that jurisdiction over the subject matter is the power to hear and determine the general class to which the proceedings in question belong; it is conferred by law and not by the consent or acquiescence of any or all of the parties or by erroneous belief of the court that it exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, when a court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the only power it has is to dismiss the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing considerations and as will be explained hereunder, the Court finds that the CA erred in referring the records of the collection case to the CTA for proper disposition of the appeal taken by respondent.<br><br>Section 7 of Republic Act No. (RA) 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> as amended by RA 9282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. Jurisdiction. – The CTA shall exercise:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>c. Jurisdiction over tax collection cases as herein provided:<br><br>x x x x<br><blockquote>2. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction in tax collection cases:<br><br>a. Over appeals from the judgments, resolutions or orders of the Regional Trial Courts in tax collection cases originally decided by them in their respective territorial jurisdiction.<br></blockquote>x x x x<br></blockquote>Similarly, Section 3, Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <i>Cases within the jurisdiction of the Court in Divisions</i>. – The Court in Divisions shall exercise:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>c. Exclusive jurisdiction over tax collections cases, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><blockquote>2. Appellate jurisdiction over appeals from the judgments, resolutions or orders of the Regional Trial Courts in tax collection cases originally decided by them within their respective territorial jurisdiction.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Verily, the foregoing provisions explicitly provide that the CTA has <b><u>exclusive appellate jurisdiction</u></b> over tax collection cases originally decided by the RTC.<br><br>In the instant case, the CA has no jurisdiction over respondent’s appeal; hence, it cannot perform any action on the same except to order its dismissal pursuant to Section 2, Rule 50<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Rules of Court. Therefore, the act of the CA in referring respondent’s wrongful appeal before it to the CTA under the guise of furthering the interests of substantial justice is blatantly erroneous, and thus, stands to be corrected. In <i>Anderson v. Ho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court held that the invocation of substantial justice is not a magic wand that would readily dispel the application of procedural rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x procedural rules are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases. Courts and litigants alike are enjoined to abide strictly by the rules. <b><u>While in certain instances, we allow a relaxation in the application of the rules, we never intend to forge a weapon for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity. The liberal interpretation and application of rules apply only in proper cases of demonstrable merit and under justifiable causes and circumstances. While it is true that litigation is not a game of technicalities, it is equally true that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure to ensure an orderly and speedy administration of justice.</u></b> Party litigants and their counsels are well advised to abide by rather than flaunt, procedural rules for these rules illumine the path of the law and rationalize the pursuit of justice. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Finally, in view of respondent’s availment of a wrong mode of appeal via&nbsp; notice of appeal stating that it was elevating the case to the CA – instead of appealing by way of a petition for review to the CTA within thirty (30) days from receipt of a copy of the RTC’s August 3, 2012 Order, as required by Section 11 of RA 1125, as amended by Section 9 of RA 9282<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> – the Court is constrained to deem the RTC’s dismissal of respondent’s collection case against petitioner final and executory. It is settled that the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period set by law is not only mandatory, but jurisdictional as well, and that failure to perfect an appeal within the period fixed by law renders the judgment appealed from final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The Court’s pronouncement in <i>Team Pacific Corporation v. Daza</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> is instructive on this matter, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>Although appeal is an essential part of our judicial process, it has been held, time and again, that the right thereto is not a natural right or a part of due process but is merely a statutory privilege. Thus, the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional and failure of a party to conform to the rules regarding appeal will render the judgment final and executory. Once a decision attains finality, it becomes the law of the case irrespective of whether the decision is erroneous or not and no court — not even the Supreme Court — has the power to revise, review, change or alter the same. The basic rule of finality of judgment is grounded on the fundamental principle of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of occasional error, the judgment of courts and the award of quasi-judicial agencies must become final at some definite date fixed by law.<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
