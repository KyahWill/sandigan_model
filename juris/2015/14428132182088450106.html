Aurellano Agnes, et al.</i>"<br><br>The facts, as culled from the records, are as follows:<br><br>Calauit Island (Calauit) is a 3,600-hectare island that forms part of the Calamianes Island group in the Province of Palawan.<br><br>The petitioners claim to be among the more than 250 families ("settlers") who lived in Calauit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as successors of the early settlers therein. They are members of the "<i>Balik Calauit Movement</i>," which was organized for the purpose of reclaiming the lands they used to occupy. The settlers lay claim on the lands of Calauit either (1) through a predecessor, who had become a titled owner by virtue of Act No. 926;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> or (2) by means of an imperfect title, which they, by themselves or their ancestors, had acquired by way of "unbroken, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and cultivation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the lands therein until their relocation in 1977.<br><br>In 1973, the Bureau of Lands started to survey Calauit. After some time, the surveyors met some resistance to the continued survey, but the settlers were told that it was being done for purposes of titling the latter's landholdings, as well as to determine how much land may be apportioned for people coming from Busuanga who were to be relocated in the area in view of the establishment of the Yulo King Ranch. In 1975, however, the settlers were told that the supposed titling of their landholdings was not going to push through as the island was going to be set up as a zoo for rare and exotic animals from other countries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Further, they were told that instead, they would be resettled in Halsey and Burabod in Culion, where the lands were claimed to be more fertile and where full government services and facilities such as irrigation, electricity, waterworks, public markets, roads, housing, school, and health care, would be provided by the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The petitioners alleged that, along with the other settlers, they could not refuse the offer because they were harassed and intimidated by members of the Philippine Constabulary (PC). In their petition and answers to written interrogatories, they mentioned instances of violence and harassment by PC soldiers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> They were also told that they had no choice but to leave Calauit, as the island was government property and that, as illegal settlers, they could be sued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The terms of the proposed relocation was later embodied in individual <i>Resettlement Agreements</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> wherein the government, through the Secretary of Natural Resources, among other things, undertook to provide the signatory settler the following: (1) an agricultural lot in exchange for the area he would be vacating; and (2) payment for the improvements on the properties to be vacated, as ascertained in individualized appraisal sheets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In exchange, the signatory settler agreed to (1) be resettled to any selected resettlement area in Busuanga; (2) relinquish "totally his rights and claim (<i>sic</i>) over the land thereon in favor of the Government;" and (3) vacate the premises upon receipt of fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of the appraised value of the improvements, with the other half to be paid upon proof of actual evacuation from the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1976, then President Ferdinand E.

These portions, known as Halsey and Burabod, became the resettlement areas for the settlers of Calauit.<br><br>In 1981, the Presidential Committee for the Conservation of the Tamaraw (PCCT) absorbed the CSP; and in 1985, it entered into a contract with the Conservation and Resource Management Foundation, Inc. (CRMF) to carry out the functions of the CSP.<br><br>According to petitioners, life in the resettlement areas was unbearable. They claimed that the lands in Halsey and Burabod were unsuitable for habitation and agriculture; and that the government failed to comply with the promised services and facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After the EDSA People Power and the ouster of Pres. Marcos, the settlers formed the "<i>Balik Calauit Movement</i>," and aired their collective grievances to the new administration of then President Corazon C. Aquino (Pres. Aquino).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Some of the settlers tried to return to the Island but were driven away by the CRMF; thus, they went to the Philippine Commission on Human Rights (PCHR) to file a complaint against the government and CRMF. A fact-finding commission was established by the PCHR and dialogues were held among the parties. On February 17 and 23, 1987, the fact-finding commission submitted two memoranda<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> recommending (1) the repeal of Proclamation No. 1578 for being violative of the settlers' Bill of Rights; and (2) the immediate return of the settlers to Calauit.<br><br>In June 1987, the petitioners, with the other settlers, once again tried to return to Calauit, with success this time around.<br><br>Meantime, the PCHR referred the aforementioned complaint to then DNR Secretary Fulgencio Factoran, who, on July 14, 1987 issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> directing the settlers who returned to Calauit to "immediately vacate the sanctuary and return to their resettlement areas of Halsey [and] Burabod."<br><br>In response to the above Order, the concerned settlers filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court, docketed as <b>G.R.

In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated February 16, 1988, this Court dismissed the petition for being factual in nature, to wit:<br><blockquote>G.R. No. 80034 (Reynaldo Rufino, et al. vs. Hon. Secretary Fulgencio Factoran, et al.). It appearing from the allegations and arguments of the parties in their respective pleadings that the issues presented to the Court for determination are mainly factual in nature, among them the manner of the petitioners' transfer from Calawit to Halsey and Burabod, the conditions obtaining in the places to which they have been relocated, the terms and conditions of their resettlement, including the benefits, if any, extended to them by the government, the number of persons involved in the Back-to-Calawit Movement, and whether or not there have really been violations of human rights against the petitioners, the Court, not being a trier of facts, Resolved to DISMISS the petition, without prejudice to the filing by the petitioners of the appropriate action before the regional trial court for trial and determination of the said factual issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 10, 1988, the petitioners filed a petition with the RTC, Branch 134, Makati, Metro Manila, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 88-298</b>, entitled "<i>Reynaldo Rufino, et al. v. Hon. Fulgencio Factoran, et al.</i>," for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), to enjoin the latter from implementing Secretary Factoran's July 14, 1987 Order, and for the declaration of nullity of Proclamation No. 1578 for being unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated April 6, 1988, the RTC of Makati, denied the motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, and upheld the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1578.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On April 17, 1989, the RTC of Makati issued another Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dismissing the case without prejudice, to wit:<br><blockquote>On motion of counsel for defendants and there being no objection on the part of counsel for the plaintiffs, the instant case is hereby ordered dismissed without prejudice.<br></blockquote>The foregoing Order was prompted by petitioners' manifestation that they had a pending appeal before the Office of the President relative to the July 14, 1987 Order of DENR Secretary Factoran directing the petitioners and the other settlers to leave Calauit and return to their resettlement areas in Halsey and Burabod.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Office of the President ultimately denied said appeal.<br><br>Some of the settlers failed to comply with Secretary Factoran's July 14, 1987 Order to vacate Calauit; thus, the Republic of the Philippines (herein respondent), represented by the DENR Secretary, filed a Complaint for Specific Performance and Recovery of Possession with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against herein petitioners before the RTC, Branch 49, Puerto Princesa City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 2262, entitled "<i>Republic of the Philippines v. Aurellano Agnes, et al</i>."<br><br>In said Complaint, herein respondent alleged that the petitioners' repossession and reoccupation of portions of Calauit are patently unlawful and grossly reproachable as they had already waived and relinquished whatever rights they had on the island when they signed and executed their respective Resettlement Agreements. The respondent claimed that by returning to Calauit, the petitioners breached their contracts, the Resettlement Agreements, which they voluntarily and freely executed. Moreover, by virtue of Proclamation No. 1578, which closed Calauit to exploitation and settlement, the respondent contended that the petitioners are staying on the island as "squatters" on public land. The respondent also complained of the great damage and disturbance the petitioners were doing to the natural resources and the protected animals in Calauit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In their "Answer with Counterclaims,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> herein petitioners alleged that the Resettlement Agreements were executed with deceit, intimidation, misrepresentation, and fraud; hence they are illegal and void. They also contested their admissibility on the ground that they are private documents, which have not been authenticated. They also claim that it was actually the respondent who breached its contract by providing poor resettlement areas, which resulted in their subhuman and marginal existence. The petitioners denied causing damage to the island and the animals in Calauit, as they only occupied the coastal areas, away from the animals' roaming grounds and habitat. The petitioners then prayed for the nullification of the Resettlement Agreements for having been procured through violence, intimidation, deceit, misrepresentation, and fraud. In the alternative, they called for the rescission of the contracts for respondent's material breach of its obligations. Lastly, they asked for Twenty-Five Thousand (25,000.00) Pesos each as temperate, exemplary, and moral damages.<br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the RTC</i></b><br></center><br>On February 23, 1994, the RTC of Puerto Princesa City rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby orders the defendants (with the exception of Alfredo Aunang, Juana Apuen, Eufricinia Bello, Bartolome Darol, Eduardo de Mesa, Aurora Eco, Eleuterio Fresnillo, Jovita Gabarda, Fausto Lledo, Pampilo Sabroso, Ismael, Rafaela and Regalado Tradio)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and anyone claiming under them to vacate the respective areas where they have resettled at Calauit Island, Busuanga, Palawan.<br><br>Plaintiff-Republic through the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources, is ordered to procure another suitable Relocation Sites for defendants within six months from receipt of this Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC held that the Resettlement Agreements, being duplicates of the originals and records of the Republic of the Philippines, are public documents notwithstanding their lack of notarization. As such, they are admissible in evidence even if the parties' signatures were not authenticated. The RTC also held that the vices of consent allegedly attached to the Resettlement Agreements would have served to render the agreements merely voidable and not void. However, the four-year period within which the petitioners could bring an action for annulment had long prescribed. On the issue of rescission, the RTC held that even assuming that the petitioners had grounds for rescission, they "could not unilaterally rescind the agreements, since the right to rescind must be invoked judicially."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The RTC, in deciding against the petitioners' return to Calauit, proclaimed:<br><blockquote>National Interest in the preservation of Calauit as Game Preserve and Sanctuary is the overriding factor which argues against the right of [petitioners] to return to Calauit. Assuming that the Resettlement Areas provided by [Respondent]-Republic did not measure up to the expectations of [petitioners], the recourse was not to renege on their Agreements by returning to Calauit and contributing to the disturbance or destruction of the Preserve, but to demand that [Respondent] deliver the fair value of the properties they vacated.<br><br>[Respondent]-Republic is not entirely free from blame for what appears to have been an unwise choice of Relocation Sites and should be given an opportunity to rectify the mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners sought the Court of Appeals' reversal of the RTC's decision in their Appeal docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 46222, entitled "<i>Republic of the Philippines v. Aurellano Agnes, et al</i>."<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In a Decision promulgated on April 24, 2002, the Court of Appeals affirmed the assailed ruling of the RTC, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appealed Decision dated February 23, 1994, of the Regional Trial Court of Palawan and Puerto Princesa City, Branch 49, Fourth Judicial Regional, Palawan docketed as Civil Case No. 2262, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>. No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals concurred in the findings and conclusions of the RTC. In addition, it disputed the petitioners' claim of ownership on the lands of Calauit; and held that absent any proof to the contrary, the presumption that Calauit is of public domain and thus belongs to the State stands. The Court of Appeals explained its pronouncement in this wise:<br><blockquote>Pursuant to [Article XII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution], all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in land and charged with the conservation of such patrimony. Corollarily, all lands not otherwise appearing to be within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State. Ergo, a positive act of the government is needed to declassify a forest land into alienable or disposable land for agricultural or other purposes. x x x. Therefore, to acquire ownership of public land, the same must first be released from its original classification and reclassified as alienable or disposable land. In the absence of such classification, the land remains unclassified public land until released therefrom and rendered open to disposition. Thus, the burden of proof in overcoming the presumption of state ownership of land lies upon the claimant. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he law itself stated that only alienable and disposable lands, particularly agricultural lands, can be acquired through possession and occupation for at least 30 years. Since the subject property is still unclassified when [the petitioners] and their ancestors occupied the same, whatever possession they or their predecessors may have had and however long, cannot ripen into private ownership. Moreover, the fact that the disputed property may have been declared for taxation purposes in the names of [petitioners] or their predecessors-in-interest does not necessarily prove ownership. This is due to the fact that tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership or of the right to possess land when not supported by evidence or other persuasive proof to substantiate their claim. They are merely indicia of a claim of ownership.<br><br>Considering that the [petitioners] failed to present convincing evidence and persuasive proof to substantiate their claim, the presumption of State ownership stands. It is also well to note that the bases of [respondent]'s superior right of possession and ownership was sufficiently supported both by law andjurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>The petitioners moved for the reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the aforequoted Decision, which was subsequently denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated November 18, 2002.<br><br>Hence, this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> premised on the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><center><b><i>Issues</i></b><br></center><br>I.

The issuance of CADT over Calauit Island including the Calauit Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary under Presidential Proclamation 1578 is another current problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Thus, the OSG submitted that "the instant petition must be decided on the merits considering that the area in dispute remains to be a Game and Wildlife Preserve and petitioners persist on their illegal occupation thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding the matters raised by the petitioners in this case, a review of the <i>Complaint, Answer with Counterclaims</i>, and the rest of the record of the instant petition readily reveals that the fundamental issue of the controversy between the parties may be summed up into these: whether or not the <i>Resettlement Agreements</i> are valid; and, more importantly, whether or not the petitioners may be compelled to vacate Calauit by virtue of their obligations enumerated in the <i>Resettlement Agreements</i>.<br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of this Court</i></b><br></center><br>With the issuance by the Office of the President of the CADT, an <i><u>ostensive</u></i> successor to the <i>Resettlement Agreements</i>, to the Tagbanua Indigenous Cultural Community (ICC), the resolution of the question on the propriety or impropriety of the latter contract and their effects on the continued stay of the settlers on Calauit appears to have been rendered moot and academic.<br><br>Under the CADT, the Tagbanua ICC is given authority "TO HAVE AND HOLD IN OWNERSHIP, <i>the x x x described ancestral domain as their private but community property, which belongs to all generations of the said Indigenous Cultural Community/Indigenous Peoples</i>"; and "TO DEVELOP, CONTROL, MANAGE <i>and</i> UTILIZE COLLECTIVELY <i>the said</i> ANCESTRAL DOMAIN <i>with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities appurtenant thereto, subject to the condition that the said ancestral domain shall</i> NOT be SOLD, DISPOSED, <i>nor</i> DESTROYED."<br><br>To be precise, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 8371 recognizes that the rights to ancestral domains carry with it the rights of ownership and possession of ICCs/IPs to their ancestral domains, which shall include the following:<br><blockquote><b>Section 7. <i>Rights to Ancestral Domains</i>. </b>- The rights of ownership and possession of ICCs/IPs to their ancestral domains shall be recognized and protected. Such rights shall include:<br><ol type="a"><li><i>Rights of Ownership</i>. - The right to claim ownership over lands, bodies of water traditionally and actually occupied by ICCs/IPs, sacred places, traditional hunting and fishing grounds, and all improvements made by them at any time within the domains;<br><br></li><li><i>Right to Develop Lands and Natural Resources.</i> - Subject to Section 56 hereof, right to develop, control and use lands and territories traditionally occupied, owned, or used; to manage and conserve natural resources within the territories and uphold the responsibilities for future generations; to benefit and share the profits from allocation and utilization of the natural resources found therein; the right to negotiate the terms and conditions for the exploration of natural resources in the areas for the purpose of ensuring ecological, environmental protection and the conservation measures, pursuant to national and customary laws; the right to an informed and intelligent participation in the formulation and implementation of any project, government or private, that will affect or impact upon the ancestral domains and to receive just and fair compensation for any damages which they may sustain as a result of the project; and the right to effective measures by the government to prevent any interference with, alienation and encroachment upon these rights;<br><br></li><li><b><i>Right to Stay in the Territories</i>. - The right to stay in the territory and not to be removed therefrom. No ICCs/IPs will be relocated without their free and prior informed consent, nor through any means other than eminent domain. Where relocation is considered necessary as an exceptional measure, such relocation shall take place only with the free and prior informed consent of the ICCs/IPs concerned and whenever possible, they shall be guaranteed the right to return to their ancestral domains, as soon as the grounds for relocation cease to exist. When such return is not possible, as determined by agreement or through appropriate procedures, ICCs/IPs shall be provided in all possible cases with lands of quality and legal status at least equal to that of the land previously occupied by them, suitable to provide for their present needs and future development. Persons thus relocated shall likewise be fully compensated for any resulting loss or injury;</b><br><br></li><li><i>Right in Case of Displacement</i>. - In case displacement occurs as a result of natural catastrophes, the State shall endeavor to resettle the displaced ICCs/IPs in suitable areas where they can have temporary life support systems: <i>Provided</i>, That the displaced ICCs/IPs shall have the right to return to their abandoned lands until such time that the normalcy and safety of such lands shall be determined: <i>Provided, further</i>, That should their ancestral domain cease to exist and normalcy and safety of the previous settlements are not possible, displaced ICCs/IPs shall enjoy security of tenure over lands to which they have been resettled: <i>Provided, furthermore</i>, That basic services and livelihood shall be provided to them to ensure that their needs are adequately addressed;<br><br></li><li><i>Right to Regulate Entry of Migrants</i>. - Right to regulate the entry of migrant settlers and organizations into the domains;<br><br></li><li><i>Right to Safe and Clean Air and Water</i>. - For this purpose, the ICCs/IPs shall have access to integrated systems for the management of their inland waters and air space;<br><br></li><li><i>Right to Claim Parts of Reservations</i>. - The right to claim parts of the ancestral domains which have been reserved for various purposes, except those reserved and intended for common and public welfare and service; and<br><br></li><li><i>Right to Resolve Conflict</i>. - Right to resolve land conflicts in accordance with customary laws of the area where the land is located, and only in default thereof shall the complaints be submitted to amicable settlement and to the Courts of Justice whenever necessary. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></li></ol></blockquote>More significantly, the aforequoted provision provides that the right to ancestral domain carries with it the right to "stay in the territory and not to be removed therefrom." And the CADT was issued notwithstanding the existence of Presidential Proclamation No. 1578, which recognized the existence of private rights already extant at the time. Thus, although the issuance of the CADT in favor of the Tagbanua ICC to develop, control, manage, and utilize Calauit does not affect the propriety or impropriety of the execution of the <i>Resettlement Agreements <b>per se</b></i>, the same, however, gainsays the avowed consequence of said contracts, that is, to remove and transfer the settlers from Calauit to the resettlement areas in Halsey and Burabod.<br><br>Verily, in <i>Gancho-on v. Secretary of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this Court emphasized that:<br><blockquote>It is a rule of universal application, almost, that courts of justice constituted to pass upon substantial rights will not consider questions in which no actual interests are involved; they decline jurisdiction of moot cases. And where the issue has become moot and academic, there is no justiciable controversy, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value. There is no actual substantial relief to which petitioners would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>From the above pronouncement, there is no justiciable controversy anymore in the instant petition in view of the issuance of CADT. There is no longer any purpose in determining whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the Decision of the RTC since any declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value.<br><br>Clearly, any decision of this Court on the present petition, whether it be an affirmance or a reversal of the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals, would be equivalent in effect to an affirmance or an invalidation of the challenged Decision of the RTC. But the Office of the President's issuance of a 2008 <i>Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title</i> in favor of the settlers, including the petitioners, negates the need to resolve the issues raised in the <i>Complaint</i> and <i>Answer with Counterclaims</i> - whether or not the petitioners may be compelled to vacate Calauit by virtue of their obligations enumerated in the <i>Resettlement Agreements</i>.<br><br>The issuance by the respondent of CADT No. R04-BUS-0308-062 over 3,683.2324 (the entire area subject of the <i>Resettlement Agreements</i>) in favor of the settlers, including the petitioners, provide their occupation and/or settlement on the subject land an apparent color of authority at the very least by virtue of Republic Act No. 8371. Precisely, under the law, a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title "refers to a title formally recognizing the rights of possession and ownership of ICCs/[Indigenous Peoples (IPs)] over their ancestral domains<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> identified and delineated in accordance with [the] law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Therefore, the settlers continued stay in Calauit has become a non-issue. As such, any discussion on the matter of the propriety of the Resettlement Agreements and their effects would be mere surplusage.<br><br>Although the moot and academic principle admits of certain exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> none are applicable in this case.<br><br>But emphasis must be made that the disposition of the instant petition does not at all touch on the propriety or impropriety of the issuance of the CADT. Such a question is not for this Court to take on at this time as, in fact, it is not raised herein.<br><br>Relative to the recent prayer of the petitioners that they be awarded individual titles of ownership over portions of Calauit as the issuance of CADT in favor of the Tagbanua ICC amounts to an affirmation and recognition of the property rights of their ancestors from whom they trace their present individual claims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court points out that under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 8371, individual members of cultural communities, with respect to individually owned ancestral lands, the option to secure title to the same must be done in accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, or the Land Registration Act 496.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the issues invoked by the parties no longer need to be discussed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the April 24, 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
