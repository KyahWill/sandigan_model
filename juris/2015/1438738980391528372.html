Riconalla, Trisebal Q. Aguilar, Arman N. Lorenzo, Sr. and Pedro C. Gunting (Aranjuez, <i>et al.</i>) are officers and members of <i>Nagkahiusang Mamumuo sa</i> Davao City Water District (NAMADACWAD). They were charged with several administrative cases due to acts committed during the anniversary celebration of DCWD such as wearing of t-shirts with inscriptions and posting of bond papers outside the designated places. The inscriptions and postings bore employees' grievances.<br><br>The records show that as early as 16 May 2007, the members and officers of NAMADACWAD have been staging pickets in front of the DCWD Office during their lunch breaks to air their grievances about the non-payment of their Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentives and their opposition to DCWD's privatization and proposed One Hundred Million Peso Loan.<br><br>On 31 October 2007, GM Gamboa issued an Office Memorandum addressed to all department managers concerning the different activities that would take place during DCWD's then upcoming anniversary celebration. The Memorandum reads:<br><blockquote>Please be informed that the opening activities of our 34<sup>th</sup> anniversary this coming 09 November 2007 are the motorcade and the fun run. The assembly area will be at the Victoria Plaza Mall parking, in front of Cynthia's Lechon Hauz, 6:00 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>In view of this, everybody is expected to be there except only those who are assigned as a skeletal force. All carpool vehicles are also enjoined to proceed at the said area. The participants are free to wear any sports attire. Further, you are advised to sign in the attendance sheet provided by the HRD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>On 8 November 2007, the officers and members of NAMADACWAD held an Emergency General Assembly and they agreed to wear NAMADACWAD t-shirts with inscriptions stating, "CNA Incentive <i>Ihatag Na, Dir. Braganza Pahawa Na</i>!" on the day of the anniversary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Came the anniversary, officers and members sported t-shirts with inscriptions "CNA Incentive <i>Ihatag Na, Dir. Braganza Pahawa Na</i>!" at the beginning of the Fun Run at Victoria Plaza at around 6:30 in the morning and continued to wear the same inside the premises of the DCWD office during the office hours. Also, one of the members of the Board of Directors of NAMADACWAD Gregorio S. Cagula (Cagula), with the help of some of its members, attached similar inscriptions and posters of employees' grievances to a post in the motor pool area, an area not among the officially designated places<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for posting of grievances as prescribed by DCWD's Office Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated 8 February 1996 and pursuant to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 33,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Series of 1994 (MC No. 33).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>As a consequence of their actions, GM Gamboa sent a Memorandum dated 14 November 2007 addressed to the officers and members of NAMADACWAD, requiring them to explain the reasons for the attire they wore during the anniversary celebration. Through a collective letter dated 19 November 2007, the officers and members explained that the Memorandum only required the employees to wear any sports attire, though theirs were with additional inscriptions containing grievances. They countered that the inscriptions were but manifestations of their constitutional rights of free speech and freedom.of expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 23 November 2007, another Memorandum was sent to the officers of NAMADACWAD requiring them to explain within 72-hours why they should not be held liable for the actions committed by Cagula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Finding <i>prima facie</i> case against them, GM Gamboa filed formal charges against the officers and members of NAMADACWAD as follow:<br><ol><li>For DCWD Administrative Case No. 34-2007 against the officials of NAMADACWAD for violation of Existing Civil Service Law and Rules of Serious Nature defined under Section 46 [12], Book V of Executive Order No. 292,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in relation to Rule IV, Section 52 B [4] of the Civil Service Resolution No. 991936<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 31, 1999 and Civil Service Resolution No. 021316<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated October 11, 2002 and MC No. 33 dated October 21, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br></li><li>For DCWD Administrative Case Nos. 11-2007 to 33-2007 and 35-2007 to 44-2007 involving the individual members of NAMADACWAD for violation of Existing Civil Service Law and Rules of Serious Nature defined under Section 46 [12], Book V of Executive Order No. 292,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in relation to Rule IV, Section 52 B [4] of the Civil Service Resolution No. 991936 dated August 31, 1999 and Civil Service Resolution No. 021316 dated October 11, 2002.<br></li></ol>After giving those concerned the opportunity to explain through several hearings and submission of additional evidence, the Hearing Committee, through the authority given by DCWD to hear the administrative charges, filed on 14 March 2008 its Consolidated Resolution and Recommendation finding the officers and members of the NAMADACWAD guilty as charged with penalties ranging from suspension to dismissal from service with all accessory penalties under the CSC Law and Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 19 March 2008, GM Gamboa issued several Orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> adopting the recommendation submitted by the Hearing Committee but modifying some of the corresponding penalties in view of mitigating circumstances such as <i>first infraction</i> and <i>substantial justice</i>. However, three officials namely Rodrigo L. Aranjuez, Cagula and Celestino A.

The Motion for Reconsideration was thereafter submitted for resolution after the Hearing Committee waived the filing of a Comment. On 17 April 2008, the Motion was denied by DCWD.<br><br>On 2 May 2008, Aranjuez, <i>et al</i>., filed an appeal before the CSC bringing up, among other issues, the violation of their constitutional rights to assemble and petition for redress of grievances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In its Comment, DCWD defended the Orders on the basis of Section 6 of CSC Resolution No. 021316<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which provides that the concerted activity like the participation of the officers and employees during the fun run wearing t-shirts with inscriptions was prohibited because it was done during office hours; Moreover, the act of Cagula in posting papers with grievances outside the designated areas was a clear violation of MC No. 33 in relation to 8 February 1996 Office Memorandum. It was submitted that due to Cagula's membership in the Board of Directors of NAMADACWAD, the other officers were solidarity responsible for his actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>CSC Resolution</i></b><br></center><br>On 14 January 2009, CSC issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> partly granting the consolidated appeal and held that the collective act of respondents in wearing t-shirts with grievance inscriptions during office hours was not within the ambit of the definition of prohibited mass action punishable under CSC Resolution 021316 since there was no intent to cause work stoppage. However, though not prohibited under the Resolution, the act was considered as an offense punishable under "Violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations." CSC further ruled that Cagula's act of posting of grievances outside the designated areas was a clear violation of MC No. 33. By reason of Cagula's position, the other officers of NAMADACWAD were considered as having agreed and conspired to commit the said act and as such are as liable as Cagula.<br><br>On the other hand, and contrary to the assertions of DCWD, the violations committed by the private respondents are not serious in nature due to the lack of any abusive, vulgar, defamatory or libelous language. The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Consolidated Appeal filed by Rodrigo L. Aranjuez, <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span>. is PARTLY GRANTED.

A prohibited concerted activity must be one undertaken by government employees, by themselves or through their association, with the intent of effecting work stoppage or service disruption, in order to realize their demands or force concessions. In the case at hand, we can readily observe that respondent's participation in the fun run, as well as their behavior inside the premises of DCWD office during the regular working hours of that day indicate a complete absence of any intention on their part to effect a work stoppage or disturbance. In fact, as attested by both parlies, all the respondents participated with the planned activities and festivities on that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court was likewise in agreement with the CSC which considered as simple violation of office rules the posting of banners outside the designated posting areas by Cagula. Also like the CSC, it ruled that such offense is not punishable with the penalty of dismissal.<br><br>The DCWD is now before us still with its basic arguments, though rephrased:<br><br><center>I.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> failed to rule on the issue whether or not the respondents' Consolidated Appeal filed before the CSC was sufficient in form and substance.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred in ruling that the concerted mass action on November 9, 2007 was not prohibited under Resolution No. 021316.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred in ruling that Resolution No. 021316 and MC No. 33 are considered "reasonable office rules and regulations" within the purview of Section 52 C [3] of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred in ruling that respondents' act of posting white bond papers with union-related inscriptions on their t-shirts while inside the office premises does not constitute serious violation of Civil Service Rules but only a violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations, despite the fact that the said Memorandum Circular No. 33 is a CSC-issued Memorandum and not DCWD-issued Rules.<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred in ruling that MC No. 33 was not violated by respondent Gregorio S. Cagula and the rest of the officials of NAMADACWAD who were charged in DCWD Administrative case No. 34-2007.<br><br><center>VI.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred in not taking into consideration that respondents Aranjuez, Cagula and Bondoc were second-time offenders who were previously charged and penalized for violation of MC No. 33, thereby justifying their dismissal from the service.<br><br><center>VII.<br></center><br>The <i>court a quo</i> erred when it failed to rule on the issue of whether the decisions of a government agency, acting as Disciplining Authority, in disciplinary cases are immediately executory upon receipt thereof.<br><br><center><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The Court finds no merit in the petition.<br><br>Prefatorily, DCWD contends that the appeal of Aranjuez, <i>et al.</i>, should have been dismissed by the CSC for non-compliance with Section 46 of CSC Resolution No. 991936, particularly their failure to file a notice of appeal, their failure to show proof of payment of the appeal fee and the petition's invalid verification and certification of non-forum shopping.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Though the appeal before the CSC lacked a notice of appeal as required by CSC Resolution No. 991936 or the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Consolidated Memorandum filed by the private respondents was enough to be considered as a sufficient compliance with the rules. The Memorandum delineates the errors asserted against DCWD and the discussions supporting their arguments. We find merit in the sufficiency of the Memorandum rather than strict compliance in view of the constitutional right of every employee to security of tenure. A more relevant consideration of public interest is accorded whenever the merits of a case collide with rigid application of the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Further, we find that the Civil Service Commission, the agency directly concerned, the ruling of which was upheld by the Court of Appeals on review, correctly exercised jurisdiction over respondent's appeal from the decision of petitioner DCWD, thereby ruling against, if <i>sub silentio</i>, the argument of petitioner that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of proof of payment of appeal. The Civil Service Commission and the Court of Appeals considered the procedural issue raised by petitioner as a surmountable bar to the resolution of the main issue of respondents' constitutional right to free expression<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as amplified with specificity by their guaranteed right as workers to peaceful concerted activity and their entitlement to security of tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The decisions of the Civil Service Commission and the Court of Appeals are squarely supported by <i>Adalim v. Taniñas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> stating that:<br><blockquote>In a number of cases, we upheld the CSC's decision relaxing its procedural rules to render substantial justice. The Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service themselves provide that administrative investigations shall be conducted without strict recourse to the technical rules of procedure and evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The case before the CSC involves the security of tenure of public employees protected by the Constitution. Public interest requires a resolution of the merits of the appeal instead of dismissing the same based on a rigid application of the CSC Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, both the CSC and the CA properly allowed respondent employees' appeal despite procedural lapses to resolve the issue on the merits.<br></blockquote>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> this Court pronounced that technical rules of procedure are not ends in themselves but primarily devised and designed to help in the proper and expedient dispensation of justice. In appropriate cases, therefore, the rules may have to be so construed liberally as to meet and advance the cause of substantial justice. While it is desirable that the rules of procedure are faithfully and even meticulously observed, courts should not be so strict about procedural lapses that do not really impair the proper administration of justice. If the rules are intended to ensure the orderly conduct of litigation, it is because of the higher objective they seek which is the protection of substantive rights of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Substantial justice, in other words must prevail. In <i>Paler</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> We said:<br><blockquote>When substantial justice dictates it, procedural rules may be relaxed in order to arrive at a just disposition of a case. The purpose behind limiting the period of appeal is to avoid unreasonable delay in the administration of justice and to put an end to controversies. A one-day delay as in this case, does not justify denial of the appeal where there is absolutely no indication of intent to delay as in this case, does not justify denial of the appeal where there is absolutely no indication of intent to delay justice on the pail of Paler and the pleading is meritorious on its face.<br></blockquote>We rule in favor of the allowance of respondents' appeal because:<br><blockquote>Law and jurisprudence grant to courts the prerogative to relax compliance with procedural rules of <b>even the most mandatory character</b>, mindful of the duty to reconcile both the need to put an end to litigation speedily and the parties' right to an opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Quoting again the case of <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we pointed out that this Court can temper rigid rules in favor of substantial justice. We find that pronouncement apt and fit to this case. Thereby we are not detained by the omissions of the respondents in their resort to the CSC, and we thus proceed to the merits of the petitioners' submissions.<br><br>Lastly, on the form, we find no merit in the contention that Aranjuez was not authorized to sign on behalf of the other petitioners. Pursuant to Union Resolution No. 015-2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> attached as Annex A to the Appellants' 015-2008 Consolidated Memorandum dated 26 March 2008, the officers and members of NAMDACWAD gave Aranjuez a general authority to represent the organization in all legal matters to be filed for whatever purpose it may serve. From the general and broad grant of authority, Aranjuez possessed the specific authority to sign in behalf of his principal the verification and certification against non-forum shopping required of the petition.<br><br>To the kernel, then.<br><br>DCWD primarily contends that CSC and the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the concerted mass action on 9 November 2007 is not prohibited under Resolution No. 021316. We disagree.<br><br>DCWD relies on Resolution No. 021316, which states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 6.</b> <i>Permissible Concerted Mass Action</i>. - A concerted activity or mass action done outside of government office hours shall not be deemed a prohibited concerted activity or mass action within the contemplation of this omnibus rules provided the same shall not occasion or result in the disruption of work or service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>DCWD argues that since the concerted or mass action was done within government office hours, such act was not permissible, therefore prohibited. Otherwise stated, a concerted activity done within the regular government office hours is automatically a violation of Section 6 of the Resolution.<br><br>Notably, however, a prohibited concerted mass action is defined not in Sec. 6 of Resolution No. 021316 but in Sec. 5 thereof. Thus:<br><blockquote><b>Section 5.</b> <i>Definition of Prohibited Concerted Mass Action</i>. - As used in this Omnibus Rules, the phrase "prohibited concerted activity or mass action" shall be understood to refer to any collective activity undertaken by government employees, by themselves or through their employees organizations, <b>with the intent of effecting work stoppage or service disruption in order to realize their demands of force concession, economic or otherwise, from their respective agencies or the government</b>. It shall include mass leaves, walkouts, pickets and acts of similar nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis ours).<br></blockquote>The operative phrases are "any collective activity" and "work stoppage or service disruption." Without the intent at work stoppage or service disruption, the concerted activity is not prohibited. The time and place of the activity are not determinative of the prohibition. Whether done within government hours, a concerted activity is allowed if it is without any intent at work stoppage.<br><br>We cannot isolate the provision of Section 6 of the Resolution from definition of prohibited activity in Section 5 thereof. It is erroneous to interpret the provisions in such a way that an act not within the circumstances as defined under Section 5 can still be regarded as prohibited if done within government hours. To subscribe to the argument of DCWD would in effect expand the definition provided by Resolution No. 021316 on what constitutes a prohibited mass action.<br><br>It is clear that the collective activity of joining the fun run in t-shirts with inscriptions on CNA incentives was not to effect work stoppage or disrupt the service. As pointed out by the respondents, they followed the advice of GM Gamboa "to be there" at the fun run. Respondents joined, and did not disrupt the fun run. They were in sports attire that they were allowed, nay required, to wear. Else, government employees would be deprived of their constitutional right to freedom of expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This, then, being the fact, we have to rule against the findings of both the CSC and Court of Appeals that the wearing of t-shirts with grievance inscriptions constitutes as a violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations.<br><br>First off and as correctly pointed out by the charged officials and members in their 19 November 2007 Reply Letter to DCWD, they did not violate the 31 October 2007 Office Memorandum issued by GM Gamboa relating to the proper attire to be worn during the fun run. The Office Memorandum was clear in its order that the participants are free to wear any sports attire during the event. To reiterate, the t-shirts they wore fall within the description of "any sports attire" that the Memorandum allowed to be worn.<br><br>More importantly we need to refer to <i>GSIS v. Villaviza (GSIS case)</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It was there ruled that the acts of GSIS employees wearing similarly colored shirts while attending a public hearing inside the GSIS Office, with clenching of fists and orating against the then President Winston Garcia, were not constitutive of a prohibited activity but were only an exercise of their constitutional freedom of expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We repeat:<br><blockquote>In this case, CSC found that the acts of respondents in going to the GSIS-IU office wearing red shirts to witness a public hearing do not amount to a concerted activity or mass action proscribed above. CSC even added that their actuations can be deemed an exercise of their constitutional right to freedom of expression. The CA found no cogent reason to deviate therefrom.<br><br>As defined in Section 5 of CSC Resolution No. 02-1316 which serves to regulate the political rights of those in the government service, the concerted activity or mass action proscribed must be coupled with the "intent of effecting work stoppage or service disruption in order to realize their demands of force concession." Wearing similarly colored shirts, attending a public hearing at the GSIS-IU office, bringing with them recording gadgets, clenching their fists, some even badmouthing the guards and PGM Garcia, are acts not constitutive of an (i) intent to effect work stoppage or service disruption and (ii) for the purpose of realizing their demands or force concession.<br><br>Precisely, the limitations or qualifications found in Section 5 of CSC Resolution No. 02-1316 are there to temper and focus the application of such prohibition. Not all collective activity or mass undertaking of government employees is prohibited. Otherwise, we would be totally depriving our brothers and sisters in the government service of their constitutional right to freedom of expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>DCWD also found that Cagula and the rest of the officials violated MC No. 33 in relation to 8 February 1996 Office Memorandum. DCWD also argues that a violation of this circular constitutes as a serious violation of CSC Rules as the circular is a CSC-issued Memorandum and not just a mere issuance of DCWD.<br><br>CSC issued MC No. 33 in recognition of the rights of the government employees to air their grievances balanced by the delivery of services to the public which should not be prejudiced. MC No. 33 sets down rules governing the posting of posters and other similar materials within the premises of government agencies as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>All head of agencies are hereby directed to provide specific spaces within their respective premises, preferably near the bundy clock, at the canteen or places normally frequented by employees, where employees' unions/associations could post their posters.<br></li><li>x x x.<br></li><li>The hanging of posters and streamers shall only be allowed in the designated areas.<br></li><li>No poster, placard, streamer or other similar materials containing abusive, vulgar, defamatory or libelous language shall be allowed.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Pursuant to this mandate, the former General Manager of DCWD issued an office memorandum designating the bulletin board at the motorpool area below the Office of the Purchasing Division and the side of the office building beside the guard house where the bundy clock is located as the designated areas for posting of grievances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Clearly, the DCWD Office Memorandum hews close and faithfully to MC No. 33. It is a reasonable rule issued by the heads of the agencies in order to regulate posting of grievances of the employees.<br><br>It is correct to conclude that those who enter government service are subjected to a different degree of limitation on their freedom to speak their mind; however, it is not tantamount to the relinquishment of their constitutional right of expression otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of their employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Unarguably, a citizen who accepts public employment "must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom." But there are some rights and freedoms so fundamental to liberty that they cannot be bargained away in a contract for public employment. It is the Court's responsibility to ensure that citizens are not deprived of these fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The <i>GSIS case</i> pronounced:<br><blockquote>Government workers, whatever their ranks, have as much right as any person in the land to voice out their protests against what they believe to be a violation of their rights and interests. Civil Service does not deprive them of their freedom of expression. It would be unfair to hold that by joining the government service, the members thereof have renounced or waived this basic liberty. This freedom can be reasonably regulated only but can never be taken away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>In simple paraphrase we say, regulation of the freedom of expression is not removal of the constitutional right.<br><br>Apparently, DCWD, not satisfied by the CSC ruling that a violation of the memorandum is punishable with reprimand, argues that what occurred was a serious violation implying that a higher penalty is warranted.<br><br>Under Section 52 (C) (3), Rule IV of Resolution No. 991936,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> violation of reasonable office rules and regulations is punishable with reprimand on the first offense and suspension ranging from one to thirty days for the second offense.<br><br>In <i>Re: Failure of Various Employees to Register their Time of Arrival and/or Departure from Office in the Chronolog Machine</i>, the charged court employees were penalized for violation of reasonable office rules and regulations due to their violation of Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 36-2001 requiring all employees to register their daily attendance, in the Chronolog Time Recorder Machine (CTRM) and in the logbook of their respective offices. Following Resolution No. 991936 that violation of reasonable rules and regulations is a light offense, the Court penalized its erring employees with the penalty of reprimand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Thus, in line with the civil service rules and jurisprudence, we conclude that a violation of an office memorandum, which was issued as an internal rule to regulate the area for posting of grievances inside the office premise, is only a light offense punishable by reprimand.<br><br>Rules and regulations are issued to attain harmony, smooth operation, maximize efficiency and productivity, with the ultimate objective of realizing the functions of particular offices and agencies of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On the submissions that the decisions of a government agency, acting as Disciplining Authority, are immediately executory upon receipt thereof, we need merely cite Section 37 of the Resolution No. 991936 which clearly provides that:<br><blockquote><b>Section 37.</b> <i>Finality of Decisions</i>. — A decision rendered by heads of agencies whereby a penalty of suspension for not more than thirty (30) days or a fine in an amount not exceeding thirty (30) days' salary is imposed, shall be final and executory. However, if the penalty imposed is suspension exceeding thirty (30) days, or fine in an amount exceeding thirty (30) days salary, the same shall be final and executory after the lapse of the reglementary period for filing a motion for reconsideration or an appeal and no such pleading has been filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>As distinguished by the law, if the imposed suspension exceeds thirty days or the fine imposed is in an amount over thirty-day salary, the decision will only attain finality after the lapse of the reglementary period in the absence of any motion for reconsideration or appeal. Penalties within the 30-day threshold are immediately executor penalties.<br><br>In this case, the members and officials, except the casual employees who were not meted with penalty as the renewal of their employment was held in abeyance, were sanctioned with penalties ranging from suspension of work from one (1) month and one (1) day to dismissal from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Evidently, the finality and execution of the judgment did not take place after the lapse of the reglementary period because as previously discussed, the members and officials were able to file their consolidated appeal in lieu of notice of appeal.<br><br>As clear as the provision on the finality of decisions is Section 42 of Resolution No. 991936 on the effect of motions for reconsideration. Thus:<br><blockquote><b>Section 42.</b> <i>Effect of Filing</i>. — The filing of a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days <b>shall stay the execution</b> of the decision sought to be reconsidered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The first and fundamental duty of the Court is to apply the law. If the law is clear and free from any doubt or ambiguity as the quoted provision, there is no room for construction or interpretation.

This court held that such act was not constitutive of a prohibited activity but only an exercise of their constitutional right to freedom of expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The ponencia mentioned the government employees' limited right to freedom of expression as follows:<br><blockquote>It is correct to conclude that those who enter government service are subjected to a different degree of limitation on their freedom to speak their mind; however, it is not tantamount to the relinquishment of their constitutional right of expression otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of their employment. Unarguably, a citizen who accepts public employment "must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom."

Civil Service does not deprive them of their freedom of expression. It would be unfair to hold that by joining the government service, the members thereof have renounced or waived this basic liberty. This freedom can be reasonably regulated only but can never be taken away.<br></blockquote>In simple paraphrase we say, regulation of the freedom of expression is not removal of constitutional right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Freedom to express one's views enjoys a level of primacy among our constitutional guarantees, but it has never been considered to be absolute and immune from reasonable regulation. However, there is always a higher degree of judicial review of regulation that affects speech to ensure, among others, that it does not amount to a disguised form of censorship or that its exercise does not burden the same exercise of the same rights by others. Even civil service regulations should hew closely to the parameters of the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution.<br><br>Exercising one's right to air grievances in relation to employment in the public sector, as in this case, should also be given protection but with the added requirement that the exercise of the guarantee of freedom to express does not unduly deter the government agency's primary functions.<br><br>Thus, the pronouncements in this case must be limited only to its context, that is, expressions in t-shirts during the office anniversary where there was no showing that that exercise obstructed or eroded the public functions of the government agency involved.<br><br>In the determination of the extent of the exercise of this fundamental freedom, the nature of the government agencies where there may be some employment grievances should be taken into consideration. There are some, like the uniformed military and police services requiring a greater degree of discipline within its ranks, where certain forms of expression—not part of the ambient facts of this case—may not be constitutionally permissible.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Republic Act No. 875 known as the Industrial Peace Act was passed in 1953 in order to, among others, "eliminate the causes of industrial unrest by encouraging and protecting the exercise by employees of their right to self-organization for the purpose of collective bargaining and for the promotion of their moral, social, and economic well-being."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This early law prohibited government employees from engaging in strikes to secure changes in their employment terms and conditions:<br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <b><i>Prohibition Against Strikes in the Government</i></b>.—The terms and conditions of employment in the Government, including any political subdivision ot instrumentality thereof, are governed by law and it is declared to be the policy of this Act that employees therein shall not strike for the purpose of securing changes or modification in their terms and conditions of employment, Such employees may belong to any-labor organization which does not impose the obligation to strike or to join in strike: Provided, however, <b><i>That this section shall apply only to employees employed in governmental functions and not to those employed in proprietary functions of the Government including but not limited to governmental corporations.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The last sentence differentiates between employees of government bodies that exercise governmental functions, and employees of those that exercise proprietary functions such as government corporations.

They shall endeavor to discourage wrong perceptions of their roles as dispensers or peddlers of undue patronage.<br><br>(c) Justness and sincerity. - Public officials and employees shall remain true to the people at all times. They must act with justness and sincerity and shall not discriminate against anyone, especially the poor and the underprivileged. They shall at all times respect the rights of others, and shall refrain from doing acts contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy, public order, public safety and public interest.

While public benefit and public welfare, particularly, the promotion of the economic and social development of Central Luzon, may be attributable to the operation of the BCDA, yet it is certain that the functions performed by the BCDA are basically proprietary in nature. The promotion of economic and social development of Central Luzon, in particular, and the country's goal for enhancement, in general, do not make the BCDA equivalent to the Government. Other corporations have been created by government to act as its agents for the realization of its programs, the SSS, GSIS, NAWASA and the NIA, to count a few, and yet, the Court has ruled that these entities, although performing functions aimed at promoting public interest and public welfare, are not government-function corporations invested with governmental attributes. <b><i>It may thus be said that the BCDA is not a mere agency of the Government but a corporate body performing proprietary functions.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Government-Owned and controlled corporations also exercising proprietary functions, not "mere agenc[ies] of the Government," should thus have a wider scope of freedom of expression compared to other, government agencies.<br><br><i>GSIS v.

Lopoz: But the question is, did you see somebody who posted those posters?</u><br><br><u>Ms. Dumalag: Those were posted already.</u><br><br><u>Atty. Lopoz: Did vou see who posted these?</u> <br><br><u>Ms. Dumalag: I cannot recall, but...</u><br><br><u>Atty. Lopoz: Okay, thank you. So you cannot recall and perhaps by your recollection as you have mentioned earlier that the pictures would tell. So you somehow presumed that somebody from those people you have taken pictures posted that posters?</u><br><br><u>Ms. Dumalag: I did.</u><br><br><center>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br>(Emphasis ours)<br></center></blockquote>DCWD concluded that the photographs showed a "sequence of events" constituting "substantial evidence xxx that respondent Gregorio S. Cagula was responsible to the posting of banner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This finding is erroneous and contradicts the record. There is no showing what type of camera Dumalag used but she was on the scene. One photograph shows Cagula and two other persons "standing close to one another facing the post." Another photograph shows that "after they left the post," the poster was "already attached to the post." Assuming the photographs were indeed taken in sequence and for some reason Dumalag was unable to take photographs of the actual posting, she was on the scene and should have witnessed who actually attached the poster. However, her testimony is that she cannot "recall," as a result of which she merely presumed it was one of "those people," meaning the three, among them Cagula.<br><br><i>Other Posters Inside DCWD's Premises</i><br><br>Leonida, the other employee who took the pictures showing posters attached to a post inside the premises of DCWD but outside the designated areas, testified that he did not see who attached the union posters. Leonida testified on cross-examination:<br><blockquote>Atty. Lopoz: Na na'ay nakapilit sa poste na coupon bond, ikaw ba ng nagpicture ani (<i><u>That there was a coupon bond posted in the post</u></i>)?<br><br>Mr. Leonida: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Atty. Lopoz: Sa atoa pa, nakita ka kung kinsa ang nagbutang ana (<i><u>Or in other words, you saw who placed that</u></i>)?<br><br>Mr. Leonida: Wala (<i><u>No</u></i>), Sir.<br><br>Atty. Lopoz: So imoha lang gyud gi-pikturan na nakapilit na siya (<i><u>So you just purely took pictures when it was already posted</u></i>)?<br><br>Mr. Leonida: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Atty. Lopoz: Pero wala gyud ka nakakita kung kinsa gyud nagbutang ana (<i><u>But you actually did not see who placed that</u></i>)?<br><br>Mr. Leonida: Yes, Sir.<br><br><center>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br>(Underscoring in the original)</center></blockquote>The DCWD Administrative Committee itself found that no one saw who posted in this area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Like Dumalag, Leonida admitted that he only took the pictures when the posters were already attached. For that matter, considering that there is no testimonial or physical evidence shown that Cagula or any other NAMADACWAD member attached the union posters outside designated areas, there is no basis to hold them liable in violation of Memorandum Circular No. 33.<br><br><b><i>Individual liability for unlawful acts in a mass action</i></b><br><br>Even assuming for the sake of argument that Cagula or any other NAMADACWAD member indeed attached the union posters outside the designated areas, the conclusion that "NAMADACWAD and its officials are responsible for an act of any of its officials or members"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is wrong as a matter of law.<br><br>Liability for unlawful or prohibited acts committed in a strike or other concerted mass action is legally determined <b><i>individually</i></b>, not collectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Article 277<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Labor Code does not hold the officers of a union responsible for an illegal act of another officer:<br><blockquote>Art. 277. Prohibited activities.<br><br>(a) No labor organization or employer shall declare a strike or lockout without first having bargained collectively in accordance with Title VII of this Book or without first having filed the notice required in the preceding Article or without the necessary strike or lockout vote first having been obtained and reported to the Ministry.<br><br>No strike or lockout shall be declared after assumption of jurisdiction by the President or the Minister or after certification or submission of the dispute to compulsory or voluntary arbitration or during the pendency of cases involving the same grounds for the strike or lockout.<br><br>Any worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence of any unlawful lockout shall be entitled to reinstatement with full backwages. <u>Any union officer who knowingly participates in an illegal strike and any worker or union officer who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during a strike may be declared to have lost his employment status</u>: Provided, That mere participation of a worker in a lawful strike shall not constitute sufficient ground for termination of his employment, even if a replacement had been hired by the employer during such lawful strike. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>A strike or mass action which is legal does not become illegal merely because it is tainted by prohibited acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Here, there was no prohibited mass action, and thus the union officers who wore shirts with the inscription were not held liable. Further, the alleged prohibited act of posting is not proven.<br><br>A reprimand is a public and formal censure or severe reproof administered to a person at fault by his superior officer or a body to which he belongs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Although a reprimand may be a slight form of penalty, it still goes into the record of the employee. It is unjust to impose even the slightest form of penalty to an employee, whether or not in the government, where the alleged infraction is not proven with substantial evidence.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to DISMISS the petition. For the reasons stated, I respectfully submit that we exonerate respondent Cagula and all other respondent union officers from the charge of attaching the union posters outside the designated areas.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 223-226.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rules to Govern Posting and Hanging of Posters, Placards, Streamers and Other Similar Materials</i> (1994).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures;<br><br>(2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;<br><br>(3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion;<br><br>(4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;<br><br>(5) When the findings of fact are conflicting;<br><br>(6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;<br><br>(7) When the findings are contrary to those of the trial court;<br><br>(8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;<br><br>(9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents;<br><br>(10) When the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and<br><br>(11) When the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<br><br>[<i>Cirtek Employees Labor Union v.
