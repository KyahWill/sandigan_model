When arraigned, the petitioners pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br><br>The prosecution presented twenty (20) witnesses to prove the crime charged. Their testimonies are summarized as follows:<br><br>At around 3:20 o'clock in the morning of January 14, 2006, the victim Marlon Villanueva (<i>Villanueva</i>) was brought to the emergency room of Dr. Jose P. Rizal District Hospital (<i>JP Rizal Hospital</i>). Dr. Ramon Masilungan (<i>Dr. Masilungan</i>), who was then the attending physician at the emergency room, observed that Villanueva was motionless, not breathing and had no heartbeat. Dr. Masilungan tried to revive Villanueva for about 15 to 30 minutes. Villanueva, however, did not respond to the resuscitation and was pronounced dead. Dr. Masilungan noticed a big contusion hematoma on the left side of the victim's face and several injuries on his arms and legs. He further attested that Villanueva's face was cyanotic, meaning that blood was no longer running through his body due to lack of oxygen; and when he pulled down Villanueva's pants, he saw large cpntusions on both legs, which extended from the upper portion of the thighs, down to the couplexial portion, or back of the knees.<br><br>Dr. Masilungan disclosed that two (2) men brought Villanueva to the hospital. The two told him that they found Villanueva lying motionless on the ground at a store in Brgy. Pansol, Calamba City, and brought him to the hospital. When he asked them where they came from, one of them answered that they came from Los Ba√±os, Laguna, <i>en route</i> to San Pablo City. He questioned them on how they found Villanueva, when the latter was in Brgy. Pansol, Calamba City. One of the men just said that they were headed somewhere else.<br><br>Dr. Masilungan reduced his findings in a medico-legal report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Due to the nature, extent and location of the injuries, he opined that Villanueva was a victim of hazing. He was familiar with hazing injuries because he had undergone hazing himself when he was a student and also because of his experience in treating victims of hazing incidents.<br><br>Dr. Roy Camarillo (<i>Dr. Camarillo</i>), Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory (<i>PNP-CL</i>) in Region IV, Camp Vicente Lim, Canlubang, Calamba City, testified that he performed an autopsy on the body of Villanueva on January 14, 2006 and placed down his findings in an autopsy report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Upon examination of the body, he found various external injuries in the head, trunk and extremities. There were thirty-three (33) external injuries, with various severity and nature. He concluded that the cause of death was subdural hemorrhage due to head injury contusion-hematoma. Based on multiple injuries and contusions on the body, and his previous examinations of hazing injuries, Dr. Camarillo opined that these injuries were hazing-related. During the autopsy, he retrieved two (2) matchsticks from the cadaver with the marking of Alpha Phi Omega (<i>APO</i>) Fratemity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Susan Ignacio (<i>Ignacio</i>) was the owner of the <i>sari-sari</i> store located at Purok 5, Pansol, Calamba City, in front of Villa Novaliches Resort, which was barely ten steps away. On January 13, 2006, at around 8:30 to 9:00 o'clock in the evening, she was tending her store when she saw a jeepney with more than twenty (20) persons arrive at the resort. Ignacio identified Dungo as the person seated beside the driver of the jeepney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> She estimated the ages of these persons in the group to be between 20 to 30 years old. They were in civilian clothes, while the other men wore white long-sleeved shirts. Before entering the resort, the men and women shook hands and embraced each other. Three (3) persons, riding on a single motorcycle, also arrived at the resort.<br><br>Ignacio saw about fifteen (15) persons gather on top of the terrace of the resort who looked like they were praying, and then the lights of the resort were turned off. Later that evening, at least three (3) of these persons went to her store to buy some items. During her testimony, she was shown photographs and she identified Christopher Braseros and Sibal as two of those who went to her store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It was only on the morning of January 14, 2006 that she learned from the policemen visiting the resort that the deceased person was Villanueva.<br><br>Donato Magat (<i>Magat</i>), a tricycle driver plying the route of Pansol, Calamba City, testified that at around 3:00 o'clock in the morning of January 14, 2006, he was waiting for passengers at the comer of Villa Novaliches Resort. A man approached him and told him that someone inside the resort needed a ride. Magat went to the resort and asked the two (2) men at the gate who needed a ride. Afterwards, he saw three (3) men in their 20's carrying another man, who looked very weak, like a vegetable, towards his tricycle. Magat touched the body of the man being carried and sensed it was cold.<br><br>Magat asked the men what happened to their companion. They replied that he had too much to drink. Then they instructed Magat to go to the nearest hospital. He drove the tricycle to JP Rizal Hospital. Upon their arrival, two of his passengers brought their unconscious companion inside the emergency room, while their other companion paid the tricycle fare. Magat then left to go home. Several days after, he learned that the person brought to the hospital had died.<br><br>Abelardo Natividad (<i>Natividad</i>) and Seferino Espina y Jabay (<i>Espina</i>) were the security guards on duty at JP Rizal Hospital, from 11:00 o'clock in the evening of January 13, 2006 until 7:00 o'clock in the morning of January 14, 2006. In the early morning of January 14, 2006, two men, who signed on the logbook<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> under the names Brandon Gonzales and Jerico Paril, brought the lifeless body of a person. Pursuant to the standard operating procedure of the hospital, the security guards did not allow the two men to leave the hospital because they called the police station so that an investigation could be conducted. Two policemen arrived later at the hospital. During his testimony, Natividad identified Sibal and Dungo as the two persons who brought Villanueva to the hospital.<br><br>PO2 Alaindelon Ignacio (<i>PO2 Ignacio</i>) testified that on January 14, 2006 at around 3:30 o'clock in the early morning, Natividad called up the PNP Calamba City Station to report that a lifeless body of a man was brought to JP Rizal Hospital. When PO2 Ignacio arrived, he saw Villanueva's corpse with contusions and bite marks all over his body. PO2 Ignacio and his policemen companions then brought Dungo and Sibal to the police station. He asked them about what happened, but they invoked their right to remain silent. The policemen then proceeded to Brgy. Pansol at around 9:00 o'clock in the morning. After finding Villa Novaliches Resort, they knocked on the door and the caretaker, Maricel Capillan (<i>Capillan</i>), opened it.<br><br>The police asked Capillan if there were University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (<i>UP Los Ba√±os</i>) students who rented the resort on the evening of January 13, 2006. Capillan said yes and added that about twenty (20) persons arrived onboard a jeepney and told her that they would be renting the resort from 9:30 o'clock in the evening up to 7:00 o'clock the following mornmg.<br><br>Gay Czarina Sunga (<i>Sunga</i>) was a food technology student at UP Los Ba√±os during the academic year of 2005-2006 and a member of the Symbiosis UPLB Biological Society. Around 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of January 13, 2006, she was at their organization's <i>tambayan</i> in the UPLB Biological Sciences Building, when she noticed three (3) men seated two meters away from her. She identified the two of the three men as Sibal and Dungo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> They were wearing black shirts with the logo of APO. Later at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, two more men arrived and, with their heads bowed, approached the three men. One of thm was Villanueva, who was carrying a 5-gallon water container. Dungo then stood up and asked Villanueva why the latter did not report to him when he was just at their <i>tambayan</i>. Dungo then punched Villanueva twice, but the latter just kept quiet with his head bowed. Fifteen minutes later, all the men left.<br><br>Joey Atienza (<i>Atienza</i>) had been a good friend of Villanueva since 2004. They were roommates at the UP Los Ba√±os Men's Dormitory and housemates at the DPS Apartment in Umali Subdivision, Los Ba√±os, Laguna. According to Atienza, on January 9, 2006, Villanueva introduced him to Daryl Decena (<i>Decena</i>) as his APO - Theta Chapter batchmate, who was also to undergo final initiation rites on January 13, 2006.<br><br>Severino Cuevas, Director of the Students Affairs at UP Los Ba√±os, testified that Dungo and Sibal were both members of the APO Fraternity, and that there was no record of any request for initiation or hazing activity filed by the said fraternity.<br><br>McArthur Padua of the Office of the Registrar, UP Los Ba√±os, testified that Villanueva was a B.S. Agricultural Economics student at the UP Los Ba√±os,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as evidenced by his official transcript of record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Atty. Eleno Peralta and Dina S. Carlos, officers of the Student Disciplinary Tribunal (<i>SDT</i>) of the UP Los Ba√±os, testified that an administrative disciplinary case was filed on March 31, 2006 against the APO Fraternity regarding the death of Villanueva. They confirmed that Capilla of Villa Novaliches Resort and Irene Tan (<i>Tan</i>) of APO Sorority Theta Chapter appeared as witnesses for the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Roman Miguel De Jesus, UP - Office of the Legal Aid (<i>UP-OLA</i>) supervising student, testified that he met Tan of the APO Sorority sometime between July and August 2006 in UP Diliman to convince her to testify in the criminal case. Tan, however, refused because she feared for her safety. She said that after testifying in the SDT hearing, her place in Imus, Cavite was padlocked and vandalized.<br><br>Evelyn Villanueva, mother of victim Villanueva, testified that, as a result of the death of her son, her family incurred actual damages consisting of medical, burial and funeral expenses in the aggregate amount of P140,000.00 which were evidenced by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Her husband also incurred travel expenses in the amount of P7,000.00 in returning to the Philippines to attend his son's wake and burial, as supported by a plane ticket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> She further attested that she experienced mental anguish, sleepless nights, substantial weight loss, and strained family relationship as a result of her son's death.<br><br><i>Version of the Defense</i><br><br>The defense presented seven (7) witnesses to prove the innocence of the petitioners. Their testimonies are summarized as follow:<br><br>Richard Cornelio (<i>Cornelio</i>), an APO Fraternity member, testified that on January 13, 2006, around 4:00 to 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon, he met Dungo at the UP Los Ba√±os Graduate School. Dungo asked him if he would attend the initiation ceremony, and Cornelio answered in the negative because he had other things to do. At 10:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day, Cornelio again met Dungo and his girlfriend while eating a hamburger at the Burger Machine along; Raymundo Street, Umali Subdivision, Los Ba√±os, Laguna (<i>Raymundo Street</i>). He asked Dungo if he would attend the initiation ceremony. Dungo replied that he would not because he and his girlfriend had something to do.<br><br>Ana Danife Rivera (<i>Rivera</i>), the girlfriend of Dungo, testified that on January 13, 2006 at around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, Dungo came and visited her at her boarding house on Raymundo Street. Around 4:00 o'clock of the same afternoon, they went to the UP Los Ba√±os Graduate School and saw Cornelio. Afterwards, they went back to her boarding house and stayed there from 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon to 7:00 o'clock in the evening. Then, they went to Lacxo Restaurant for dinner and left at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening. On their way back to her boarding house, they encountered Cornelio again at the Burger Machine. Dungo then stayed and slept at her boarding house. Around 2:00 o'clock in the early morning of January 14, 2006, they were roused from their sleep by a phone call from Sibal, asking Dungo to go to a resort in Pansol, Calamba City. Dungo then left the boarding house.<br><br>Dungo testified that around 1:00 o'clock in the early afternoon of January 13, 2006, he arrived at the boarding house of his girlfriend, Rivera, on Raymundo Street. At around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, they went to the UP Los Ba√±os Graduate School and inquired about the requirements for a master's degree. They walked back to the boarding house and met Cornelio. They talked about their fraternity's final initiation ceremony for that night in Pansol, Calamba City. Dungo and Rivera then reached the latter's boarding house around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon. At around 7:00 o'clock in the evening, they went out for dinner at the Lacxo Restaurant, near Crossing Junction, Los Ba√±os. They ate and stayed at the restaurant for at least one and a half hours. Then they walked back to the boarding house of Rivera and, along the way, they met Cornelio again at the Burger Machine along Raymundo Street. Cornelio asked Dungo if he would attend their fraternity's final initiation ceremony, to which he replied in the negative. Dungo and Rivera reached the boarding house around 9:00 o'clock in the evening and they slept there.<br><br>Around 2:00 o'clock in the early morning of January 14, 2006, Dungo was roused from his sleep because Sibal was calling him on his cellphone. Sibal asked for his help, requesting him to go to Villa Novaliches Resort in Pansol, Calamba City. Upon Dungo's arrival at the resort, Sibal led him inside. There, he saw Rudolfo Castillo (<i>Castillo</i>), a fellow APO fraternity brother, and Villanueva, who was unconscious. Dungo told them that they should bring Villanueva to the hospital. They all agreed, and Castillo called a tricycle that brought them to JP Rizal Hospital. He identified himself before the security guard as Jerico Paril because he was scared to tell his real name.<br><br>Gilbert Gopez (<i>Gopez</i>) testified that he was the Grand Chancellor of the APO- Theta Chapter for years 2005-2006. At around 7:00 o'clock in the evening of January 13, 2006, he was at the <i>tambayan</i> of their fraternity in UP Los Ba√±os because their neophytes would be initiated that night. Around 8:30 o'clock in the evening, they met their fraternity brothers in Bagong Kalsada, Los Ba√±os. He noticed that their neophyte, Villanueva, was with Castillo and that there was a bruise on the left side of his face. Then they boarded a jeepney and proceeded to Villa Novaliches Resort in Pansol, Calamba City. There, Gopez instructed Sibal to take Villanueva to the second floor of the resort. He confronted Castillo as to what happened to Villanueva. Around 11:00 or 11:30 o'clock in the evening, Gopez decided to cancel the final rites. He told Sibal to stay at the resort and accompany Villanueva and Castillo. Together with the other neophytes, Gopez left the resort and went back to UP Los Ba√±os.<br><br>Sibal testified that he was a DOST Scholar at the UP Los Ba√±os from 2002 to 2006, taking up B.S. Agricultural Chemistry. He was a Brother Actuary of the APO - Theta Chapter, and was in charge of fraternity activities, such as tree planting, free medical and dental missions, and blood donations. On January 13, 2006, at around 6:00 o'clock in the evening, he was at the fraternity's <i>tambayan</i> for the final initiation rites of their neophytes. After preparing the food for the initiation rites, Sibal, together with some neophytes, went to Bagong Kalsada, Los Ba√±os, where he saw fellow fraternity brother Castillo with their neophyte Villanueva, who had a bruised face. Thereafter, they boarded a jeepney and proceeded to Villa Novaliches Resort in Pansol, Calamba City. Once inside the resort, he accompanied Villanueva upstairs for the latter to take a rest. A few minutes later, he went down and confronted Castillo about the bruises on Villanueva's face. He was angry and irritated with Castillo. He then stayed outside the resort until Gopez and the other neophytes came out and told him that the final initiation rite was cancelled, and that they were returning to UP Los Ba√±os. Sibal wanted to go with them but he was ordered to stay with Villanueva and Castillo.<br><br>After the group of Gopez left, Sibal checked on the condition of Villanueva, who was sleeping on the second floor of the resort. Then he went outside for one hour, or until 1:00 o'clock in the early morning of January 14, 2006. Sibal entered the resort again and saw Villanueva, who looked unconscious, seated in one of the benches on the ground floor. Sibal inquired about Villanueva's condition but he was ignored by Castillo. He then called Dungo for help. After Dungo arrived at the resort, they hailed a tricycle and brought Villanueva to JP Rizal Hospital. There, he gave a false name to the security guard as he heard that Dungo had done the same.<br><br><i>The RTC Ruling</i><br><br>On February 23, 2011, the RTC found Dungo and Sibal guilty of the crime of violating Section 4 of the Anti-Hazing Law and sentenced them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. The trial court stated that the prosecution established the presence of Dungo and Sibal (1) at the UP Los Ba√±os Campus on January 13, 2006 around 3:0.0 o'clock in the afternoon, by the testimony of Sunga and (2) at the Villa Novaliches Resort around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day by the testimony of Ignacio. With the extensive testimonies of Dr. Masilungan and Dr. Camarillo, the prosecution also proved that Villanueva died from hazing injuries.<br><br>According to the RTC, the evidence of the prosecution undeniably proved that Villanueva, a UP Los Ba√±os student, was a neophyte of the APO - Theta Chapter Fraternity; that Dungo and Sibal were members of the said fraternity; that on the evening of January 13, 2006, Dungo and Sibal, together with the other fraternity members, officers and alumni, brought and transported Villanueva and two other neophytes to Villa Novaliches Resort at Barangay Pansol, Calamba City, for the final initiation rites; that the initiation rites were conducted inside the resort, performed under the cover of darkness and secrecy; that due to the injuries sustained by Villanueva, the fraternity members and the other two neophytes haphazardly left the resort; and that Dungo and Sibal boarded a tricycle and brought the lifeless body of Villanueva to JP Rizal Hospital, where Villanueva was pronounced dead.<br><br>The RTC explained that even if there was no evidence that Dungo and Sibal participated to bodily assault and harm the victim, it was irrefutable that they brought Villanueva to the resort for their final initiation rites. Clearly, they did not merely induce Villanueva to attend the final initiation rites, but they also brought him to Villa Novaliches Resort.<br><br>The RTC held that the defense of denial and alibi were self-serving negative assertions. The defense of denial and alibi of Dungo, which was corroborated by the testimony of his girlfriend Rivera and his co-fraternity brother, could not be given credence. The witnesses presented by the defense were partial and could not be considered as disinterested parties. The defense of denial of Sibal likewise failed. The corroborative testimonies of his fraternity brothers were suspect because they had so much at stake in the outcome of the criminal action.<br><br>The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Dandy Dungo and Gregorio Sibal GUILTY of violating Section 4 of the Anti-Hazing Law and sentenced them to suffer the penalty of <i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i> and order them to jointly and severally pay the family/heirs of Deceased Marlon Villanueva the following sums of money:<br><blockquote>1. P141,324.00 for and as actual damages;<br><br>2. P200,000.00 for and as moral damages;<br><br>3. P100,000.00 for and as exemplary damages; and<br><br>4. P50,000.00 for the death of Marlon Villanueva.<br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, the petitioners filed a notice of appeal. In their brief, they contended that the prosecution failed to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt for violating R.A. No. 8049. They also assailed the constitutionality of Section 4 of the said law, which stated that mere presence in the hazing was <i><i>prima facie</i></i> evidence of participation therein, because it allegedly violated the constitutional presumption of innocence of the accused.<br><br><i>The CA Ruling</i><br><br>The CA ruled that the appeal of Dungo and Sibal was bereft of merit. It stated that, in finding them guilty of violating R.A. No. 8049, the RTC properly relied on circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution. The CA painstakingly discussed the unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence to convict Dungo and Sibal as principals in the crime of hazing.<br><br>It further found that the defense of denial and alibi of Dungo and Sibal failed to cast doubt on the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses; and that denial, being inherently weak, could not prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrators of the crime.<br><br>The CA also stated that Dungo and Sibal were not only convicted based on their presence in the venue of the hazing, but also in their act of bringing the victim to Villa Novaliches Resort for the final initiation rites.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the February 23, 2011 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 36 of Calamba City in CRIM. Case No. 13958-2006-C, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of R.A. 8049 is hereby AFFIRMED in TOTO.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Dungo and Sibal moved for reconsideration but their motion was denied by the CA in the assailed October 8, 2013 Resolution.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><blockquote><center><b>SOLE ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</b><br></center><br><b>THE JUDGMENTS OF THE RTC AND THE CA <i>A QUO</i> CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF THE ACCUSED TO BE INFORMED OF THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THE OFFENSE PROVED AS FOUND AND PRONOUNCED THEREBY IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION, NOR DOES ONE INCLUDE OR NECESSARILY INCLUDE THE OTHER.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners Dungo and Sibal argue that the amended information charged them as they "did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault and use personal violence upon one Marlon Villanueva y Mejilla."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Yet, both the RTC and the CA found them guilty of violating R.A. No. 8049 because they "[i]nduced the victim to be present"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> during the initiation rites. The crime of hazing by inducement does not necessarily include the criminal charge of hazing by actual participation. Thus, they cannot be convicted of a crime not stated or necessarily included in the information. By reason of the foregoing, the petitioners contend that their constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against them has been violated.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> filed on May 23, 2014, the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>) asserted that Dungo and Sibal were charged in the amended information with the proper offense and convicted for such. The phrases "planned initiation" and "in conspiracy with more or less twenty members and officers" in the amended information sufficiently cover "knowingly cooperated in carrying out the hazing by inducing the victim to be present thereat." The planned initiation rite would not have been accomplished were it not for the acts of the petitioners in inducing the victim to be present thereat and it was obviously conducted in conspiracy with the others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In their Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> filed on September 10, 2014, Dungo and Sibal insisted that there was a variance between the offense charged of "actually participated in the infliction of physical harm," and the offense "knowingly cooperated in carrying out the hazing by inducing the victim to be present thereat."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The prosecution, moreover, failed to establish conspiracy because no act or circumstance was proved pointing to a joint purpose and design between and among the petitioners and the other twenty accused.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><u><i>Procedural Matter</i></u><br><br>An appeal is a proceeding undertaken to have a decision reconsidered by bringing it to a higher court authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The right to appeal is neither a natural right nor is it a component of due process.

With the continuity of these senseless tragedies, one question implores for an answer: is R.A.

This distinction is important with reference to the intent with which a wrongful act is done. The rule on the subject is that in acts <i>mala in se</i>, the intent governs; but in acts <i>mala prohibita</i>, the only inquiry is, has the law been violated? When an act is illegal, the intent of the offender is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> When the doing of an act is prohibited by law, it is considered injurious to public welfare, and the doing of the prohibited act is the crime itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>A common misconception is that all <i>mala in se</i> crimes are found in the Revised Penal Code (RPC), while all <i>mala prohibita</i> crimes are provided by special penal laws.

If the punishable act or omission is immoral in itself, then it is a crime <i>mala in se</i>; on the contrary, if it is not immoral in itself, but there is a statute prohibiting its commission by reasons of public policy, then it is <i>mala prohibita</i>. In the final analysis, whether or not a crime involves moral turpitude is ultimately a question of fact and frequently depends on all the circumstances surrounding the violation of the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The crime of hazing under R.A. No. 8049 is <i>malum prohibitum</i>. The Senate deliberations would show that the lawmakers intended the anti¬≠hazing statute to be <i>malum prohibitum</i>, as follows:<br><blockquote>SENATOR GUINGONA: Most of these acts, if not all, are already punished under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. If hazing is done at present and it results in death, the charge would be murder or homicide.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. If it does not result in death, it may be frustrated homicide or serious physical injuries.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. Or, if the person who commits sexual abuse does so it can be penalized under rape or acts of lasciviousness.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. So, what is the rationale for making a new offense under this definition of the crime of hazing?<br><br>SENATOR LINA. To discourage persons or group of persons either composing a sorority, fraternity or any association from making this requirement of initiation that has already resulted in these specific acts or results, Mr. President.<br><br>That is the main rationale. We want to send a strong signal across the land that no group or association can require the act of physical initiation before a person can become a member without being held criminally liable.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x</center><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. Yes, but what would be the rationale for that imposition? Because the distinguished Sponsor has said that he is not punishing a mere organization, he is not seeking the punishment of an initiation into a club or organization, he is seeking the punishment of certain acts that resulted in death, etcetera as a result of hazing which are already covered crimes.<br><br>The penalty is increased in one, because we would like to discourage hazing, abusive hazing, but it may be a legitimate defense for invoking two or more charges or offenses, because these very same acts are already punishable under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>That is my difficulty, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. x x x<br><br>Another point, Mr. President, is this, and this is a very telling difference: <b>When a person or group of persons resort to hazing as a requirement for gaining entry into an organization, the intent to commit a wrong is not visible or is not present, Mr. President. Whereas, in these specific crimes, Mr. President, let us say there is death or there is homicide, mutilation, if one files a case, then the intention to commit a wrong has to be proven. But if the crime of hazing is the basis, what is important is the result from the act of hazing.</b><br><br>To me, that is the basic difference and that is what will prevent or deter the sororities or fraternities; that they should really shun this activity called "hazing." Because, initially, these fraternities or sororities do not even consider having a neophyte killed or maimed or that acts of lasciviousness are even committed initially, Mr. President.<br><br>So, what we want to discourage is the so-called initial innocent act. That is why there is need to institute this kind of hazing. Ganiyan po ang nangyari. Ang fraternity o ang sorority ay magre-recruit. Wala talaga silang intensiyong makamatay. Hindi ko na babanggitin at buhay pa iyong kaso. Pero dito sa anim o pito na namatay nitong nakaraang taon, walang intensiyong patayin talaga iyong neophyte. So, kung maghihintay pa tayo, na saka lamang natin isasakdal ng murder kung namatay na, ay after the fact ho iyon. Pero, kung sasabihin natin sa mga kabataan na: "Huwag ninyong gagawin iyong hazing. Iyan ay kasalanan at kung mamatay diyan, mataas ang penalty sa inyo."<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x</center><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. I join the lofty motives, Mr. President, of the distinguished Sponsor. But I am again disturbed by his statement that the prosecution does not have to prove the intent that resulted in the death, that resulted in the serious physical injuries, that resulted in the acts of lasciviousness or deranged mind. <b>We do not have to prove the willful intent of the accused in proving or establishing the crime of hazing.</b> This seems, to me, a novel situation where we create the special crime without having to go into the intent, which is one of the basic elements of anycnme.<br><br>If there is no intent, there is no crime. If the intent were merely to initiate, then there is no offense. And even the distinguished Sponsor admits that the organization, the intent to initiate, the intent to have a new society or a new club is, per se, not punishable at all. What are punishable are the acts that lead to the result. But if these results are not going to be proven by intent, but just because there was hazing, I am afraid that it will disturb the basic concepts of the Revised Penal Code, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. Mr. President, the act of hazing, precisely, is being criminalized because in the context of what is happening in the sororities and fraternities, when they conduct hazing, no one will admit that their intention is to maim or to kill. So, we are already criminalizing the fact of inflicting physical pain. Mr. President, it is a criminal act and we want it stopped, deterred, discouraged.<br><br><b>If that occurs, under this law, there is no necessity to prove that the masters. intended to kill or the masters intended to maim. What is important is the result of the act of hazing.</b> Otherwise, the masters or those who inflict the physical pain can easily escape responsibility and say, "We did not have the intention to kill. This is part of our initiation rites. This is normal. We do not have any intention to kill or maim."<br><br>This is the lusot, Mr. President. They might as well have been charged therefore with the ordinary crime of homicide, mutilation, etcetera, where the prosecution will have a difficulty proving the elements if they are separate offenses.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>SENATOR LINA. x x x<br><br>I am very happy that the distinguished Minority Leader brought out the idea of intent or whether it is <i>mala in se</i> or <i>mala prohibita</i>. There can be a radical amendment if that is the point that he wants to go to.<br><br><b>If we agree on the concept, then, maybe, we can just make this a special law on hazing.

During the discussion of whether sodomy shall be included as a punishable act under the law, the issue of consent was tackled:<br><blockquote>SENATOR LINA x x x<br><br>But sodomy in this case is connected with hazing, Mr. President. Such that the act may even be entered into with consent. It is not only sodomy. The infliction of pain may be done with the consent of the neophyte. If the law is passed, that does not make the act of hazing not punishable because the neophyte accepted the infliction of pain upon himself.<br><br>If the victim suffers from serious physical injuries, but the initiator said, "Well, he allowed it upon himself. He consented to it." So, if we allow that reasoning that sodomy was done with the consent of the victim, then we would not have passed any law at lflll. There will be no significance if we pass this bill, because it will always be a defense that the victim allowed the infliction of pain1 or suffering. He accepted it as part of the initiation rites.<br><br>But precisely, Mr. President that is one thing that we would want to prohibit. <b>That the defense of consent will not apply because the very act of inflicting physical pain or psychological suffering is, by itself, a punishable act.

But the defense of consent is not going to nullify the criminal nature of the act.</b><br><br>So, if we accept the amendment that sodomy can only aggravate the offense if it is committedr without consent of the victim, then the whole foundation of this proposed law will collapse.<br><br>SENATOR BIAZON.

It provides that the responsible officials of the school or of the police, military or citizen's army training organization, may impose the appropriate administrative sanctions on the person or the persons charged under this provision even before their conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Necessarily, the offended party can file either administrative, civil, or criminal actions against the offenders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The study of the provisions of R.A. No. 8049 shows that, on paper, it is complete and robust in penalizing the crime of hazing. It was made <i>malum prohibitum</i> to discount criminal intent and disallow the defense of good faith. It took into consideration the different participants and contributors in the hazing activities. While not all acts cited in the law are penalized, the penalties imposed therein involve various and serious terms of imprisonment to discourage would be offenders. Indeed, the law against hazing is ideal and profound. As to whether the law can be effectively implemented, the Court begs to continue on the merits of the case.<br><br><i>The Information properly charged the offense proved</i><br><br>The petitioners claim that the amended information avers a criminal charge of hazing by actual participation, but the only offense proved during the trial was hazing by inducement. Their contention must faiL The Amended Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about 2:30 in the early morning of January 14, 2006, at Villa Novaliches, Brgy. Pansol, Calamba City, Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, during a <u>planned</u> initiation rite and being then <u>officers and</u> members of Alpha Phi Omega fraternity and present thereat, in conspiracy with more or less tvventy other members and officers, whose identity is not yet known, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault and use personal violence upon one MARLON VILLANUEVA y MEJILLA, a neophyte thereof and as condition for his admission to the fraternity, thereby subjecting him to physical harm, resulting to his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote>On the manner of how the Information should be worded, Section 9, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, is enlightening:<br><blockquote>Section 9. Cause of the accusation. The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.<br></blockquote>It is evident that the Information need not use the exact language of the statute in alleging the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense. The test is whether it enables a person of common understanding to know the charge against him, and the court to render judgment properly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the OSG that the "planned initiation rite" as stated in the information included the act of inducing Villanueva to attend it. In ordinary parlance, a planned event can be understood to have different phases. Likewise, the hazing activity had different stages and the perpetrators had different roles therein, not solely inflicting physical injury to the neophyte. One of the roles of the petitioners in the hazing activity was to induce Villanueva to be present. Dungo and Sibal not only induced Villanueva to be present at the resort, but they actually brought him there. They fulfilled their roles in the planned hazing rite which eventually led to the death of Villanueva. The hazing would not have been accomplished were it not for the acts of the petitioners that induced the victim to be present.<br><br>Secrecy and silence are common characterizations of the dynamics of hazing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> To require the prosecutor to indicate every step of the planned initiation rite in the information at the inception of the criminal case, when details of the clandestine hazing are almost nil, would be an arduous task, if not downright impossible. The law does not require the impossible (<i>lex non cognit ad impossibilia</i>).<br><br>The proper approach would be to require the prosecution to state every element of the crime of hazing, the offenders, and the accompanying circumstances in the planned initiation activity, which has been satisfied in the present case. Accordingly, the amended information sufficiently informed the petitioners that they were being criminally charged for their roles in the planned initiation rite.<br><br><i>Conspiracy of the offenders was duly proven</i><br><br>The petitioners assail that the prosecution failed to establish the fact of conspiracy.<br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. To determine conspiracy, there must be a common design to commit a felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The overt act or acts of the accused may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself or may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the criminal plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In conspiracy, it need not be shown that the parties actually came together and agreed in express terms to enter into and pursue a common design. The assent of the minds may be and, from the secrecy of the crime, usually inferred from proof of facts and circumstances which, taken together, indicate that they are parts of some complete whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Responsibility of a conspirator is not confined to the accomplishment of a particular purpose of conspiracy but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of the purpose intended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>The lawmakers ¬∑deliberated on whether the prosecution was still obliged to prove the conspiracy between the offenders under R.A. 8049, to wit:<br><blockquote>SENATOR GUINGONA. Mr. President, assuming there was a group that initiated and a person died. The charge is murder. My question is: Under this bill if it becomes a law, would the prosecution have to prove conspiracy or not anymore?<br><br>SENATOR LINA. Mr. President, if the person is present during hazing x x x<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. The persons are present. First, would the prosecution have to prove conspiracy? Second, would the prosecution have to prove intent to kill or not?<br><br>SENATOR LINA. No more. As to the second question, Mr. President, if that occurs, there is no need to prove intent to kill.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. But the charge is murder.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is why I said that it should not be murder. It should be hazing, Mr. President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court does not categorically agree that, under R.A. No. 8049, the prosecution need not prove conspiracy. Jurisprudence dictates that conspiracy must be established, not by conjectures, but by positive and conclusive evidence. Conspiracy transcends mere companionship and mere presence at the scene of the crime does not in itself amount to conspiracy. Even knowledge, acquiescence in or agreement to cooperate, is not enough to constitute one as a party to a conspiracy, absent any active participation in the commission of the crime with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>R.A. No. 8049, nevertheless, presents a novel provision that introduces a disputable presumption of actual participation; and which modifies the concept of conspiracy. Section 4, paragraph 6 thereof provides that the presence of any person during the hazing is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of participation as principal, unless he prevented the commission of the punishable acts. This provision is unique because a disputable presumption arises from the mere presence of the offender during the hazing, which can be rebutted by proving that the accused took steps to prevent the commission of the hazing.<br><br>The petitioners attempted to attack the constitutionality of Section 4 of R.A. No. 8049 before the CA, but did not succeed. "[A] finding of <i>prima facie</i> evidence x x x does not shatter the presumptive innocence the accused enjoys because, before <i>prima facie</i> evidence arises, certain facts have still to be proved; the trial court cannot depend alone on such evidence, because precisely, it is merely <i>prima facie</i>. It must still satisfy that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged. Neither can it rely on the weak defense the latter may adduce."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Penal laws which feature <i>prima facie</i> evidence by disputable presumptions against the offenders are not new, and can be observed in the following: (1) the possession of drug paraphernalia gives rise to <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the use of dangerous drug;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> (2) the dishonor of the check for insufficient funds is. <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge of such insufficiency of funds or credit;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> and (3) the possession of any good which has been the subject of robbery or thievery shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fencing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Verily, the disputable presumption under R.A. No. 8049 can be related to the conspiracy in the crime of hazing. The common design of offenders is to haze the victim. Some of the overt acts that could be committed by the offenders would be to (1) plan the hazing activity as a requirement of the victim's initiation to the fraternity; (2) induce the victim to attend the hazing; and (3) actually participate in the infliction of physical injuries.<br><br>In this case, there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the petitioners' participation in the hazing because of their presence in the venue. As correctly held by the RTC, the presence of Dungo and Sibal during the hazing at Villa Novaliches Resort was established by the testimony of Ignacio.

Her testimony was given great weight because she was a disinterested and credible witness. The prosecution indubitably established the presence of Dungo and Sibal during the hazing. Such gave rise to the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of their actual participation in the hazing of Villanueva. They were given an opportunity to rebut and overcome the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the prosecution by proving that they prevented the commission of the hazing, yet they failed to do so.<br><br>Because of the uncontroverted <i>prima facie</i> evidence against the petitioners, it was shown that they performed an overt act in the furtherance of the criminal design of hazing. Not only did they induce the victim to attend the hazing activity, the petitioners also actually participated in it based on the <i>prima facie</i> evidence. These acts are sufficient to establish their roles in the conspiracy of hazing.<br><br>Hence, generally, mere presence at the scene of the crime does not in itself amount to conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Exceptionally, under R.A. No. 8049, the participation of the offenders in the criminal conspiracy can be proven by the <i>prima facie</i> evidence due to their presence during the hazing, unless they prevented the commission of the acts therein.<br><br><i>The guilt of the petitioners was proven beyond reasonable doubt</i><br><br>Aside from inducing Villanueva to attend the initiation rites and their presence during the hazing, the petitionersguilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt by the sequence of circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution. Their involvement in the hazing of Villanueva is not merely based on <i>prima facie</i> evidence but was also established by circumstantial evidence.<br><br>In considering a criminal case, it is critical to start with the law's own starting perspective on the status of the accused - in all criminal prosecutions, he is presumed innocent of the charge laid unless the contrary is proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> In criminal law, proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such degree of proof that produces absolute certainty. Only moral certainty is required or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>While it is established that nothing less than proof beyond reasonable doubt is required for a conviction, this exacting standard does not preclude resort to circumstantial evidence when direct evidence is not available. Direct evidence is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to prove the guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt. For in the absence of direct evidence, the prosecution may resort to adducing circumstantial evidence to discharge its burden. Crimes are usually committed in secret and under conditions where concealment is highly probable. If direct evidence is insisted on under all circumstances, the prosecution of vicious felons who commit heinous crimes in secret or secluded places will be hard, if not impossible, to prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Needless to state, the crime of hazi,ng is shrouded in secrecy.

It is only at this point that the secret is revealed and the activities become public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Bearing in mind the concealment of hazing, it is only logical and proper for the prosecution to resort to the presentation of circumstantial evidence to prove it.<br><br>The rules on evidence and precedents to sustain the conviction of an accused through circumstantial evidence require the existence of the following requisites: (1) there are more than one circumstance; (2) the inference must be based on proven facts; and (3) the combination of all circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> To justify a conviction upon circumstantial evidence, the combination of circumstances must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind as to the criminal liability of the accused.

Correlating these two cases to the injuries found on the victim's body, Dr. Camarillo attested that the victim, Marlon Villanueva, sustained similar injuries to those two (2) persons. Based on the presence of multiple injuries and contusions on his body, he opined that these injuries were hazing-related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners Dungo and Sibal, on the other hand, presented the defense of denial and alibi. These defenses, however, must fail. Time and time again, this Court has ruled that denial and alibi are the weakest of all defenses, because they are easy to concoct and fabricate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> As properly held by the RTC, these defenses cannot prevail over the positive and unequivocal identification of the petitioners by prosecution witnesses Sunga and Ignacio. The testimonies of the defense witnesses also lacked credibility and reliability. The corroboration of defense witness Rivera was suspect because she was the girlfriend of Dungo, and it was only logical and emotional that she would stand by the man she loved and cared for. The testimonies of their fellow fraternity brothers, likewise, do not hold much weight because they had so much at stake in the outcome of the case. Stated differently, the petitioners did not present credible and disinterested witnesses to substantiate their defenses of denial and alibi.<br><br>After a careful review of the records, the Court agrees with the CA and the RTC that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution was overwhelming enough to establish the guilt of the petitioners beyond a reasonable doubt. The unbroken chain of events laid down by the CA leaves us no other conclusion other than the petitioners' participation in the hazing. They took part in the hazing and, together with their fellow fraternity officers and members, inflicted physical injuries to Villanueva as a requirement of his initiation to the fraternity. The physical injuries eventually took a toll on the body of the victim, which led to his death. Another young life lost.<br><br>With the fact of hazing, the identity of the petitioners, and their participation therein duly proven, the moral certainty that produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind has been satisfied.<br><br><center><b><u>Final Note</u></b><br></center><br>Hazing has been a phenomenon that has beleaguered the country's educational institutions and communities. News of young men beaten to death as part of fraternities' violent initiation rites supposedly to seal fraternal bond has sent disturbing waves to lawmakers. Hence, R.A. No. 8049 was signed into to law on June 7, 1995. Doubts on the effectiveness of the law were raised. The Court, however, scrutinized its provisions and it is convinced that the law is rigorous in penalizing the crime of hazing.<br><br>Hopefully, the present case will serve as a guide to the bench and the bar on the application of R.A. No. 8049. Through careful case-build up and proper presentation of evidence before the court, it is not impossible for the exalted constitutional presumption of innocence of the accused to be overcome and his guilt for the crime of hazing be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution must bear in mind the secretive nature of hazing, and carefully weave its chain of circumstantial evidence. Likewise, the defense must present a genuine defense and substantiate the same through credible and reliable witnesses. The counsels of both parties must also consider hazing as a <i>malum prohibitum</i> crime and the law's distinctive provisions.<br><br>While the Court finds R.A. No. 8049 adequate to deter and prosecute hazing, the law is far from perfect. In <i>Villareal v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> the Court suggested that the fact of intoxication and the presence of non-resident or alumni fraternity members during hazing should be considered as aggravating circumstances that would increase the applicable penalties. Equally, based on the discussion earlier, this Court suggests some further amendments to the law. <i>First</i>, there should be a penalty or liability for non¬≠compliance with Section 2, or the written notice requirement, and with Section 3, or the representation requirement. <i>Second</i>, the penalties under Section 4 should also consider the psychological harm done to the victim of hazing. With these additional inputs on R.A. No. 8049, the movement against hazing can be invigorated.<br><br>R.A. No. 8049 is a democratic response to the uproar against hazing. It demonstrates that there must, and should, be another way of fostering brotherhood, other than through the culture of violence and suffering. The senseless deaths of these young men shall never be forgotten, for justice is the spark that lights the candles of their graves.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
