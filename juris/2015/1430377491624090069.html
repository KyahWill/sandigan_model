				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case stemmed from an undated Letter-Complaint, addressed to Executive Judge Elpidio N. Abella (Executive Judge Abella), Regional Trial Court, Alaminos City, Pangasinan, charging respondents Reynaldo C. Alcantara (Alcantara) and Joseph C. Jacinto (Jacinto) with the commission of several illegal activities in violation of Civil Service Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Alcantara worked as Utility Worker I, Branch 70, Regional Trial Court, Burgos, Pangasinan, whereas Jacinto was an electrician at the Hall of Justice in the same city.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The Letter-Complaint was indorsed to the Office of the Court Administrator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Office of the Court Administrator then directed Executive Judge Abella to conduct a discreet investigation and submit a report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In the Report dated July 17, 2013, Executive Judge Abella recommended that Alcantara and Jacinto be immediately dismissed from service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He found that as early as 2009, Alcantara and Jacinto received and encashed checks of their co-workers without consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The investigating judge made the following factual findings:<br><br><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td align="center" width="10%"><div>(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Roger Ginez (Ginez), Junior Process Server, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Burgos, Pangasinan, executed an affidavit pointing to Alcantara as the one who stole his two (2) salary checks amounting to P8,792.38, which covered the month of June 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> According to Ginez, Alcantara later confessed that he was the one who stole the checks.

Respondent Alcantara admitted to stealing and encashing the checks of Tugade and Espanol and put up the lame excuse that he was forced to do it because of his dire financial situation at the time. The explanation of respondent Jacinto is even more absurd. He slaimed that he had no idea that the checks were stolen but he admitted receiving proceeds from the scheme and allotting them to his personal needs.<br><br>Under Rule 9, Section 46 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service, promulgated on 18 November 2011, Serious Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct are grave offenses punishable by dismissal from service even on the first offense. As correctly pointed by Executive Judge Abella, respondents Alcantara and Jacinto committed grave offenses and "do not deserve to stay with the judiciary even for a minute longer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>We adopt the findings and recommendations of the Office of the Court Administrator.<br><br>Dishonesty is defined as the "[disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of, integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Grave misconduct is committed when there has been '"a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.' The misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules, all of which must be established by substantial evidence, and must necessarily be manifest in a charge of grave misconduct."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In <i>Rojas, Jr. v. Mina</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> respondent was found guilty of gross misconduct and dishonesty for stealing and encashing Special Allowance for Judges and Justices checks payable to several trial court judges without their consent. Similarly, in <i>Re: Loss of Extraordinary Allowance Check No. 11-6739 of Judge Eduardo Jovellanos,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> respondent Rosario Santos was held responsible for stealing, encashing, and converting for her personal use the amount covered by the check issued to Judge Eduardo U. Jovellanos.<br><br>In this case, Alcantara and Jacinto admitted to taking and encashing checks of their co-workers without permission. There is no doubt that their acts of repeatedly stealing the checks and forging the signatures of their co-workers constitute grave misconduct and dishonesty. Their alleged remorse for what they have done does not erase the transgression they committed. "This Court will not hesitate to rid its ranks of undesirables who undermine its efforts toward an effective and efficient administration of justice, thus tainting its image in the eyes of the public."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule 10, Section 46, serious dishonesty and grave misconduct are punishable by dismissal from service even if for the first offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This court held that:<br><br><blockquote>we have not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty.
