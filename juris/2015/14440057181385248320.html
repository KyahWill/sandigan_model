Palad, Jr., (<i>Dir. Palad</i>) <b>and petitioner NOVAI. The deed of sale was subsequently registered and from which TCT No. T-15387 was issued in NOVAI's name.</b><br><br><i>The Republic's Complaint for Cancellation of Title</i><br><br>In its complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> filed with the RTC on December 23, 1993, the Republic sought to cancel NOVAFs title based on the following grounds: (a) the land covered by NOVAFs title is part of a military reservation; (b) the deed of sale conveying the property to NOVAI, which became the basis for the issuance of TCT No. 15387, is fictitious; (c) the LMB has no records of any application made by NOVAI for the purchase of the property, and of the NOVAFs alleged payment of P14,250,270.00 for the property; and (d) the presidential proclamation, <i>i.e.</i>, Proclamation No. 2487, claimed to have been issued by then President Corazon C. Aquino in 1991 that authorized the transfer and titling of the property to NOVAI, is fictitious.<br><br><i>NOVAI's Answer to the Complaint</i><br><br>In its answer (which was later amended) to the Republic's complaint, NOVAI counter-argued that the property was no longer part of the public dominion, as the land had long been segregated from the military reservation pursuant to Proclamation No. 461.<br><br>NOVAI claimed that, contrary to the Republic's contention that there were no records of the sale, it had actually filed a letter-application for a sales patent over the property with the LMB which prepared, verified and approved the property's plan and technical description; and that the LMB delivered to it a copy of the deed of sale, signed and executed by Dir. Palad, after it had paid a portion of the P14,250,270.00 purchase price, corresponding taxes, and other charges, with the balance to be paid in installments.<br><br>Also, NOVAI contended that, since any alleged irregularities that may have attended the sale pertained only to formalities, the proper remedy for the Republic was to file an action for reformation of instrument, not for cancellation of title. In any event, it added that the Republic's cause of action had prescribed because its title to the property had already become indefeasible.<br><br><center><b><u>The RTC's decision</u></b><br></center><br>The RTC narrowed down the issues to: (a) the character of the property in question, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the property in question was part of the FBMR, and hence, inalienable; and (b) the validity of the deed of sale conveying the property to NOVAI, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the title over the property was acquired by NOVAI through fraud. The <b>RTC resolved both issues in NOVAI's favor</b>.<br><br>In its decision, the RTC ruled that: (a) the property is alienable and disposable in character, as the land falls within the area segregated from the FBMR pursuant to Proclamation No. 461; (b) the subject deed of sale should be presumed valid on its face, as it was executed with all the formalities of a notarial certification; (c) notwithstanding the claims of forgery, the signature of Dir. Palad on the deed of sale appeared genuine and authentic; and (d) NOVAI's title to the property had attained indefeasibility since the Republic's action for cancellation of title was filed close to two (2) years from the issuance of the title.<br><br><center><b><u>The CA's decision</u></b></center><br><b>The CA reversed and set aside the RTC's decision.</b> It ruled that the property is inalienable land of the public domain; thus, it cannot be disposed of or be the subject of a sale. It pointed out that, since NOVAI failed to discharge its burden of proving the existence of Proclamation No. 2487 - the positive governmental act that would have removed the property from the public domain — the property remained reserved for veterans rehabilitation purposes under Proclamation No. 478, the latest executive issuance affecting the property.<br><br>Since the property is inalienable, the CA held that the incontestability and indefeasibility generally accorded to a Torrens title cannot apply because the property, as in this case, is unregistrable land; that a title issued by reason or on account of any sale, alienation, or transfer of an inalienable property is void and a patent nullity; and that, consequently, the Republic's action for the cancellation of NOVAI's title cannot be barred by prescription.<br><br>Also, the CA held that there can be no presumption of regularity in the execution of the subject deed of sale given the questionable circumstances that surrounded the alleged sale of the property to NOVAI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>e.g.</i>, NOVAI's failure to go through the regular process in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (<i>DENR</i>) or the LMB Offices in the filing of an application for sales patent and in the conduct of survey and investigation; the execution of the deed of sale without payment of the full purchase price as required by policy; and the appearances of forgery and falsification of Dir. Palad's signature on the deed of sale and on the receipts issued to NOVAI for its installment payments on the property, among others.<br><br>Lastly, the CA held that the Court's observations and ruling in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Southside Homeowners Association, Inc (Southside)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> is applicable to the present case. In Southside, the Republic similarly sought the cancellation of title - TCT No. 15084 - issued in favor of Southside Homeowners Association, Inc. (<i>SHAI</i>) over a 39.99 hectare area of land situated in what was known as the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group (<i>JUSMAG</i>) housing area in Fort Bonifacio. The Court cancelled the certificate of title issued to SHAI, as the latter failed to prove that the JUSMAG area had been withdrawn from the military reservation and had been declared open for disposition. The Court therein ruled that, since the JUSMAG area was still part of the FBMR, its alleged sale to SHAI is necessarily void and of no effect.<br><br>NOVAI sought reconsideration of the CA's decision, which the CA denied in its March 28, 2007 resolution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b><br></center><br>NOVAI alleges that the CA erred in declaring that: (a) the property is inalienable land of the public domain, (b) the deed of sale and Proclamation No. 2487 were void and nonexistent, respectively, (c) the Republic's action for cancellation of title was not barred by prescription, and (d) the ruling in <i>Southside</i> was applicable to the present case.<br><br>In support of its petition, NOVAI raises the following arguments:<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The property is no longer part of the public domain because, by virtue of Proclamation No. 461, s. of 1965, the property was excluded from the FBMR and made available for disposition to qualified persons, subject to the provisions of R.A.

Nos. 274 and 730, and the Public Land Act are null and void; and that any title which may have been issued by mistake or error on the part of a public official can be cancelled at any time by the State.<br><br>The BCDA further contends that NOVAI miserably failed to comply with the legal requirements for the release of the property from the military reservation. More specifically, (1) the Director of Lands did not cause the property's subdivision, including the determination of the number of prospective applicants and the area of each subdivision lot which should not exceed one thousand (1,000) square meters for residential purposes; (2) the purchase price for the property was not fixed by the Director of Lands as approved by the DENR Secretary; (3) NOVAI did not pay the purchase price or a portion of it to the LMB; and (4) the Deed of Sale was not signed by the President of the Republic of the Philippines or by the Executive Secretary, but was signed only by the LMB Director.<br><br>Also, the BCDA observed that NOVAI was incorporated only on December 11, 1991, while the deed of sale was purportedly executed on November 15, 1991, which shows that NOVAI did not yet legally exist at the time of the property's purported sale.<br><br><center><b><u>OUR RULING</u></b><br></center><br>We resolve to <b>DENY</b> NOVAI's petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> as we find <b>no reversible error</b> committed by the CA in issuing its December 28, 2006 decision and March 28, 2007 resolution.<br><br><center><b><i>I. Procedural Objections</i></b><br></center><br><b><i>A. In the filing of the present petition before this Court</i></b><br><br>Under Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, a party desiring to appeal from a judgment or final order of the CA shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.<br><br>A question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence on a certain state of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The issue does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of the facts being admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In contrast, a question of fact exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites the calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses; the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, as well as their relation to each other and to the whole; and the probability of the situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The rule that only questions of law may be the subject of a Rule 45 Petition before this Court, however, has exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Among these exceptions is when there is <b>conflict between the factual findings of the RTC and that of the CA</b>.<br><br>In this case, the CA totally reversed the RTC on the nature and character of the land, in question, and on the,validity of the deed of sale between the parties. Due to the conflicting findings of the RTC and the CA on these issues, we are allowed to reexamine the facts and the parties' evidence in order to finally resolve the present controversy.<br><br><b><i>B. On BCD A's Intervention</i></b><br><br>In its reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to the BCDA's comment-in-intervention, NOVAI primarily objects to the BCDA's intervention because it was made too late.<br><br>Intervention is a proceeding in a suit or action by which a third person is permitted by the court to make himself a party, either joining the plaintiff or defendant, or demanding something adverse to both of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Its purpose is to enable such third party to protect or preserve a right or interest which may be affected by the proceeding,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> such interest being actual, material, direct and immediate, not simply contingent and expectant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, intervention cannot be made at the appeal stage. Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court, governing interventions, provides that "the motion to intervene may be filed at any time before rendition of judgment by the trial court." This rule notwithstanding, intervention may be allowed after judgment where it is necessary to protect some interest which cannot otherwise be protected, and may be allowed for the purpose of preserving the intervenor's right to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "The rule on intervention, like all other rules of procedure, is intended to make the powers of the Court fully and completely available for justice x x x and aimed to facilitate a comprehensive adjudication of rival claims overriding technicalities on the timeliness of the filing thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Thus, in exceptional cases, the Court may allow intervention although the trial court has already rendered judgment. In fact, the Court had allowed intervention in one case even when the petition for review was already submitted for decision before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the BCDA is indisputably the agency specifically created under R.A. No. 7227<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> to own, hold and/or administer military reservations including, among others, those located inside the FBMR. If we are to affirm the CA's decision, the BCDA stands to benefit as a favorable ruling will enable it to pursue its mandate under R.A. No. 7227. On the other hand, if we reverse the CA's decision, it stands to suffer as the contrary ruling will greatly affect the BCDA's performance of its legal mandate as it will lose the property without the opportunity to defend its right in court.<br><br>Indeed, the BCDA has such substantial and material interest both in the outcome of the case and in the disputed property that a final adjudication cannot be made in its absence without affecting such interest. Clearly, the BCDA's intervention is necessary; hence, we allow the BCDA's intervention although made beyond the period prescribed under Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b><i>II. Substantive Issues</i></b><br></center><br><b><i>A. The property is non-disposable land of the public domain reserved for public or quasi-public use or purpose</i></b><br><br>We agree with the CA that the property remains a part of the public domain that could not have been validly disposed of in NOVAI's favor. NOVAI failed to discharge its burden of proving that the property was withdrawn from the intended public or quasi-public use or purpose.<br><br>While the parties disagree on the character and nature of the property at the time of the questioned sale, they agree, however, that the property formed part of the FBMR - a military reservation belonging to the public domain. We note that the FBMR has been the subject of several presidential proclamations and statues issued subsequent to Proclamation No. 423, which either removed or reserved for specific public or quasi-public use or purpose certain of its portions.<br><br>On the one hand, NOVAI argues that Proclamation No. 461 had already transferred the property from the State's "public domain" to its "private domain." On the other hand, the respondents argue that Proclamation No. 478, in relation with RA 7227 and EO No. 40, had reverted the property to the inalienable property of the "public domain."<br><br>The classification and disposition of lands of the public domain are governed by Commonwealth Act (<i>C.A.</i>) No. 141 or the Public Land Act, the country's primary law on the matter.<br><br>Under Section 6 of C.A. No. 141, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, may, from time to time, <i>classify</i> lands of the public domain into alienable or disposable, timber and mineral lands, and <i>transfer</i> these lands from one class to another for purposes of their administration and disposition.<br><br>Under Section 7 of C.A. No. 141, the President may, from time to time, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and for purposes of the administration and disposition of alienable and disposable public lands, <i>declare</i> what lands are open to disposition or concession under the Acts' provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Section 8 of C.A. No. 141 sets out the public lands open to disposition or concession and the requirement that they have been officially delimited and classified, and when practicable, surveyed. Section 8 excludes (by implication) from disposition or concession, <u>public lands which have been reserved for public or quasi-public uses</u>; appropriated by the Government; or in any manner have become private property, or those on which a private right authorized and recognized by the Act or any other valid law may be claimed. Further, Section 8 authorizes the President to suspend the concession or disposition of lands previously declared open to disposition, until again declared open to disposition by his proclamation or by act of Congress.<br><br>Lands of the public domain classified as alienable and disposable are further classified, under Section 9 of C.A. No. 141, according to their use or purpose into: (1) agricultural; (2) residential, commercial, industrial, or for similar productive purposes; (3) educational, charitable, or other similar purposes; and (4) <u>reservations for townsites and for public and quasi-public uses</u>. Section 9 also authorizes the President to make the classifications and, at any time, transfer lands from one class to another.<br><br>Section 83 of C.A. No. 141 defines <b>public domain lands classified as reservations for public and quasi-public uses</b> as "any tract or tracts of <b>land of the public domain</b>" which the President, by proclamation and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, may <i>designate</i> "as reservations for the use of the Republic of the Philippines or any of its branches, or of the inhabitants thereof or "for quasi-public uses or purposes when the public interest requires it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Under Section 88 of the same Act, <b>these "reserved tract or tracts of lands shall be non-alienable and shall not be subject to occupation, entry, sale, lease or other disposition until again declared alienable under the provisions of [CA No. 141] or by proclamation of the President."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As these provisions operate, the President may classify lands of the public domain as alienable and disposable, mineral or timber land, and transfer such lands from one class to another at any time.<br><br>Within the class of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, the President may further classify public domain lands, according to the use or purpose to which they are destined, as agricultural: residential, commercial, industrial, etc.; educational, charitable, etc.; and reservations for townsites and for public and quasi-public uses; and, he may transfer such lands from one class to the other at any time.<br><br>Thus, the President may, for example, transfer a certain parcel of land from its classification as agricultural (under Section 9 [a]), to residential, commercial, industrial, or for similar purposes (under Section 9 [b]) and declare it available for disposition under any of the modes of disposition of alienable and disposable public lands available under C.A. No. 141, as amended.<br><br>The modes of disposition of alienable and disposable lands available under C.A. No. 141 include: (1) by homestead settlement (Chapter IV), by sale (Chapter V), by lease (Chapter VI) and by confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles (Chapters VII and VIII) for agricultural lands under Title II of C.A. No. 141 as amended; (2) by sale or by lease for residential, commercial, or industrial lands under Title III of C.A. No. 141, as amended; (3) by donation, sale, lease, exchange or any other form for educational and charitable lands under Title IV of C.A. No. 141, as amended; and (4) by sale by public auction for townsite reservations under Chapter XI, Title V of C.A. No. 141, as amended.<br><br>Once these parcels of lands are actually acquired by private persons, either by sale, grant, or other modes of disposition, they are removed from the mass of land of the public domain and become, by operation of law, their private property.<br><br>With particular regard, however, to parcels of land classified as reservations for public and quasi-public uses (under Section 9 [d]), when the President transfers them to the class of .alienable and disposable public domain lands destined for residential, commercial, industrial, or for similar purposes (under Section 9 [b]), or some other class under Section 9, these reserved public domain lands become available for disposition under any of the available modes of disposition under C.A. No. 141, as provided above. Once these re-classified lands (to residential purposes from reservation for public and quasi-public uses) are actually acquired by private persons, they become private property.<br><br>In the meantime, however, and until the parcels of land are actually granted to, acquired, or purchased by private persons, they remain lands of the public domain which the President, under Section 9 of C.A. No. 141, may classify again as reservations for public and quasi-public uses. The President may also, under Section 8 of C.A. No. 141, suspend their concession or disposition.<br><br>If these parcels of land are re-classified as reservations before they are actually acquired by private persons, or if the President suspends their concession or disposition, they shall not be subject to occupation, entry, sale, lease, or other disposition until again declared open for disposition by proclamation of the President pursuant to Section 88 in relation with Section 8 of C.A. No. 141.<br><br>Thus, in a limited sense, parcels of land classified as reservations for public or quasi-public uses under Section 9 (d) of C.A. No. 141 are still non-alienable and non-disposable, even though they are, by the general classification under Section 6, alienable and disposable lands of the public domain. By specific declaration under Section 88, in relation with Section 8, these lands classified as reservations are non-alienable and non-disposable.<br><br>In short, parcels of land classified as reservations for public or quasi-public uses: (1) are non-alienable and non-disposable in view of Section 88 (in relation with Section 8) of CA No. 141 specifically declaring them as non-alienable and not subject to disposition; and (2) they remain public domain lands until they are actually disposed of in favor of private persons.<br><br>Complementing and reinforcing this interpretation - that lands designated as reservations for public and quasi-public uses are non-alienable and non-disposable and retain their character as land of the public domain is the Civil Code with its provisions on Property that deal with lands in general. We find these provisions significant to our discussion and interpretation as lands are property, whether they are public lands or private lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this regard, Article 419 of the Civil Code classifies property as either of public dominion or of private ownership. Article 420<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> defines property of the public dominion as those which are intended for public use or, while not intended for public use, belong to the State and are intended for some public service. Article 421, on the other hand, defines patrimonial property as all other property of the State which is not of the character stated in Article 420. While Article 422 states that public dominion property which is no longer intended for public use or service shall form part of the State's patrimonial property.<br><br>Thus, from the perspective of the general Civil Code provisions on Property, lands which are intended for public use or public service such as reservations for public or quasi-public uses are property of the public dominion and remain to be so as long as they remain reserved.<br><br>As property of the public dominion, public lands reserved for public or quasi-public uses are outside the commerce of man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> They cannot be subject to sale, disposition or encumbrance; any sale, disposition or encumbrance of such property of the public dominion is void for being contrary to law and public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>To be subject to sale, occupation or other disposition, lands of the public domain designated as reservations must first be withdrawn, by act of Congress or by proclamation of the President, from the public or quasi-public use for which it has been reserved or otherwise positively declared to have been converted to patrimonial property, pursuant to Sections 8 and 88 of C.A. No. 141 and Article 422 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Without such express declaration or positive governmental act, the reserved public domain lands remain to be public dominion property of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>To summarize our discussion:<br><br>(1) Lands of the public domain classified as reservations for public or quasi-public uses are non-alienable and shall not be subject to disposition, although they are, by the general classification under Section 6 of C.A. No. 141, alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, until declared open for disposition by proclamation of the President; and<br><br>(2) Lands of the public domain classified as reservations are property of the public dominion; they remain to be property of the public dominion until withdrawn from the public or quasi-public use for which they have been reserved, by act of Congress or by proclamation of the President, or otherwise positively declared to have been converted to patrimonial property.<br><br>Based on these principles, we now examine the various issuances affecting the property in order to determine the property's character and nature, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the property remains public domain property of the State or has become its private property.<br><br>For easier reference, we reiterate the various presidential proclamations and statutes affecting the property:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Proclamation No. 423, series of 1957 - established the FBMR, a military reservation; the property falls within the FBMR;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Proclamation No. 461, series of (September) 1965 - segregated, from the FBMR, a portion of Parcel 3, plan Psd-2031, which includes the property, for disposition in favor of the AFPOVAI;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Proclamation No. 478, series of (October) 1965 — reserved the property in favor of the Veterans Rehabilitation and Medical Training Center (<span style="font-style: italic;">VRMTC</span>); and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">RA No. 7227 (1992), as implemented by EO No. 40, series of 1992 - subject to certain specified exemptions, transferred the military camps within Metro Manila, among others, to the BCDA.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><i>1. Proclamation No. 461 was not the legal basis for the property's sale in favor of NOVAI</i><br><br>We agree with the respondents that while Proclamation No. 461, issued in September 1965, removed from the FBMR a certain parcel of land that includes the property, Proclamation No. 478, issued in October 1965, in turn segregated the property from the area made available for disposition under Proclamation No. 461, and reserved it for the use of the VRMTC.<br><br>We find it clear that Proclamation No. 478 was issued after, not before, Proclamation No. 461. Hence, while Proclamation No. 461 withdrew a certain area or parcel of land from the FBMR and made the covered area available for disposition in favor of the AFPOVAI, Proclamation No. 478 subsequently withdrew the property from the total disposable portion and reserved it for the use of the VRMTC. With the issuance of Proclamation No. 478, the property was transferred back to that class of public domain land reserved for public or quasi-public use or purpose which, consistent with Article 420 of the Civil Code, is property of the public dominion, not patrimonial property of the State.<br><br>Even under the parties' deed of sale, Proclamation No. 2487, not Proclamation No. 461, was used as the authority for the transfer and sale of the property to NOVAI. The subject deed of sale pertinently reads:<br><blockquote>"This DEED OF SALE, made and executed in Manila, Philippines, by the Director of Lands, Pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 878 and in representation of the Republic of the Philippines, hereinafter referred to as the Vendor, in favor of THE NAVY OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION (NOVA) and residing in Fort Bonifacio, Metro Manila, referred to as the Vendee, WITNESSETH:<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>WHEREAS, <b>pursuant to Presidential proclamation No. 478 as amended by proclamation No. 2487</b> in relation to the provision of Act No. 3038 and similar Acts supplemented thereto, the Vendee applied for the purchase of a portion of the above-described Property which portion is identical to Lot 3, Swo-000183 and more particularly described on page two hereof;<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>WHEREAS, the Vendee has complied with all other conditions required by Act No. 3038 in relation to Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, and the rules and regulation promulgated thereunder.<br><br><center>x x x x. (emphasis supplied)<br></center></blockquote>Clearly, the legal basis of the property's sale could not have been Proclamation No. 461.<br><br><i>2. Proclamation No. 2487 which purportedly revoked Proclamation No. 478 does not legally exist; hence, it did not withdraw the property from the reservation or from the public dominion</i><br><br>Neither can Proclamation No. 2487 serve as legal basis for the property's sale in NOVAI's favor. Proclamation No. 2487 purportedly revoked Proclamation No. 478 and declared the property open for disposition in favor of NOVAI.<br><br>The Republic and the BCD A (now <i>respondents</i>) argue that Proclamation No. 2487 does not legally exist; it could not have served to release the property from the mass of the non-alienable property of the State.<br><br>Hence, even if NOVAI relies on Proclamation No. 2487 - on which it did not as it relied on Proclamation No. 4.61 - the sale and NOVAI's title are still void. NOVAI, on the other hand, claims in defense that Proclamation No. 2487 is presumed valid and constitutional, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on the respondents.<br><br>In insisting on the presumptive validity of law, NOVAI obviously failed to grasp and appreciate the thrust of the respondents' arguments, including the impact of the evidence which they presented to support the question they raised regarding the authenticity of Proclamation No. 2487.<br><br>Rather than the validity or constitutionality of Proclamation No. 2487, what the respondents assailed was its legal existence, not whether it was constitutional or not. Put differently, they claimed that Proclamation No. 2487 was never issued by former Pres. Aquino; hence, the presumptive validity and constitutionality of laws cannot apply.<br><br>Accordingly, after the respondents presented their evidence, it was NOVAI's turn to present its own evidence sufficient to rebut that of the respondents. On this point, we find the Republic's evidence sufficiently convincing to show that Proclamation No. 2487 does not legally exist. These pieces of evidence include:<br><br><u><i>First</i></u>, the October 26, 1993 letter of the Solicitor General to the Office of the President inquiring about the existence of Proclamation No. 2487.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><u><i>Second</i></u>, the November 12, 1993 letter-reply of the Office of the President informing the Solicitor General that Proclamation No. 2487 "is not among the alleged documents on file with [its] Office."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><u><i>Third</i></u>, the testimony of the Assistant Director of the Records Office in Malacañang confirming that indeed, after verifying their records or of the different implementing agencies, "[t]here is no existing document(s) in [their] possession regarding that alleged Proclamation No. 2487;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and<br><br><u><i>Fourth</i> and last</u>, the October 11, 1993 Memorandum of then Department of Justice Secretary Frahklin M.

Aquino followed a series or sequential pattern with each succeeding issuance bearing a proclamation number one count higher than the proclamation number of the preceding Presidential Proclamation. It also shows that on or about the time Proclamation No. 2487 was purportedly issued, the proclamation numbers of the proclamations issued by President Aquino did not go beyond the hundreds series.<br><br>It is highly implausible that Proclamation No. 2487 was issued on September 25, 1991, or on any day close to September 25, 1991, when the proclamations issued for the same period were sequentially numbered and bore three-digit proclamation numbers.<br><br>As Proclamation No. 2487 does not legally exist and therefore could not have validly revoked Proclamation No. 478, we find, as the CA also correctly did, that Proclamation No. 478 stands as the most recent manifestation of the State's intention to reserve the property anew for some public or quasi-public use or purpose. Thus, consistent with Sections 88, in relation with Section 8, of C.A. No. 141 and Article 420 of the Civil Code, as discussed above, the property which was classified again as reservation for public or quasi-public use or purpose is non-alienable and not subject to disposition; it also remains property of the public dominion; hence, non-alienable and non-disposable land of the public domain.<br><br>As a consequence, when R.A. No. 7227 took effect in 1992, the property subject of this case, which does not fall among the areas specifically designated as exempt from the law's operation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> was, by legal fiat, transferred to the BCDA's authority.<br><br><b><i>B.

It is a well-settled doctrine that registration under the Torrens System does not, by itself, vest title as it is not a mode of acquiring ownership;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> that registration under the Torrens System merely confirms the registrant's already existing title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the indefeasibility of a Torrens title does not apply in this case and does not attach to NOVAI's title. The principle of indefeasibility does not apply when the sale of the property and the title based thereon are null and void. Hence, the Republic's action to declare the nullity of NOVAI's void title has not prescribed.<br><br>NOVAI insists that the deed of sale carries the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties as it bears all the earmarks of a valid deed of sale and is duly notarized.<br><br>While we agree that duly notarized deeds of sale carry the legal presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, like all other disputable legal presumptions, applies only in the absence of clear and convincing evidence establishing the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>When, as in this case, the evidence on record shows not only that the property was reserved for public use or purpose, and thus, non-disposable - a fact that on its own defeats all the evidence which the petitioner may have had to support the validity of the sale - but also shows that the sale and the circumstances leading to it are void in form and in substance, the disputable presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties certainly cannot apply.<br><br><b><i>C. Even assuming that Proclamation No. 2487 legally exists, the sale of the property to NOVAI is illegal.</i></b><br><br><i>1. Dir.

As the sale was executed by the LMB Director covering the property that was reserved for the use of the VRMTC, it, therefore, clearly violated the provisions of Act No. 3038.<br><br><i>2.
