They defaulted in their installment payments, and their failure to pay despite demand resulted in the entire outstanding balance of the loan, plus interests and other charges, becoming due and demandable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On April 18, 2004, Bank of the Philippine Islands foreclosed the mortgaged property after due notice and publication, and sold it to the highest bidder at the public auction for P2,900,000.00. A deficiency of P27,744,762.49 remained after the tendered bid price had been deducted from the Spouses Genuino's total obligation of P30,644,762.49. The Spouses Genuino failed to pay the deficiency despite written demands by the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Thus, Bank of the Philippine Islands filed the Complaint. It prayed for the reduced amount of P10,626,121.69, waiving partly the stipulated interest, and waiving totally the late payment charges and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On November 25, 2009, the Spouses Genuino filed their Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses. They argued nullity of the auction sale for lack of notice or demand made to them before and after the alleged foreclosure. Even assuming the auction sale was valid, they argued that Bank of the Philippine Islands waived the remedy of collection when it chose to foreclose the security. The Spouses Genuino included a Compulsory Counterclaim for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On December 2, 2009, Bank of the Philippine Islands received a copy of the Answer and opted not to file any Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court, in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated May 17, 2010, dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of interest to prosecute under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.

The assigned secretary of counsel had already left the firm, and the bank could no longer seek an explanation for the misfiling of the case after it had been unloaded by previous counsel. The bank argued for the application of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC. The court denied reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, in its Decision dated February 26, 2013, denied due course and dismissed Bank of the Philippine Islands' Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It found no grave abuse of discretion by the trial court in dismissing without prejudice the bank's Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Hence, Bank of the Philippine Islands filed this Petition.<br><br>The bank submits that with the issuance of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC, "it is no longer proper to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute starting August 16, 2004 due to the non-filing by the plaintiff of a Motion to Set Case for Pre Trial Conference but instead the Clerk of Court should issue an Order setting the case for Pre Trial Conference."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It quotes <i>Espiritu, et al. v.

No. 03-1-09-SC it is the duty of the plaintiff to prosecute its action within a reasonable length of time and the failure to do so would justify the dismissal of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The issue for resolution is whether the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the case without prejudice on the ground of failure to prosecute when Bank of the Philippine Islands failed to file a motion to set case for pre-trial conference.<br><br>We deny this Petition by Bank of the Philippine Islands.<br><br>The trial court dismissed the Complaint pursuant to Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court. This dismissal operated as an adjudication on the merits:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 3.</b> <i>Dismissal due to fault of plaintiff</i>. â€” If, for no justifiable cause, the plaintiff fails to appear on the date of the presentation of his evidence in chief on the complaint, or to prosecute his action for an unreasonable length of time, or to comply with these Rules or any order of the court, the complaint may be dismissed upon motion of the defendant or upon the court's own motion <b><i>without prejudice to the right of the defendant</i></b> to prosecute his counterclaim in the same or in a separate action. <b><i>This dismissal shall have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise declared by the court</i></b><i>.</i> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC entitled <i>Re: Proposed Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-Trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures</i> took effect on August 16, 2004. This provides that:<br><blockquote>I. Pre-Trial<br><blockquote>A. Civil Cases<br><br>1....<br><br>....<br><br>Within five (5) days from date of filing of the reply, the plaintiff must promptly move ex parte that the case be set for pre-trial conference. <b><i>If the plaintiff fails to file said motion within the given period, the Branch COC shall issue a notice of pre-trial.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Respondents Spouses Genuino cannot rely on <i>Olave v. Mistas</i> as this involved a trial court Order dated October 20, 1997 dismissing the Complaint with prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The facts in <i>Olave</i> took place before the effectivity of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC on August 16, 2004.<br><br><i>Espiritu, et al. v. Lazaro, et al</i>. quoted by petitioner Bank of the Philippine Islands "clarified the application of [A.M.] No. 03-l-09[-SC] to cases filed after its effectivity on August 16, 2004":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote>In every action, the plaintiffs are duty-bound to prosecute their case with utmost diligence and with reasonable dispatch to enable them to obtain the relief prayed for and, at the same time, to minimize the clogging of the court dockets. Parallel to this is the defendants' right to have a speedy disposition of the case filed against them, essentially, to prevent their defenses from being impaired.<br><br><b><i>Since the incidents occurred prior to the effectivity of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC on August 16, 2004, the guidelines stated therein should not be made applicable to this case.</i></b> Instead, the prevailing rule and jurisprudence at that time should be utilized in resolving the case.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 18 of the Rules of Court imposes upon the plaintiff the duty to set the case for pre-trial after the last pleading is served and filed. Under Section 3 of Rule 17, failure to comply with the said duty makes the case susceptible to dismissal for failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time or failure to comply with the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Nevertheless, nowhere in the text of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC does it remove the plaintiff's duty under Rule 18, Section 1 of the Rules of Court to set the case for pre-trial after the last pleading has been served and filed. Nowhere does it repeal Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court that allows dismissals due to plaintiff's fault, including plaintiff's failure to comply with the Rules for no justifiable cause. Nowhere does it impose a sole burden on the trial court to set the case for pre-trial.<br><br>Reading A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC together with Rule 17, Section 3 and Rule 18, Section 1 of the Rules of Court accommodates the outright dismissal of a complaint upon plaintiff's failure to show justifiable reason for not setting the case for pre-trial within the period provided by the Rules. Thus, trial courts must consider the facts of each case.<br><br>This court has allowed cases to proceed despite failure by the plaintiff to promptly move for pre-trial when it finds that "the extreme sanction of dismissal of the complaint might not be warranted":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><blockquote>It must be stressed that even if the plaintiff fails to promptly move for pre-trial without any justifiable cause for such delay, <b><i>the extreme sanction of dismissal of the complaint might not be warranted if no substantial prejudice would be caused to the defendant, and there are special and compelling reasons which would make the strict application of the rule clearly unjustified</i></b>.<br><br>....<br><br>While "heavy pressures of work" was not considered a persuasive reason to justify the failure to set the case for pre-trial in <span style="font-style: italic;">Olave v. Mistas</span>, however, unlike the respondents in the said case, herein respondent never failed to comply with the Rules of Court or any order of the trial court at any other time. Failing to file a motion to set the case for pre-trial was her first and only technical lapse during the entire proceedings. Neither has she manifested an evident pattern or a scheme to delay the disposition of the case nor a wanton failure to observe the mandatory requirement of the rules. Accordingly, the ends of justice and fairness would best be served if the parties are given the full opportunity to litigate their claims and the real issues involved in the case are threshed out in a full-blown trial. Besides, petitioners would not be prejudiced should the case proceed as they are not stripped of any affirmative defenses nor deprived of due process of law.<br><br>This is not to say that adherence to the Rules could be dispensed with. However, exigencies and situations might occasionally demand flexibility in their application. Indeed, on several occasions, the Court relaxed the rigid application of the rules of procedure to afford the parties opportunity to fully ventilate the merits of their cases. This is in line with the time-honored principle that cases should be decided only after giving all parties the chance to argue their causes and defenses. Technicality and procedural imperfection should thus not serve as basis of decisions.<br><br>Finally, A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC or the new <i>Guidelines To Be Observed By Trial Court Judges And Clerks Of Court In The Conduct Of Pre-Trial And Use Of Deposition-Discovery Measures</i>, which took effect on August 16, 2004, aims to abbreviate court proceedings, ensure prompt disposition of cases and decongest court dockets, and to further implement the pre-trial guidelines laid down in Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999. A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC states that: Within five (5) days from date of filing of the reply, the plaintiff must promptly move <i>ex-parte</i> that the case be set for pre-trial conference. If the plaintiff fails to file said motion within the given period, the Branch COC shall issue a notice of pre-trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As such, the clerk of court of Branch 17 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos should issue a notice of pre-trial to the parties and set the case for pre-trial. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, this court has sustained dismissals due to plaintiff's fault after finding that plaintiff's failure to prosecute or comply with the rules was without justifiable reason.

Although it was discretionary under the 1940 Rules of Court, it was made mandatory under the 1964 Rules and the subsequent amendments in 1997.

It protects the right to speedy trial without compromising substantive justice.<br><br>A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC upholds this purpose in requiring the Clerk of Court to issue a notice of pre-trial "[i]f the plaintiff fails to file [the] said motion [to set case for pre-trial] within the given period[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>However, petitioner Bank of the Philippine Islands also has the duty to set the case for pre-trial after the last pleading has been served and filed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and to diligently pursue its case and comply with the rules.

For instance, it could have weighed that the costs of pursuing its litigation against respondents Spouses Genuino outweigh the potential benefits. It could be that their business with the bank was far more valuable than the incidental rupture in their relationship caused by this transaction. In all these possible cases, respondents Spouses Genuino and other debtors have a right to rely on the non-action of the plaintiff. In their view, the non-filing of the basic motion for setting of pre-trial would have been, at best, a reasonable economic signal that the bank was no longer interested. At worse, it was clearly negligence of an entity with enough institutional resources to maintain a large arsenal of in-house and external counsel. The bank's explanation for its own negligence is unavailing. While it is true that A.M.
