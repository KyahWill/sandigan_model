On 15 August and 25 October 2007, 11 February, 28 April, 23 July and 11 November 2008, and 22 January 2009, the Labor Arbiter issued seven other alias writs of execution ordering the sheriff to collect from petitioners Solidum’s accrued salaries, allowances, benefits, incentives and bonuses.<br><br>In its 26 January 2009 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter’s 3 July 2006 Decision and dismissed for lack of merit Solidum’s complaint.&nbsp;

The Labor Arbiter held that:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, the NLRC promulgated its Decision dated January 26, 2009 reversing this Office’s Decision dated July 03, 2006.&nbsp; Also, the NLRC in its Decision dated May 29, 2009 denied the complainant’s motion for reconsideration of its Decision dated January 26, 2009.&nbsp; This Office is mindful of the fact that the NLRC is tasked with the review of decisions promulgated by this Office, as such, it is a higher tribunal as contemplated by law.<br><br>Verily, the recent decision of the NLRC reversing the Decision of this Office prevents any future issuance of any writ of execution on the reinstatement aspect in line with Gracia, et al. vs. Philippine Airlines, Inc. and International Container Terminal Services vs. NLRC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Solidum appealed to the NLRC.<br><br><b><center><u>The NLRC’s Ruling</u></center></b><br>In its 31 May 2010 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter’s 29 July 2009 Order.&nbsp; The NLRC held that:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, records show that respondents appealed from the Labor Arbiter’s Decision to the Commission on July 25, 2006.&nbsp; The Commission resolved respondents’ appeal on January 26, 2009, reversing the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated July 3, 2006.&nbsp; Notably, there is no showing in the records that respondents reinstated complainant to his former position.&nbsp; Hence, pursuant to Article 223 of the Labor Code, as amended, relative to the reinstatement aspect of the Labor Arbiter’s Decision, respondents are obligated to pay complainant’s salaries and benefits, computed from July 13, 2006, when respondents received a copy of the Labor Arbiter’s Decision which, among others, ordered the reinstatement of complainant, up to the date of finality of the Commission’s resolution reversing the Labor Arbiter’s Decision, which, for this purpose, is reckoned on May 29, 2009, when the Commission denied complainant’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Indeed, common sense dictates that complainant’s entitlement to reinstatement salaries/wages and benefits, emanating from the Labor Arbiter’s order of reinstatement, presupposes that said order of reinstatement is still enforceable.&nbsp; Here, the Labor Arbiter’s order of reinstatement dated July 3, 2006 was no longer enforceable as of May 29, 2009 when the Commission’s resolution reversing the Labor Arbiter’s order of reinstatement is deemed to have become final as hereinabove discussed.&nbsp; Patently then, complainant is no longer entitled to reinstatement salaries/wages and benefits after May 29, 2009.<br><br>Significantly, the Order of the Labor Arbiter being appealed from by complainant, denied the latter’s motion for issuance of alias writ of execution for the collection of his reinstatement salaries and benefits for the period covering January 21, 2009 to April 20, 2009.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter thus committed serious error in denying complainant’s motion with respect to his reinstatement salaries and benefits as he is entitled to the same for the period starting July 13, 2006 to May 29, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>Solidum filed a motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for partial reconsideration.&nbsp; Petitioners filed a motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for reconsideration.&nbsp; In its 30 July 2010 Resolution, the NLRC granted Solidum’s motion for partial reconsideration and denied for lack of merit petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The NLRC held that:<br><br><blockquote>Our Entry of Judgment dated June 01, 2010 clearly states that the Decision promulgated by this Commission on May 29, 2009 had become final and executory on August 10, 2009.&nbsp; Thus, We so hold that the date of finality of Our Decision reversing the Labor Arbiter’s Decision dated July 3, 2006 is August 10, 2009, and the computation of complainant’s reinstatement or accrued salaries/wages and other benefits should be up to August 10, 2009.<br><br>Anent respondents’ Motion for Reconsideration, We find the same unmeritorious.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitoners appealed to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In his alias writ<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of execution dated 22 October 2010, the Labor Arbiter ordered the sheriff to collect from petitioners P1,440,667.93, representing Solidum’s accrued salaries, allowances, benefits, incentives and bonuses from 21 January to 20 April 2009.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court of Appeals’ Ruling</u></b></center><br>In its 25 January 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court of Appeals granted petitioners’ petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and set aside the NLRC’s 31 May 2010 Decision and 30 July 2010 Resolution.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that:<br><br><blockquote>The order of the Labor Arbiter denying Private Respondent’s ex-parte motion for issuance of Alias Writ of Execution is not a final order as there was something else to be done, namely, the resolution of his Complaint for Illegal Dismissal against Petitioners on the merits.&nbsp; The subject Order of the Labor Arbiter did not put an end to the issues of illegal suspension and illegal dismissal, and, thus, partakes the nature of an interlocutory order.&nbsp; It is jurisprudential that an interlocutory order is not appealable until after the rendition of the judgment on the merits for a contrary rule would delay the administration of justice and unduly burden the courts.&nbsp; Being interlocutory in nature, the subject Order could not have been validly appealed.<br><br>Moreover, as correctly argued by the Petitioners, an appeal from an interlocutory order is a prohibited pleading under Section 4 of the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the NLRC.&nbsp; Consequently, the Labor Arbiter’s order being interlocutory and unappealable, Public Respondent NLRC has no jurisdiction to rule on the appeal except to dismiss the same.&nbsp; The assailed Decision and the Resolution, rendered in excess of the Public Respondent NLRC’s jurisdiction, are therefore null.<br><br>Besides and more importantly, records show that the Decision, dated May 29, 2009, of the NLRC in the Illegal Dismissal Case which effectively denied Private Respondent’s Complaint for Illegal Dismissal against Petitioners already attained finality on June 1, 2010.&nbsp; Indeed, an Entry of Judgment was accordingly made.&nbsp; Clearly, Private Respondent can neither pray nor cause this Court to grant his Ex-parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution to reinstate him since his dismissal by Petitioners was finally ruled to be legal; hence, the denial of his complaint for lack of merit.&nbsp; Ruling on Private Respondent’s Ex-parte motion shall also have an effect of reviewing a final judgment which the law and the court abhor.&nbsp; It bears to stress that when a final judgment becomes executory, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>Solidum filed a motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> for reconsideration.<br><br>In his alias writ<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of execution dated 18 May 2011, the Labor Arbiter ordered the sheriff to collect from petitioners P1,440,667.93, representing Solidum’s accrued salaries, allowances, benefits, incentives and bonuses from 21 April to 20 July 2009.&nbsp; Petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals a motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to order Solidum to return P2,881,335.86, representing the total amount under the 22 October 2010 and 18 May 2011 alias writs of execution.<br><br>In its 3 July 2012 Amended Decision, the Court of Appeals partly granted Solidum’s motion for reconsideration and denied petitioners’ motion to order the return of P2,881,335.86.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]here was a wrong appreciation of fact relative to the date of finality of judgment.&nbsp; The true date when the May 29, 2009 NLRC decision became final and executory was on August 10, 2009 and not on June 1, 2010.&nbsp;
