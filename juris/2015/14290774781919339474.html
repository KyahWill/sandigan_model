They claim that private respondents neither submitted evidence nor were they required by respondent judge to submit evidence in support of their motions on the issue of indigency of petitioners.&nbsp; They contend that respondent judge disregarded their constitutional right to free access to courts by issuing the assailed orders.<br><br>First Asia Realty/SM, for its part, argues that the instant petition should be dismissed due to fatal infirmities such as violation of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts; deliberate, willful, and blatant forum-shopping; and arrogant refusal to the proper docket fees in the case <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; It also contends that petitioners are not entitled to be considered as indigent litigants since the evidence on record glaringly shows that petitioners failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 19, Rule 141 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>.&nbsp; First Asia Realty/SM claims that the parties were given sufficient opportunities to support their respective claims and that the assailed orders were issued only after a judicious study of the parties’ submissions.&nbsp; It further disagrees that petitioners’ right to free access to courts were violated since they were required to pay the proper amount of docket fees only after it was established that they are not qualified as indigent litigants.<br><br>Like First Asia Realty/SM, Ortigas also prays for the dismissal of the instant petition.&nbsp; It argues that contrary to petitioners’ claims, the records would show that the court <i>a quo</i> did in fact hold numerous hearings to assess the issue of petitioners’ non-payment of docket fees.&nbsp; There was a hearing scheduled on July 16, 2007 to hear Ortigas’ Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Cite Plaintiffs and Counsel in Contempt which raised this issue.&nbsp; While said hearing was rescheduled on August 24, 2007, it was nonetheless attended by petitioners’ counsel.&nbsp; Petitioners even filed a Manifestation dated July 10, 2007 wherein they adopted their Comment/Opposition to Defendant Ortigas’ Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Cite Plaintiffs and Counsel in Contempt filed in Civil Case No. MC-07-3226 before Branch 214.&nbsp; Ortigas also points out another opportunity afforded to petitioners to address the issue of non-payment of docket fees during the July 6, 2007 hearing of First Asia Realty/SM’s Motion to Dismiss which likewise raised the issue of non-payment of docket fees.&nbsp; Ortigas says that petitioners filed their Comment/Opposition to the motion to dismiss.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>At the outset, the instant petition should have been dismissed outright for being filed directly with this Court in blatant violation of the rule on hierarchy of courts.&nbsp; In <i>Garcia v. Miro, et. al.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> citing <i>Vergara, Sr. v. Suelto</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this Court stressed the importance of said rule:<br><br><blockquote>x x x In <i>Vergara, Sr. v. Suelto,</i> this Court stressed that “[w]here the issuance of an extraordinary writ is also within the competence of the Court of Appeals or a Regional Trial Court, it is in either of these courts that the specific action for the writ’s procurement must be presented,” thus:<br><blockquote>The Supreme Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the fundamental charter and immemorial tradition.&nbsp; It cannot and should not be burdened with the task of dealing with causes in the first instance. Its original jurisdiction to issue the so-called extraordinary writs should be exercised only where absolutely necessary or where serious and important reasons exist therefor.&nbsp; Hence, that jurisdiction should generally be exercised relative to actions or proceedings before the Court of Appeals, or before constitutional or other tribunals, bodies or agencies whose acts for some reason or another are not controllable by the Court of Appeals. Where the issuance of an extraordinary writ is also within the competence of the Court of Appeals or a Regional Trial Court, it is in either of these courts that the specific action for the writ’s procurement must be presented. This is, and should continue, to be the policy in this regard, a policy that courts and lawyers must strictly observe.&nbsp; (Emphasis omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Setting aside said procedural defect, this Court will look into the merit of petitioners’ allegation of lack of the required hearing in resolving the issue of indigency.<br><br>Petitioners cite Section 21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Indigent party.</i> – A party may be authorized to litigate his action, claim or defense as an indigent if the court, upon an ex parte application and hearing, is satisfied that the party is one who has no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his family.<br><br>Such authority shall include an exemption from payment of docket and other lawful fees, and of transcripts of stenographic notes which the court may order to be furnished him. The amount of the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from paying shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent, unless the court otherwise provides.<br><br>Any adverse party may contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered by the trial court. If the court should determine after hearing that the party declared as an indigent is in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be assessed and collected by the clerk of court. If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court, execution shall issue or the payment thereof, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court may impose.</blockquote><br>Respondents, on the other hand, cite Section 19, Rule 141 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>, as amended by A.M. No. 00-2-01-SC and A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 19. <i>Indigent litigants exempt from payment of legal fees</i>. – Indigent litigants (a) whose gross income and that of their immediate family do not exceed an amount double the monthly minimum wage of an employee and (b) who do not own real property with A FAIR MARKET VALUE AS STATED IN THE CURRENT TAX DECLARATION of more than THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P300,000.00) PESOS shall be exempt from the payment of legal fees.<br><br>The legal fees shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent litigant unless the court otherwise provides.<br><br>To be entitled to the exemption herein provided, the litigant shall execute an affidavit that he and his immediate family do not earn a gross income abovementioned, and they do not own any real property with the fair value aforementioned, supported by an affidavit of a disinterested person attesting to the truth of the litigant’s affidavit. The current tax declaration, if any, shall be attached to the litigant’s affidavit.<br><br>Any falsity in the affidavit of litigant or disinterested person shall be sufficient cause to dismiss the complaint or action or to strike out the pleading of that party, without prejudice to whatever criminal liability may have been incurred.</blockquote><br>In the case of <i>Spouses Algura v. Local Gov’t. Unit of the City of Naga</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this Court had the opportunity to explain how the two rules cited by the opposing parties can stand together and are compatible with each other, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In the light of the foregoing considerations, therefore, the two (2) rules can stand together and are compatible with each other. When an application to litigate as an indigent litigant is filed, the court shall scrutinize the affidavits and supporting documents submitted by the applicant to determine if the applicant complies with the income and property standards prescribed in the present Section 19 of Rule 141—that is, the applicant’s gross income and that of the applicant’s immediate family do not exceed an amount double the monthly minimum wage of an employee; and the applicant does not own real property with a fair market value of more than Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php300,000.00).&nbsp; If the trial court finds that the applicant meets the income and property requirements, the authority to litigate as indigent litigant is automatically granted and the grant is a matter of right.<br><br>However, if the trial court finds that one or both requirements have not been met, then it would set a hearing to enable the applicant to prove that the applicant has “no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his family.” In that hearing, the adverse party may adduce countervailing evidence to disprove the evidence presented by the applicant; after which the trial court will rule on the application depending on the evidence adduced. In addition, Section 21 of Rule 3 also provides that the adverse party may later still contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered by the trial court, possibly based on newly discovered evidence not obtained at the time the application was heard. If the court determines after hearing, that the party declared as an indigent is in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be assessed and collected by the clerk of court. If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court, execution shall issue or the payment of prescribed fees shall be made, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court may impose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>In the instant case, based on the list of documents submitted by petitioners in support of their Motion for Leave and to Admit Complaint of Indigent Litigants, it cannot be disputed that petitioners failed to complete the requirements set forth in Section 19, Rule 141 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>.&nbsp; They did not execute their own affidavit as required by said Section 19.&nbsp; And as this Court ruled in <i>Spouses Algura</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> if the trial court finds that one or both requirements have not been met, then it would set a hearing to enable the applicant to prove that the applicant has “no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his family.”<br><br>As correctly argued by Ortigas, the hearing requirement, contrary to petitioners’ claim, was complied with during the hearings on the motions to dismiss filed by respondents. In said hearings, petitioners’ counsel was present and they were given the opportunity to prove their indigency. Clearly, their non-payment of docket fees is one of the grounds raised by respondents in their motions to dismiss and the hearings on the motions were indeed the perfect opportunity for petitioners to prove that they are entitled to be treated as indigent litigants and thus exempted from the payment of docket fees as initially found by the Executive Judge.&nbsp; Moreover, not only were petitioners properly represented during the hearings on the motions to dismiss, they even filed on July 10, 2007 a Manifestation wherein they adopted the Comment/Opposition to Defendant Ortigas’ Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Cite Plaintiffs and Counsel in Contempt filed in Civil Case No. MC07-3226 before Branch 214 and on July 11, 2007, a Comment/Opposition to Motion to Dismiss of First Asia Realty/SM.&nbsp; Thus, it is erroneous for them to claim that respondents neither submitted evidence nor were they required by respondent judge to submit evidence on the issue of indigency and that respondent judge disregarded their constitutional right to free access to courts.&nbsp; In sum, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to respondent judge in issuing the assailed orders.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Orders dated March 18, 2008 and May 30, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City, Branch 211, in Civil Case No. MC07-3276 are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, Villarama, Jr., Reyes, </i>and <i>Jardeleza, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><div align="right"><b><u>March 23, 2015</u></b><br></div><br><br><center><b>N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T</b></center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on ___<u><b>February 11, 2015</b></u>___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on March 23, 2015 at 2:45 p.m.<br><br><br><center>Very truly yours,<br><b>(SGD)<br>WILFREDO V.
