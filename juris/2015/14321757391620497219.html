Fuentes (Fuentes) was hired as a security guard by Protective sometime in November 1999. At the time of Fuentes' employment, Protective assigned him to Picop Resources, Inc. He was posted to a security checkpoint designated as Post 33 in Upper New Visayas, Agusan del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 20, 2000, a group of armed persons ransacked Post 33 and took five (5) M-16 rifles, three (3) carbine rifles, and one (1) Browning Automatic Rifle, all with live ammunition and magazines. Agency-issued uniforms and personal items were also taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> These armed persons inflicted violence upon Fuentes and the other security guards present at Post 33, namely: Francisco Dalacan, Rolando Gualberto Lindo, Jr. (Lindo, Jr.), Cempron (Cempron), and Wilson Maravilles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Francisco Dalacan was employed by Protective, while the others were employed by Meshim Security Agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On the same day of the incident, Fuentes and his fellow security guards reported the raid to the Philippine National Police in Trento, Agusan del Sur. When asked by the police, Fuentes reported that he and the other security guards assigned to Post 33 were accosted at gunpoint by the New People's Army.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>After its initial investigation, the Philippine National Police found reason to believe that Fuentes conspired and acted in consort with the New People's Army.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This was based on the two (2) affidavits executed by Lindo, Jr. and Cempron, who were both present in the July 20, 2000 raid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In their affidavits, Lindo, Jr. and Cempron stated that Fuentes should be prosecuted for criminal acts done on July 20, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On July 24, 2000, the Philippine National Police, through Senior Police Officer IV Benjamin Corda, Jr., filed the Complaint for robbery committed by a band against Fuentes, a certain Mario Cabatlao, and others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This was filed before the Second Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Trento-Sta. Josefa-Veruela in Trento, Agusan del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Complaint stated that Fuentes was a "cohort of the NPA in the raid[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Immediately upon the filing of the Complaint, Fuentes was detained at the Mangagoy Police Sub-Station, Mangagoy, Bislig, Surigao del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> During his detention, he alleged that he was "mauled and tied up by the security officers of [Protective]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> To preserve proof of these claims, Fuentes had pictures taken of his injuries while in custody and acquired a medical certificate detailing his injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the Order dated August 1, 2000, Judge Particio Balite of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Trento-Sta. Josefa-Veruela directed that Fuentes be transferred from the Mangagoy Police Sub-Station to Trento Municipal Jail in Trento, Agusan del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In his return to this court order, however, Police Inspector Ernesto Escartin Sr. (Inspector Escartin) reported:<br><blockquote>. . . Celso Fuentes is no longer in the custody of this station and he is never detained [<i>sic</i>] in this station but requested that he will be put to custody for fear of his life. . . . [H]e left this station on July 28, 2000 at around 2:45 in the afternoon accompanied by his mother. The last known address of subject person is Sta. Josefa, Trento, Agusan del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>On August 15, 2001, the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Surigao del Sur issued the Resolution dismissing the Complaint against Fuentes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It found during preliminary investigation that there was no probable cause to warrant the filing of an Information against Fuentes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On March 14, 2002, Fuentes filed the Complaint "for illegal dismissal, non-payment of salaries, overtime pay, premium pay for holiday and rest day, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, service incentive leave and damages against [Protective], Picop [Resources, Inc.], Ernie S. Dolina and Wilfredo Fuentes before [the National Labor Relations Commission] Regional Arbitration Branch XIII in Butuan City."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In his Position Paper, Fuentes claimed that "right after the criminal complaint for robbery against [him] was dismissed ... he demanded to return to work but he was . . . refused entry by [a certain] Mr. [Regildo] Espinosa on the ground that [Fuentes] [was] a member of the NPA and that his position had already been filled up by another security guard."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Protective claims that "[a]s was usual and routine, [Fuentes] should have reported to his Team Leader or Officer-in-Charge. Since the incident of July 20, 2000, private respondent has not yet reported to his Team [L]eader or to any of the officers of [Protective]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Executive Labor Arbiter Rogelio P. Legaspi (Labor Arbiter Legaspi) rendered his Decision in favor of Protective, thus:<br><blockquote>As borne out by the record, complainant was not dismissed from the service much less illegally by the respondents PMSAI and/or Ernie S. Dolina. What happened was that complainant was charged by the PNP Trento, Agusan del, Sur in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Municipal Circuit Trial Court of TRENTO-STA. JOSEFA-VERUELA, Trento, Agusan del Sur for conspiring and confederating with the purported members of the New People's Army in robbing PMSAI (Post 33) . . . mainly based on the statements of security guards Gualberto Lindo, Jr. and Rolando Cempron of Mishem Security Agency who were also assigned at Post 33. Because of this incident, complainant was detained at the Mangagoy Police Sub-Station, Mangagoy, Bislig, Surigao [d]el Sur and later at the Trento Municipal Jail, Trento, Agusan del Sur.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by respondents PRI and/or Wilfredo Fuentes, complainant was unable to perform his duties and responsibilities as security guard due to the criminal charges filed against him, hence he was replaced with another guard.<br><br>Complainant's claim that respondents refused to admit him back to work after it was found out that he was innocent of the charges against him is not supported by relevant and/or material evidence. Moreover, complainant even failed to state with sufficient defmiteness and/or clarity the time and date when he allegedly reported for work after the dismissal of his case on 15 August 2001. In fact, respondents PMSAI and/or Ernie S. Dolina aver that complainant has not reported to any of his superiors since 20 July 2000 up to the present (17 July 2002). Neither was [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] his whereabouts known to PMSAI as he cannot be found despite diligent efforts. Hence, notice for him to explain his involvement in the incident of 20 July 2000 at Post 33 could not be properly served. The only manifestation of complainant's existence, respondents admit, came only when respondents were notified of a labor complaint filed by the complainant before this Branch sometime in April 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission reversed the Decision of Labor Arbiter Legaspi and found that Fuentes was illegally dismissed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED, and a NEW judgment is rendered, thus:<br><blockquote>1. declaring the dismissal of complaint [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] as illegal;<br><br>2. ordering respondent Protective Maximum Security Agency to pay complainant full backwages (August 15, 2001 to May 30, 2003) amounting to P204,250.00 (P9,500 x 21.5 mos.) and to reinstate him immediately upon receipt of this decision. However, should reinstatement is no longer feasible [<i>sic</i>], to pay complainant in lieu thereof separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service; and,<br><br>3. ordering same respondent and Picop Resources Inc. to pay complainant in solidum his unpaid salary amounting to P4,750.00, without prejudice however on the part of PRI to present proof of payment/remittance to respondent security agency.<br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Protective filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Protective asserted that the evidence and the records showed that Fuentes was never dismissed because he had been missing until the day he filed the Complaint with the Labor Arbiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> To support its position, Protective raised the following arguments:<br><blockquote>The determination of the respondent NLRC was without basis in law and in fact. Respondent NLRC simply brushed off the established fact that private respondent vanished after the July 20, 2000 incident. . . .<br><br>[F]rom July 20, 2000 until the present time, private respondent never contacted his superior or reported to the head office of petitioner PMSAI, much less attempted to do the same, to officially manifest whether he was still interested in being employed as security guard. Furthermore, it was incumbent upon private respondent to explain why he was implicated in the crime of robbery by fellow security guards. . . .<br><br>Hence, it was physically and legally impossible for petitioner to terminate, constructive, illegal or otherwise [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>], the services of private respondent since the procedure for such an action have [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] have not been initiated. Private respondent had chose [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] not to exercise his rights as an employee and remain unreachable for reasons known only to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It held that Protective failed to discharge its burden to prove a just cause for dismissal:<br><blockquote>Petitioner [Protective] bases its contention that private respondent [Fuentes] abandoned his job entirely upon its claim that the latter vanished from sight after the July 20, 2000 incident and until he filed the present action.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>First, the records do not support such a claim. As respondent NLRC found:<br><blockquote>[The] [r]ecord shows that after the incident on July 20, 2000, complainant was among those who reported the assault made by the group of NPA at their post in Trento Police Municipal Office, at Trento, Agusan del Sur (Annex "C", complainant's Position Paper). It was only on July 24, 2000 that a criminal complaint was filed in court leading to his arrest and detention. In fact the witnesses at the prosecution [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] are two (2) of the security guards also assigned at Post 33 of respondent PRI, albeit from different [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] security agency (Annex 1, 2 and 3, Respondent PMSAFs Position Paper). It is thus unbelievable that complainant's whereabouts were unknown. (NLRC's August 27, 2003 Resolution, pp. 6-7; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 35-36)<br></blockquote>We note, additionally, from petitioner's own submissions, that private respondent's last known address was given to the investigating court by Police Inspector Escartin in his report to that court. That report, incidentally, also reveals the state of mind of private respondent and explains why he could not report to the offices of petitioner. Private respondent, after having been charged with a crime on the strength of affidavits of petitioner's other security guards and beaten up by them, was so traumatized that <i>he actually asked to remain in the custody of the police because he feared for his life</i>. The intensity of his fear is manifest by the fact that he left the custody of the police only when his mother accompanied him. His fear, incongruous as it may appear in a trained security guard, is nonetheless understandable in view of his allegations of having been beaten up. Which allegations, [w]e note, are not controverted.<br><br>At any rate, the whereabouts of private respondent were available from official records. The claim of petitioner that private respondent "simply vanished" has no evidentiary support.<br><br>But even granting that petitioner was ignorant of private respondent's whereabouts, still it does not suffice to establish abandonment of work. In <i>ACD Investigation Security Agency, Inc. vs. Daquena, G.R. No. 147473, March 30, 2004</i>, the Supreme Court held that:<br><blockquote>... "for abandonment of work to exist, it is essential (1) that the employee must have failed to report for work or must have been absent without valid or justifiable reason; and (2) that there must have been a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship manifested by some overt acts. . . . <u>Absence must be accompanied by overt acts unerringly pointing to the fact that the employee simply does not want to work anymore. And the burden of proof to show that there was unjustified refusal to go back to work rests on the employer</u>."<br></blockquote>... It is not enough to simply allege that the private respondent had "mysteriously disappeared" and that "[a]s usual and routine, private respondent should have reported to his Team Leader or Officer-in-Charge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original, citations omitted).<br></blockquote>Further, the Court of Appeals found that Fuentes should have been afforded his procedural due process rights:<br><blockquote>More is required of the employer who must afford private respondent his right to due process. As respondent NLRC states:<br><blockquote>Granting it was so, respondents should have served a written notice to complainant at his last known address to ascertain whether he is still interested to continue his job. Feigning ignorance of the reason why complainant after being hailed in court failed to report for work is ridiculous, at best, a sham defense. What was clear is that respondents did not exert diligent efforts at all to afford complainant his right to due process. No proof has been adduced to support their defense. Moreover, considering that there was a team leader assigned by respondents to Post 33 where complainant was one of its members, the report of the incident should have come from the team leader and not from the complainant as adverted to by respondents. In sum, respondents have all the opportunities to comply with the due process requirement as mandated by law, yet they deliberately ignored and failed to do so. Such deliberate act of respondent PMSAI reflects their deprivation of due process [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]. The dismissal is thus illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Thus, the Court of Appeals found that the National Labor Relations Commission committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It applied the reasoning of this court in <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Pascua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> where this court held that since the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission is based on substantial evidence, it would not reverse these findings "[a]bsent any showing of patent error, or that the [National Labor Relations Commission] failed to consider a fact of substance that if considered would warrant a different result[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this Petition, petitioner assails the Decision of the Court of Appeals and states that it is the findings of Labor Arbiter Legaspi that should have been upheld. It argues that the findings of fact and conclusions of Labor Arbiters are accorded great weight since they have the opportunity to determine the facts surrounding the case and the necessary expertise to resolve such matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioner relies on <i>Gelmart Industries (Phils.), Inc. v. Hon. Leogardo, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and argues that "[w]hen confronted with conflicting versions of factual matters, the Labor Arbiter has the discretion to determine which party deserves credence on the basis of evidence received."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> For petitioner, Labor Arbiter Legaspi rightfully concluded that respondent abandoned his post, a finding that the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Petitioner states that, by analogy, the Labor Arbiter's findings are akin to those of a trial judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, pursuant to this court's <i>ratio decidendi</i> in <i>People v. Valla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> "the trial judge's evaluation of the testimony of a witness is generally accorded not only the highest respect, but also finality, unless some weighty circumstance has been ignored or misunderstood but which could change the result."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>For petitioner, this is a clear case of abandonment of work by respondent. Petitioner claims that since respondent "vanished"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> without reporting his whereabouts, he manifested a clear intent to leave his employment. Petitioner argues that respondent was not dismissed; no dismissal took place due to respondent's abandonment of duty. Since there was abandonment, the award of backwages and reinstatement is capricious and without basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent never bothered to explain why it took him more than six (6) months from the date petitioner allegedly refused to allow him to work to file the Complaint for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> For petitioner, this six-month delay in filing the Complaint showed that it was "a mere afterthought on the part of [Fuentes] ,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Citing <i>Indophil Acrylic Mfg. Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> petitioner claims that respondent should have been more vigilant of his rights as an employee because at stake was not only his position but also his means of livelihood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, he should have reported to his supervisor immediately after the July 20, 2000 raid at Post 33.<br><br>Petitioner contends further that contrary to the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals, there was no specific last known address where petitioner could have provided a written notice to respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Petitioner argues that the purported last address of respondent is "in Sta. Josefa, Trento, Agusan del Sur."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The insufficiency of the address rendered it impossible for petitioner to provide notice to respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, respondent's right to procedural due process was not violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>For respondent, the Court of Appeals correctly found that the National Labor Relations Commission did not commit grave abuse of discretion. Respondent asserts that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in affirming the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission. He raises that the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals correctly found that he did not abandon his job. Respondent reiterates that after the dismissal of the criminal Complaint for robbery filed against him, he tried his best to resume work. However, he was refused because he was allegedly a member of the New People's Army and he had already been replaced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>According to respondent, the Court of Appeals found no evidence to support petitioner's allegation that he had "simply vanished."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Respondent reiterates the findings of the Court of Appeals, particularly the report of Inspector Escartin. That report showed that respondent was traumatized from having been charged with the crime of robbery and suffering a beating from petitioner's security guards. This justified respondent's absence and initial failure to report back for work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>For respondent, the twin requirements of substantive and procedural due process were not observed by petitioner. He asserts that the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals correctly found that mere allegations of "simply disappearing" and failure to report to the team leader cannot justify the violation of his substantive and procedural due process rights. Respondent asserts that his dismissal from service was clearly illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>With these arguments, the principal issues are:<br><br>First, whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari assailing the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission, which reversed the findings of Labor Arbiter Legaspi;<br><br>Second, whether respondent was justifiably dismissed due to abandonment; and<br><br>Lastly, whether respondent's right to substantive and procedural due process was violated.<br><br>This Petition must be denied.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The National Labor Relations Commission has the power to overturn the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that the findings of fact of Labor Arbiter Legaspi are binding and conclusive. Petitioner raises that, between the determination of facts of the National Labor Relations Commission and the Labor Arbiter, the findings of the latter must prevail.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner's claims, the National Labor Relations Commission is not bound by the findings of the Labor Arbiter. Article 223 of the Labor Code reads:<br><blockquote><b>Article 223. Appeal.</b> Decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. Such appeal may be entertained only on any of the following grounds:<br><blockquote>1. If there is prima facie evidence of abuse of discretion on the part of the Labor Arbiter;<br><br>2. If the decision, order or award was secured through fraud or coercion, including graft and corruption;<br><br>3. If made purely on questions of law; and<br><br>4. If serious errors in the findings of facts are raised which would cause grave or irreparable damage or injury to the appellant.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Article 223 provides that the decision of the Labor Arbiter is final and executory, unless appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission within ten (10) calendar days by any or both of the parties. The Labor Code vests in the National Labor Relations Commission the authority to reverse the decision of the Labor Arbiter, provided that the appellant can prove the existence of one of the grounds in Article 223.<br><br>The errors in the findings of fact that will justify a modification or reversal of the Labor Arbiter's decision must be "serious" and, if left uncorrected, would lead to "grave or irreparable damage or injury to the appellant."<br><br>Serious errors refer to inferences of facts without evidence, or mistakes in the interpretation of the evidence that border on arbitrariness or similar circumstances. Not only must the error be palpable, but there must also be a showing that such error would cause grave and irreparable injury to the appellant. It should affect the disposition of the cause of the appellant. The error must impact on the main issues and not some tangential matter. Evidently, a showing of bias on the part of the Labor Arbiter or a lack of due regard for the procedural rights of the parties are indicia that serious errors may be present.<br><br>In this case, the National Labor Relations Commission decided that there was a serious error in the factual findings of Labor Arbiter Legaspi.<br><br>Labor Arbiter Legaspi found that respondent was charged by the Philippine National Police in Trento, Agusan del Sur for allegedly conspiring and confederating with the members of the New People's Army.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, respondent was detained at the Mangagoy Police Sub-Station in Surigao del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Labor Arbiter Legaspi found that respondent was "unable to perform his duties and responsibilities as security guard due to the criminal charges [that were] filed against him[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> This led to petitioner replacing respondent with another security guard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission found that petitioner's claims that respondent consorted with the New People's Army and committed robbery on July 20, 2000 "were never substantiated at all[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In fact, the Complaint for robbery against respondent was dismissed after preliminary investigation.

There is grave abuse of discretion when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of "passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc. v.

Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision.

Abandonment as a just ground for dismissal requires clear, willful, deliberate, and unjustified refusal of the employee to resume his employment. Mere absence or failure to report for work, even after notice to return, is not tantamount to abandonment.<br><br>Moreover, respondent Javier's acquittal for rape makes it more compelling to view the illegality of his dismissal.

It also covers money claims arising from seafarer contracts.<br><br>The provision, however, does not cover "money claims" consequent to an illegal dismissal such as backwages.

A claim for backwages, according to this court, may be a money claim "by reason of its practical effect." Legally, however, an award of backwages "is merely one of the reliefs which an illegally dismissed employee prays the labor arbiter and the NLRC to render in his favor as a consequence of the unlawful act committed by the employer."

Hence, Capulso's case which was filed after a measly delay of four (4) months should not be treated with skepticism or cynicism. By law and settled jurisprudence, he has four (4) years to file his complaint for illegal dismissal. A delay of merely four (4) months in instituting an illegal dismissal case is more than sufficient compliance with the prescriptive period.

In the instant case, when respondent Javier was freed on May 24, 1996 by virtue of the judgment of acquittal dated May 17, 1996, he immediately proceeded to the petitioner but was not accepted back to work; hence, the reckoning point for the grant of backwages started therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Standard Electric</i>, the period of computation of backwages commenced from the date petitioner refused to allow respondent to return to work, and not from the date the charges against respondent were dismissed.<br><br>In this case, the date of petitioner's refusal to allow respondent's return to work was not established in the findings of fact of the labor tribunals and the Court of Appeals. Petitioner alleged that the filing of the Complaint took place six (6) months after the alleged date that respondent's request to return to work was refused. The date when the incident took place was not specified.<br><br>Applying <i>Standard Electric</i>, respondent is not entitled to backwages from August 15, 2001, the date of the Resolution dismissing the Complaint against respondent. The facts do not categorically state that petitioner refused to allow respondent to resume working on August 15, 2001.<br><br>Absent proof of the actual date that respondent first reported for work and was refused by petitioner, the date of the filing of the Complaint should serve as the basis from which the computation of backwages should begin. Thus, this court finds that respondent is entitled to full backwages starting only on March 14, 2002 until actual reinstatement.<br><br><center><b>IX</b><br></center><br>Respondent's right to procedural due process was not observed.<br><br>The employer must always observe the employee's right to due process. In <i>Agabon</i>:<br><blockquote>Procedurally ... if the dismissal is based on a just cause under Article 282, the employer must give the employee two written notices and a hearing or opportunity to be heard if requested by the employee before terminating the employment: a notice specifying the grounds for which dismissal is sought a hearing or an opportunity to be heard and after hearing or opportunity to be heard, a notice of the decision to dismiss. . . .<br><br>Due process under the Labor Code, like Constitutional due process, has two aspects: substantive, <i>i.e.</i>, the valid and authorized causes of employment termination under the Labor Code; and procedural, <i>i.e.</i>, the manner of dismissal. Procedural due process requirements for dismissal are found in the Implementing Rules of P.D. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines in Book VI, Rule I, Sec. 2, as amended by Department Order Nos. 9 and 10. Breaches of these due process requirements violate the Labor Code. . . .<br><br>Constitutional due process protects the individual from the government and assures him of his rights in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; while statutory due process found in the Labor Code and Implementing Rules protects employees from being unjustly terminated without just cause after notice and hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In this case, petitioner violated respondent's right to procedural due process. The two-notice requirement was not followed. Petitioner sought to excuse itself by claiming that there was no address where the proper notice could have been served. However, petitioner admitted before the Court of Appeals that "respondent's last known address was given to the investigating court by Police Inspector Escartin.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>There was no attempt from petitioner to serve the proper notice on respondent at the address contained in its employment records.
