Garcia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> citing <i>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Vergara), the Court reiterated that the company-designated physician is given an additional 120 days, or a total of 240 days from repatriation, to provide the seafarer further treatment and, thereafter, make a declaration as to the nature of the latter's disability. Thus, it is only upon the lapse of 240 days, or when so declared by the company-designated physician, that a seafarer may be deemed totally and permanently disabled, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on <i>temporary total disability</i> as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the [POEA-SEC] and by applicable Philippine laws. <u><b>If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. The seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at any time such declaration is justified by his medical condition.</b></u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>As we outlined above, <u><b>a temporary total disability only becomes permanent when so declared by the company physician within the periods he is allowed to do so, or upon the expiration of the maximum 240-day medical treatment period without a declaration of either fitness to work or the existence of a permanent disability</b></u>. In the present case, while the initial 120-day treatment or temporary total disability period was exceeded, the company-designated doctor duly made a declaration well within the extended 240-day period that the petitioner was fit to work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>It is undisputed that petitioner was repatriated on March 11, 2012 and immediately subjected to medical treatment. Despite the lapse of the initial 120-day period on July 9, 2012, such treatment continued due to persistent pain complained of by petitioner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> which was observed until his 180th day of treatment on September 7, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In this relation, the CA correctly ruled that the filing of the complaint for permanent total disability benefits on July 20, 2012 was premature, and should have been dismissed for lack of cause of action, considering that at that time: (<i>a</i>) petitioner was still under the medical treatment of the company-designated physicians within the allowable 240-day period; (<i>b</i>) the latter had not yet issued any assessment as to his fitness or disability; and (<i>c</i>) petitioner had not yet secured any assessment from his chosen physician, whom he consulted only more than two (2) months thereafter, or on October 2, 2012.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner failed to comply with the prescribed procedure under the afore-quoted Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC on the joint appointment by the parties of a third doctor, in case the seafarer's personal doctor disagrees with the company-designated physician's fit to work assessment. The IBF CBA similarly outlined the procedure, viz.:<br><br><blockquote>25.2 The disability suffered by the seafarer shall be determined by a doctor appointed by the Company. If a doctor appointed by or on behalf of the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be nominated jointly between the Company and the Union and the decision of this doctor shall be final and binding on both parties.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>25.4. A seafarer whose disability, in accordance with 25.2 above is assessed at 50% or more shall, for the purpose of this paragraph, be regarded as permanently unfit for further sea service in any capacity and be entitled to 100% compensation. Furthermore, any seafarer assessed at less than 50% disability but certified as permanently unfit for further sea service in any capacity by the Company-nominated doctor, shall also be entitled to 100% compensation. Any disagreement as to the assessment or entitlement shall be resolved in accordance with clause 25.2 above.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>In the recent case of <i>Veritas Maritime Corporation v. Gepanaga, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> involving an almost identical provision of the CBA, the Court reiterated the well-settled rule that the seafarer's non-compliance with the mandated conflict-resolution procedure under the POEA-SEC and the CBA militates against his claims, and results in the affirmance of the fit to work certification of the company-designated physician, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The [POEA-SEC] and the CBA clearly provide that when a seafarer sustains a work-related illness or injury while on board the vessel, his fitness or unfitness for work shall be determined by the company-designated physician. If the physician appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the company-designated physician's assessment, the opinion of a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer to be the decision final and binding on them.<br><br>Thus, while petitioner had the right to seek a second and even a third opinion, the final determination of whose decision must prevail must be done in accordance with an agreed procedure. Unfortunately, the petitioner did not avail of this procedure; hence, we have no option but to declare that the company-designated doctor's certification is the final determination that must prevail, x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>In any event, the findings of the company-designated physicians should prevail, considering that they examined, diagnosed, and treated petitioner from his repatriation on March 11, 2012 until he was assessed fit to work after 194 days of treatment on September 21, 2012; whereas the independent physician, Dr. Garcia, examined petitioner only once on October 2, 2012, more than two (2) months after he filed his claim for permanent and total disability benefits before the NLRC on July 20, 2012. Case law holds that, under these circumstances, the assessment of the company-designated physician should be given more credence for having been arrived at after months of medical attendance and diagnosis, compared to the assessment of a private physician done only in one (1) day on the basis of an examination or existing medical records.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[66]</sup></font><br><br>Verily, petitioner's failure to observe the conflict-resolution procedure under the POEA-SEC and the CBA provided a sufficient ground for the denial of his claim for permanent total disability benefits. Considering, however, the undisputed fact that petitioner still needed medical treatment beyond the initial 120-day treatment period, which lasted for 194 days from his repatriation as found by the CA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> he is entitled to the income benefit for temporary total disability<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> provided under Section 2 (a), Rule X of the Rules implementing Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code, during the extended period of treatment or for 194 days, computed from petitioner's repatriation on March 11, 2012 until September 21, 2012 when he last visited the company-designated physician.<br><br>However, the Court finds no basis to hold respondent Dohle Seafront President Padiz, solidarity liable with respondents Dohle Manning and Dohle Seafront for the payment of the monetary awards granted to petitioner, absent any showing that he had acted beyond the scope of his authority or with malice. Settled is the rule that in the absence of malice and bad faith, or a specific provision of law making a corporate officer liable, such officer cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Finally, anent petitioner's claim for attorney's fees,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> while respondents have not been shown to have acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy petitioner's demands, it is settled that where an employee is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his right and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award at the time of actual payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
