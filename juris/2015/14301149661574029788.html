In this case, the registry return card corresponding to the copy of the Court of Appeals’ Resolution sent to Ong’s former counsel indicates that his counsel received the Resolution on April 29, 2003.&nbsp; This date, therefore, must be presumed to be the date of receipt of the Resolution.&nbsp; Since Ong failed to appeal within the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals’ Decision became final and executory and the Court of Appeals correctly issued the Entry of Judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that his former counsel did not receive a copy of the Resolution, the People argues that this negligence bound Ong under the rule that the negligence of counsel binds the client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>With respect to Ong’s prayer for issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, the People contends that he “failed to point out [the] specific instances where the [Court of Appeals and the trial court] had committed grave abuse of discretion[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, Ong is not entitled to the Writ prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On Ong’s prayer to be allowed to post bail, the People argues that the grant of bail is premised on the uncertainty of whether an accused is guilty or innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp;

Moreover, contrary to petitioner’s false claim, his former counsel had notice that the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Reconsideration as early as April 21, 2004 when his counsel received a copy of the trial court’s Order directing the issuance of a warrant of arrest against petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>With petitioner failing to rebut this presumption, it must be presumed that his former counsel received a copy of the Resolution on April 29, 2003 as indicated in the registry return card.&nbsp; The 15-day period to appeal commenced from this date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Since petitioner did not file an Appeal within 15 days from April 29, 2003, the Decision became final and executory on May 15, 2003.<br><br>Consequently, the Court of Appeals did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the Entry of Judgment, which declared petitioner’s conviction final and executory as of May 15, 2003. Under Rule 51, Section 10 of the Rules of Court on “Judgment,” “if no appeal or motion for new trial or reconsideration is filed within the time provided in these Rules, the judgment or final resolution shall forthwith be entered by the clerk in the book of entries of judgments.&nbsp; The date when the judgment or final resolution becomes executory shall be deemed as the date of its entry.”<br><br>As for the trial court, it likewise did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the arrest warrant against petitioner and ordering his commitment to the Cebu City Jail.&nbsp; Since the Court of Appeals had already issued the Entry of Judgment and had remanded to the trial court the original records of the case, it became the trial court’s duty to execute the judgment.<br><br><b><center>II<br>The negligence of petitioner’s former counsel bound him</center></b><br>The general rule is that the negligence of counsel binds the client, even mistakes in the application of procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The exception to the rule is “when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The agency created between a counsel and a client is a highly fiduciary relationship.&nbsp; A counsel becomes the eyes and ears in the prosecution or defense of his or her client’s case.&nbsp; This is inevitable because a competent counsel is expected to understand the law that frames the strategies he or she employs in a chosen legal remedy.&nbsp; Counsel carefully lays down the procedure that will effectively and efficiently achieve his or her client’s interests.&nbsp; Counsel should also have a grasp of the facts, and among the plethora of details, he or she chooses which are relevant for the legal cause of action or defense being pursued.<br><br>It is these indispensable skills, among others, that a client engages.&nbsp; Of course, there are counsels who have both wisdom and experience that give their clients great advantage.&nbsp; There are still, however, counsels who wander in their mediocrity whether consciously or unconsciously.<br><br>The state does not guarantee to the client that they will receive the kind of service that they expect.&nbsp; Through this court, we set the standard on competence and integrity through the application requirements and our disciplinary powers.&nbsp; Whether counsel discharges his or her role to the satisfaction of the client is a matter that will ideally be necessarily monitored but, at present, is too impractical.<br><br>Besides, finding good counsel is also the responsibility of the client especially when he or she can afford to do so.&nbsp; Upholding client autonomy in these choices is infinitely a better policy choice than assuming that the state is omniscient.&nbsp; Some degree of error must, therefore, be borne by the client who does have the capacity to make choices.<br><br>This is one of the bases of the doctrine that the error of counsel visits the client.&nbsp; This court will cease to perform its social functions if it provides succor to all who are not satisfied with the services of their counsel.<br><br>But, there is an exception to this doctrine of binding agency between counsel and client.&nbsp; This is when the negligence of counsel is so gross, almost bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence, that we can safely conclude that the due process rights of the client were violated.&nbsp; Even so, there must be a clear and convincing showing that the client was so maliciously deprived of information that he or she could not have acted to protect his or her interests.&nbsp; The error of counsel must have been both palpable yet maliciously exercised that it should viably be the basis for disciplinary action.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Bejarasco, Jr. v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this court reiterated:<br><br><blockquote>For the exception to apply . . . the gross negligence should not be accompanied by the client’s own negligence or malice, considering that the client has the duty to be vigilant in respect of his interests by keeping himself up-to-date on the status of the case.&nbsp; Failing in this duty, the client should suffer whatever adverse judgment is rendered against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In <i>Bejarasco, Jr.</i>, Peter Bejarasco, Jr., failed to file a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals within the extended period prayed for.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals then dismissed the Appeal and issued an Entry of Judgment.&nbsp; His conviction for grave threats and grave oral defamation became final, and a warrant for his arrest was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In his Petition for Review on Certiorari before this court, Peter Bejarasco, Jr. argued that his counsel’s negligence in failing to file the Appeal deprived him of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>This court rejected Peter Bejarasco, Jr.’s argument, ruling that “[i]t is the client’s duty to be in contact with his lawyer from time to time in order to be informed of the progress and developments of his case[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; “[T]o merely rely on the bare reassurances of his lawyer that everything is being taken care of is not enough.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>This court noted the 16 months from the issuance of the Entry of Judgment and the 22 months from the issuance of the trial court’s Decision before Peter Bejarasco, Jr. appealed his conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; According to this court, “[h]e ought to have been sooner alerted about his dire situation by the fact that an unreasonably long time had lapsed since the [trial court] handed down the dismissal of his appeal without [his counsel] having updated him on the developments[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioner took almost seven (7) years, or almost 84 months, from the Court of Appeals’ issuance of the Resolution denying his Motion for Reconsideration to file a Petition before this court.&nbsp; As this court ruled in <i>Bejarasco, Jr.</i>, petitioner ought to have been sooner alerted of the “unreasonably long time”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court of Appeals was taking in resolving his appeal.&nbsp; Worse, he was arrested in Pasay City, not in Cebu where he resides.&nbsp; His failure to know or to find out the real status of his appeal “rendered [petitioner] undeserving of any sympathy from the Court vis-a-vis the negligence of his former counsel.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>We fail to see how petitioner could not have known of the issuance of the Resolution.&nbsp; We cannot accept a standard of negligence on the part of a client to fail to follow through or address counsel to get updates on his case.&nbsp; Either this or the alternative that counsel’s alleged actions are merely subterfuge to avail a penalty well deserved.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Certiorari is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Del Castillo, Mendoza,</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated acting member per S.O.
