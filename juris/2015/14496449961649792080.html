				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The subject of this review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. HC No. 01135 dated 16 July 2012, which affirmed the Judgment<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 57, in Criminal Case No. CBU 74672, finding accused-appellant Juliet Pancho guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br>The Information filed on 22 September 2005 alleged:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 14[th] day of September, 2005, at about 2:40 [p.m.], more or less, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with deliberate intent, did then and there have in [her] possession and under [her] control three (3) heat[-]sealed transparent plastic bags each of white crystalline substance weighing 14.49 grams locally known as <i>shabu</i>, containing [m]ethamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, without authority of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On arraignment, accused-appellant entered a non-guilty plea. Trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution witnesses narrated that on the basis of a search warrant, members of the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau of Cebu City conducted a search in the house of accused-appellant and her husband Samuel Pancho located in Sitio Plastikan, Barangay Duljo-Fatima, Cebu City. Police Superintendent Pablo Labra served the search warrant on accused-appellant. Police Officer 1 Roy Carlo Veloso (PO1 Veloso) was designated as the searcher, while PO2 Benigno Andrew Ilagan (PO2 Ilagan) was assigned as the recorder of the raiding team. The raiding team was accompanied by three <i>barangay tanods.</i> The search yielded three big plastic packets of suspected <i>shabu</i> weighing a total of 14.49 grams, which were recovered under a jewelry box placed on top of a cabinet divider. PO1 Veloso handed the packets of <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Ilagan who recorded them in the confiscation receipt and made markings on the plastic packets.<br><br>The raiding team brought accused-appellant to the police station. PO1 Veloso accompanied PO2 Ilagan in handing over the seized articles and the letter-request to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory. The PNP Crime Laboratory later issued Chemistry Report No. D-1381-2005, confirming that the three heat-sealed transparent plastic bags, weighing a total of 14.49 grams, were tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride. The Chemistry Report states:<br><br><blockquote><b>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED</b><br><br>A- Three (3) heat-sealed transparent plastic bags each white crystalline substance having a total net weight of 14.49 grams each with marking "SW-SP &amp; JP-01 to 03" and further marked as A-l thru A-3. x x x<br><br><b>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION</b><br><br>To determine the presence of dangerous drugs.<br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimen gave POSITIVE result to the test for the presence of Methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, x x x<br><br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br><br>Specimens A-l thru A-3 contain Methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> x x x</blockquote><br>Accused-appellant denied the charge against her and alleged that she was sewing a blanket in her bedroom on the second floor when two police officers barged into her room and ordered her to go down. When she went down, two other police officers came and one of them went up to the bedroom. After a few seconds, the said police officer went back down and called the <i>barangay tanods</i>. When the <i>barangay tanods</i> arrived, accused-appellant was handcuffed and brought to the police station. Accused-appellant later learned that she was being charged with illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>On 5 October 2009, the RTC rendered judgment finding accused-appellant guilty of illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> and sentencing her to life imprisonment and to pay a P1,000,000.00 fine.<br><br>Accused-appellant seasonably filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> before the Court of Appeals. On 16 July 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the RTC, with modification in the fine imposed which was reduced to P500,000.00.<br><br>Accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On 8 July 2013, we issued a Resolution requiring the parties to file their supplemental briefs, if they so desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Both parties manifested that they would adopt the same arguments in their separate briefs filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant asserts that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were plagued with inconsistencies with respect to where the search of the house started and where the markings were made. Accused-appellant insists that the <i>barangay tanods</i> should have been made to testify to corroborate the testimonies of the police officers relative to the search. Accused-appellant avers that the requisites under Section 21, paragraph 1, Article 21 of R.A. No. 9165 were not complied with. Moreover, accused-appellant contends that the packs of <i>shabu </i>allegedly recovered from her house should first be submitted to the court which issued the search warrant in accordance with Section 12, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) dismisses the inconsistencies as trivial, and maintains that the elements of the crime of illegal possession of a prohibited drug were proven by the prosecution. The OSG agrees that the prosecution was able to establish the chain of custody of the<i> corpus delicti</i>; and despite the non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, the prosecution has shown that the integrity and evidentiary. value of the seized items had been duly preserved.<br><br>Whether accused-appellant's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt is the crux of this controversy.<br><br>In <i>Valleno v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court ruled that -<br><br><blockquote>In order for prosecution for illegal possession of a dangerous drug to prosper, there must be proof that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>The prosecution has duly established all these elements. By virtue of a search warrant, POl Veloso found three packets of suspected <i>shabu</i> in one of the rooms of accused-appellant's house, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Pros.

Mere possession of a regulated drug <i>per se</i> constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi </i>sufficient to convict an accused absent a satisfactory explanation of such possession - the <i>onus probandi</i> is shifted to the accused, to explain the absence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Accused-appellant's bare denials will not suffice to overcome the&nbsp; presumption of knowledge.<br><br>Accused-appellant emphasizes the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the two police officers. PO1 Veloso stated that the living room on the first floor of accused-appellant's house was searched first, while PO2 Ilagan narrated that the search started on the second floor of the house. Moreover, accused-appellant claimed that PO1 Veloso initially related that markings were done in the police station, only to backtrack and declare that markings were done in accused-appellant's house. The inconsistency on the order of the search is a trivial matter and does not detract from the fact that all elements for the crime were duly established. In relation to the marking of the seized <i>shabu</i>, PO1 Veloso repeatedly declared that the marking was done in accused-appellant's house, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">At the office, the three packs of shabu were marked subsequently, is that correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">So the three packs claimed to be shabu were not marked at the place or at the room where it was confiscated but in the office?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">After the search was done, it was already marked in the house of the accused.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Did you not say earlier that the packs were marked was in the office because after the confiscation you brought the accused to the office?

No. 9165 provide:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. x x x.<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]<br></blockquote><br>Accused-appellant cites as an irregularity the failure of the prosecution to present photographs of the seized items and that there were no representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ) during the conduct of the inventory of the seized items.<br><br>The Implementing Rules and Regulations of Section 21 (a) of R.A. No. 9165 offer some flexibility when a proviso added that "non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Salvador</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Court ruled that the failure to submit in evidence the required physical inventory of the seized drugs and the photograph, as well as the absence of a member of the media or the DOJ, pursuant to Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, is not fatal and will not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible.<br><br>"What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and [the] evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the chain of custody of the seized illegal drugs was not broken. The prosecution established that PO1 Veloso seized three packets of <i>shabu</i> from the bedroom of accused-appellant. He handed them over to PO2 Ilagan, who made markings on the items and prepared a confiscation receipt of the same while in appellant's house. PO2 Ilagan brought the confiscated <i>shabu</i> to the police station where he prepared a letter-request addressed to the PNP Crime Laboratory. It was PO2 Ilagan, accompanied by PO1 Veloso, who went to the PNP Crime Laboratory to bring the specimen and the letter-request. PO2 Roma received the <i>shabu </i>and forwarded the same to the forensic chemist. The chain of custody was testified to by the police authorities. Clearly, the recovery and the handling of the seized illegal drugs were satisfactorily established in this case.<br><br>The failure of the members of the raiding team to deliver the seized items to the judge who issued the warrant becomes immaterial because records show that the chain of custody is intact.<br><br>Accused-appellant was caught in possession of 14.49 grams of <i>shabu</i> or methamphetamine hydrochloride. The illegal possession of dangerous drugs is punishable under Section 11, paragraph 2(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Life imprisonment and a fine ranging from Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00) to Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00), if the quantity of methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu" is ten (10) grams or more but less than fifty (50) grams[.]</blockquote><br>We affirm the penalty imposed by the Court of Appeals. It was specified in the Information that the <i>shabu</i> found in the possession of the accused-appellant weighted 14.49 grams. This weight is as certified to in the Chemistry Report. Such weight is within the range stated for by law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 16 July 2012 of the Court of Appeals CA-G.R. CR.
