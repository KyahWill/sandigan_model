G.R. Nos. 193383-84</u></b><br><br>The Philippine Constitution provides for adherence to the general principles of international law as part of the law of the land. The time-honored international principle of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i> demands the performance in good faith of treaty obligations on the part of the states that enter into the agreement. In this jurisdiction, treaties have the force and effect of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The issue of whether the failure to strictly comply with RMO No. 1-2000 will deprive persons or corporations of the benefit of a tax treaty was squarely addressed in the recent case of <i>Deutsche Bank AG Manila Branch v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Deutsche Bank), where the Court emphasized that <b>the obligation to comply with a tax treaty must take precedence over the objective of RMO No. 1-2000</b>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>We recognize the clear intention of the BIR in implementing RMO No. 1-2000, but the CTA’s outright denial of a tax treaty relief for failure to strictly comply with the prescribed period is not in harmony with the objectives of the contracting state to ensure that the benefits granted under tax treaties are enjoyed by duly entitled persons or corporations.<br><br>Bearing in mind the rationale of tax treaties, the period of application for the availment of tax treaty relief as required by RMO No. 1-2000 <b>should not operate to divest entitlement to the relief</b> as it would constitute a <b>violation of the duty</b> required by good faith in complying with a tax treaty. The denial of the availment of tax relief for the failure of a taxpayer to apply within the prescribed period under the administrative issuance would <b>impair the value</b> of the tax treaty. At most, the application for a tax treaty relief from the BIR should <b><u>merely operate to confirm</u></b> the entitlement of the taxpayer to the relief.<br><br><b><u>The obligation to comply with a tax treaty must take precedence over the objective of RMO No. 1-2000.</u></b> Logically, noncompliance with tax treaties has negative implications on international relations, and unduly discourages foreign investors. While the consequences sought to be prevented by RMO No. 1-2000 involve an administrative procedure, these may be remedied through other system management processes, <i>e.g.</i>, the imposition of a fine or penalty. <b>But we cannot totally deprive those who are entitled to the benefit of a treaty for failure to strictly comply with an administrative issuance requiring prior application for tax treaty relief.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The objective of RMO No. 1-2000 in requiring the application for treaty relief with the ITAD before a party’s availment of the preferential rate under a tax treaty is to avert the consequences of any erroneous interpretation and/or application of treaty provisions, such as claims for refund/credit for overpayment of taxes, or deficiency tax liabilities for underpayment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> However, as pointed out in <i>Deutsche Bank, </i>the underlying principle of prior application with the BIR becomes <b>moot in refund cases</b> – as in the present case – <u>where the very basis of the claim is <b>erroneous or there is excessive payment</b> arising from the non-availment of a tax treaty relief at the first instance</u>. Just as Deutsche Bank was not faulted by the Court for not complying with RMO No. 1-2000 prior to the transaction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> so should CBK Power. In parallel, CBK Power could not have applied for a tax treaty relief 15 days prior to its payment of the final withholding tax on the interest paid to its lenders<b> precisely because it erroneously paid said tax</b> on the basis of the regular rate as prescribed by the NIRC, and not on the preferential tax rate provided under the different treaties. As stressed by the Court, the prior application requirement under RMO No. 1-2000 then becomes <b>illogical.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Not only is the requirement illogical, but it is also an imposition that is <b>not found at all in the applicable tax treaties.</b> In<i> Deutsche Bank</i>, the Court categorically held that the BIR should not impose additional requirements that would negate the availment of the reliefs provided for under international agreements, especially since said tax treaties do not provide for any prerequisite at all for the availment of the benefits under said agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It bears reiterating that the application for a tax treaty relief from the BIR should <b>merely operate to confirm</b> the entitlement of the taxpayer to the relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Since CBK Power had requested for confirmation from the ITAD on June 8, 2001 and October 28, 2002<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> before it filed on April 14, 2003 its administrative claim for refund of its excess final withholding taxes, the same should be <b>deemed substantial compliance</b> with RMO No. 1-2000, as in <i>Deutsche Bank.</i> To rule otherwise would defeat the purpose of Section 229 of the NIRC in providing the taxpayer a remedy for erroneously paid tax solely on the ground of failure to make prior application for tax treaty relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As the Court exhorted in <i>Republic v. GST Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> while the taxpayer has an obligation to honestly pay the right taxes, the government has a corollary duty to implement tax laws in good faith; to discharge its duty to collect what is due to it; and to <b>justly return what has been erroneously and excessively given to it</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court holds that the CTA En Banc committed reversible error in affirming the reduction of the amount of refund to CBK Power from P15,672,958.42 to P14,835,720.39 to exclude its transactions with Fortis-Netherlands for which no ITAD ruling was obtained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> CBK Power’s petition in G.R. Nos. 193383-84 is therefore <b>granted.</b><br><br>The opposite conclusion is, however, reached with respect to the Commissioner’s petition in G.R. Nos. 193407-08.<br><br><b><u>B. G.R.

Section 204 applies to administrative claims for refund, while Section 229 to judicial claims for refund. In both instances, the taxpayer’s claim must be filed within two (2) years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty. However, Section 229 of the NIRC further states the condition that a judicial claim for refund may not be maintained until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner. These provisions respectively read:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 204. <b><i>Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes.</i></b> – The Commissioner may -<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(C) Credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and, in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty: Provided, however, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 229.

Had CBK Power awaited the action of the Commissioner on its claim for refund prior to taking court action knowing fully well that the prescriptive period was about to end, it would have lost not only its right to seek judicial recourse but its right to recover the final withholding taxes it erroneously paid to the government thereby suffering irreparable damage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Also, while it may be argued that, for the remittance filed on June 10, 2003 that was to prescribe on June 10, 2005, CBK Power could have waited for, at the most, three (3) months from the filing of the administrative claim on March 4, 2005 until the last day of the two-year prescriptive period ending June 10, 2005, that is, if only to give the BIR at the administrative level an opportunity to act on said claim, the Court cannot, on that basis alone, deny a legitimate claim that was, for all intents and purposes, timely filed in accordance with Section 229 of the NIRC. There was no violation of Section 229 since the law, as worded, only requires that an administrative claim be priorly filed.<br><br>In the foregoing instances, attention must be drawn to the Court’s ruling in <i>P.J.

David</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Kiener), wherein it was held that in no wise does the law, <i>i.e.,</i> Section 306 of the old Tax Code (now, Section 229 of the NIRC), imply that the Collector of Internal Revenue first act upon the taxpayer’s claim, and that the taxpayer shall not go to court before he is notified of the Collector’s action. In Kiener, the Court went on to say that the claim with the Collector of Internal Revenue was intended primarily as a notice of warning that unless the tax or penalty alleged to have been collected erroneously or illegally is refunded, court action will follow, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The controversy centers on the construction of the aforementioned section of the Tax Code which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 306. Recovery of tax erroneously or illegally collected. — No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue; but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress. In any case, no such suit or proceeding shall be begun after the expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty.</blockquote>The preceding provisions seem at first blush conflicting. It will be noticed that, whereas the first sentence requires a claim to be filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue before any suit is commenced, the last makes imperative the bringing of such suit within two years from the date of collection. But the conflict is only apparent and the two provisions easily yield to reconciliation, which it is the office of statutory construction to effectuate, where possible, to give effect to the entire enactment.<br><br>To this end, and bearing in mind that the Legislature is presumed to have understood the language it used and to have acted with full idea of what it wanted to accomplish, it is fair and reasonable to say without doing violence to the context or either of the two provisions, that by the first is meant simply that the Collector of Internal Revenue shall be given an opportunity to consider his mistake, if mistake has been committed, before he is sued, but not, as the appellant contends that pending consideration of the claim, the period of two years provided in the last clause shall be deemed interrupted. <b>Nowhere and in no wise does the law imply that the Collector of Internal Revenue must act upon the claim, or that the taxpayer shall not go to court before he is notified of the Collector’s action.</b> x x x. <b>We understand the filing of the claim with the Collector of Internal Revenue to be intended primarily as a notice of warning that unless the tax or penalty alleged to have been collected erroneously or illegally is refunded, court action will follow</b>. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>That being said, the foregoing refund claims of CBK Power should all be granted, and, the petition of the Commissioner in G.R.

In other words, a resident or non-resident foreign corporation shall be taxed according to the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, unless it is shown that the treaty provisions apply to the said corporation, and that, in cases the same are applicable, the option to avail of the tax benefits under the tax treaty has been successfully invoked.<br><br>Under Revenue Memorandum Order 01-2000 of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, it is provided that the availment of a tax treaty provision must be preceded by an application for a tax treaty relief with its International Tax Affairs Division (ITAD).

The Order covers exclusively applications for tax treaty relief, including claims or requests for tax exemption, preferential tax treaty rate and refund or credit of taxes on income derived or to be derived by the taxpayer under existing tax treaties. The processing for tax treaty relief shall be transferred from Law Division to the International Tax Affairs Division (ITAD). Any availment of the tax treaty relief shall be preceded by an application by filing BIR Form No. 0901 (Application for Relief from Double Taxation) with ITAD at least 15 days before the transaction (<i>i.e</i>. payment of dividends, royalties, etc.), accompanied by supporting documents justifying the relief. Consequently, BIR Form Nos. TC 001 and TC 002 prescribed under RMO No. 10-92 are declared obsolete. Claims for tax credit/refund pertinent to the tax treaty relief requested shall be filed with ITAD within the two year period prescribed by Section 229 of the NIRC, as amended under RA 8424. The Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) for this purpose shall be issued for the account of the “non-resident taxpayer/recipient of the income”. Issuance of the TCC shall be done by the Appellate Division upon receipt of endorsement memo from ITAD recommending the issuance of such. The release of the signed TCC to the taxpayer/applicant, however, shall be done by ITAD.
