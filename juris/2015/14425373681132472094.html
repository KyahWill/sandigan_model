Unlike other business associations such as partnerships, the corporate framework encourages investment by allowing even small capital contributors to be part of a big business endeavor made possible by the aggregation of their capital funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The consequent limited liability feature, since corporate assets will answer for corporate debts, also proves attractive for investors. However, this legal structure should not be abused.<br><br>A separate corporate personality shields corporate officers acting in good faith and within their scope of authority from personal liability except for situations enumerated by law and jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>Personal liability of a corporate director, trustee or officer along (although not necessarily) with the corporation may so validly attach, as a rule, only when —<br><blockquote>'1.

It was also shown that for the prior years of 1998 and 1999, defendant Morning Star incurred a deficit of Php3,910,763.00 as of December 31, 1998 and Php2,841,626.00 as of December 31, 1999 and in the Balance Sheet, it indicated therein the defendants' total assets of Php150,579,421.00 while the total liabilities amounted to Php160,222,966.00, thereby making the defendant Morning Star insolvent. <b><i>Despite the fact that defendant Morning Star was already incurring losses as early as 1998 up to the year 2000, the latter still contracted loans and/or obligations with IATA sometime in 2002 and which indebtedness ballooned to the huge amount of Phpl09,728,051.00 and US$496,403.21 as of April 30, 2003, which obviously it could not pay considering its financial standing.</i></b><br><br>Further investigation by the plaintiff shows that it could not find any assets or properties in the name of defendant Morning Star because even the land and the building where it held office was registered in the name of "Morning Star Management Ventures Corporation", as evidenced by the certified true copies of the transfer certificates of title (TCT) nos. 192243 and 192244 in the name of Morning Star Management Ventures Corporation and unlike the defendant Morning Star, which has practically the same officers and members of the Board, has only an asset of Php125,392,960.00 and liabilities of Php4,306,702[.]00 and an income deficit of Php26,922,598.00 as of December 31, 2001. Similarly, the Pic [']N Pac Mart, Inc., which has the same set of officers, said corporation has shown a total assets of Php5,423,201.30 and liabilities/stockholders equity of Php5,423,201.30 but with a retained earnings of Php194,412[.]74 as of December 31, 1999. <b><i>Plaintiff contends that in such a case, defendant Morning Star has used the separate and distinct corporate personality accorded to it under the Corporation Code to commit said fraudulent transaction of incurring corporate debts and allow the herein individual defendants to escape personal liability and placing the assets beyond the reach of the creditors.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals ruled that the general rule on separate corporate personality and against personal liability by corporate officers applies since petitioner failed to prove bad faith amounting to fraud by the corporate officers:<br><blockquote>The mere fact that Morning Star has been incurring huge losses and that it has no assets at the time it contracted large financial obligations to IATA, cannot be considered that its officers, Defendants-Appellants Estelita Co Wong, Benny H. Wong, Arsenio Chua, Sonny Chua and Wong Yan Tak, acted in bad faith or such circumstance would amount to fraud, warranting personal and solidary liability of its corporate officers. The same is also true with the fact that Morning Star Management Ventures Corporation and Pic 'N Pac Mart, Inc., corporations having the same set of officers as Morning Star, were doing relatively well during the time that the former incurred huge losses. Thus, only Morning Star should be held personally liable to Plaintiff-Appellee, and not its corporate officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>Piercing the corporate veil in order to hold corporate officers personally liable for the corporation's debts requires that "the bad faith or wrongdoing of the director <i>must be established clearly and convincingly</i> [as] [b]ad faith is never presumed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br><i>Oria v.

The fact that the consideration of the conveyance is fictitious or is inadequate.<br><br>2. A transfer made by a debtor after suit has been begun and while it is pending against him.<br><br>3. A sale upon credit by an insolvent debtor.<br><br><b><i>4. Evidence of large indebtedness or complete insolvency.<br><br>5. The transfer of all or nearly all of his property by a debtor, especially when he is insolvent or greatly embarrassed financially.<br><br>6. The fact that the transfer is made between father and son, when there are present other of the above circumstances.</i></b><br><br>7. The failure of the vendee to take exclusive possession of all the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner listed the following circumstances as constituting badges of fraud by the individual respondents:<br><blockquote>Attention is drawn to the following badges of fraud by individual respondents to use the corporate fiction of respondent Morning Star as a veil or cloak to insulate themselves from any liability to pay its indebtedness to [sic], to wit:<br><blockquote>a. As members of the Board of Directors and at the same time, officers of respondent Morning Star, individual respondents Estelita Co Wong (President and Member of the Board), Benny H. Wong (Chairman of the Board), Arsenio Chua (Member of the Board), Sonny Chua (Secretary and Member of the Board) and Wong Yan Tak (Treasurer and Member of the Board) undoubtedly exercised complete control and direction of the financial management and business operations of respondent Morning Star;<br><br>b. Similarly, the individual respondents are likewise in direct control of the management of two other corporations, Morning Star Management Ventures Corp. and Pic 'N Pac Mart[,] Inc., being the shareholders, members of the Board and officers of the said corporations, as evidenced by the General Information Sheets (GIS) of the said corporations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Exhibits "O" to "0-4" and "P" to "P-3" of petitioner's Formal Offer of Evidence dated August 15, 2007);<br><br>c. Respondent Morning Star has no assets or property in its name that may be levied upon for attachment and execution to secure and to satisfy any judgment debt, as in fact the land and building where its offices can be found and situated at J.

Pedro Gil Street, Ermita Manila is not even registered in its name but in the name of another corporation "Morning Star Management Ventures Corporation" which is similarly owned and controlled by the individual respondents (Exhibits "S" to "S-2" and "T" to "T-2" of petitioner's Formal Offer of Evidence dated August 15, 2007);<br><br>d. As early as 1998, respondent Morning Star had already been incurring huge losses which clearly show the inability to pay its obligations to IATA but the individual respondents contracted its huge financial obligations from IATA knowing fully well that respondent Morning Star will be unable to pay such obligations;<br><br>e. Strangely, on the other hand, Pic 'N Pac Mart, Inc. and Morning Star Management Ventures Corp., the other two (2) corporations similarly controlled and managed by the individual respondents, were doing relatively well during the time that respondent Morning Star was incurring huge losses (Exhibits "U" to "U-7" and "V" to "V-9" of petitioner's Formal Offer of Evidence dated August 15, 2007);<br><br>f. Individual respondents allowed the indebtedness of respondent Morning Star to balloon to a staggering amount of Php100,479,171.59 and US$457,834.14[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>This court finds that petitioner was not able to clearly and convincingly establish bad faith by the individual respondents, nor substantiate the alleged badges of fraud.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>First, petitioner failed to substantiate the fourth badge of fraud on "[e]vidence of large indebtedness or complete insolvency."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In 1993, International Air Transport Association appointed respondent Morning Star as an accredited travel agent with the privilege of getting air tickets on credit, and they entered a Passenger Sales Agency Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> None of the parties made allegations on the financial status or business standing of respondent Morning Star during the first five years from its accreditation in 1993.<br><br>Petitioner relies on Atty.

These two financial statements do not show that respondent Morning Star was operating at a loss in 2002. Deficits in the years 1998 to 2000 do not necessarily mean deficits in 2002.
