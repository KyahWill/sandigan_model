The RTC also noted that petitioner’s President attended every hearing of the case but did not interpose any objection to the said motion when its conditions were being discussed and formulated by the parties and Atty. Gonzales.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that express and written waiver from the depositor concerned is required by law before any third person or entity is allowed to examine bank deposits or bank records. According to petitioner, it is not a party to the compromise agreement between BPI and TIDCORP and its silence or acquiescence is not tantamount to an admission that binds it to the compromise agreement of the creditors especially the waiver of confidentiality of bank deposits.&nbsp; Petitioner cites the rule on relativity of contracts which states that contracts can only bind the parties who entered into it, and it cannot favor or prejudice a third person, even if he is aware of such contract and has knowledge thereof. Petitioner also maintains that waivers are not presumed, but must be clearly and convincingly shown, either by express stipulation or acts admitting no other reasonable explanation.<br><br>Respondent BPI counters that petitioner is estopped from questioning the BPI-TIDCORP compromise agreement because petitioner and its counsel participated in all the proceedings involving the subject compromise agreement and did not object when the compromise agreement was considered by the RTC.<br><br>Respondent TIDCORP contends that the waiver of confidentiality under Republic Act (R.A.) Nos. 1405 and 8791 does not require the express or written consent of the depositor.&nbsp; It is TIDCORP’s position that upon declaration of insolvency, the insolvency court obtains complete jurisdiction over the insolvent’s property which includes the authority to issue orders to look into the insolvent’s bank deposits.&nbsp; Since bank deposits are considered debts owed by the banks to the petitioner, the receiver is empowered to recover them even without petitioner’s express or written consent, said TIDCORP.<br><br>TIDCORP further avers that the BPI-TIDCORP compromise agreement approved by the RTC is binding on petitioner and its Board of Directors by reason of estoppel.&nbsp; The compromise agreement is not an ordinary contract. Since it was approved by the insolvency court, the compromise agreement has the force and effect of judgment; it is immediately executory and not appealable, except for vices of consent or forgery, TIDCORP concluded.<br><br>The main issue for our consideration is whether the petitioner is bound by the provision in the BPI-TIDCORP Joint Motion to Approve Agreement that petitioner shall waive its rights to confidentiality of its bank deposits under R.A. No. 1405, as amended, otherwise known as the Law on <u>Secrecy of Bank Deposits</u> and R.A. No. 8791, otherwise known as <u>The General Banking Law of 2000</u>.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>A judgment rendered on the basis of a compromise agreement between the parties in a civil case is final, unappealable, and immediately executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>However, if one of the parties claims that his consent was obtained through fraud, mistake, or duress, he must file a motion with the trial court that approved the compromise agreement to reconsider the judgment and nullify or set aside said contract on any of the said grounds for annulment of contract within 15 days from notice of judgment.&nbsp; Under Rule 37, said party can either file a motion for new trial or reconsideration.&nbsp; A party can file a motion for new trial based on fraud, accident or mistake, excusable negligence, or newly discovered evidence.&nbsp; On the other hand, a party may decide to seek the recall or <i>modification</i> of the judgment by means of a motion for reconsideration on the ground that “the decision or final order is contrary to law” if the consent was procured through fraud, mistake, or duress.&nbsp; Thus, the motion for a new trial or motion for reconsideration is the readily available remedy for a party to challenge a judgment if the 15-day period from receipt of judgment for taking an appeal has not yet expired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner sought partial reconsideration of the decision based on compromise agreement assailing the waiver of confidentiality provision in the Agreement between its two creditors, TIDCORP and BPI, in which petitioner was not a party.&nbsp; After the trial court denied the motion on the ground of estoppel, petitioner sought a direct recourse to this Court.<br><br>We stress that a direct recourse to this Court from the decisions, final resolutions and orders of the RTC may be taken where only questions of law are raised or involved.&nbsp; There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, which does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is a question of fact when the doubt or controversy arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.&nbsp; Simply put, when there is no dispute as to fact, the question of whether the conclusion drawn therefrom is correct or not, is a question of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner submits the lone question of law on whether the waiver of confidentiality provision in the Agreement between TIDCORP and BPI is valid despite petitioner not being a party and signatory to the same.&nbsp; According to petitioner, R.A. No. 1405 requires the express and written consent of the depositor to make the waiver effective.<br><br>Section 2 of R.A. No. 1405, the <u>Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits</u> enacted in 1955, was first amended by Presidential Decree No. 1792 in 1981 and further amended by R.A. No. 7653 in 1993.&nbsp; It now reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. All deposits of whatever nature with banks or banking institutions in the Philippines including investments in bonds issued by the Government of the Philippines, its political subdivisions and its instrumentalities, are hereby considered as of an absolutely confidential nature and may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office, except when the examination is made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank and is specifically authorized by the Monetary Board after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that a bank fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that it is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity, or when the examination is made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit provided that the examination is for audit purposes only and the results thereof shall be for the exclusive use of the bank, or upon written permission of the depositor, or in cases of impeachment, or upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or in cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation.</blockquote><br>R.A. No. 1405 provides for exceptions when records of deposits may be disclosed.&nbsp; These are under any of the following instances: (a) upon written permission of the depositor, (b) in cases of impeachment, (c) upon order of a competent court in the case of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials or, (d) when the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation, and (e) in cases of violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Anti-Money Laundering Council may inquire into a bank account upon order of any competent court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Joint Motion to Approve Agreement was executed by BPI and TIDCORP only.&nbsp; There was no written consent given by petitioner or its representative, Epifanio Ramos, Jr., that petitioner is waiving the confidentiality of its bank deposits. The provision on the waiver of the confidentiality of petitioner’s bank deposits was merely inserted in the agreement.&nbsp; It is clear therefore that petitioner is not bound by the said provision since it was without the express consent of petitioner who was not a party and signatory to the said agreement.<br><br>Neither can petitioner be deemed to have given its permission by failure to interpose its objection during the proceedings.&nbsp; It is an elementary rule that the existence of a waiver must be positively demonstrated since a waiver by implication is not normally countenanced.&nbsp; The norm is that a waiver must not only be voluntary, but must have been made knowingly, intelligently, and with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.&nbsp; There must be persuasive evidence to show an actual intention to relinquish the right.&nbsp; Mere silence on the part of the holder of the right should not be construed as a surrender thereof; the courts must indulge every reasonable presumption against the existence and validity of such waiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In addition, considering that petitioner was already declared insolvent by the RTC, all its property, assets and belongings were ordered delivered to the appointed receiver or assignee. Thus, in the order of the RTC appointing Atty. Gonzales as receiver, petitioner was directed to assign and convey to Atty. Gonzales all its real and personal property, monies, estate and effects with all the deeds, books and papers relating thereto,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> pursuant to Section 32<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the <u>Insolvency Law</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Such assignment shall operate to vest in the assignee all of the estate of the insolvent debtor not exempt by law from execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Corollarily, the stipulation in the Joint Motion to Approve Compromise Agreement that petitioner waives its right to confidentiality of its bank deposits requires the approval and conformity of Atty. Gonzales as receiver since all the property, money, estate and effects of petitioner have been assigned and conveyed to her<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and she has the right to recover all the estate, assets, debts and claims belonging to or due to the insolvent debtor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>While it was Atty. Gonzales who filed the Motion for Parties to Enter Into Compromise Agreement, she did not sign or approve the Joint Motion to Approve Agreement submitted by TIDCORP and BPI.&nbsp; In her Manifestation and Comment (on <i>Dacion En Pago</i> by Compromise Agreement with TRC and Joint Motion to Approve Agreement of BPI and TIDCORP) there is no showing that Atty. Gonzales signified her conformity to the waiver of confidentiality of petitioner’s bank deposits. Atty. Gonzales stated thus:<br><br><blockquote>13.&nbsp; COMPROMISE AGREEMENT OF TIDCORP AND BPI<br><br>The undersigned receiver is in conformity with the compromise agreement of TIDCORP and BPI, attached hereto as <b>Annex C</b>, which they submitted to this Honorable Court under the abovementioned Joint Motion <b>in so far as the sharing scheme of the sewing machine inventories of Dona Adela is concerned</b>. However, the undersigned receiver has the following comments on the other provisions of the said compromise agreement:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">13.2. </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The undersigned receiver reiterates that Dona Adela has no cash or other assets to source payment for expenses and taxes provided under no. 4 of the Joint Motion to Approve Agreement.

EPIFANIO RAMOS, she has been shouldering all the administrative expenses of this insolvency proceedings.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>21. As also mentioned under 13.2. above, Dona Adela has no cash to source payment for the abovementioned administrative expenses and receiver’s fees, and its assets, which should have been the source for payment for administrative expenses and receiver’s fees before the distribution to the creditors, have already been assigned to the creditors by compromise agreement.<br><br>22.
