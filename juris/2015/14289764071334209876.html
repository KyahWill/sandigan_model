				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the December 3, 2009 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00738 that affirmed in <i>toto</i> the May 30, 2007 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 58, in Criminal Case No. CBU-66693 finding appellant Virgilio Largo Perondo (appellant) guilty of Violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and imposing upon him the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>An Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> containing the following accusatory allegations was filed against appellant:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 20<sup>th</sup> day of July 2003, at about 10:45 P.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with deliberate intent, and without authority of law, did then and there sell, deliver or give away to a poseur buyer one heat sealed plastic packet of 0.05 gram of white crystalline substance, locally known as “SHABU” containing Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Appellant pleaded “not guilty” during his arraignment on October 7, 2003.&nbsp; After the pre-trial conference, trial ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution presented Police Senior Inspector Mutchit G. Salinas (PSI Salinas), a Forensic Chemist, and buy-bust team members SPO2 Benjamin G. Genzon, Jr. (SPO2 Genzon) and PO3 Simeon A. Tapanan, Jr. (PO3 Tapanan).&nbsp; From their testimonies, the following version of the incident emerged:<br><br>On July 20, 2003, SPO2 Genzon, SPO1 James Estrera (SPO1 Estrera), PO3 Emmanuel Sarmiento (PO3 Sarmiento) and PO3 Tapanan were briefed regarding a planned buy-bust operation to be conducted against appellant on that same day in Brgy. San Roque, Cebu City.&nbsp; During the briefing, a civilian asset was designated as the poseur-buyer and two 50-peso marked bills were given to him as buy-bust money.<br><br>Thereafter, the team proceeded to the target area and, upon arrival, strategically positioned themselves 10 to 15 meters away from the <i>barangay</i> hall where appellant was seen standing.&nbsp; The poseur-buyer approached appellant.&nbsp; After briefly talking to the latter, the poseur-buyer took out the 50-peso marked bills from his pocket and gave them to the appellant.&nbsp; In exchange, appellant handed over to the poseur-buyer a small plastic pack containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; The poseur-buyer examined it and then touched his head, which was the pre-arranged signal that the transaction was already consummated.&nbsp; The members of the buy-bust team then rushed to the scene and arrested appellant.&nbsp; They recovered from him the buy-bust money.&nbsp; Anent the plastic sachet, PO3 Tapanan retrieved the same from the poseur-buyer while PO3 Sarmiento wrote thereon appellant’s initials. A qualitative examination conducted on the contents of the plastic sachet by PSI Salinas later revealed that the substance is positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied that a buy-bust operation was conducted against him. Instead, he claimed that at around 9:15 p.m. of July 20, 2003, he was eating and watching television at a barbecue stand when he was suddenly arrested by SPO1 Estrera, PO3 Sarmiento and PO3 Tapanan.&nbsp; He was then taken to a police station and interrogated on the identities of big time drug dealers in Cebu.&nbsp; Because he was not able to provide any information as he is not even from Cebu, the police officers blottered an incident implicating him in the alleged sale of <i>shabu.</i><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>The RTC gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and convicted appellant of the crime charged.&nbsp; In its May 30, 2007 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> it disposed of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, this court finds the accused GUILTY as charged and hereby sentences him to Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>The pack of shabu, Exhibit “B”, is confiscated in favor of the state for proper disposition.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which was approved by the RTC.&nbsp; Hence, the entire records of the case were forwarded to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> appellant maintained that the RTC erred in finding him guilty of the offense charged because: (1) the members of the buy-bust team could not give an accurate account of what really transpired during the alleged operation; (2) there was no pre-operation report submitted to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA); (3) the poseur-buyer was not presented as witness; and (4) the prosecution failed to establish the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>On the other hand, appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), averred that: (1) the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the offense charged; (2) the failure to present the poseur buyer as witness is not fatal since his testimony would merely be corroborative to the testimonies of the police officers who positively identified appellant as the seller; (3) the presumption of regularity on the part of the police officers was correctly applied by the RTC since no improper motive was attributed to them; (4) a pre-operation report to the PDEA is not a requirement under R.A. 9165; and (5) the prosecution was able to prove the identity of the confiscated drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Agreeing with the OSG, the CA ruled as follows in its December 3, 2009 Decision:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision dated May 30, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 58 is hereby AFFIRMED in <i>toto</i>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Appellant’s lone assignment of error in his Appellant’s Brief filed with the CA which he adopted in this appeal per a Manifestation In Lieu of Supplemental Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF&nbsp; VIOLATING SECTION 5, ARTICLE II OF REPUBLIC ACT 9165 DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>There is no merit in the appeal.<br><br><b><i>All the elements of the offense of Illegal<br>Sale of Shabu were proven in this case.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>In a successful prosecution for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must concur: “(1) [the] identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing

of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Appellant was positively identified by the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation as the person who sold the <i>shabu</i> to the poseur buyer.&nbsp; PO3 Tapanan testified, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div

It must be noted that whatever relevant information the poseur-buyer may have was also equally known to the police officers who testified for the prosecution during trial.&nbsp; This is considering that they all participated in the planning and implementation of the buy-bust operation and were all direct witnesses to the actual sale of the <i>shabu</i>, the appellant’s arrest immediately thereafter, and the recovery from him of the marked money.&nbsp; Hence, the testimony of the poseur-buyer was not indispensable or necessary; it would have been cumulative merely, or corroborative at best.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b><i>There was no evidence of improper motive <br>on the part of the police officers.</i></b><br><br>Appellant failed to proffer clear and convincing evidence of improper motive to overturn the presumption that the arresting officers regularly performed their duties.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record to corroborate his self-serving declaration that the charges against him were fabricated for his failure to give the names of those engaged in illegal drug trade in Cebu.&nbsp; Thus, there is no basis to suspect the veracity of the statements of the police officers who testified against him.<br><br>Moreover, appellant’s defenses of denial and frame-up do not deserve credence.&nbsp; Denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; On the other hand, frame-up is viewed with disfavor since it can easily be fabricated and is a common ploy in prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Law.&nbsp; For these defenses to prosper, they must be proved with clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; However, none exists in this case.<br><br>Besides, appellant should have filed the proper charges against the police officers if he was indeed a victim of frame-up.&nbsp; “The fact that no administrative or criminal charges were filed lends cogency to the conclusion that the alleged frame-up was merely concocted as a defense scheme.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b><i>The seized item was the same item<br>presented for examination in the crime<br>laboratory.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Appellant contends that the testimony of PSI Salinas, the Forensic Chemist, was insufficient to conclude that the sachet of <i>shabu</i> she examined in the crime laboratory was the same illegal drug allegedly seized from him.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that the specimen, when turned over by PO3 Tapanan to the crime laboratory, was received by one PO1 Abesia and not by PSI Salinas.&nbsp; And since it was not shown that PSI Salinas knew of the manner with which PO1 Abesia handled the specimen or of what happened to the specimen while it was in the latter’s custody, it cannot be reasonably concluded from PSI Salinas’ testimony that it was the same drug allegedly seized from appellant.<br><br>Appellant’s contention does not adversely affect the identity, integrity and probative value of the seized <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, the Crime Laboratory Request<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> shows that it was PO1 Abesia who received the seized plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from PO3 Tapanan on July 21, 2003.&nbsp; Notably, however, Chemistry Report No. D-1252-2003<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> reveals that PSI Salinas immediately conducted an examination on the specimen submitted and released the result thereof on that day. The span of time that lapsed from the time the specimen was received by PO1 Abesia until the same was examined by PSI Salinas was, therefore, too short to be considered consequential.&nbsp; Also, the marking placed on the seized item by PO3 Sarmiento matches the label of the heat-plastic packet containing white crystalline substance that, per said Chemistry Report No. D-1252-2003, was examined by PSI Salinas.&nbsp; It is thus reasonable to conclude that the specimen submitted was the same one examined.&nbsp; Besides, appellant’s claim that the same may have been altered is just his mere speculation and nothing more.<br><br>Lastly, appellant’s argument that the buy-bust operation is fatally flawed for failure of the police officers to coordinate with the PDEA deserves scant consideration.&nbsp; Coordination with the PDEA is not a crucial requisite of a proper buy-bust operation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> it is not invalidated by mere non-coordination with the PDEA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>All told, there is no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165.<br><br><b><i>The Proper Penalty</i></b><br><br>R.A. 9165 imposes the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10 million for the unauthorized sale of <i>shabu,</i> regardless of its quantity and purity.&nbsp; However, with the enactment of R.A. 9346,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> appellant shall only be penalized with life imprisonment and fine,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as correctly imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA.&nbsp; It must be added, however, that appellant shall not be eligible for parole pursuant to Section 2 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated December 3, 2009 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
