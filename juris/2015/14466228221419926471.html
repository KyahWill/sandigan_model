Pacasum rendered her ruling whereby she concluded that in the absence of a showing of lawful entry into the country the 6,500 sacks of rice were of foreign origin and thus subject to seizure and forfeiture for violation of Section 2530 (f) and (1) No. 1 of the TCCP, as amended; that the presentation of the supporting documents by the claimants was a strategy to conceal the true nature and origin of the rice cargo in order to mislead the Customs authorities into believing that the rice was locally produced and locally purchased; and that considering that the evidence to support the seizure and forfeiture of the carrying vessel was insufficient, the release of the vessel was to be ordered. Pertinent portions of the ruling follow:<br><br><blockquote>The results of the Laboratory Analysis of samples of the subject rice by the NFA and the Philippine Rice Institute reveal that the grain length is unusually long with 7.2 mm. for both Orion and Platinum 2000 rice samples as compared to the grain length of most Philippine Varieties which ranges from 5.8 to 6.9 mm. only. It was also found out that rice with grain length of more than 7.0 mm. are more common in the countries of Brazil, Bolivia, Guatamala and Thailand, (Exhibit "J-3" and "K-l"), although the said imported variety could be purchased locally through the NFA.<br><br>Furthermore, it also appears that some white sacks/containers were marked with Premium Rice whereas per Philippine Grains Standardization, yellow color is for premium while white color is for ordinary rice. (Exhibit I).<br><br>On the basis of the above findings, it can be safely concluded that the 6,500 sacks of rice subject of this proceedings are of foreign origin and therefore subject to seizure and forfeiture for violation of Section 2530 (f) and (1) no. 1 of the TCCP, as amended, in the absence of showing of its lawful entry into the country. The presentation of the supporting documents by respondents/claimants was a strategy to conceal the true nature and origin of the cargoes and to mislead the Customs Authorities into believing that subject rice are locally produced and locally purchased. Hence, said documents have no probative value whatsoever insofar as the subject cargoes are concerned.<br><blockquote>Section 2530 provides: Property Subject to Forfeiture Under Tariff and Customs Law. x x x<br><br>(L) Any article sought to be imported or exported:<br><ol><li>Without going through a Customhouse, whether the act was consummated, frustrated or attempted.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Since the subject rice was established to be of the imported variety and considering that the said cargoes are not covered by proper import documents, the importation of the same fall squarely on the above quoted provision of the TCCP.<br><br>With respect to the carrying vessel, <b>MV "DON MARTIN"</b>, which is a common carrier, no evidence sufficient enough to warrant its forfeiture in favor of the government was presented to satisfy the provision of Section 2530 paragraph a and k of the TCCP. On the other hand, respondent/claimant was able to show proof to defeat a forfeiture decree, by presentation of pertinent documents relative to the following requirements, viz:<br><ol><li>That the owner is engaged in the business for which the conveyance is generally used;<br><br></li><li>That the owner is financially in a position to own such conveyance and<br><br></li><li>That the vessel has not been used for smuggling at least twice before. (Exhibit 1 &amp; 2) in compliance with the provision of Section 2531 oftheTCCP.</li></ol><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing and by virtue of the authority vested in the undersigned under Section 2312 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the 6,500 sacks of imported rice subject of this seizure proceedings be, as they are hereby decreed forfeited in favor of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines to be disposed of in the manner provided by law.

Rosqueta, in her decision dated April 19, 1999, upheld District Collector Pacasum, holding thusly:<br><br><blockquote>This Office is convinced that the 6,500 sacks of rice subject matter of this case are of foreign growth and origin. No evidence of lawful entry of the said rice into the country as well as payment of duties and taxes has been presented, hence, the said cargo is liable to forfeiture under Section 2530 (a), (f) and (I) - 1 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the District Collector of Customs, Port of Cagayan de Oro, ordering the forfeiture of the 6,500 sacks of rice discharge (sic)/ seized from the M/V "DON MARTIN" is AFFIRMED.

In his 3rd Indorsement dated May 11, 1999, then Secretary of Finance Edgardo B. Espiritu reversed the order for the release of the vessel based on the finding that "the operator of the vessel is the shipper of the smuggled goods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Consequently, on June 21, 1999, the petitioners brought a petition for review in the CTA (CTA Case No. 5890) to seek the nullification of the May 11, 1999 3<sup>rd</sup> Indorsement of the Secretary of Finance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and to obtain the release of the rice shipment and the vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Pending the resolution of the appeal, the CTA issued its resolution dated November 8, 1999 ordering the release of the vessel and the rice cargo upon the petitioners' filing of GSIS Surety Bond 032899 and GSIS Surety Bond 032900 in the respective amounts of P5,550,000.00 and P6,682,000.00 in favor of the BOC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On May 22, 2001, the CTA rendered its decision in favor of the petitioners, disposing thusly:<br><br><blockquote><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decisions of the Respondents are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

No. 1125 the decision consequently became final and executory 30 days from their receipt of the decision.<br><br>The respondents' contention is bereft of merit.<br><br>The April 19, 1999 decision of BOC Deputy Commissioner Rosqueta on the forfeiture of the 6,500 sacks of rice would become final and immutable if the petitioners did not appeal it in the CTA within 30 days from receipt thereof. Such period of appeal was expressly set in Section 11 of R.A. No. 1125, which relevantly declares:<br><br><blockquote>Section 11. <b>Who may appeal; effect of appeal</b>.— Any person, association or corporation adversely affected by a decision or ruling of the Collector of Internal Revenue, the Collector of Customs or any provincial or city Board of Assessment Appeals may file an appeal in the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty days after the receipt of such decision or ruling.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote><br>The petitioners insisted in their <i>Comment/Opposition (To Respondents Motion for Partial Reconsideration</i>), however, that they were not furnished a copy of the decision of BOC Deputy Commissioner Rosqueta; and that they only learned of the decision on June 1, 1999 after the issuance of the May 11, 1999 3<sup>rd</sup> Indorsement of the Secretary of Finance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Considering that the respondents did not dispute such insistence of the petitioners, and did not present evidence showing the contrary, the 30-day period for filing the appeal in the CTA commenced to run for the petitioners only after June 1, 1999, which was the date when they unquestionably acquired notice of the adverse decision. Accordingly, they had until July 1, 1999 within which to appeal. With their petition for review being filed on June 21, 1999, which was well within the 30-day period provided in Section 11, <i>supra</i>, their appeal was timely.<br><br>Moreover, the records indicated that the petitioners' appeal in the CTA raised the following issues, to wit:<br><br>It is respectfully submitted that respondents erred:<br><br><blockquote><center>A.<br></center><br>IN DECLARING THAT THE SUBJECT VESSEL M/V "DON MARTIN" BE FORFEITED IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 2530 (a) and (k) (sic) THE TARIFF AND CUSTOMS CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES.<br><br><center>B.<br></center><br>IN DECLARING THAT THE SUBJECT CARGO OF RICE BE FORFEITED IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT DESPITE THE TESTIMONIAL AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF PETITIONERS INDISPUTABLY SHOWING THAT THE SAME WAS PRODUCED AND ACQUIRED LOCALLY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>and that they prayed for the release of <i>both </i>the vessel and its cargo of rice. They also extensively presented in their petition for review their arguments on the illegality of the forfeiture of the rice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Under the circumstances, the issue on the legality of the forfeiture of the rice was fully raised and submitted in the CTA, which thus had adequate basis to resolve it.<br><br>Lastly, under Section 2530 (a) and (k)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the TCCP, the forfeiture of a vehicle, vessel or aircraft is anchored on its being used unlawfully in the transport of contraband or smuggled articles into or from any Philippine port. Consequently, the determination of the legality of the forfeiture of the M/V Don Martin was necessarily contingent on whether the customs authorities had validly and properly seized the shipment of 6,500 sacks of rice on account of the rice being smuggled. Given this logical correlation, the CTA could not be divested of its jurisdiction to determine the legality of the forfeiture of the rice.<br><br>In this regard, we hold it fitting to reiterate that:<br><br><blockquote>Once a court acquires jurisdiction over a case, it has wide discretion to look upon matters which, although not raised as an issue, would give life and meaning to the law. Indeed, the Rules of Court recognize the broad discretionary power of an appellate court to consider errors not assigned.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Thus, an appellate court is clothed with ample authority to review rulings even if they are not assigned as errors in the appeal in these instances</b>: (a) grounds not assigned as errors but affecting jurisdiction over the subject matter; (b) matters not assigned as errors on appeal but are evidently plain or clerical errors within contemplation of law; <b>(c) matters not assigned as errors on appeal but consideration of which is necessary in arriving at a just decision and complete resolution of the case or to serve the interests of justice or to avoid dispensing piecemeal justice</b>; (d) matters not specifically assigned as errors on appeal but raised in the trial court and are matters of record having some bearing on the issue submitted which the parties failed to raise or which the lower court ignored; <b>(e) matters not assigned as errors on appeal but closely related to an error assigned; and (f) matters not assigned as errors on appeal but upon which the determination of a question properly assigned, is dependent</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br><center><b>2.<br>The CA did not reverse the <br>factual findings of the CTA</b></center><br>The petitioners argue that the CA should not have reversed the factual findings of the CTA because such findings were supported by substantial evidence; that the CA should not have favored the assumption by the Secretary of Finance that the operator of the vessel was also the shipper of the smuggled goods; and that the cargo of rice should not have been found as unlawfully imported considering that all the documents they had presented to prove the contrary had been verified and uncontested.<br><br>The petitioners' arguments are unfounded.<br><br>It is true that the CTA is a highly specialized body specifically created for the purpose of reviewing tax cases; hence, its findings of fact are to be accorded utmost respect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Indeed, the factual findings of the CTA, when supported by substantial evidence, are not to be disturbed on appeal unless there is a showing that the CTA committed gross error or abuse in the appreciation of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Here, however, it was obvious that the CA did not modify or alter any of the factual findings of the CTA, but only re-assessed the findings because of the conflicting conclusions reached by the CTA and the BOC. After its re-assessment, the CA declared that the conclusions by the BOC and the Secretary of Finance were more sustainable and convincing than those of the CTA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> By so declaring, the CA did not change the factual findings of the CTA but only arrived at a different interpretation of the findings that tilted its appellate resolution in favor of the respondents. The CA thereby simply exercised its power of appellate review. Indeed, the CA, as the appellate court, had the authority to either affirm, or reverse, or modify the appealed decision of the CTA. To withhold from the CA its power to render an entirely new decision would trench on its power of review, and would, in effect, render it incapable of correcting the patent errors of the lower court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>3.<br>The 6,500 sacks of rice were not unlawfully imported<br>Into the Philippines; hence, there was no legal ground<br>for the forfeiture of the rice and its carrying vessel</b></center><br>In resolving the issue whether the rice shipment constituted smuggling or unlawful importation, the CTA observed that —<br><br><blockquote>xxx [I]n order that a shipment be liable (to) forfeiture, it must be proved that fraud has been committed by the consignee/importer to evade the payment of the duties due. This is clear under Section 2530 (1) and (1) of the TCCP. To establish the existence of fraud, the <i>onus probandi </i>rests on the Respondents who ordered the forfeiture of the shipment of rice and its carrying vessel M/V "DON MARTIN."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Special and Affirmative Defenses of the Respondents generally averred that the subject 6,500 bags of rice are of imported variety which are not covered by proper import documents, hence should be declared forfeited in favor of the government.<br><br>We do not agree. The said ratiocination of Respondents did not clearly indicate any actual commission of fraud or any attempt or frustration thereof. As defined, actual or intentional fraud consist of deception wilfully and deliberately done or resorted to in order to induce another to give up some right (<i>Hon Farolan, Jr. vs. Court of Tax Appeals, 217 SCRA 293</i>). It must amount to intentional wrong-doing with the sole object of avoiding the tax. (<i>Aznar vs. Court of Tax Appeals,</i> 58 SCRA 543).<br><br>The circumstances presented by the Respondents in their Answer do not reveal to us any kind of deception committed by Petitioners. Such circumstances are nothing more than mere half-baked premises that fail to support the proposition sought to be established which is the commission of fraud in accordance with Section 2530 (f) and (1) of the TCCP, as amended.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Court is in total acquiescence with the argument of Petitioners that it is <i>non sequitur </i>to conclude that the subject rice was imported simply because its grain length is more common in other foreign countries. <b>Firstly</b>, the said laboratory analysis by both the NFA and Philippine Rice Research Institute are not conclusive. In fact, the Head of the Rice Chemistry and Food Science Division of the Philippine Rice Research Institute, Mr. James Patindol, <b>admitted that it is premature to conclude that the samples are indeed imported by simply relying on the grain length</b> (Annex "H"). <b>Secondly</b>, these inconclusive findings do not and cannot overcome the documentary evidence of Petitioners that show that said rice was produced, milled and acquired locally. And thirdly, at the time the vessel M/V "DON MARTIN" and its cargo of rice were seized on 26 January 1999, the agents of the EIIB and the Bureau of Customs never had a probable cause that would warrant the filing of the seizure proceedings. The Government agents only made their inquiries about the alleged smuggling only three (3) days after the seizure.

More thorough analyses need to be done</i>." PRRI explained:<br><br><blockquote>xxx We are sorry to inform you, however, that our institute does not have the capability yet to identify local milled rice from imported ones. Routine grain quality analysis in our institute only includes: grain size and shape, % chalky grains, % amylose, % protein, gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, and cooked rice texture. Based on experience, these parameters are not reliable enough to be used as criteria in identifying local from imported cultivars.<br><br>The samples submitted to us are <i>indica</i> types. This further complicates the identification since our local cultivars are <i>indica</i> types as well. However, based on our initial analysis, we noticed that the grain length of your samples is unusually long. It is 7.2 mm for both Orion and Platinum 2000. Milled rice grain length of most Philippine varities (sic) usually ranges from 5.8 to 6.9 mm only. We seldom encounter local cultivars with milled rice grain length of more than 7.0 mm. I tried to browse the Handbook on Grain Quality of World Rices (by Juliano and Villareal, 1993) and I found out that cultivars with grain length above 7.0 mm are more common in the countries of Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Thailand.<b> It is premature to conclude though that your samples are indeed imported, by simply relying on the grain length data. More thorough analyses need to be done</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The National Food Authority (NFA) made a separate laboratory analysis of the rice grain samples, and concluded that the samples resembled "NFA imported rice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It issued a certification dated January 29, 1999<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to the effect that -<br><br><blockquote>xxx per Philippine Grains Standardization Program <b>there was a mislabelling of the rice stocks samples confiscated by Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau (EIIB) last January 27, 1999 unloaded from MV Don Martin at Cagayan de Oro City port.</b><br><br>Observed defeciencies (sic) are as follows:<br><ol><li>Some white sacks/containers were marked with Premium Rice (per PGS yellow color is for premium variety while white color is for ordinary rice).<br><br></li><li>No information available on the quality parameters such as classification, grade, milling degree, date of milling and its miller/packer on all containers used (with logo, Platinum 2000 and Orion).</li></ol></blockquote><br>The results of the laboratory analyses of the rice samples were rendered by the PRRI and the NFA only on February 4, 1999 and February 5, 1999, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is clear, therefore, that the evidence offered by the respondents to establish that the 6,500 sacks of rice were smuggled or were the subject of illegal importation was obtained only after the forfeiture of the 6,500 sacks of rice had been effected on January 26, 1999.<br><br>Moreover, there is no question that the proof of the rice being smuggled or the subject of illegal importation was patently insufficient. Although the rice samples from the shipment dominantly bore foreign rice characteristics as compared with the Philippine varieties, the PRRI itself opined that further analysis was necessary to turn up with a more concrete result. But no additional analysis was made. There was also no proof to establish that the petitioners had been responsible for the mislabelling in the packaging of the rice shipment, or that the mislabelling had been intentionally done to evade the payment of customs duties.<br><br>In contrast, the records showed that the 6,500 sacks of rice were of local origin, having been purchased from Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro from a licensed grains dealer. The local origin was substantiated by the official receipts, business license and certificate of registration issued by the NFA in favor of the source in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, Mintu Rice Mill, and its proprietor, Godofredo Mintu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The petitioners likewise submitted a copy of the Coastwise License<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> issued to the M/V Don Martin, proving that the vessel had been registered only for coastwise trade. A craft engaged in the coastwise and interisland trade was one that carried passengers and/or merchandise for hire between ports and places in the Philippine Islands<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Under Section 902 of the TCCP, the right to engage in the Philippine coastwise trade was limited to vessels carrying a certificate of Philippine registry,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> like the M/V Don Martin.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> To legally engage in coastwise trade, the vessel owner must further submit other documents, like the bill of lading and coastwise manifest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> documents that were also presented by the petitioners during the forfeiture proceedings.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[55]</sup></font> In the absence of any showing by the respondents that the vessel was licensed to engage in trade with foreign countries and was not limited to coastwise trade, the inference that the shipment of the 6,500 sacks of rice was transported only between Philippine ports and not imported from a foreign country became fully warranted.<br><br>Here, the importation of rice was not among the prohibited importations provided under Section 101<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the TCCP. Nor was there any other law that prohibited the importation of rice.<br><br>Still, the respondents insist that the 6,500 sacks of rice were unlawfully imported because the shipment was not accompanied by the necessary import documents.<br><br>The insistence was unreasonable and unwarranted.<br><br>The law penalizes the importation of any merchandise in any manner contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Yet, the shipment of the 6,500 sacks of rice was clearly not contrary to law; hence, it did not constitute unlawful importation as defined under Section 3601 of the TCCP. The phrase <i>contrary to law </i>in Section 3601 qualifies the phrases<i> imports or brings into the Philippines </i>and <i>assists in so doing</i>, not the word <i>article.</i><br><br>The respondents' insistence was based on the premise that the rice shipment was imported. The premise was plainly erroneous. With the petitioners having convincingly established that the 6,500 sacks of rice were of local origin, the shipment need not be accompanied by import documents. Nor was it shown that the shipment did not meet other legal requirements. There were no other circumstances that indicated that the 6,500 sacks of rice were fraudulently transported into the Philippines; on the contrary, the petitioners submitted documents supporting the validity and regularity of the shipment.<br><br>It then becomes unavoidable to address the fate of the M/V Don Martin. The penalty of forfeiture could be imposed on any vessel engaged in smuggling, provided that the following conditions were present, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The vessel is "used unlawfully in the importation or exportation of articles into or from" the Philippines;<br><br>(2) The articles are imported to or exported from "any Philippine port or place, except a port of entry"; or<br><br>(3) If the vessel has a capacity of less than 30 tons and is "used in the importation of articles into any Philippine port or place other than a port of the Sulu Sea, where importation in such vessel may be authorized by the Commissioner, with the approval of the department head."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>With the absence of the first and second conditions, the M/V Don Martin must be released.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision promulgated on July 29, 2003 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
