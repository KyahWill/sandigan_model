				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before this Court is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (<i>TRO</i>) seeking to declare unconstitutional and illegal Ordinance Nos. SP-2095, S-2011 and SP-2235, S-2013 on the Socialized Housing Tax and Garbage Fee, respectively, which are being imposed by the respondents.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>On October 17, 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> respondent Quezon City Council enacted <b>Ordinance No. SP-2095, S-2011</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or the <i>Socialized Housing Tax of Quezon City</i>, Section 3 of which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. IMPOSITION. A special assessment equivalent to one-half percent (0.5%) on the assessed value of land in excess of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) shall be collected by the City Treasurer which shall accrue to the Socialized Housing Programs of the Quezon City Government. The special assessment shall accrue to the General Fund under a special account to be established for the purpose.<br></blockquote>Effective for five (5) years, the Socialized Housing Tax (<i>SHT</i>) shall be utilized by the Quezon City Government for the following projects: (a) land purchase/land banking; (b) improvement of current/existing socialized housing facilities; (c) land development; (d) construction of core houses, sanitary cores, medium-rise buildings and other similar structures; and (e) financing of public-private partnership agreement of the Quezon City Government and National Housing Authority (<i>NHA</i>) with the private sector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Under certain conditions, a tax credit shall be enjoyed by taxpayers regularly paying the special assessment:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7. TAX CREDIT. Taxpayers dutifully paying the special assessment tax as imposed by this ordinance shall enjoy a tax credit. The tax credit may be availed of only after five (5) years of continue[d] payment. Further, the taxpayer availing this tax credit must be a taxpayer in good standing as certified by the City Treasurer and City Assessor.<br><br>The tax credit to be granted shall be equivalent to the total amount of the special assessment paid by the property owner, which shall be given as follows:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; 6<sup>th</sup> year&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%<br><br>2.&nbsp; 7<sup>th</sup> year&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%<br><br>3.&nbsp; 8<sup>th</sup> year&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%<br><br>4.&nbsp; 9<sup>th</sup> year&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%<br><br>5.&nbsp; 10<sup>th</sup> year&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%<br></blockquote>Furthermore, only the registered owners may avail of the tax credit and may not be continued by the subsequent property owners even if they are buyers in good faith, heirs or possessor of a right in whatever legal capacity over the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, <b>Ordinance No. SP-2235, S-2013</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was enacted on December 16, 2013 and took effect ten days after when it was approved by respondent City Mayor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The proceeds collected from the garbage fees on residential properties shall be deposited solely and exclusively in an earmarked special account under the general fund to be utilized for garbage collections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Section 1 of the Ordinance set forth the schedule and manner for the collection of garbage fees:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.

We issued a TRO on February 5, 2014, which enjoined the enforcement of Ordinance Nos. SP-2095 and SP-2235 and required respondents to comment on the petition without necessarily giving due course thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Respondents filed their Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with urgent motion to dissolve the TRO on February 17, 2014. Thereafter, petitioner filed a Reply and a Memorandum on March 3, 2014 and September 8, 2014, respectively.<br><br><center><b>Procedural Matters</b><br></center><br><i>A.&nbsp; Propriety of a Petition for Certiorari</i><br><br>Respondents are of the view that this petition for <i>certiorari</i> is improper since they are not tribunals, boards or officers exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Petitioner, however, counters that in enacting Ordinance Nos. SP-2095 and SP-2235, the Quezon City Council exercised quasi-judicial function because the ordinances ruled against the property owners who must pay the SHT and the garbage fee, exacting from them funds for basic essential public services that they should not be held liable. Even if a Rule 65 petition is improper, petitioner still asserts that this Court, in a number of cases like in <i>Rosario v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> has taken cognizance of an improper remedy in the interest of justice.<br><br>We agree that respondents neither acted in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity nor arrogated unto themselves any judicial or quasi-judicial prerogatives.<br><blockquote>A respondent is said to be exercising <i>judicial function</i> where he has the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties.<br><br><i>Quasi-judicial function</i>, on the other hand, is “a term which applies to the actions, discretion, <i>etc.</i>, of public administrative officers or bodies required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.”<br><br>Before a tribunal, board, or officer may exercise judicial or quasi-judicial acts, it is necessary that there be a law that gives rise to some specific rights of persons or property under which adverse claims to such rights are made, and the controversy ensuing therefrom is brought before a tribunal, board, or officer clothed with power and authority to determine the law and adjudicate the respective rights of the contending parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>For a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to issue, the following requisites must concur: (1) it must be directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) the tribunal, board, or officer must have acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The enactment by the Quezon City Council of the assailed ordinances was done in the exercise of its <b><i>legislative</i></b>, not judicial or quasi-judicial, function. Under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160, or the <i>Local Government Code of 1991</i> (<i>LGC</i>), local legislative power shall be exercised by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> for the city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Said law likewise is specific in providing that the power to impose a tax, fee, or charge, or to generate revenue shall be exercised by the <i>sanggunian</i> of the local government unit concerned through an appropriate ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Also, although the instant petition is styled as a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, it essentially seeks to declare the unconstitutionality and illegality of the questioned ordinances. It, thus, partakes of the nature of a petition for declaratory relief over which this Court has only appellate, not original, jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Despite these, a petition for declaratory relief may be treated as one for prohibition or mandamus, over which We exercise original jurisdiction, in cases with far-reaching implications or one which raises transcendental issues or questions that need to be resolved for the public good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The judicial policy is that this Court will entertain direct resort to it when the redress sought cannot be obtained in the proper courts or when exceptional and compelling circumstances warrant availment of a remedy within and calling for the exercise of Our primary jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Section 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court lay down under what circumstances a petition for prohibition may be filed:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Petition for prohibition</i>. - When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceeding in the action or matter specified therein, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br></blockquote>In a petition for prohibition against any tribunal, corporation, board, or person – whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial functions – who has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, the petitioner prays that judgment be rendered, commanding the respondents to desist from further proceeding in the action or matter specified in the petition. In this case, petitioner's primary intention is to prevent respondents from implementing Ordinance Nos. SP-2095 and SP-2235. Obviously, the writ being sought is in the nature of a prohibition, commanding desistance.<br><br>We consider that respondents City Mayor, City Treasurer, and City Assessor are performing <b><i>ministerial</i></b> functions. A ministerial function is one that an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard for the exercise of his or its own judgment, upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Respondent Mayor, as chief executive of the city government, exercises such powers and performs such duties and functions as provided for by the LGC and other laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Particularly, he has the duty to ensure that all taxes and other revenues of the city are collected, and that city funds are applied to the payment of expenses and settlement of obligations of the city, in accordance with law or ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On the other hand, under the LGC, all local taxes, fees, and charges shall be collected by the provincial, city, municipal, or barangay treasurer, or their duly-authorized deputies, while the assessor shall take charge, among others, of ensuring that all laws and policies governing the appraisal and assessment of real properties for taxation purposes are properly executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Anent the SHT, the Department of Finance (DOF) Local Finance Circular No. 1-97, dated April 16, 1997, is more specific:<br><blockquote>6.3 The Assessor’s office of the <i>Id.</i>ntified LGU shall:<br><ol type="a"><li>immediately undertake an inventory of lands within its jurisdiction which shall be subject to the levy of the Social Housing Tax (SHT) by the local sanggunian concerned;<br><br></li><li>inform the affected registered owners of the effectivity of the SHT; a list of the lands and registered owners shall also be posted in 3 conspicuous places in the city/municipality;<br><br></li><li>furnish the Treasurer’s office and the local sanggunian concerned of the list of lands affected;<br></li></ol>6.4 The Treasurer’s office shall:<br><ol type="a"><li>collect the Social Housing Tax on top of the Real Property Tax, SEF Tax and other special assessments;<br><br></li><li>report to the DOF, thru the Bureau of Local Government Finance, and the Mayor’s office the monthly collections on Social Housing Tax (SHT). An annual report should likewise be submitted to the HUDCC on the total revenues raised during the year pursuant to Sec. 43, R.A. 7279 and the manner in which the same was disbursed.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner has adduced special and important reasons as to why direct recourse to Us should be allowed. Aside from presenting a novel question of law, this case calls for immediate resolution since the challenged ordinances adversely affect the property interests of all paying constituents of Quezon City. As well, this petition serves as a test case for the guidance of other local government units (<i>LGUs</i>). Indeed, the petition at bar is of transcendental importance warranting a relaxation of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. In <i>Social Justice Society (SJS) Officers, et al. v. Lim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court cited the case of <i>Senator Jaworski v. Phil. Amusement &amp; Gaming Corp.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> where We ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>Granting <i>arguendo</i> that the present action cannot be properly treated as a petition for prohibition, <b><u>the transcendental importance of the issues involved in this case warrants that we set aside the technical defects and take primary jurisdiction over the petition at bar</u></b>. x x x <b><u>This is in accordance with the well-entrenched principle that rules of procedure are not inflexible tools designed to hinder or delay, but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate, rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><i>B.&nbsp; Locus Standi of Petitioner</i><br><br>Respondents challenge petitioner’s legal standing to file this case on the ground that, in relation to Section 3 of Ordinance No. SP-2095, petitioner failed to allege his ownership of a property that has an assessed value of more than Php100,000.00 and, with respect to Ordinance No. SP-2335, by what standing or personality he filed the case to nullify the same. According to respondents, the petition is not a class suit, and that, for not having specifically alleged that petitioner filed the case as a taxpayer, it could only be surmised whether he is a party-in-interest who stands to be directly benefited or injured by the judgment in this case.<br><blockquote>It is a general rule that every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest, who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.<br><br>Jurisprudence defines interest as "material interest, an interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. By real interest is meant a present substantial interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." "To qualify a person to be a real party-in-interest in whose name an action must be prosecuted, he must appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>“Legal standing” or <i>locus standi</i> calls for more than just a generalized grievance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The concept has been defined as a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>A party challenging the constitutionality of a law, act, or statute must show “not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has sustained or is in immediate, or imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way.” It must be shown that he has been, or is about to be, denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled, or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Tested by the foregoing, petitioner in this case clearly has legal standing to file the petition. He is a real party-in-interest to assail the constitutionality and legality of Ordinance Nos. SP-2095 and SP-2235 because respondents did not dispute that he is a registered co-owner of a residential property in Quezon City and that he paid property tax which already included the SHT and the garbage fee. He has substantial right to seek a refund of the payments he made and to stop future imposition. While he is a lone petitioner, his cause of action to declare the validity of the subject ordinances is substantial and of paramount interest to similarly situated property owners in Quezon City.<br><br><i>C.&nbsp; Litis Pendentia</i><br><br>Respondents move for the dismissal of this petition on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i>. They claim that, as early as February 22, 2012, a case entitled <i>Alliance of Quezon City Homeowners, Inc., et al., v. Hon. Herbert Bautista, et al.</i>, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-12-7-820, has been pending in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, Branch 104, which assails the legality of Ordinance No. SP-2095. Relying on <i>City of Makati, et al. v. Municipality (now City) of Taguig, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> respondents assert that there is substantial identity of parties between the two cases because petitioner herein and plaintiffs in the civil case filed their respective cases as taxpayers of Quezon City.<br><br>For petitioner, however, respondents’ contention is untenable since he is not a party in <i>Alliance</i> and does not even have the remotest identity or association with the plaintiffs in said civil case. Moreover, respondents’ arguments would deprive this Court of its jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of laws under Section 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><i>Litis pendentia</i> is a Latin term which literally means “a pending suit” and is variously referred to in some decisions as <i>lis pendens</i> and <i>auter action pendant</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> While it is normally connected with the control which the court has on a property involved in a suit during the continuance proceedings, it is more interposed as a ground for the dismissal of a civil action pending in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In <i>Film Development Council of the Philippines v. SM Prime Holdings, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We elucidated:<br><blockquote><i>Litis pendentia</i>, as a ground for the dismissal of a civil action, refers to a situation where two actions are pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, so that one of them becomes unnecessary and vexatious. It is based on the policy against multiplicity of suit and authorizes a court to dismiss a case <i>motu proprio</i>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The requisites in order that an action may be dismissed on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i> are: (a) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interest in both actions; (b) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts, and (c) the identity of the two cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The underlying principle of <i>litis pendentia</i> is the theory that a party is not allowed to vex another more than once regarding the same subject matter and for the same cause of action. This theory is founded on the public policy that the same subject matter should not be the subject of controversy in courts more than once, in order that possible conflicting judgments may be avoided for the sake of the stability of the rights and status of persons, and also to avoid the costs and expenses incident to numerous suits.<br><br>Among the several tests resorted to in ascertaining whether two suits relate to a single or common cause of action are: (1) whether the same evidence would support and sustain both the first and second causes of action; and (2) whether the defenses in one case may be used to substantiate the complaint in the other.<br><br>The determination of whether there is an identity of causes of action for purposes of <i>litis pendentia</i> is inextricably linked with that of <i>res judicata</i>, each constituting an element of the other. In either case, both relate to the sound practice of including, in a single litigation, the disposition of all issues relating to a cause of action that is before a court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>There is substantial identity of the parties when there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case albeit the latter was not impleaded in the first case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, the fact that the positions of the parties are reversed, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the plaintiffs in the first case are the defendants in the second case or vice-versa, does not negate the identity of parties for purposes of determining whether the case is dismissible on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is notable that respondents failed to attach any pleading connected with the alleged civil case pending before the Quezon City trial court. Granting that there is substantial identity of parties between said case and this petition, dismissal on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i> still cannot be had in view of the absence of the second and third requisites. There is no way for Us to determine whether both cases are based on the same set of facts that require the presentation of the same evidence. Even if founded on the same set of facts, the rights asserted and reliefs prayed for could be different. Moreover, there is no basis to rule that the two cases are intimately related and/or intertwined with one another such that the judgment that may be rendered in one, regardless of which party would be successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<br><br><i>D. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</i><br><br>Respondents contend that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his non-compliance with Section 187 of the LGC, which mandates:<br><blockquote>Section 187. <i>Procedure for Approval and Effectivity of Tax Ordinances and Revenue Measures; Mandatory Public Hearings</i>. – The procedure for approval of local tax ordinances and revenue measures shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Code: Provided, That public hearings shall be conducted for the purpose prior to the enactment thereof: Provided, further, That any question on the constitutionality or legality of tax ordinances or revenue measures may be raised on appeal within thirty (30) days from the effectivity thereof to the Secretary of Justice who shall render a decision within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the appeal: Provided, however, That such appeal shall not have the effect of suspending the effectivity of the ordinance and the accrual and payment of the tax, fee, or charge levied therein: Provided, finally, That within thirty (30) days after receipt of the decision or the lapse of the sixty-day period without the Secretary of Justice acting upon the appeal, the aggrieved party may file appropriate proceedings with a court of competent jurisdiction.<br></blockquote>The provision, the constitutionality of which was sustained in <i>Drilon v. Lim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> has been construed as mandatory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> considering that –<br><blockquote>A municipal tax ordinance empowers a local government unit to impose taxes. The power to tax is the most effective instrument to raise needed revenues to finance and support the myriad activities of local government units for the delivery of basic services essential to the promotion of the general welfare and enhancement of peace, progress, and prosperity of the people. Consequently, any delay in implementing tax measures would be to the detriment of the public. It is for this reason that protests over tax ordinances are required to be done within certain time frames. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The obligatory nature of Section 187 was underscored in <i>Hagonoy Market Vendor Asso. v. Municipality of Hagonoy</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he timeframe fixed by law for parties to avail of their legal remedies before competent courts is not a “mere technicality” that can be easily brushed aside. The periods stated in Section 187 of the Local Government Code are mandatory. x x x Being its lifeblood, collection of revenues by the government is of paramount importance. The funds for the operation of its agencies and provision of basic services to its inhabitants are largely derived from its revenues and collections. Thus, it is essential that <i>the validity of revenue measures is not left uncertain for a considerable length of time</i>. Hence, the law provided a time limit for an aggrieved party to assail the legality of revenue measures and tax ordinances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Despite these cases, the Court, in <i>Ongsuco, et al. v. Hon. Malones</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> held that there was no need for petitioners therein to exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the courts, considering that there was only a pure question of law, the parties did not dispute any factual matter on which they had to present evidence. Likewise, in <i>Cagayan Electric Power and Light Co., Inc. v. City of Cagayan de Oro</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> We relaxed the application of the rules in view of the more substantive matters.

By imposing the SHT and the garbage fee, the latter has shown a penchant and pattern to collect taxes to pay for public services that could be covered by its revenues from taxes imposed on property, idle land, business, transfer, amusement, <i>etc.</i>, as well as the Internal Revenue Allotment (<i>IRA</i>) from the National Government. For petitioner, it is noteworthy that respondents did not raise the issue that the Quezon City Government is in dire financial state and desperately needs money to fund housing for informal settlers and to pay for garbage collection. In fact, it has not denied that its revenue collection in 2012 is in the sum of P13.69 billion.<br><br>Moreover, the imposition of the SHT and the garbage fee cannot be justified by the Quezon City Government as an exercise of its power to create sources of income under Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> According to petitioner, the constitutional provision is not a <i>carte blanche</i> for the LGU to tax everything under its territorial and political jurisdiction as the provision itself admits of guidelines and limitations.<br><br>Petitioner further claims that the annual property tax is an <i>ad valorem</i> tax, a percentage of the assessed value of the property, which is subject to revision every three (3) years in order to reflect an increase in the market value of the property. The SHT and the garbage fee are actually increases in the property tax which are not based on the assessed value of the property or its reassessment every three years; hence, in violation of Sections 232 and 233 of the LGC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>For their part, respondents relied on the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of Ordinance Nos.

There is no way that the ordinance could violate the equal protection clause because real property owners and informal settlers do not belong to the same class.<br><br>Ordinance No. SP-2095 is also not oppressive since the tax rate being imposed is consistent with the UDHA. While the law authorizes LGUs to collect SHT on properties with an assessed value of more than P50,000.00, the questioned ordinance only covers properties with an assessed value exceeding P100,000.00. As well, the ordinance provides for a tax credit equivalent to the total amount of the special assessment paid by the property owner beginning in the sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) year of the effectivity of the ordinance.<br><br>On the contrary, petitioner claims that the collection of the SHT is tantamount to a penalty imposed on real property owners due to the failure of respondent Quezon City Mayor and Council to perform their duty to secure and protect real property owners from informal settlers, thereby burdening them with the expenses to provide funds for housing. For petitioner, the SHT cannot be viewed as a “charity” from real property owners since it is forced, not voluntary.<br><br>Also, petitioner argues that the collection of the SHT is a kind of class legislation that violates the right of property owners to equal protection of the laws since it favors informal settlers who occupy property not their own and pay no taxes over law-abiding real property owners who pay income and realty taxes.<br><br>Petitioner further contends that respondents’ characterization of the SHT as “nothing more than an advance payment on the real property tax” has no statutory basis. Allegedly, property tax cannot be collected before it is due because, under the LGC, chartered cities are authorized to impose property tax based on the assessed value and the general revision of assessment that is made every three (3) years.<br><br>As to the rationale of SHT stated in Ordinance No. SP-2095, which, in turn, was based on Section 43 of the UDHA, petitioner asserts that there is no specific provision in the 1987 Constitution stating that the ownership and enjoyment of property bear a social function. And even if there is, it is seriously doubtful and far-fetched that the principle means that property owners should provide funds for the housing of informal settlers and for home site development. Social justice and police power, petitioner believes, does not mean imposing a tax on one, or that one has to give up something, for the benefit of another. At best, the principle that property ownership and enjoyment bear a social function is but a reiteration of the Civil Law principle that property should not be enjoyed and abused to the injury of other properties and the community, and that the use of the property may be restricted by police power, the exercise of which is not involved in this case.<br><br>Finally, petitioner alleges that 6 <i>Bistekvilles</i> will be constructed out of the SHT collected. <i>Bistek</i> is the monicker of respondent City Mayor. The <i>Bistekvilles</i> makes it clear, therefore, that politicians will take the credit for the tax imposed on real property owners.<br><br><i>On the Garbage Fee</i><br><br>Respondents claim that Ordinance No. S-2235, which is an exercise of police power, collects on the average from every household a garbage fee in the meager amount of thirty-three (33) centavos per day compared with the sum of P1,659.83 that the Quezon City Government annually spends for every household for garbage collection and waste management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In addition, there is no double taxation because the ordinance involves a fee. Even assuming that the garbage fee is a tax, the same cannot be a direct duplicate tax as it is imposed on a different subject matter and is of a different kind or character. Based on <i>Villanueva, et al. v. City of Iloilo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and <i>Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. Municipality of Victorias, etc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> there is no “taxing twice” because the real property tax is imposed on ownership based on its assessed value, while the garbage fee is required on the domestic household. The only reference to the property is the determination of the applicable rate and the facility of collection.<br><br>Petitioner argues, however, that Ordinance No. S-2235 cannot be justified as an exercise of police power. The cases of <i>Calalang v. Williams</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <i>Patalinghug v.

To bolster the claim, he states that the revenue collection of the Quezon City Government reached Php13.69 billion in 2012. A small portion of said amount could be spent for garbage collection and other essential services.<br><br>It is further noted that the Quezon City Government already collects garbage fee under Section 47<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of R.A. No. 9003, or the <i>Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000</i>, which authorizes LGUs to impose fees in amounts sufficient to pay the costs of preparing, adopting, and implementing a solid waste management plan, and that LGUs have access to the Solid Waste Management (<i>SWM</i>) Fund created under Section 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the same law. Also, according to petitioner, it is evident that Ordinance No. S-2235 is inconsistent with R.A. No. 9003 for while the law encourages segregation, composting, and recycling of waste, the ordinance only emphasizes the collection and payment of garbage fee; while the law calls for an active involvement of the barangay in the collection, segregation, and recycling of garbage, the ordinance skips such mandate.<br><br>Lastly, in challenging the ordinance, petitioner avers that the garbage fee was collected even if the required publication of its approval had not yet elapsed. He notes that on January 7, 2014, he paid his realty tax which already included the garbage fee.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>Respondents correctly argued that an ordinance, as in every law, is presumed valid.<br><blockquote>An ordinance carries with it the presumption of validity. The question of reasonableness though is open to judicial inquiry. Much should be left thus to the discretion of municipal authorities. Courts will go slow in writing off an ordinance as unreasonable unless the amount is so excessive as to be prohibitive, arbitrary, unreasonable, oppressive, or confiscatory. A rule which has gained acceptance is that factors relevant to such an inquiry are the municipal conditions as a whole and the nature of the business made subject to imposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>For an ordinance to be valid though, it must not only be within the corporate powers of the LGU to enact and must be passed according to the procedure prescribed by law, it should also conform to the following requirements: (1) not contrary to the Constitution or any statute; (2) not unfair or oppressive; (3) not partial or discriminatory; (4) not prohibit but may regulate trade; (5) general and consistent with public policy; and (6) not unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As jurisprudence indicates, the tests are divided into the formal <span style="font-style: italic;">(i.e.</span>, whether the ordinance was enacted within the corporate powers of the LGU and whether it was passed in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law), and the substantive (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, involving inherent merit, like the conformity of the ordinance with the limitations under the Constitution and the statutes, as well as with the requirements of fairness and reason, and its consistency with public policy).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>An ordinance must pass muster under the test of constitutionality and the test of consistency with the prevailing laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> If not, it is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Ordinance should uphold the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> As to conformity with existing statutes, <i>Batangas CATV, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> has this to say:<br><blockquote>It is a fundamental principle that municipal ordinances are inferior in status and subordinate to the laws of the state. An ordinance in conflict with a state law of general character and statewide application is universally held to be invalid. The principle is frequently expressed in the declaration that municipal authorities, under a general grant of power, cannot adopt ordinances which infringe the spirit of a state law or repugnant to the general policy of the state. In every power to pass ordinances given to a municipality, there is an implied restriction that the ordinances shall be consistent with the general law. In the language of Justice Isagani Cruz (ret.), this Court, in <i>Magtajas vs. Pryce Properties Corp., Inc.</i>, ruled that:<br><blockquote>The rationale of the requirement that the ordinances should not contravene a statute is obvious. Municipal governments are only agents of the national government. Local councils exercise only delegated legislative powers conferred on them by Congress as the national lawmaking body. The delegate cannot be superior to the principal or exercise powers higher than those of the latter. It is a heresy to suggest that the local government units can undo the acts of Congress, from which they have derived their power in the first place, and negate by mere ordinance the mandate of the statute.<br></blockquote>Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. As it creates, so it may destroy. As it may destroy, it may abridge and control. Unless there is some constitutional limitation on the right, the legislature might, by a single act, and if we can suppose it capable of so great a folly and so great a wrong, sweep from existence all of the municipal corporations in the State, and the corporation could not prevent it. We know of no limitation on the right so far as to the corporation themselves are concerned. They are, so to phrase it, the mere tenants at will of the legislature.<br><br>This basic relationship between the national legislature and the local government units has not been enfeebled by the new provisions in the Constitution strengthening the policy of local autonomy. Without meaning to detract from that policy, we here confirm that Congress retains control of the local government units although in significantly reduced degree now than under our previous Constitutions. The power to create still includes the power to destroy. The power to grant still includes the power to withhold or recall. True, there are certain notable innovations in the Constitution, like the direct conferment on the local government units of the power to tax, which cannot now be withdrawn by mere statute. <i>By and large, however, the national legislature is still the principal of the local government units, which cannot defy its will or modify or violate it</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>LGUs must be reminded that they merely form part of the whole; that the policy of ensuring the autonomy of local governments was never intended by the drafters of the 1987 Constitution to create an <i>imperium in imperio</i> and install an intra-sovereign political subdivision independent of a single sovereign state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> “[M]unicipal corporations are bodies politic and corporate, created not only as local units of local self-government, but as governmental agencies of the state. The legislature, by establishing a municipal corporation, does not divest the State of any of its sovereignty; absolve itself from its right and duty to administer the public affairs of the entire state; or divest itself of any power over the inhabitants of the district which it possesses before the charter was granted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>LGUs are able to legislate only by virtue of a valid delegation of legislative power from the national legislature; they are mere agents vested with what is called the power of subordinate legislation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> “Congress enacted the LGC as the implementing law for the delegation to the various LGUs of the State’s great powers, namely: the police power, the power of eminent domain, and the power of taxation. The LGC was fashioned to delineate the specific parameters and limitations to be complied with by each LGU in the exercise of these delegated powers with the view of making each LGU a fully functioning subdivision of the State subject to the constitutional and statutory limitations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Specifically, with regard to the power of taxation, it is indubitably the most effective instrument to raise needed revenues in financing and supporting myriad activities of the LGUs for the delivery of basic services essential to the promotion of the general welfare and the enhancement of peace, progress, and prosperity of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> As this Court opined in <i>National Power Corp. v. City of Cabanatuan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><blockquote>In recent years, the increasing social challenges of the times expanded the scope of state activity, and taxation has become a tool to realize social justice and the equitable distribution of wealth, economic progress and the protection of local industries as well as public welfare and similar objectives. Taxation assumes even greater significance with the ratification of the 1987 Constitution. Thenceforth, the power to tax is no longer vested exclusively on Congress; local legislative bodies are now given direct authority to levy taxes, fees and other charges pursuant to Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“Section 5. Each Local Government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenue, to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.”<br></blockquote>This paradigm shift results from the realization that genuine development can be achieved only by strengthening local autonomy and promoting decentralization of governance. For a long time, the country’s highly centralized government structure has bred a culture of dependence among local government leaders upon the national leadership. It has also “dampened the spirit of initiative, innovation and imaginative resilience in matters of local development on the part of local government leaders.” The only way to shatter this culture of dependence is to give the LGUs a wider role in the delivery of basic services, and confer them sufficient powers to generate their own sources for the purpose. To achieve this goal, Section 3 of Article X of the 1987 Constitution mandates Congress to enact a local government code that will, <i>consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy</i>, set the guidelines and limitations to this grant of taxing powers x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote>Fairly recently, We also stated in <i>Pelizloy Realty Corporation v.

City Council of Baguio</i>:<br><blockquote>It is settled that a municipal corporation unlike a sovereign state is clothed with no inherent power of taxation. <u>The charter or statute must plainly show an intent to confer that power or the municipality, cannot assume it</u>. And the power when granted is to be construed in <i>strictissimi juris</i>. Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality. Inferences, implications, deductions – all these – have no place in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal corporation.

Nevertheless, the fundamental law did not intend the delegation to be absolute and unconditional; the constitutional objective obviously is to ensure that, while the local government units are being strengthened and made more autonomous, the legislature must still see to it that (a) the taxpayer will not be over-burdened or saddled with multiple and unreasonable impositions; (b) each local government unit will have its fair share of available resources; (c) the resources of the national government will not be unduly disturbed; and (d) local taxation will be fair, uniform, and just.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Subject to the provisions of the LGC and consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy, every LGU is now empowered and authorized to create its own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees, and charges which shall accrue exclusively to the local government unit as well as to apply its resources and assets for productive, developmental, or welfare purposes, in the exercise or furtherance of their governmental or proprietary powers and functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The relevant provisions of the LGC which establish the parameters of the taxing power of the LGUs are as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 130. <i>Fundamental Principles</i>. – The following fundamental principles shall govern the exercise of the taxing and other revenue-raising powers of local government units:<br><br>(a) Taxation shall be uniform in each local government unit;<br><br>(b) Taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall:<br><blockquote>(1) be equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer’s ability to pay;<br><br>(2) be levied and collected only for public purposes;<br><br>(3) not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory;<br><br>(4) not be contrary to law, public policy, national economic policy, or in restraint of trade;<br><br>(c) The collection of local taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall in no case be let to any private person;<br><br>(d) The revenue collected pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall inure solely to the benefit of, and be subject to the disposition by, the local government unit levying the tax, fee, charge or other imposition unless otherwise specifically provided herein; and,<br><br>(e) Each local government unit shall, as far as practicable, evolve a progressive system of taxation.<br></blockquote>SECTION 133. <i>Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units</i>. – Unless otherwise provided herein, the exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays shall not extend to the levy of the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Income tax, except when levied on banks and other financial institutions;<br><br>(b) Documentary stamp tax;<br><br>(c) Taxes on estates, inheritance, gifts, legacies and other acquisitions <i>mortis causa</i>, except as otherwise provided herein;<br><br>(d) Customs duties, registration fees of vessel and wharfage on wharves, tonnage dues, and all other kinds of customs fees, charges and dues except wharfage on wharves constructed and maintained by the local government unit concerned;<br><br>(e) Taxes, fees, and charges and other impositions upon goods carried into or out of, or passing through, the territorial jurisdictions of local government units in the guise of charges for wharfage, tolls for bridges or otherwise, or other taxes, fees, or charges in any form whatsoever upon such goods or merchandise;<br><br>(f) Taxes, fees or charges on agricultural and aquatic products when sold by marginal farmers or fishermen;<br><br>(g) Taxes on business enterprises certified to by the Board of Investments as pioneer or non-pioneer for a period of six (6) and four (4) years, respectively from the date of registration;<br><br>(h) Excise taxes on articles enumerated under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and taxes, fees or charges on petroleum products;<br><br>(i) Percentage or value-added tax (VAT) on sales, barters or exchanges or similar transactions on goods or services except as otherwise provided herein;<br><br>(j) Taxes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code;<br><br>(k) Taxes on premiums paid by way of reinsurance or retrocession;<br><br>(l) Taxes, fees or charges for the registration of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof, except tricycles;<br><br>(m) Taxes, fees, or other charges on Philippine products actually exported, except as otherwise provided herein;<br><br>(n) Taxes, fees, or charges, on Countryside and Barangay Business Enterprises and cooperatives duly registered under R.A.

The determining factors are the purpose and effect of the imposition as may be apparent from the provisions of the ordinance. Thus, “[w]hen no police inspection, supervision, or regulation is provided, nor any standard set for the applicant to establish, or that he agrees to attain or maintain, but any and all persons engaged in the business designated, without qualification or hindrance, may come, and a license on payment of the stipulated sum will issue, to do business, subject to no prescribed rule of conduct and under no guardian eye, but according to the unrestrained judgment or fancy of the applicant and licensee, <i>the presumption is strong that the power of taxation</i>, and not the police power, is being exercised.”<br></blockquote></blockquote>In Georgia, U.S.A., assessments for garbage collection services have been consistently treated as a fee and not a tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> In another U.S. case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> the garbage fee was considered as a "service charge" rather than a tax as it was actually a fee for a service given by the city which had previously been provided at no cost to its citizens.<br><br>Hence, not being a tax, the contention that the garbage fee under Ordinance No. SP-2235 violates the rule on double taxation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> must necessarily fail.<br><br>Nonetheless, although a special charge, tax, or assessment may be imposed by a municipal corporation, it must be reasonably commensurate to the cost of providing the garbage service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> To pass judicial scrutiny, a regulatory fee must not produce revenue in excess of the cost of the regulation because such fee will be construed as an illegal tax when the revenue generated by the regulation exceeds the cost of the regulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that the Quezon City Government already collects garbage fee under Section 47 of R.A.

To reiterate, however, the authority of a municipality or city to impose fees extends only to those related to the collection and transport of <b><i>non-recyclable</i></b> and <b><i>special</i></b> wastes.<br><br>Granting, for the sake of argument, that the 0.66 kilogram of solid waste per day refers only to non-recyclable and special wastes, still, We cannot sustain the validity of Ordinance No. S-2235. It violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution and the provisions of the LGC that an ordinance must be equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer’s ability to pay, and not unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup><br><br>In the subject ordinance, the rates of the imposable fee depend on land or floor area and whether the payee is an occupant of a lot, condominium, social housing project or apartment. For easy reference, the relevant provision is again quoted below:<br><blockquote>On all domestic households in Quezon City;<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="center">LAND AREA</div></td><td width="60%"><div align="center">IMPOSABLE FEE</div></td></tr><tr><td>Less than 200 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP 100.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>201 sq. m. – 500 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP 200.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>501 sq. m. – 1,000 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP 300.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>1,001 sq. m. – 1,500 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP 400.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>1,501 sq. m. – 2,000 sq. m. or more</td><td><div align="center">PHP 500.00</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On all condominium unit and socialized housing projects/units in Quezon City;<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="center">FLOOR AREA</div></td><td width="60%"><div align="center">IMPOSABLE FEE</div></td></tr><tr><td>Less than 40 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP25.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>41 sq. m. – 60 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP50.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>61 sq. m. – 100 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP75.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>101 sq. m. – 150 sq. m.</td><td><div align="center">PHP100.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>151 sq. m. – 200 sq.

Most likely, garbage output produced by these types of occupants is uniform and does not vary to a large degree; thus, a similar schedule of fee is both just and equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>The rates being charged by the ordinance are unjust and inequitable: a resident of a 200 sq. m. unit in a condominium or socialized housing project has to pay twice the amount than a resident of a lot similar in size; unlike unit occupants, all occupants of a lot with an area of 200 sq. m. and less have to pay a fixed rate of Php100.00; and the same amount of garbage fee is imposed regardless of whether the resident is from a condominium or from a socialized housing project.<br><br>Indeed, the classifications under Ordinance No. S-2235 are not germane to its declared purpose of “promoting shared responsibility with the residents to attack their common mindless attitude in over-consuming the present resources and in generating waste.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> Instead of simplistically categorizing the payee into land or floor occupant of a lot or unit of a condominium, socialized housing project or apartment, respondent City Council should have considered factors that could truly measure the amount of wastes generated and the appropriate fee for its collection. Factors include, among others, household age and size, accessibility to waste collection, population density of the barangay or district, capacity to pay, and actual occupancy of the property. R.A. No. 9003 may also be looked into for guidance. Under said law, SWM service fees may be computed based on minimum factors such as types of solid waste to include special waste, amount/volume of waste, distance of the transfer station to the waste management facility, capacity or type of LGU constituency, cost of construction, cost of management, and type of technology. With respect to utility rates set by municipalities, a municipality has the right to classify consumers under reasonable classifications based upon factors such as the cost of service, the purpose for which the service or the product is received, the quantity or the amount received, the different character of the service furnished, the time of its use or any other matter which presents a substantial difference as a ground of distinction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><blockquote>[A] lack of uniformity in the rate charged is not necessarily unlawful discrimination. The establishment of classifications and the charging of different rates for the several classes is not unreasonable and does not violate the requirements of equality and uniformity. Discrimination to be unlawful must draw an unfair line or strike an unfair balance between those in like circumstances having equal rights and privileges. Discrimination with respect to rates charged does not vitiate unless it is arbitrary and without a reasonable fact basis or justification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup><br></blockquote>On top of an unreasonable classification, the penalty clause of Ordinance No. SP-2235, which states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Penalty Clause</i> – A penalty of 25% of the garbage fee due plus an interest of 2% per month or a fraction thereof (interest) shall be charged against a household owner who refuses to pay the garbage fee herein imposed.<br></blockquote>lacks the limitation required by Section 168 of the LGC, which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 168. <i>Surcharges and Penalties on Unpaid Taxes, Fees, or Charges</i>. – The <i>sanggunian</i> may impose a surcharge not exceeding twenty-five (25%) of the amount of taxes, fees or charges not paid on time and an interest at the rate not exceeding two percent (2%) per month of the unpaid taxes, fees or charges including surcharges, until such amount is fully paid but <b>in no case shall the total interest on the unpaid amount or portion thereof exceed thirty-six (36) months</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Finally, on the issue of publication of the two challenged ordinances.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the garbage fee was collected even if the required publication of its approval had not yet elapsed. He notes that he paid his realty tax on January 7, 2014 which already included the garbage fee. Respondents counter that if the law provides for its own effectivity, publication in the Official Gazette is not necessary so long as it is not penal in nature. Allegedly, Ordinance No. SP-2095 took effect after its publication while Ordinance No. SP-2235 became effective after its approval on December 26, 2013.<br><br>The pertinent provisions of the LGC state:<br><blockquote>SECTION 59. <i>Effectivity of Ordinances or Resolutions</i>. – (a) <b>Unless otherwise stated in the ordinance</b> or the resolution approving the local development plan and public investment program, <b>the same shall take effect after ten (10) days from the date a copy thereof is posted</b> in a bulletin board at the entrance of the provincial capitol or city, municipal, or barangay hall, as the case may be, and in at least two (2) other conspicuous places in the local government unit concerned.<br><br>(b) The secretary to the sanggunian concerned shall cause the posting of an ordinance or resolution in the bulletin board at the entrance of the provincial capitol and the city, municipal, or barangay hall in at least two (2) conspicuous places in the local government unit concerned not later than five (5) days after approval thereof.<br><br>The text of the ordinance or resolution shall be disseminated and posted in Filipino or English and in the language or dialect understood by the majority of the people in the local government unit concerned, and the secretary to the sanggunian shall record such fact in a book kept for the purpose, stating the dates of approval and posting.<br><br>(c) The gist of all ordinances with penal sanctions shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the province where the local legislative body concerned belongs. In the absence of any newspaper of general circulation within the province, posting of such ordinances shall be made in all municipalities and cities of the province where the sanggunian of origin is situated.<br><br>(d) In the case of highly urbanized and independent component cities, the main features of the ordinance or resolution duly enacted or adopted shall, <b>in addition to being posted, be published once in a local newspaper of general circulation within the city: Provided, That in the absence thereof the ordinance or resolution shall be published in any newspaper of general circulation</b>.<br><br>SECTION 188. <i>Publication of Tax Ordinances and Revenue Measures</i>. – <b>Within ten (10) days after their approval</b>, certified true copies of all provincial, city, and municipal tax ordinances or revenue measures shall be <b>published in full for three (3) consecutive days in a newspaper of local circulation</b>: Provided, however, That in provinces, cities and municipalities where there are no newspapers of local circulation, the same may be posted in at least two (2) conspicuous and publicly accessible places. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On October 17, 2011, respondent Quezon City Council enacted Ordinance No. SP-2095, which provides that it would take effect after its publication in a newspaper of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> On the other hand, Ordinance No. SP-2235, which was passed by the City Council on December 16, 2013, provides that it would be effective upon its approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> Ten (10) days after its enactment, or on December 26, 2013, respondent City Mayor approved the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup><br><br>The case records are bereft of any evidence to prove petitioner’s negative allegation that respondents did not comply with the posting and publication requirements of the law.
