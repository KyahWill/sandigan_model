				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The lone issue for resolution in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure (<i>Rules</i>) with prayer for the issuance of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order is the applicability of Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules in criminal cases.

In both issues, petitioners vehemently assert that respondent trial court has no more jurisdiction to order the execution of judgment on the basis of Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules.<br><br>We consider the issues separately.<br><br><i>Prescription of Penalty</i><br><br>With respect to the penalty of imprisonment, Act No. 3815, or the Revised Penal Code (<i>RPC</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> governs. Articles 92 and 93 of which provide:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 92. <i>When and How Penalties Prescribe.</i> - The penalties imposed by final sentence prescribe as follows:<br><blockquote>1. Death and reclusion perpetua, in twenty years;<br>2. Other afflictive penalties, in fifteen years;<br>3. Correctional penalties, in ten years; with the exception of the penalty of arresto mayor, which prescribes in five years;<br>4. Light penalties, in one year.</blockquote><br>ARTICLE 93. Computation of the Prescription of Penalties.- The period of prescription of penalties shall commence to run from the date when the culprit should evade the service of his sentence, and it shall be interrupted if the defendant should give himself up, be captured, should go to some foreign country with which this Government has no extradition treaty, or should commit another crime before the expiration of the period of prescription.</blockquote><br>As early as 1952, in <i>Infante v. Provincial Warden of Negros Occidental,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court already opined that evasion of service of sentence is an essential element of prescription of penalties. Later, <i>Tanega v. Masakayan, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> expounded on the rule that the culprit should escape during the term of imprisonment in order for prescription of penalty imposed by final sentence to commence to run, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The period of prescription of penalties- so the succeeding Article 93 provides - "shall commence to run from the date when the culprit should <i>evade the service of his sentence</i>."<br><br>What then is the concept of evasion of service of sentence? Article 157 of the Revised Penal Code furnishes the ready answer. Says Article 157:<br><blockquote>ART. 157. <i>Evasion of service of sentence.</i> - The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum periods shall be imposed upon any convict who shall evade service of his sentence by escaping during the term of his imprisonment by reason of final judgment. However, if such evasion or escape shall have taken place by means of unlawful entry, by breaking doors, windows, gates, walls, roofs, or floors, or by using picklocks, false keys, disguise, deceit, violence or intimidation, or through connivance with other convicts or employees of the penal institution, the penalty shall be prision correccional in its maximum period.<br><br>Elements of evasion of service of sentence are: (1) the offender is a <i>convict</i> by final judgment; (2) he "is <i>serving</i> his sentence which consists in deprivation of liberty"; and (3) he evades service of sentence by <i>escaping</i> during the term of his sentence. This must be so. For, by the express terms of the statute, a convict evades "service of his sentence" by "<i>escaping </i>during the term of his imprisonment by reason of final judgment." That escape should take place while serving sentence, is emphasized by the provisions of the second sentence of Article 157 which provides for a higher penalty if such "<i>evasion</i> or <i>escape</i> shall have taken place by means of unlawful entry, by breaking doors, windows, gates, walls, roofs, or floors, or by using picklocks, false keys, disguise, deceit, violence or intimidation, or through connivance with other convicts or employees of the <i>penal institution,</i> * * *" Indeed, evasion of sentence is but another expression of the term "jail breaking."<br></blockquote>A dig into legal history confirms the views just expressed. The Penal Code of Spain of 1870 in its Article 134 - from whence Articles 92 and 93 of the present Revised Penal Code originated- reads:<br><blockquote>"Las penas impuestas por sentencia firme prescriben: Las de muerte y cadena perpetua, a los veinte años.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Las leves, al año.<br><br>El tiempo de esta prescripcion comenzara a correr desde el dia en que se notifique personalmente al reo la sentencia firme, o desde el quebrantamiento de la condena, si hubiera esta comenzado a cumplirse. * * *"</blockquote>Note that in the present Article 93 the words "desde el dia en que se notifique personalmente al reo la sentencia firme", written in the old code, were deleted. The omission is significant. What remains reproduced in Article 93 of the Revised Penal Code is solely "quebrantamiento de Ia condena". And, "quebrantamiento" or "evasion" means <i>escape.</i> Reason dictates that one can escape only after he has started service of sentence.<br><br>Even under the old law, Viada emphasizes, where the penalty consists of imprisonment, prescription shall only begin to run when he escapes from confinement. Says Viada:<br><blockquote>"El tiempo de la prescripcion empieza a contarse desde el dia en que ha tenido Iugar la notificacion personal de la sentencia firme al reo: el Codigo de 1850 no expresaba que la notificacion hubiese de ser personal, pues en su art. 126 se consigna que el termino de Ia prescripcion se cuenta desde que <i>se notifique</i> la sentencia, causa de la ejecutoria en que se imponga le pena respectiva. <i>Luego ausente el reo, ya no podra prescribir hoy Ia pena, pues que Ia notificacion personal no puede ser sup/ida por Ia notificacion hecha en estrados. Dada la imprescindible necesidad del requisito de la notificacion personal, es obvio que en las penas que consisten en privacion de libertad solo podra existir Ia prescripcion quebrantando el reo Ia condena</i>, pues que si no se hallare ya preso pre­ventivamente, debera siempre procederse a su encerrarniento en el acto de serle notificada personalmente la sentencia."<br></blockquote>We, therefore, rule that for prescription of penalty of imprisonment imposed by final sentence to commence to run, the culprit should escape during the term of such imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Following <i>Tanega, Del Castillo v. Hon. Torrecampo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> held that one who has not been committed to prison cannot be said to have escaped therefrom. We agree with the position of the Solicitor General that "escape" in legal parlance and for purposes of Articles 93 and 157 of the RPC means unlawful departure of prisoner from the limits of his custody.<br><br>Of more recent vintage is Our pronouncements in <i>Pangan v. Hon. Gatbalite</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which cited <i>Tanega</i> and <i>Del Castillo</i>, that the prescription of penalties found in Article 93 of the RPC applies only to those who are convicted by final judgment and are serving sentence which consists in deprivation of liberty, and that the period for prescription of penalties begins only when the convict evades service of sentence by escaping during the term of his sentence.<br><br>Applying existing jurisprudence in this case, the Court, therefore, rules against petitioners. For the longest time, they were never brought to prison or placed in confinement despite being sentenced to imprisonment by final judgment. Prescription of penalty of imprisonment does not run in their favor. Needless to state, respondent trial court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in assuming jurisdiction over the motion for execution and in eventually granting the same.<br><br><i>Extinction of Civil Liability</i><br><br>The treatment of petitioners' civil liability arising from the offense committed is different.<br><br>Elementary is the rule that every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> We said in one case:<br><br><blockquote>It bears repeating that "an offense as a general rule causes two (2) classes of injuries - the first is the social injury produced by the criminal act which is sought to be repaired thru the imposition of the corresponding penalty and the second is the personal injury caused to the victim of the crime which injury is sought to be compensated thru indemnity, which is civil in nature." (<i>Ramos v. Gonong</i>, 72 SCRA 559). As early as 1913, this Court in <i>US. v. Heery</i> (25 Phil. 600) made it clear that the civil liability of the accused is not part of the penalty for the crime committed. It is <i>personal</i> to the victim. x x x.</blockquote><br>Under Article 112 of the RPC, civil liability established in Articles 100,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> 101,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 102,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and 103<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of the Code shall be extinguished in the same manner as other obligations, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Law. Since the Civil Code is the governing law, the provisions of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Section 6, Rule 39 thereof, is applicable. It states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Execution by motion or by independent action. </i>- A final and executory judgment or order may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry. After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action. The revived judgment may also be enforced by motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry and thereafter by action before it is barred by the statute of limitations. (6a)</blockquote><br>Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules must be read in conjunction with<br><br><blockquote>Articles 1144 (3) and 1152 of the Civil Code, which provide:<br><br>Art. 1144. The following actions must be brought within ten years from the time the right of action accrues:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) Upon a judgment<br><br>Art. 1152. The period for prescription of actions to demand the fulfillment of obligations declared by a judgment commences from the time the judgment became final.<br></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, there are two (2) modes of enforcing a final and executory judgment or order: through motion or by independent action.<br><br><blockquote>These two modes of execution are available depending on the timing when the judgment creditor invoked its right to enforce the court's judgment. <b>Execution by motion is only available if the enforcement of the judgment was sought within five (5) years from the date of its entry</b>. On the other hand, execution by independent action is mandatory if the five-year prescriptive period for execution by motion had already elapsed. However, for execution by independent action to prosper - the Rules impose another limitation - the action must be filed before it is barred by the statute of limitations which, under the Civil Code, is ten (10) years from the finality of the judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>An action for revival of judgment is not intended to reopen any issue affecting the merits of the case or the propriety or correctness of the first judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The purpose is not to re-examine and re-try issues already decided but to revive the judgment; its cause of action is the judgment itself and not the merits of the original action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, being a mere right of action, the judgment sought to be revived is subject to defenses and counterclaims like matters of jurisdiction and those arising after the finality of the first judgment or which may have arisen subsequent to the date it became effective such as prescription, payment, or counterclaims arising out of transactions not connected with the former controversy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Once a judgment becomes final, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to a writ of execution the issuance of which is the trial court's ministerial duty, compellable by mandamus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Yet, a writ issued after the expiration of the period is null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The limitation that a judgment be enforced by execution within the stated period, otherwise it loses efficacy, goes to the very jurisdiction of the court. Failure to object to a writ issued after such period does not validate it, for the reason that jurisdiction of courts is solely conferred by law and not by express or implied will of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, jurisprudence is replete with a number of exceptions wherein the Court, on meritorious grounds, allowed execution of judgment despite non-observance of the time bar. In <i>Lancita, et al. v. Magbanua, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> it was held:<br><br><blockquote>In computing the time limited for suing out an execution, although there is authority to the contrary, the general rule is that there should not be included the time when execution is stayed, either by agreement of the parties for a definite time, by injunction, by the taking of an appeal or writ of error so as to operate as a supersedeas, by the death of a party, or otherwise. Any interruption or delay occasioned by the debtor will extend the time within which the writ may be issued without <i>scire facias</i>. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the demands of justice and fairness were contemplated in the following instances: dilatory tactics and legal maneuverings of the judgment obligor which redounded to its benefit;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> agreement of the parties to defer or suspend the enforcement of the judgment;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> strict application of the rules would result in injustice to the prevailing party to whom no fault could be attributed but relaxation thereof would cause no prejudice to the judgment obligor who did not question the judgment sought to be executed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and the satisfaction of the judgment was already beyond the control of the prevailing party as he did what he was supposed to do.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Essentially, We allowed execution even after the prescribed period elapsed when the delay is caused or occasioned by actions of the judgment debtor and/or is incurred for his benefit or advantage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, it is obvious that the heirs of Atty. Roblete did not file a motion for execution within the five-year period or an action to revive the judgment within the ten-year period. Worse, other than the bare allegation that the judgment has not been enforced because the public prosecutor has not acted on the request to file a motion for execution, no persuasive and compelling reason was presented to warrant the exercise of Our equity jurisdiction. Unfortunately for private respondent Roblete, the instant case does not fall within the exceptions afore-stated. It cannot be claimed that the delay in execution was entirely beyond their control or that petitioners have any hand in causing the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As regards the civil aspect of a criminal case is concerned, it is apt to point that —<br><br><blockquote>Litigants represented by counsel should not expect that all they need to do is sit back and relax, and await the outcome of their case. They should give the necessary assistance to their counsel, for at stake is their interest in the case. While lawyers are expected to exercise a reasonable degree of diligence and competence in handling cases for their clients, the realities of law practice as well as certain fortuitous events sometimes make it almost physically impossible for lawyers to be immediately updated on a particular client's case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>Aside from the civil indemnity arising from the crime, costs and incidental expenses of the suit are part of the judgment and it is incumbent upon the prevailing party in whose favor they are awarded to submit forthwith the itemized bill to the clerk of court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Manifestly, the heirs of Atty. Roblete failed to do so. Their indifference, if not negligence, is indicative of lack of interest in executing the decision rendered in their favor. To remind, the purpose of the law in prescribing time limitations for executing judgments or orders is to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Indeed, inaction may be construed as a waiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>To close, the Court cannot help but impress that this case could have been averted had the lower court been a competent dispenser of justice. It is opportune to remind judges that once a judgment of conviction becomes final and executory, the trial court has the ministerial duty to immediately execute the penalty of imprisonment and/or pecuniary penalty (fine). A motion to execute judgment of conviction is not necessary. With respect to the penalty of imprisonment, the trial court should cancel the bail bond and issue a warrant of arrest, if the accused is not yet under detention. If the convicted accused is already under detention by virtue of the warrant of arrest issued, the trial court should immediately issue the corresponding <i>mittimus</i> or commitment order for the immediate transfer of the accused to the National Penitentiary to serve his sentence, if the penalty imposed requires the service of sentence in the National Penitentiary. The commitment order should state that an appeal had been filed, but the same had been withdrawn/dismissed/decided with finality.<br><br>If aside from the penalty of imprisonment the penalty of fine is likewise imposed, the trial court should issue at once an order requiring the payment of fine within a reasonable period of time and, in case of non­payment and subsidiary imprisonment is imposed, he should likewise serve the subsidiary imprisonment. If, however, the penalty is only fine and the judgment has become final and executory, an order should be issued by the trial court at once for the payment of the fine. And in case of non-payment, the bail bond previously issued for his provisional liberty should be cancelled and a warrant of arrest should be issued to serve the subsidiary imprisonment, if there is any.<br><br>In cases where the accused is a detention prisoner, i.e., those convicted of capital offenses or convicted of non-capital offenses where bail is denied, or refused to post bail, a <i>mittimus</i> or commitment order should be immediately issued after the promulgation of judgment by the trial court as long as the penalty imposed requires the service of sentence in the National Penitentiary. The filing of a motion for reconsideration, motion for new trial, or notice of appeal should not stop the lower court from performing its ministerial duty in issuing the commitment order, unless a special order has been issued by the Court in specific cases - to the effect that the convicted accused shall remain under detention in the provincial jail or city jail while the motion is being heard or resolved.<br><br>In so far as the civil liability arising from the offense is concerned, a motion for execution should be filed in accordance with Section 6, Rule 39 of the<i> Rules</i> and existing jurisprudence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing considered, the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
