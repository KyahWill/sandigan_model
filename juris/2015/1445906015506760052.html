She also discussed:<br><blockquote><i>The phrase "who are employed in the government service as of October 31 of the same year" which is merely reproduced by Rep. Act No. 8441 from Section 1 of Rep.

Thus, a strict interpretation of the law would exclude all retired Justices from its coverage.<br><br>However, in clear implementation of the constitutionally mandated fiscal autonomy of the Judiciary and the policy of liberal interpretation of retirement laws and other laws granting monetary benefits to retired Justices</i>, the Court approved the request of retired Supreme Court and Court of Appeals Justices for increase/adjustment of their December 1998 pensions in the Resolution of 28 March 2000 in A.M. No. 99-7-01-SC. In that Resolution, the Court directed the Fiscal Division of the Fiscal Management and Budget Office (FMBO) that "the increase/adjustment in these benefits effective December 1998 shall be divided by twelve (12) months and the quotient (the resulting amount) shall be released and tacked to their monthly pensions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated January 16, 2001, this court granted the request of Former Presiding Justice Salome A.

She discussed that the grant of the year-end bonus and cash gift to retired justices was based on A.M. No. 91-8-225-CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which interpreted Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 910 in the following manner:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3-a of the retirement law is sufficiently clear that whenever the salary of an incumbent Justice is increased, such increased salary shall be deemed to be the salary or the retirement pension which a Justice who retired was receiving at the time of his cessation in office. In other words, the increased salary of the incumbent becomes the basis of the salary of the retiree at the time of his cessation in office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>In 1997, Republic Act No. 8441 was passed. It states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Section 1 of Republic Act No. 6686 is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.

Thus, retired judges of the first- and second-level courts were not entitled to the annual year-end bonus and cash gift.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>At present, Republic Act No. 9946 has amended Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 910 to state "retired members of the judiciary" instead of "justices of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals." From the provision of law, Court of Tax Appeals justices are now included.<br><br>Considering that incumbent justices receive the annual year-end bonus and cash gift every December and that such grant is deemed an increase in the monthly salary for December, retired members of the judiciary are entitled to receive the same amount, with the caveat that this grant is only for the period when they have yet to receive their monthly pensions from this court.<br><br>The five-year lump sum amount that a member of the judiciary receives at the time of retirement does not include the year-end bonus and cash gift because doing so would mean that the retirees benefit earlier than the incumbents. However, once the retirees receive their monthly pensions, the equivalent of the year-end bonus and cash gift shall form part of their pension and be released to them at the same time that the incumbents receive the year-end bonus and cash gift.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Further, retirement benefits are liberally construed in favor of the retiree. In A.M. No. 14155-Ret.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this court discussed the rationale for the grant of retirement benefits:<br><blockquote>Retirement laws are social legislation. In general, retirement laws provide security to the elderly who have given their prime years in employment whether in the private sector or in government. These laws ensure the welfare of individuals who are approaching their twilight years and have limited opportunities for productive employment that give them a steady income stream. . . .<br><br>In government, lucrative retirement benefits are used as an incentive mechanism to encourage competent individuals to have careers in government. This Court often states:<br><blockquote>[Retirement benefits receivable by public employees are valuable parts of the consideration for entrance into and continuation in public office or employment. They serve a public purpose and a primary objective in establishing them is <b>to induce competent persons to enter and remain in public employment and render faithful and efficient service while so employed</b>. (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>. . . On several occasions, this Court has liberally interpreted retirement laws in keeping with its purpose. In <i>Government Service Insurance System v. De Leon</i>:<br><blockquote>Retirement laws, in particular, are liberally construed in favor of the retiree because their objective is to provide for the retiree's sustenance and, hopefully, even comfort, when he no longer has the capability to earn a livelihood. The liberal approach aims to achieve the humanitarian purposes of the law in order that efficiency, security, and well-being of government employees may be enhanced. Indeed, retirement laws are liberally construed and administered in favor of the persons intended to be benefited, and all doubts are resolved in favor of the retiree to achieve their humanitarian purpose.<br></blockquote>This general principle for retirement benefits applies to members of the Judiciary. However, Congress made a special law specifically for retiring justices and judges. This law on "retirement pensions of Justices arise[s] from the package of protections given by the Constitution to guarantee and preserve the independence of the Judiciary." Aside from guaranteeing judicial independence, a separate retirement law for justices and judges is designed to attract intelligent members of the Bar to join the Judiciary. It compensates for the opportunity cost of having profitable private practices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">V<br></div><br>Although Republic Act No. 6686 as amended by Republic Act No. 8441, Department of Budget and Management Budget Circular Nos. 2003-2 and 2010-1, and Commission on Audit Circular No. 2012-001 do not include retirees, this court's interpretation of the retirement laws is part of its fiscal autonomy.<br><br>Fiscal autonomy has been defined as "freedom from outside control."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It guarantees full flexibility in the utilization of funds and resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The Constitution grants fiscal autonomy to the judiciary to ensure its independence. As explained in <i>Bengzon v. Drilon</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>The Judiciary, the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman must have the independence and flexibility needed in the discharge of their constitutional duties. The imposition of restrictions and constraints on the manner the independent constitutional offices allocate and utilize the funds appropriated for their operations is anathema to fiscal autonomy and violative not only of the express mandate of the Constitution but especially as regards the Supreme Court, of the independence and separation of powers upon which the entire fabric of our constitutional system is based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>In A.M. No. 11-7-10-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this court discussed that one aspect of the constitutional grant of fiscal autonomy is administrative supervision over courts and its personnel, thus:<br><blockquote>The Judiciary's fiscal autonomy is realized through the actions of the Chief Justice, as its head, and of the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>, in the exercise of administrative control and supervision of the courts and its personnel. . . . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Thus, under the guarantees of the Judiciary's fiscal autonomy and its independence, the Chief Justice and the Court <i>En Banc</i> determine and decide the <i>who, what, where, when</i>[,] and <i>how</i> of the privileges and benefits they extend to justices, judges, court officials and court personnel within the parameters of the Court's granted power; they determine the terms, conditions and restrictions of the grant as grantor.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>. . . Any kind of interference on how these retirement privileges and benefits are exercised and availed of, not only violates the fiscal autonomy and independence of the Judiciary, but also encroaches upon the constitutional duty and privilege of the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court En Banc to manage the Judiciary's own affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, the power to decide "who, what, where, when[,] and how"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to grant retirement benefits is within this court's exercise of administrative supervision over courts and its personnel. Any outside interference would violate this court's fiscal autonomy.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9946 specifies what is included in the pension of retired members of the judiciary as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. Upon retirement, a Justice of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan or of the Court of Tax Appeals, or a Judge of the regional trial court, metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court in cities, municipal trial court, municipal circuit trial court, shari'a district court, shari'a circuit court, or any other court hereafter established <i>shall be automatically entitled to a lump sum of five (5) years' gratuity computed on the basis of the highest monthly salary plus the highest monthly aggregate of transportation, representation and other allowances such as personal economic relief allowance (PERA) and additional compensation allowance he/she was receiving on the date of his/her retirement and thereafter upon survival after the expiration of five (5) years, to further annuity payable monthly during the residue of his/her natural life pursuant to Section 1 hereof</i>[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The enumeration under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9946 admittedly does not include the year-end bonus and cash gift. Nevertheless, the interpretation of retirement laws is part of this court's fiscal autonomy. In addition, the grant of the year-end bonus and cash gift is based on A.M. No. 91-8-225-CA and A.M. No. 99-7-01-SC.<br><br><center>VI<br></center><br>Republic Act No. 9282 elevated the rank of a Court of Tax Appeals justice to that of a Court of Appeals justice. Section 1 of Republic Act No. 9282 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Court; Justices; Qualifications; Salary; Tenure. - <i>There is hereby created a Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) which shall be of the same level as the Court of Appeals</i>, possessing all the inherent powers of a Court of Justice, and shall consist of a Presiding Justice and five (5) Associate Justices. . . . <i>They shall have the same qualifications, rank, category, salary, emoluments and other privileges, be subject to the same inhibitions and disqualifications, and enjoy the same retirement and other benefits as those provided for under existing laws for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals</i>.<br><br>Whenever the salaries of the Presiding Justice and the Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals are increased, such increases in salaries shall be deemed correspondingly extended to and enjoyed by the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the CTA. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Since part of the retirement benefits granted to the retired Court of Appeals justices is the annual year-end bonus and cash gift pending receipt of monthly pensions, retired Court of Tax Appeals justices are entitled to the same.<br><br>Considering that the payment of the year-end bonus and cash gift is deemed part of the retirement benefits of retired members of this court, the Court of Appeals, the Court of Tax Appeals, and the Sandiganbayan, the funds for this purpose should come from the appropriations for Pension Benefits.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this court resolves to <b>GRANT</b> the request of Court of Tax Appeals Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario that retired Court of Tax Appeals Justices Ernesto D. Acosta and Olga Palanca-Enriquez shall be given their annual year-end bonus and cash gift while they have yet to receive their monthly pensions from this court.
