As such, compliance with the requirements of procedural and substantive due process must be observed. However, considering that Halili was dismissed without prior notice and hearing, and absent a valid cause, the LA found that she was illegally dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, respondents filed their appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> before the NLRC.<br><br><center><b>The NLRC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated July 30, 2008, the NLRC affirmed the LA's ruling <i>in toto</i>. It also found that Halili's consent was vitiated when JFCI led her to believe that the termination clause was a standard item to conform to the format of JFCI contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It further held that JFCI cannot simply rely on the termination clause in dismissing Halili, but instead on a valid cause and with observance of procedural due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Moreover, the NLRC debunked respondents' new theory that Halili was terminated for loss of trust and confidence for having been raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Unperturbed, respondents moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which the NLRC denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated November 25, 2008, prompting the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated December 23, 2010, the CA reversed the NLRC ruling, attributing to it grave abuse of discretion in affirming the illegality of Halili's dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>It observed that while there was an initial apprehension on the part of Halili with respect to the terms of her employment contract, she nonetheless voluntarily gave her consent thereto and signed the same. As such, the contract has the force of law and the stipulations contained therein must be observed. Consequently, the termination clause, among others, was validly enforced by JFCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>At odds with the CA's ruling, Halili seeks its reversal through the present petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The primary issue in this case is whether or not the CA erred in granting respondents' petition for <i>certiorari</i>, thereby validating the termination of Halili's employment.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Applicable laws form part of, and are read into, contracts without need for any express reference thereto;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> more so, when it pertains to a labor contract which is imbued with public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Each contract thus contains not only what was explicitly stipulated therein, but also the statutory provisions that have any bearing on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that the contract entered into by JFCI and Halili is a fixed-term employment contract, <b>covering a period of one (1) year</b>. The peculiar feature, however, of this contract lies in its termination clause which reads that either party may terminate the same "<b>at anytime by giving four (4) weeks written notice</b>":<br><blockquote>WRITTEN AGREEMENT REGARDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF [HALILI] BY [JFCI] AS CONSULTANT PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR AFTERCARE<br><br>This Agreement is made between [JFCI] and [Halili], for mutual consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is acknowledged by the parties, who agree:<br><br>1. Term. [Halili] is independently contracted by JFCI <b>to serve as Consultant Program Coordinator for Aftercare of JFCI for a contracted period of 46 weeks within one year, beginning May 15, 2006 and ending May 14, 2007</b>, with said term being capable of extension by mutual review and written agreement of both parties.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>5. Termination of Agreement. Either party may terminate this agreement at anytime by giving four weeks written notice.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>x x x x (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>While said clause is silent on the requirement of a legal cause for the same to be operative, the fundamental principle — as above-stated — is that the law is read into every contract. Hence, the contract's termination clause should not be interpreted as a form of blanket-license by which each of the parties may just abdicate the contract at will. Rather, it is a clause which allows any of the parties to pre-terminate the employment contract within the stipulated fixed-term period of one year, <b><u>provided</u></b> that the party invoking the same has: (<b><u><i>a</i></u></b>) a legal cause for terminating it; and (<b><i><u>b</u></i></b>) notifies the other party in writing four (4) weeks prior to the intended date of termination.<br><br>That the parties had intended to dispense with the need for a legal cause for the termination clause to be operative does not sufficiently appear in this case. Had they so intended, then the contract should have so indicated, as in <i>Price v. Innodata Phils.</i>, Inc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which contractual provision explicitly allowing the employer to pre-terminate the same "with or without cause" was, however, struck down as invalid:<br><blockquote>As a final observation, the Court also takes note of several other provisions in petitioners' employment contracts that display utter disregard for their security of tenure. Despite fixing a period or term of employment, <i>i.e.</i>, one year, INNODATA reserved the right to pre-terminate petitioners' employment under the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>6.1 x x x Further should the Company have no more need for the EMPLOYEE'S services on account of completion of the project, lack of work (sic) business losses, introduction of new production processes and techniques, which will negate the need for personnel, and/or overstafiing, this contract maybe pre-terminated by the EMPLOYER upon giving of three (3) days notice to the employee.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>6.4 The EMPLOYEE or the EMPLOYER may pre-terminate this CONTRACT, <b><u>with or without cause</u></b>, by giving at least Fifteen - (15) [day] notice to that effect. Provided, that such pre-termination shall be effective only upon issuance of the appropriate clearance in favor of the said EMPLOYEE.<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the afore-quoted provisions, petitioners have no right at all to expect security of tenure, even for the supposedly one-year period of employment provided in their contracts, because they can still be pre-terminated (1) upon the completion of an unspecified project; or (2) <b><u>with or without cause</u></b>, for as long as they are given a three-day notice. <b><u>Such contract provisions are repugnant to the basic tenet in labor law that no employee may be terminated except for just or authorized cause.</u></b><br><br>Under Section 3, Article XVI of the Constitution, it is the policy of the State to assure the workers of security of tenure and free them from the bondage of uncertainty of tenure woven by some employers into their contracts of employment. This was exactly the purpose of the legislators in drafting Article 280 of the Labor Code - to prevent the circumvention by unscrupulous employers of the employee's right to be secure in his tenure by indiscriminately and completely ruling out all written and oral agreements inconsistent with the concept of regular employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Here, it is clear that the first requisite of legal cause was not complied with by JFCI. No just or authorized cause was proven by substantial evidence in support of its invocation of the termination clause stated in its contract with Halili. As such, the pre-termination of the contract was infirm. Thus, considering further that respondents' argument on its purported loss of trust and confidence in Halili cannot be taken into account at this stage since it was belatedly raised for the first time on appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling that Halili's dismissal was illegal. The CA's issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> was perforce improper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
