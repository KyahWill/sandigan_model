It added that in approving the withdrawal of Nippon's petition for review, it exercised its discretionary authority under Section 3, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court after due consideration of the reasons proffered by Nippon, namely: (<i>a</i>) that the parties had already arrived at a reasonable settlement of the issues; (<i>b</i>) further legal and related costs would be avoided; and (<i>c</i>) the court's time and resources would be saved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, the CIR elevated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> its case to the CTA <i>En Banc</i>. <br><br><center><b>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated December 18, 2013, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> affirmed the July 31, 2012 Resolution of the CTA Division granting Nippon's motion to withdraw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It debunked the CIR's assertions that Nippon failed to comply with the requirements set forth in RMC No. 49-03 - <i>i.e.</i>, that Nippon failed to notify the BIR that it agreed with its findings and to file the necessary motion before the CTA Division prior to the promulgation of its Decision -noting that RMC No. 49-03 did not expressly require a taxpayer to inform the BIR of its assent nor prescribe a definite period for filing a motion to withdraw. It also observed that the CIR did not deny the existence and issuance of the July 27, 2011 Tax Credit Certificate. In this regard, the same may be taken judicial notice of, and the need for its formal offer dispensed with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The CIR moved for partial reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which was, however, denied by the CTA <i>En Banc</i> in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated June 10, 2014; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue in this case is whether the CTA properly granted Nippon's motion to withdraw.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>A perusal of the Revised Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (RRCTA) reveals the lack of provisions governing the procedure for the withdrawal of pending appeals before the CTA. Hence, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 1 of the RRCTA, the Rules of Court shall suppletorily apply:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. Applicability of the Rules of Court. - The Rules of Court in the Philippines shall apply suppletorily to these Rules.<br></blockquote>Rule 50 of the Rules of Court - an adjunct rule to the appellate procedure in the CA under Rules 42, 43, 44, and 46 of the Rules of Court which are equally adopted in the RRCTA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> - states that when the case is deemed submitted for resolution, withdrawal of appeals made after the filing of the appellee's brief may still be allowed in the discretion of the court:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 50 <br>DISMISSAL OF APPEAL<br></center><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Section 3. <i>Withdrawal of appeal</i>. â€” An appeal may be withdrawn as of right at any time before the filing of the appellee's brief. <b>Thereafter, the withdrawal may be allowed in the discretion of the court.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Impelled by the BIR's supervening issuance of the July 27, 2011 Tax Credit Certificate, Nippon filed a motion to withdraw the case, proffering that:<br><blockquote>Having arrived at a reasonable settlement of the issues with the [CIR]/BIR, and to avoid incurring further legal and related costs, not to mention the time and resources of [the CTA], [Nippon] most respectfully moves for the withdrawal of its Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>Finding the aforementioned grounds to be justified, the CTA Division allowed the withdrawal of Nippon's appeal thereby ordering the case closed and terminated, notwithstanding the fact that the said motion was filed after the promulgation of its August 10, 2011 Decision.<br><br>While it is true that the CTA Division has the prerogative to grant a motion to withdraw under the authority of the foregoing legal provisions, the attendant circumstances in this case should have incited it to act otherwise.<br><br>First, it should be pointed out that the August 10, 2011 Decision was rendered by the CTA Division after a full-blown hearing in which the parties had already ventilated their claims. Thus, the findings contained therein were the results of an exhaustive study of the pleadings and a judicious evaluation of the evidence submitted by the parties, as well as the report of the commissioned certified public accountant. In <i>Reyes v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court only noted, and did not grant, a motion to withdraw the petition filed after it had already acted on said petition, ratiocinating in the following wise:<br><blockquote>It may well be in order to remind petitioner that jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost upon the instance of the parties, but continues until the case is terminated. When petitioner filed her Petition for Certiorari jurisdiction vested in the Court and, in fact, the Court exercised such jurisdiction when it acted on the petition. Such jurisdiction cannot be lost by the unilateral withdrawal of the petition by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>The primary reason, however, that militates against the granting of the motion to withdraw is the fact that the CTA Division, in its August 10, 2011 Decision, had already determined that Nippon was only entitled to refund the reduced amount of <b>P2,614,296.84</b> since it failed to prove that the recipients of its services were non-residents "doing business outside the Philippines"; hence, Nippon's purported sales therefrom could not qualify as zero-rated sales, necessitating the reduction in the amount of refund claimed. Markedly different from this is the BIR's determination that Nippon should receive <b>P21,675,128.91</b> as per the July 27, 2011 Tax Credit Certificate, which is, in all, <b>P19,060,832.07</b> larger than the amount found due by the CTA Division. Therefore, as aptly pointed out by Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro during the deliberations on this case, the massive discrepancy alone between the administrative and judicial determinations of the amount to be refunded to Nippon should have already raised a red flag to the CTA Division. Clearly, the interest of the government, and, more significantly, the public, will be greatly prejudiced by the erroneous grant of refund - at a substantial amount at that - in favor of Nippon. Hence, under these circumstances, the CTA Division should not have granted the motion to withdraw.<br><br>In this relation, it deserves mentioning that the CIR is not estopped from assailing the validity of the July 27, 2011 Tax Credit Certificate which was issued by her subordinates in the BIR. In matters of taxation, the government cannot be estopped by the mistakes, errors or omissions of its agents for upon it depends the ability of the government to serve the people for whose benefit taxes are collected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court has observed that based on the records, Nippon's administrative claim for the first taxable quarter of 2002 which closed on March 31, 2002 was already time-barred<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> for being filed on <b>April 22, 2004</b>, or beyond the two (2)-year prescriptive period pursuant to Section 112(A)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. Although prescription was not raised as an issue, it is well-settled that if the pleadings or the evidence on record show that the claim is barred by prescription, the Court may <i>motu proprio</i> order its dismissal on said ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>All told, the CTA committed a reversible error in granting Nippon's motion to withdraw. The August 10, 2011 Decision of the CTA Division should therefore be reinstated, without prejudice, however, to the right of either party to appeal the same in accordance with the RRCTA.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
