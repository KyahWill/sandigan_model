Pardo (<i>Pardo</i>) executed in favor of Pangilinan a real estate mortgage (REM) over a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 135066 as a security for the payment of a loan in the amount of P200,000.00; that Pardo failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note with REM; that upon compliance with the statutory requirements, the mortgaged property was sold at public auction to Pangilinan as the highest bidder; that the one-year redemption period already elapsed without Pardo exercising the right to redeem the subject property; that the title over the lot was consolidated and transferred in the name of Pangilinan as evidenced by TCT No. 147777; and, that Pardo, her agents, and persons claiming rights under her failed and refused to vacate the subject premises despite several demands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2007, the trial court granted the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Notice to Vacate and Surrender Possession was issued by respondent Sheriff Rolando G.

The said Petition for Cancellation of Adverse Claim is yet to be resolved by Hon. Ma. Rosario B. Ragasa, Presiding Judge of RTC Branch 108, and here is [Pangilinan] filing yet another petition, this time for Writ of Possession;<br><br>8. Third-Party Claimant has already filed a complaint directly attacking the validity of [Pangilinan's] title and praying for, among other things, the annulment of TCT 1 Mill as having emanated from an illegal source, as well as the reinstatement of the former title, TCT 135066, in the name of PARDO, Third-Party Claimant's deceased aunt, benefactor and donor without all the liens and [encumbrances] caused to be annotated thereon by Petitioner x x x.<br><br>9. Third-Party Claimant is the rightful owner of the Subject Property and is entitled to its possession, not [Pangilinan] whose title TCT 147777 emanated from an illegal source and is therefore null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>In her Comment/Opposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Pangilinan relied on <i>Spouses Arquiza v.

On April 3, 2008, petitioner's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> was likewise denied.<br><br>Petitioner elevated the case to the appellate court. Nevertheless, the CA did not find any evidence that the trial court acted in a capricious and despotic manner or that the questioned Orders were issued by reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility. It opined that any question regarding the regularity and validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure sale, as well as the consequent cancellation of the writ of possession, is to be determined in a subsequent proceeding, pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> as amended by Act No. 4118,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and that such question should not be raised as a justification for opposing the issuance of the writ since the proceeding is heard <i>ex parte</i>.<br><br>The motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> filed by petitioner was denied; hence, this petition.<br><br>We deny.<br><br>In extrajudicial foreclosures of real estate mortgages, the issuance of a writ of possession is governed by Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended, which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7. In any sale made under the provisions of this Act, the purchaser may petition the Court of First Instance (Regional Trial Court) of the province or place where the property or any part thereof is situated, to give him possession thereof during the redemption period, furnishing bond in an amount equivalent to the use of the property for a period of twelve months, to indemnify the debtor in case it be shown that the sale was made without violating the mortgage or without complying with the requirements of this Act. Such petition shall be made under oath and filed in form of an <i>ex parte</i> motion in the registration or cadastral proceedings if the property is registered, or in special proceedings in the case of property registered under the Mortgage Law or under section one hundred and ninety-four of the Administrative Code, or of any other real property encumbered with a mortgage duly registered in the office of any register of deeds in accordance with any existing law, and in each case the clerk of the court shall, upon the filing of such petition, collect the fees specified in paragraph eleven of section one hundred and fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six, as amended by Act Numbered Twenty-eight hundred and sixty-six, and the court shall, upon approval of the bond, order that a writ of possession issue, addressed to the sheriff of the province in which the property is situated, who shall execute said order immediately.<br><br>Although the above provision clearly pertains to a writ of possession availed of and issued within the redemption period of the foreclosure sale, the same procedure also applies to a situation where a purchaser is seeking possession of the foreclosed property bought at the public auction sale <i>after</i> the redemption period has expired without redemption having been made. The only difference is that in the latter case, no bond is required therefor, as held in <i>China Banking Corporation v. Lozada</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>It is thus settled that the buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the absolute owner of the property purchased if it is not redeemed during the period of one year after the registration of the sale. As such, he is entitled to the possession of the said property and can demand it at any time following the consolidation of ownership in his name and the issuance to him of a new transfer certificate of title. <b>The buyer can in fact demand possession of the land even during the redemption period except that he has to post a bond in accordance with Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended. No such bond is required after the redemption period if the property is not redeemed.</b> x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Upon the expiration of the period to redeem and no redemption was made, the purchaser, as confirmed owner, has the absolute right to possess the land and the issuance of the writ of possession becomes a ministerial duty of the court upon proper application and proof of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>There is, however, an exception to the rule. Under Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the possession of the property shall be given to the purchaser or last redemptioner unless a third party is actually holding the property in a capacity adverse to the judgment obligor. Thus, the court's obligation to issue an <i>ex parte</i> writ of possession in favor of the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale ceases to be ministerial when there is a third party in possession of the property claiming a right adverse to that of the judgment debtor/mortgagor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In such a case, the issuance of the writ of possession ceases to be ex-parte and non-adversarial as the trial court must order a hearing to determine the nature of said possession, <i>i.e.</i>, whether or not possession of the subject property is under a claim averse to that of the judgment debtor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We repeatedly emphasize though that the exception provided under Section 33 contemplates a situation in which a third party holds the property by adverse title or right <i>vis-a-vis</i> the judgment debtor or mortgagor, such as that of a co-owner, agricultural tenant or usufructuary, who possesses the property in his or her own right, and is not merely the successor or transferee of the right of possession of another co-owner or the owner of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In this case, while it is undisputed that petitioner was in possession of the subject property, it cannot be said that his right to possess the same is by virtue of being a co-owner, agricultural tenant or usufructuary; nor is the claim to his right of possession analogous to the foregoing situations. What is clear is that he allegedly acquired the property from Pardo by reason of a donation <i>mortis causa</i>. He is, therefore, a transferee or successor-in-interest who merely stepped into the shoes of his aunt. He cannot assert that his right of possession is adverse to that of Pardo as he has no independent right of possession. Consequently, under legal contemplation, he cannot be considered as a "third party who is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment obligor." The trial court had the ministerial duty to issue, as it did issue, the possessory writ in favor of respondent Pangilinan. As it appeared, there was no reason for it to order the recall of the writ already issued.<br><br>Moreover, it is not amiss to point that the execution of Pardo of donation <i>mortis causa</i> in favor of petitioner does not immediately transfer title to the property to the latter. Considering that the alleged donation is one of <i>mortis causa</i>, the same partake of the nature of testamentary provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As such, said deed must be executed in accordance with the requisites on solemnities of wills and testaments under Articles 805<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and 806<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the New Civil Code; otherwise, the donation is void and would produce no effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Unless and until the alleged donation is probated, <i>i.e.</i>, proved and allowed in the proper court, no right to the subject property has been transmitted to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the foregoing considered, the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
