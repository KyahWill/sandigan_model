Their testimonies, as summarized by the Sandiganbayan, are as follows:<br><blockquote>Victor J. Patam, a policeman. He testified that on July 4, 2004 at 1:00 in the afternoon, he. with Domingo Bawalan, went to Barangay Litlit, Silang, Cavite, to attend the birthday party of his son's kumpadre. From Litlit, they then proceeded at 5:00 in the afternoon to the house of Edgardo Mamuyac for the birthday party of Mamuyac's son, where they had singing spree and a little drink. They stayed there until 11:00 in the evening.<br><br>Upon reaching Barangay Biclatan, General Trias, Cavite, Patam received a call from Reynaldo Santos who was at Mamuyac's place. Santos requested Patam to go back to Mamuyac's house which was already closed, as Santos had no companion there. Santos arrived late because he came from a follow-up operation in Maragondon, Cavite.<br><br>When Patam and Domingo returned to the place of Mamuyac, they saw Santos in front of his Space Gear van. After a little chat, Patam invited Santos and Domingo to go home. Domingo rode with Santos, while Patam took his own car. Santos and Domingo left ahead of him.<br><br>Upon reaching the boundary of Tamacan and Banay-banay, he saw the van of Santos parked at the side of the street behind another van whose owner he did not know. He likewise saw Ronnel Bawalan, the brother of Domingo, standing at their gate, looking at the direction of the vehicles parked.<br><br>Patam parked his car behind Santos' van and alighted therefrom. Immediately, Santos handed him a baby annalite, which according to Santos, he got from Mayor Ambagan's men. Patam placed the baby annalite at the driver's seat of his car. When he returned to where Santos was, the latter ordered the four apprehended men to line up at the other side of the street. Two of them put down their short firearms upon the order of Santos. After telling the group to step away from the firearms. Santos came near the firearms, but without touching them. Thereafter, Santos phoned Superintendent Cabillo and informed him of what happened.<br><br>While Santos was talking to Cabillo, somebody called Patam "<i>Kuya Taring</i>." Patam recognized him to be Alberto Angcanan. Patam told them to just stay put and they would help them after Cabillo had arrived. After a few minutes. Mayor Ambagan arrived.<br><br>Patam went near Mayor Ambagan and greeted him. The Mayor greeted him back, and asked who was at the other side. Patam told him that it was Reynaldo Santos, a policeman. Mayor Ambagan then told Santos, "<i>Rey, baka pwede namang pag-usapan nalin yan kung amiman yang problema.</i>" Santos replied, "<i>Mayor, wala na hong desisyon akong magagawa dito. Intayin niyo si GD. Siya na lang ang kakausapin ninyo.</i>" Repeatedly, the Mayor made the same request to Santos, but Santos gave him the same answer. Patam felt that the situation was heating up, so he asked Mayor Ambagan to go to the house of Patam's cousin, Miling Javier.<br><br>While Patam was pushing Mayor Ambagan, who was angry and cursing Santos, to Javier's house, Patam heard the first gunshot emanating from where he and the Mayor were, but did not see anything when he looked back. The Mayor wanted to go back to see what happened to his men. Patam also wanted to go back to his companions, so he left the Mayor with Alberto Angcanan and Rosendo Causaren. However, Patam's gun fell, thus, he instead proceeded to the house of his brother near the place of the incident. While he was already near his brother's house. Patam saw three men with long firearms - two at the back of his car and the other one in front of the MB 100 van. all firing towards the south direction where he left Rey. Upon reaching the house of his brother, he asked his niece Susan Patam to call the police. Patam was not able to get out of his brother's house anymore, because he was prevented by his mother and brother, as he might be suspected of being responsible for the killing. Patam called the chief of Police of General Trias. Cavite, Chief Inspector Portento, to fetch him because his life was in danger. On July 5, 2004, he executed a <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay and Karagdagang Salaysay</i>.<br><br>Ronnel Bawalan, brother of Domingo Bawalan and cousin-in-law of Reynaldo Santos, he testified that on July 5, 2004 at around 12:00 midnight, he parked his passenger jeepney at his garage, and prepared it for the next day's use. When he was about to sleep, at around 1:00 o'clock in the morning. Santos riding in his vehicle with Domingo, entered the garage. They asked if they could hire his jeepney the following day. When he agreed, Ronnel guided them from the garage to the road. While outside answering a call of nature. Ronnel looked towards the south direction and he saw Santos and Domingo about less than 100 meters from him park the van and alight from their vehicle. He also saw the car of Patam parked behind Santos' vehicle. He crossed the road and walked towards them. When he was already near them, he heard Santos saying to the four men from the van parked in front of Santos' vehicle. "<i>Dyan lang kayo, wag kayong aalis</i>." Upon hearing this, he went to Domingo and inquired why Santos was asking these men to get out of the van. Domingo told him that these men were carrying firearms.<br><br>While Ronnel and Domingo were standing at the right front side of the parked van. Ronnel heard a sound of a radio coming from the four men accosted by Santos. At that time, Santos was in the middle of the road, making a call from his cellphone. Thereafter, Mayor Ambagan with his bodyguards carrying long firearms arrived. Mayor Ambagan told Santos that they should just talk it out whatever the problem was.<br><br>When Domingo saw the Mayor, he directed Ronnel to leave the place as it was dangerous, and shoved him away. Ronnel walked a few meters towards the southern direction and hid, lying flat on his belly behind the bushes at the entrance of an old poultry house. Being approximately 10 to 15 meters from where Santos was standing, he heard Santos say to Mayor Ambagan, "<i>Hintayin nalang natin si GD at sa kanya ka nalang makiusap</i>." Santos did not agree. From a calm voice when he made his first request. Mayor Ambagan's voice became loud and angry when Santos many times turned him down. At that time, Patam was just an arm's length between Santos and Mayor Ambagan.<br><br>Then, Ronnel heard the Mayor say, "<i>Sige yan pala ang gusto mo. Mga kasama, banatan na ninyo yan.</i>" After the mayor had uttered these words, Ronnel heard a gunfire from Rene Amparo in the direction of Santos. The men of Mayor Ambagan (referring to Rene Amparo, Domingo Villasis, Michael Malabanan, Ely Garcia, and Roger Causaren) were spread along the road, firing their guns at Santos and Domingo. After several gunshots that lasted for about five minutes, he saw Mayor Ambagan's men board their vehicles and left in the direction of Amadeo, after taking the guns from Santos and Domingo.<br><br>Ronnel quickly went home and told his parents that his brother just got killed. They went to the place of incident after the policemen had arrived. On July 27, 2004, he executed a <i>Salaysay</i>. It took him long to give a statement because he feared for his life and his family's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The defense, on the other hand, offered the testimonies of accused <b>Roger V.

The Sandiganbayan recapitulated petitioner's testimony in the following wise:<br><blockquote>Albert G. Ambagan. Jr., Mayor of the Municipality of Amadeo, Cavite, at the time material to these cases and one of the accused. He testified that during the last week of June to the first week of July of 2004, they encountered robbery (<i>akyat-bahay</i>) and theft occurrences in their place. Robbers went inside houses, aimed guns at the households and robbed them. One of the victims was the Angcanan family.<br><br>In order to address the problems, he met with the policemen, the barangay captains, the committee on peace and order, and the chiefs of barangay tanods, where they decided to form a <i>ronda</i> team, to be composed of civilian groups, barangay officials, and policemen. The team would conduct regular patrol in the Municipality to prevent crimes, and maintain peace and order.<br><br>In the afternoon of July 4, 2004, on his way home from a wake of a relative, he received a text message from Barangay Captain Gina Salazar of Banay-banay, Amadeo saying, "<i>Humanda kayo. May mangyari sa inyo mamyang gabi</i>." So, he called Salazar and told her that he would send policemen, volunteers, and the <i>ronda</i> team to her barangay. He just needed to bring his fiancee to Manila, but would be back later.<br><br>From Manila, Mayor Ambagan went directly to Salazar's place, then to the police station where he was told that the policemen and the <i>ronda</i> team were to bring a motorcycle rider accosted earlier. At the station, he was informed that the owner of the motorcycle was freed, because there was no basis that the apprehended person was a suspected robber. So, he went back to the house of Salazar. At about 11:30 to 11:40 in the evening, while he was having a conversation with the officials of Banay-banay, he received a radio call from Alberto Angcanan, through Rene Amparo, saying that Santos was harassing the group of Angcanan. He was calling the police when Rene called again telling him, "<i>Nagpaputok na Mayor kailangan po kayo dito at maayos po lahat ito kung kayo'y nandito</i>." Being the mayor and considering that those who were being harassed were his constituents, he thought he needed to go to them even if he was fearful.<br><br>On board his Isuzu Trooper, he went to the boundary of Banay-banay and Tamacan, with the Chair of the Peace and Order Committee Michael Malabanan, his friend Leandro Causaren, and his driver Ariel Mendoza. When they arrived, he saw his MB 100 van at the left side of the road, and two cars parked at the back of the van. On the right side of the road were Angcanan, Juanito Loyola, Melanio Bayot, and Edrelin John Jamon, with Santos pointing a gun at the group. Domingo Bawalan was standing beside the car holding a long firearm. Santos was wearing a sando and short pants, while Domingo was wearing a t-shirt and maong pants. Both looked drunk.<br><br>He told Mendoza to park far from the area, and his companions to stay in the vehicle as he would go down alone to pacify the situation. Victorino Patam approached him and apologized for the altercation that happened between Angcanan's and Santos' groups. He went near Santos and asked the latter to just settle the issue because anyway all of them were one in trying to solve the robbery in their place, and pleaded him to put the gun down. But Santos with his gun still pointing at the group of Angcanan and waiving his cellphone, responded that he instead should talk to "GD." He continued pleading for Santos to put down his gun and to just talk out the issue as the Amadeo police were already coming. But Santos moved near him and pointed the gun at him. At that moment, Rene grappled the gun from Santos. He heard a gunshot and saw Rene fall to the ground. Angcanan, Patam and Loyola embraced and ushered him to the house of Miling Javier, while he was shouting to bring Rene to the hospital. Then, he heard a series of gunshots. He hurriedly called the police who said that they were already coming.<br><br>After the gunshots had stopped, he heard the vehicles from outside leaving. Worried that they had nothing to ride on, he called his house after they left Javier's house through the backdoor. They were picked up by a vehicle by the mango tree in Banay-banay. When they arrived at his house, he made a phone call to Provincial Director Col. Rosales instead of Amadeo police because its Chief, Major Aspiras, was not around. At Col. Rosales' office, Angcanan, Bayot and Loyola were separately investigated and underwent a paraffin test. He did not know about Mendoza who just left the Isuzu Trooper in front of his (Ambagan) house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Ester D.

Causaren (Roger), Michael T. Malabanan, Celestino (Ely) Garcia, Flor Amparo (Flor), Domingo Villasis, and the deceased Leandro Causaren (Leandro), were at the place of Barangay Captain Gina B. Salazar in Banay-banay, Amadeo, Cavite, to address a robbery threat to the barangay. When two suspicious speeding motorcycles passed by they all dashed to catch them. Leandro drove the MB 100 van. Villasis the barangay patrol owner-type jeep, and Flor, his owner-type jeep.<br><br>Hours later, accused Mayor Albert G. Ambagan went to Salazar's place. Not long enough. Leandro followed him after purportedly having turned over to the police station one of the two motorcycles they had chased earlier.<br><br>Meanwhile, the victim Reynaldo Santos coming from a police station in Maragondon, Cavite, went to Edgardo R. Mamuyac's house. Since Mamuyac was already asleep, Santos called Victorino J. Patam who was with the victim Domingo Bawalan, for company. After a little chat outside Mamuyac's house, at past 11:00 in the evening, the three decided to go home. Domingo rode with Santos in the latter's Space Gear van, while Patam drove his Toyota Corolla car. Santos went ahead of Patam, although both took the southern direction going to Barangay Tamacan.<br><br>When Santos and Domingo reached the boundary of Tamacan and Banay-banay (after passing by the latter's parents' house and having a short talk with Ronnel Bawalan), they came across an MB 100 van owned by Mayor Ambagan, parked at the right side of the road facing south (Poblacion of Amadeo). Santos positioned and parked his vehicle at the back of the MB 100 van, and as soon as he has alighted, ordered the four men armed with long and short firearms to get out from the van and line up at the other side (left) of the street. These men turned out to be Alberto C. Angcanan, Juanito S. Loyola, Melanio S. Bayot, and the deceased Edrelin John Jamon.<br><br>Santos Called Superintendent Cabillo, referred to as "GD," to inform him of the situation. Cabillo said that he was coming. On the other hand, Angcanan called Mayor Ambagan, through Rene Amparo, over the two-way radio saying that Santos apprehended him and his companions. Thereupon, Mayor Ambagan, Leandro, and Rene boarded the Mayor's Isuzu Trooper and headed to Tamacan where the group of Angcanan was.<br><br>When Mayor Ambagan arrived at the place of the incident, he approached Santos and requested the latter that they just settle whatever the problem was. But Santos replied that the Mayor should just wait for GD. While Santos and Mayor Ambagan were talking, Rene Amparo went near Santos. Mayor Ambagan repeatedly made the same request, but Santos stood pat and rejected the Mayor's requests. Mayor Ambagan then got angry and said: "<i>Sige, yan pala ang gusto mo. Mga kasama banatan na ninyo iyan</i>." Thereupon, the first gunshot was fired, followed by successive gunshots from the men of Mayor Ambagan, namely, Michael Malabanan, Ely Garcia, and Roger Causaren. The shooting incident which lasted for about five minutes left five men dead - Leandro, Rene, Jamon, Santos, and Domingo. The first, three were from the group of Mayor Ambagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan</b><br></div><br>In its June 21, 2012 Decision in Crim.

On the main, petitioner ventures to discredit Ronnel Bawalan, one of the only two prosecution witnesses who allegedly personally witnessed the prelude to the shootout, if not the shootout itself.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Office of the State Prosecutor (OSP), representing the People of the Philippines, countered that the Sandiganbayan committed no reversible error in convicting petitioner for double homicide. The OSP pointed out that the prosecution sufficiently established petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt through the testimony of Ronnel Bawalan, who only lived 100 meters away from the crime scene, and was even seen by Patam to be looking at the direction of the parked vehicles moments before he (Patam) joined Santos and Domingo Bawalan; and that Ronnel Bawalan was unwavering and steadfast in his testimony that he witnessed the attack, assault and shooting of Santos and Domingo Bawalan; and that Ronnel Bawalan categorically heard petitioner direct his men "<i>Sige, yan pala ang gusto mo. Mga kasama, banatan na ninyo yan</i>." Petitioner's command, so the OSP claims, was what triggered the exchange of gunshots, making him liable as principal by inducement for the resultant deaths of Santos and Domingo Bawalan.<br><br>On August 28, 2013, this Court resolved to deny the petition for its failure to show any reversible error in the challenged judgment of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This prompted petitioner to move for reconsideration, and the Court, through its December 9, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> to order the OSP to comment thereon.<br><br>In its Comment, the OSP argued that petitioner's motion for reconsideration was a mere rehash of arguments already submitted to and denied by the Court for lack of merit; and that the issues raised in the petition pertain to factual findings of the Sandiganbayan and that there is no cogent reason for the Court to review the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, on September 29, 2014, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> setting aside the August 28, 2013 Resolution and reinstating the petition.<br><br>We now resolve.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>After a careful review of the case, the Court finds the petition to be impressed with merit.<br><br><b><i>Findings of fad reviewable under exceptional circumstances</i></b><br><br>Resolving the issues posed by the petitioner, as aptly pointed out by the OSP, indeed requires a review of the Sandiganbayan's findings of fact, which is generally not a function of this Court. The oft-quoted rule is that factual findings of the court <i>a quo</i> and its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This rule, however, is not ironclad as it admits of exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> such as when the lower court has overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which the Sandiganbayan, as will be discussed, committed in the case at bar.<br><br><b><i>There is reasonable doubt to hold petitioner Ambagan criminally liable as principal by inducement</i></b><br><br>It may be recalled, in the case at bar, that petitioner was charged for two (2) counts of homicide for the deaths of Santos and Domingo Bawalan. Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code defines the offense charged as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 249. <i>Homicide</i>. - Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another without the attendance of any of the circumstances enumerated in the next preceding article, shall be guilty ol homicide and shall be punished by <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<br></blockquote>In relation thereto, the Court, in <i>Villanueva v. Caparas</i>, held that the following elements must be proven to sustain a conviction for homicide: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him without any justifying circumstance; (3) the accused had the intention to kill, which is presumed; and (4) the killing was not attended by any of the qualifying circumstances of murder, or by that of parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> is correct in its observation that the Court need not belabor on the elements of the offense since it is not disputed that Santos and Domingo Bawalan were killed during the July 5, 2004 shooting incident, and that the killing was not attended by any of the circumstances that would qualify the offense to murder, parricide, or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Verily, what is left to be determined is the extent of petitioner's participation in the adverted shooting incident, if any. Here, the Sandiganbayan adjudged petitioner guilty for two counts of homicide as principal by inducement for allegedly uttering "<i>Sige, yan pala ang gusto mo. Mga kasama banatan na ninyo yan</i>" which impelled petitioner's bodyguards to open fire at the victims.<br><br>The conviction of a person as a principal by inducement requires (1) that the inducement be made with the intention of procuring the commission of the crime; and (2) that such inducement be the determining cause of the commission by the material executor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As applied, the Sandiganbayan would have been correct in holding petitioner criminally liable if he indeed made the utterance immediately before the shooting incident. However, this Court is not inclined to believe that petitioner indeed made the declaration that started the fray. The court <i>a quo</i> failed to take note of substantial inconsistencies in the testimonies of star prosecution witnesses Patam and Ronnel Bawalan. These contradictions refer not only to minor details but even to the facts constituting important aspects of the case, seriously eroding the weight of the evidence of the prosecution, and casting reasonable doubt on the culpability of petitioner Ambagan.<br><br><i>a. Only Ronnel Bawalan allegedly heard petitioner made the utterance</i><br><br>It is a cardinal principle in criminal law that the prosecution has the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is the primordial duty of the prosecution to present its side with clarity and persuasion, so that conviction becomes the only logical and inevitable conclusion, with moral certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> If the prosecution fails to discharge its heavy burden, then it is not only the right of the accused to be freed, it becomes the Court's constitutional duty to acquit him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Noteworthy in the present controversy is that out of the eighteen (18) prosecution witnesses presented to satisfy the quantum of evidence required, only Ronnel Bawalan testified that petitioner uttered "<i>Sige, yan pala ang gusto mo.

It simply fails to see the light of reason.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, if petitioner himself was armed, as Patam claimed him to be,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and willing to start a shootout, according to Ronnel Bawalan, why would he then not draw his own pistol? As petitioner argued, having his gun tucked to his waist indicated that he himself was not mentally ready to engage in a gunfight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Had he had the mind to start the firefight, he would have spontaneously drawn his gun. He would not have let Patam, a member of Santos' group and an easy target given his close proximity, survive the ordeal.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, Ronnel Bawalan claimed that only Santos, from his group, was wielding a firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> He likewise testified that Rene Amparo was the first one to fire his gun, hitting Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> If indeed the other victim, Domingo Bawalan, was unarmed, this would have meant that Santos, by his lone injured self, and before he fell, was able to shoot down three (3) of petitioner's men: the other casualties Leandro Causaren, Rene Amparo, and Edrelin John Jamon. Needless to say, this would have been a difficult feat to accomplish in his wounded state.<br><br>Not even Santos' rifle and marksmanship skills as a police officer could have improved his odds since he had alcohol in his system at the time of the incident. Based on Patam's narration of the events prior to the shootout, Santos came from six straight hours of merry-making, from 5PM to 11PM on July 4, 2004, at a birthday party hosted by Edgardo R. Mamuyac. Patam continued that, during the celebration, Santos downed shots of liquor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> which could have adversely affected his focus and aim.<br><br>Moreover, believing Ronnel Bawalan's testimony - that only Santos, from their group, was armed - would only bolster the defense argument that, in all likelihood, it was Santos who first pulled the trigger. Otherwise, he would not have had ample time to shoot and kill all three of Ambagan's bodyguards by himself before getting killed by his assailants who have already surrounded him and were armed by automatic rifles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Ronnel Bawalan's version then makes it quite possible that it was Santos who drew first blood. While it may be, as the CA correctly observed, that even if Ronnel Bawalan was mistaken (deliberately or not) for saying that Santos first shot Rene Amparo, this could not be made to exclude the participation of Michael Malabanan, Roger Causaren, and Celestino "Ely" Garcia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this would, nevertheless, negate the assertion that petitioner Ambagan initiated the shooting incident.<br><br><i>Sixth</i>, Ronnel Bawalan's contradicting testimonies as to the details of Ambagan's bodyguards' demise further damage his credibility. According to Ronnel Bawalan in his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> he <b>personally</b> witnessed the deaths of Leandro Causaren and Edrelin Jamon as casualties of friendly fire.

This cannot simply be glossed over and treated as a badge of truthfulness, but instead plausibly raises suspicion as to his presence in the scene of the crime when it was committed.<br><br><i>Lastly</i>, there is, in the case at bar, reason to believe that Ronnel Bawalan is biased against petitioner, having an axe to grind against the latter for the untimely demise of Reynaldo Santos and Domingo Bawalan, Ronnel Bawalan's "cousin-in-law" and brother, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Bias is that which excites "a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> A witness is said to be biased when his relation to the cause or to the parties is such that he has an incentive to exaggerate or give false color to his statements, or to suppress or to pervert the truth, or to state what is false. To warrant rejection of the testimony of a relative or friend, it must be clearly shown that, independently of the relationship, the testimony was inherently improbable or defective, or that improper or evil motives had moved the witness to incriminate the accused falsely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Here, Ronnel Bawalan's bias was first made manifest when he was caught in a bold-faced lie. He claimed that only Santos was armed during the firefight when in fact, his brother, Domingo Bawalan, tested positive for gunpowder nitrates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> This detail - whether or not Domingo Bawalan was armed - is substantial in this case since this tends to establish the probability or improbability of Santos starting the gunfight, as earlier discussed. Likewise, We have earlier demonstrated how Ronnel Bawalan distorted the truth by first claiming that he personally witnessed the deaths of Leandro Causaren and Edrelin Jamon only to recant later on and admit that he only learned of their deaths afterwards from other people who went to the site of the shooting incident. Additionally, despite having keenly observed the events unfold, Ronnel Bawalan failed to identify the location of Ambagan during the shootout, in spite of tagging the latter as the main perpetrator of the crime.<br><br>The general rule may be that where there is no evidence to indicate that the prosecution witnesses were actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that they were not so actuated and that their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In this case, however, there are sufficient circumstances and discrepancies in Ronnel Bawalan's testimony that impel this Court to look at his version of the facts with reasonable skepticism.<br><br>From the foregoing circumstances, We have gotten a clearer glimpse of petitioner's state of mind at the time of the shooting. These seemingly minute details - the second, third, fourth, and fifth circumstances specifically - readily render it unlikely, if not at all improbable, that petitioner initiated the gunfight by saying "<i>banatan na ninyo yan</i>." The rest of the enumeration, on the other hand, cautions this Court not to swallow Ronnel Bawalan's testimony in its entirety hook, line and sinker for his narration of facts may not be truthful or accurate.<br><br>Worthy of note is that my esteemed colleague, Associate Justice Martin S. Villarama, in his dissent, echoes the observation of the Sandiganbayan that <b>there are indeed inconsistencies in Ronnel Bawalan's testimony</b>, but regretfully downplays such discrepancies as inconsequential to the outcome of the case. Citing the Sandiganbayan, the position advanced is that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><blockquote>It is of no moment that Ronnel's allegation that Rene fired first at Santos may be disproved with the paraffin test result, showing that Santos was positive for gunpowder nitrates while Rene was found negative. Immaterial too is the argument that Ronnel was not consistent as to when he actually learned of the deaths of the victims, other than Santos and Domingo. If Ronnel failed to accurately testify on this part, his other testimony worthy of belief cannot, nonetheless, be excluded. Even assuming that Santos shot Rene first, it should be noted that the evidence cannot believe that Santos and Domingo both died from the gunfire of Malabanan, Roger, Garcia, and other unrecognized men of Mayor Ambagan.<br></blockquote>With all due respect, these inconsistencies are not "<i>of no moment</i>" and neither are they "<i>immaterial</i>" to the case at bar.<br><br><i>First</i>, Ronnel Bawalan claimed that after petitioner Ambagan allegedly uttered the imperative phrase "<i>banatan na ninyo yan</i>" one of his bodyguards, Rene Amparo, was the first to fire at the direction of the victim, Santos. However, Rene Amparo's negative paraffin test would already belie such claim. Such circumstance is not "<i>of no moment</i>" for it raises material doubt as to who started the firefight. If Rene Amparo was the first to fall, this would mean that Santos was the first to open fire. And if the victim was the first one to open fire, then the firefight may not have been started by petitioner Ambagan's alleged instruction after all.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the Sandiganbayan claimed that "[e]ven assuming that Santos shot Rene first, it should be noted that the evidence cannot belie that Santos and Domingo died from the gunfire of Malabanan, Roger, Garcia, and other unrecognized men of Mayor Ambagan." This statement misses the point. Again, the issue in the instant petition is whether or not petitioner is criminally liable as principal by inducement. Identifying Santos as the first one to shoot raises the probability that petitioner's men opened fire only in retaliation, and were not, by any means, induced by petitioner to do so.<br><br><i>Third</i>, Ronnel Bawalan's knowledge, or lack thereof, of the deaths of the other victims, Leandro Causaren and Edrelin Jamon, petitioner's two (2) other bodyguards, is a material detail which tends to establish his presence or absence at the scene of the crime. If the star prosecution witness was indeed present, it would be too difficult to believe that he only witnessed the deaths of his two relatives, aside from Rene Amparo who was the first to fall. He would have at least seen that there were other dead bodies even though their identities were not known to him at that time. Confusion as to the number of casualties may be understandable if most of their identities are unknown to the witness, but for the witness to skip the detail and effectively claim that the only deaths he saw were those of the people he knew is far too convenient an omission and militates against his very credibility.<br><br>In determining the guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt, We entertain the probability or improbability of alternative scenarios other than what is offered by the prosecution. For this purpose, We were urged "<i>to view Ronnel Bawalan's testimony as a whole</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> to reconcile the inconsistencies in his statements, but as extensively discussed, Ronnel Bawalan's narration of events is not airtight and even brings to fore more reasons to disbelieve his version. Indeed, there are far too many inconsistencies in the testimony <pf bawalan,="" enough="" put="" us="" guard="" when="" it="" comes="" accepting="" veracity="" of="" his="" claims.="" for="" inconsistencies="" to="" discredit="" a="" witness,="" they="" must="" be="" minor="" and="" should="" not="" on="" material="" details.="" but="" here,="" we="" find="" that="" the="" statements="" made="" by="" ronnel="" bawalan="">"<i>taken as a whole</i>" does not foreclose the probability that Ambagan did not initiate the firefight, and casts reasonable doubt as to his guilt as principal by inducement.<br><br>In conclusion, the scant evidence for the prosecution casts serious doubts as to the guilt of petitioner as principal by inducement.

No. L-1374, December 3, 1903, 3 Phil. 3, 6.<br><br> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Id. at 6.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b><br>DISSENTING OPINION</b></center><br>VILLARAMA, JR., J.: <br><br>With due respect to my colleague and Member-in-Charge of this case, Justice Velasco, Jr., I disagree with his ruling to acquit, on ground of reasonable doubt, petitioner former Mayor Albert G. Ambagan, Jr. from the charge of two counts of homicide in connection with the fatal shooting of SPO2 Reynaldo Santos and Domingo Bawalan on July 4, 2004 at past midnight in Amadeo, Cavite when the latter tried to apprehend certain motorcycle-riding men carrying firearms. <br><br>As a general rule, an appellate court will not disturb the findings of the lower court, unless there appears in the record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which have been misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>Perusing the appealed decision and the evidence on record, I find no such fact or circumstance of weight and significance which has been overlooked or misappreciated by the Sandiganbayan regarding the participation of petitioner in the shooting incident that took place in his presence. <i>All</i> the matters discussed in the <i>ponencia</i> have already been thoroughly passed upon and exhaustively discussed by the Sandiganbayan in its decision convicting petitioner of the crime charged. <br><br>The issue boils down really to the credibility of prosecution eyewitness, Rommel Bawalan, who categorically testified that petitioner ordered his armed bodyguards and co-accused to fire at the victims. <br><br>This Court has consistently held that matters affecting credibility are best left to the trial court because of its unique opportunity of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witness deportment on the stand while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Member-in-Charge found it highly irregular that out of several witnesses presented by the prosecution, only Ronnel Bawalan testified that petitioner uttered the words "<i>Sige yan pala ang gusto mo. Mga kasama banatan na ninyo yan</i>" in those moments of petitioner's intense anger over the repeated rejection by SPO2 Santos of his request to just talk over the matter respecting certain individuals whom Santos had just apprehended and whose illegal firearms he was confiscating at the time. However, this alleged discrepancy pointed out by the defense was already satisfactorily explained and judiciously resolved by the Sandiganbayan, as follows:<br><blockquote>The Court is not convinced that Ambagan could not have made such utterance, because Patam, who was with the Mayor at that moment, had not mentioned about it in his testimony. Patam testified that when he was pushing Mayor Ambagana to Javier's house, the Mayor was shouting invectives at Santos. Distinctly, Patam remembered the Mayor telling Santos, "<i>Ang hirap mong kausap</i>." This was followed by more statements, but Patam could no longer understand them. It is of common knowledge that the nearness of the speaker to the hearer is not necessarily determinant of what the speaker actually said or did not say. In other words, whatever Patam had heard does not exclude what Ronnel had perceived, simply because Patam was nearer to Mayor Ambagan. A hearer's perception of speaker's utterance is affected by other factors, such as the hearer's attention and understanding or interpretation about what has been said. At that time, Ronnel was differently situated from Patam. While Ronnel was simply a spectator waiting for what was going to happen next, Patam was in a move involved stance, being into the situation himself. He was foreseeing possible trouble which to his mind needed to be contained. In fact, Patam decided to bring the Mayor to Javier's house when he sensed that the awkward situation was heating up. Faced with these concerns, it was not unlikely that Patam may have missed the other words of Mayor Ambagan. On the other hand, Patam;s testimony about Mayor Ambagan's remarks only corroborates Ronnel's testimony, rather than discredit it. Infuriated with Santos' refusal to accommodate his requests, Mayor Ambagan bellowed unsavoury words to him. His tirade supports the possibility that he directed his men to fire at Santos. This was validated when gunfire ensued shortly after his command. That command induced Garcia and Roger Causaren to shoot Santos and Domingo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>The other perceived inconsistencies and improbabilities pointed out in the <i>ponencia</i> which supposedly casts doubt on the truthfulness of Ronnel's eyewitness account, were also addressed by the Sandiganbayan, viz.:<br><blockquote>The aforecited testimony of Ronnel on cross-examination should not be taken in isolation. Ronnel may not have adequately portrayed the exchange of shots between Santos and Rene per se. However, it cannot be denied that in his other declarations, he was categorical too, that the bodyguards of Mayor Ambagan fired shots. These seemingly inconsistent statements are reconcilable, if Ronnel's testimony is viewed as a whole. He saw Santos and Rene fired at each other, and successive firings happened from the companions of Mayor Ambagan, although, Ronnel could not specifically name them all. For one, he did not know some of the bodyguards. For another, it is impossible for him to describe in detail who fired in succession, because there were many gunmen involved, and the interval between gunfire was just a matter of seconds.<br><br>It is of no moment that Ronnel's allegation that Rene fired first at Santos may be disproved with the paraffin test result, showing that Santos was positive for gunpowder nitrates while Rene was found negative. Immaterial too is the argument that Ronnel was not consistent as to when he actually learned of the deaths of the victims, other than Santos and Domingo. If Ronnel failed to accurately testify on this part, his other testimony worthy of belief cannot, nonetheless, be excluded. Even assuming that Santos shot Rene first, it should be noted that the evidence cannot belie that Santos and Domingo both died from the gunfire of Malabanan, Roger, Garcia, and other unrecognized, men of Mayor Ambagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The testimony of a single witness has been held sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused, and if found positive and credible, is sufficient to convict the accused even in a murder charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Also, failure of a witness to reveal to the authorities that he witnessed a crime and to reveal the identities of the offender for a number of days, weeks or even a number of years, is allowable if there is a valid reason for such delay, as even a ten-year delay was still acceptable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Here, the Sandiganbayan ruled that petitioner is guilty as principal by inducement considering the attendant circumstances clearly indicating that petitioner's bodyguards would not have fired their guns at SPO2 Santos and Domingo had he not ordered them to do so. It also held that Ronnel Bawalan's delay of 22 days in reporting what he witnessed during the shooting incident, did not impair his testimony, which the Sandiganbayan found as bearing no earmarks of falsehood.<br><br>It is evident that petitioner herein seeks a review by the Court of the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, which essentially involve the credibility of the testimonies of the witnesses. As the issue of credibility is to be resolved primarily by the trial court, I see no reason to reverse the findings and conclusions made by the Sandiganbayan as they are supported by the testimonial and documentary evidence on record.<br><br>I therefore <b>VOTE</b> to deny the petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
