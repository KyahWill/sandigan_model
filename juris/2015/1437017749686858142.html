				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The complex crime of robbery in an inhabited house by armed persons and robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons was committed when the accused, who held firearms, entered the residential house of the victims and inflicted injury upon the victims in the process of committing the robbery. Hence, the penalty is that imposed for the robbery in an inhabited house, the more serious crime. All the accused are liable because the act of one is the act of all.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>Aurora Engson Fransdilla (Fransdilla), the lone appellant, seeks to reverse the decision promulgated on February 28, 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed her conviction and that of her co-accused for robbery on the basis of conspiracy, with modifications as to the penalty imposed, under the decision rendered on September 15, 1999 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 99, in Quezon City<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>As factual background, the CA adopted the summary rendered by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in its appellee's brief, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>On February 20, 1991 between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, at private complainants' residence at No. 24, Mabait St., Teachers Village, Quezon City, private complainant Lalaine Yreverre saw appellant Aurora Engson in front of their gate. Upon noticing Aurora, Lalaine went to the gate and asked Aurora what is their purpose, as there were four (4) of them. Aurora then inquired about Cynthia Yreverre, Lalaine's sister. The latter replied that Cynthia was in the Japanese Embassy and asked Aurora if there was any other person whom she wanted to talk to. It was then that Aurora told Lalaine that she was from the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA). It was upon said pretension that Lalaine offered herself to instead talk to her and allowed her to enter their house. When they were already having a conversation, Aurora asked Lalaine if she could use the telephone, which the latter acceded to and handed her a cordless telephone. Lalaine noticed that Aurora seemed to keep on dialing the telephone and even said that the person she was calling did not know how to use the telephone. But still, Aurora kept on dialing the telephone.<br><br>Thereafter, appellant Aurora asked for a cigarette. After Lalaine gave Aurora the cigarette, the four (4) other men outside the gate, who were with Aurora, suddenly came inside the house. The four (4) men stood behind Aurora who was still dialing the telephone. When Aurora told that she could not contact the person she was calling, she asked Lalaine if she could use the comfort room, which the latter again permitted. Aurora stood up, put down the telephone, got her bag and went to the comfort room. When Aurora came back, she sat down again but in crossed-legs as she said she was having a menstrual period. Upon saying that, Lalaine's attention was focused on her. At this juncture, accused Edgardo Cacal poked a gun at Lalaine's neck and announced that it was a hold-up. While appellant Edgardo Cacal was poking a gun at Lalaine's neck, accused Danilo Cuanang and the two (2) other men proceeded to the kitchen. In the kitchen, Danilo and his two (2) other companions herded their maids, private complainant's niece and cousin inside the bodega.<br><br>Accused Cacal who was still poking the gun at Lalaine's neck, thereafter, pulled Lalaine's hair and dragged her upstairs and brought her inside Cynthia's room. The gun still being poked at Lalaine, Cacal looked around the room and when he spotted upon the vault he dropped Lalaine, opened the door and called for his companions to come along. Accused Cuanang came up and the two (Cacal and Cuanang) carried the vault and brought it downstairs. But before they went downstairs, they threatened Lalaine not to follow them and to just stay in the room, but Lalaine opened the door and followed them.<br><br>When Lalaine was halfway downstairs, accused Cacal turned his back and saw her. Accused Cacal then brought her inside her room. Inside the room, Cacal pushed her towards her bed and she fell. Cacal told her to just stay, and then he searched the room. Lalaine managed to stand up but Cacal slapped her. While sitting, accused Cuanang came and tied her arms at her back. While she was being tied, appellant Aurora Fransdilla peeped inside the room. It was also at the time that accused Cacal and Cuanang searched the entire room and took all the jewelries and things they saw.<br><br>When Cuanang and Cacal left the room, Lalaine followed them. While in the middle downstairs, she saw Cacal, Cuanang and their two other companions tucking their guns around their waists. Appellants and their co-accused then left the house on board two (2) cars that were waiting for them just outside the house, and one of which, a black Colt Mirage, was driven by accused Manuel Silao, together with appellant Edgardo Silao who was seated at the front passenger seat.<br><br>At this point, Lalaine shouted for help, thereafter, a relative came by to help and untied her. Lalaine then called her sister Cynthia and related the incident. Cynthia reported the incident to the police authorities. Not too long thereafter, the police investigated the incident.<br><br>In relation thereto, Lalaine executed her sworn statement on February 20, 1991 (Exhibit "J"). After said investigation, Lalaine underwent medical examination at the East Avenue Medical Center as her hands were bruised when she was tied by her hands and her face being slapped by one of the accused. A medical certificate was issued in relation thereto (Exhibit "N").<br><br>Thereafter, Lalaine went to Camp Karingal at Sikatuna, Quezon City where there were at least fifteen (15) person(s) presented before her in the police line-up, but she was not able to identify any of the accused among said line-up.<br><br>After which, she went to the Station Investigation Division (SID) Station 4, Quezon City where she was shown about fifty (50) pictures in order for her to identify the robbers, but she was not able to identify any of them.<br><br>Since she failed to identify any of the malefactors, she proceeded to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Manila. She was referred to a cartographer for the sketch of herein appellants and their co-accused as the malefactors in robbing their house (Exhibits "B", "C" and "D").<br><br>Thereafter, Lalaine proceeded to the Western Police District, Manila. There, she went to the rogues gallery where a picture of about (5) persons were shown to her. After carefully examining the pictures, Lalaine was able to pinpoint the picture of accused Danilo Cuanang as one of the robbers. She was also able to identify Manuel "Sonny" Silao in a group picture where she identified accused Cuanang (Exhibits "E" and "F") It was also in said rogues gallery that they were able to get accused Cuanang's address at Iriga, Cubao, Quezon City.<br><br>Lalaine, together with her police officers companions, proceeded to Cuanang's indicated address. Upon arrival thereat, they inquired from the security guard of the townhouse if Danilo Cuanang was residing there, which the latter confirmed.<br><br>On the following day Lalaine and her police companions went back to Cuanang's house. Lalaine knocked at the door and accused Cuanang himself opened the door. When Lalaine confronted him and told him that he was one of those who entered their house, the latter did not answer. Lalaine asked Cuanang if he could come with them at the PNP-SID, Station 4, EDSA, Kamuning, Quezon City and the latter acceded.<br><br>On their way to the police station, Lalaine inquired on Cuanang about their lady companion (herein appellant Fransdilla), but the latter just bowed his head. When Lalaine threatened him that if he would not tell the whereabouts of their lady companion (herein appellant Aurora) he would be answerable for all the things stolen, the latter replied that they had no share in the stolen items. Lalaine then asked the name of their lady companion and the latter said that her name was Jessica Engson (also known as Aurora Engson Fransdilla) and she was living in Antipolo Street, Sampaloc, Manila. Cuanang also volunteered himself to accompany them to Aurora's house provided that they should not hurt him. Agreeing thereto, the group of Lalaine, accompanied by Cuanang, proceeded to Aurora's house at the given address. Upon arrival thereat, Lalaine inquired from a child if Aurora was awake, and upon asking, she saw appellant Aurora who was trembling at that time. Lalaine noticed that Aurora was nervous and even told her that Lalaine was able to remember her face. Appellant even voluntarily told Lalaine that she would tell her the whole truth. She (Aurora) told that she was instructed by her companions Edgar (Silao), Sonny (Manuel Silao) and Danilo Cacal. Lalaine even confronted her when she implicated her cousins (Sonny and Edgar).<br><br>Upon reaching PNP Station 4, SID, Kamuning, Quezon City, Lalaine and her police companions rested for a while before they proceeded to 921 Adelina St., Sampaloc, Manila, where accused Manuel "Sonny" Silao lived. Upon reaching the said address, Lalaine knocked at the gate, and a maid opened the same and allowed them to enter the house. In the house, Lalaine asked the maid where Sonny's room was and the latter said it was on the third floor. When Lalaine and her police companions were going upstairs, they passed by the second floor and saw accused Cacal sitting on a folding bed. She then told her police companions that that man (Cacal) was among those who entered and robbed their house, Cacal just remained silent. Thereafter, the group proceeded to the third floor of the house, knocked at the door and it was Manuel's (a.k.a. Sonny) wife who opened it. At this point, Manuel (a.k.a. Sonny) was lying on the bed and holding his gun, thus, Pat. Randy Quitoriano immediately handcuffed him. Lalaine's group invited Manuel and Danilo to go with them at the police station; both acceded.<br><br>On March 21, 1991, Lalaine went back to the PNP Station 4, SID, Kamuning, Quezon City, where she was informed that they (Rod Fortaleza's group) were able to recover some money (dollar bills) from appellant Edgardo Silao. When these dollar bills were shown to her, she recognized that these were the same dollar bills withdrawn by her sister Cynthia from the RCBC Bank as the bills bear red markings (Exhibits "M" to "M-5".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Fransdilla and her co-accused were eventually charged with robbery under the following information, to wit:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 20<sup>th</sup> day of February, 1991, in Quezon City Philippines and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring together, confederating with and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to gain, and by means of violence and intimidation upon person rob the residence of CYNTHIA YREVERRE Y PANGANIBAN located at No. 24-B Mabait St., Teacher's Village, Quezon City, this City, by pretending to be from PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY (POEA) and once inside took, rob, and carried away the following items therefrom, to wit:<br><blockquote>nine (9) pieces of expensive jewelry ....

It adverted to Fransdilla's various acts as evincing her role in the concerted resolve to commit the robbery, such as introducing herself to Lalaine as a representative of the POEA in order to gain access into the house; trying to distract Lalaine by using the telephone, asking for a cigarette, going to the bathroom, and pretending that she was then having her menstrual period in order to have her cohorts enter the house; and peeping inside the bedroom when her co-accused were tying Lalaine up to enable themselves to search for and take away jewelry and other valuables inside the latter's bedroom without hindrance.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The accused still insists on her innocence, protesting that the CA erred in affirming the conviction despite the failure to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt as a co-conspirator in robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court<br><br></b></center> The Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision of the CA.<br><br><center><b>1.<br> Conspiracy of Fransdilla with<br> her co-accused was established<br> beyond reasonable doubt</b><br></center><br>It bears stressing that Fransdilla opted not to present evidence in her defense during the trial. On appeal, the core of her contentions in the CA was that the Prosecution did not establish her having conspired with the other accused in committing the robbery. She reiterates such contentions here, stating that the State's formal offer of evidence did not include any reference to any evidence specifically incriminating her.<br><br>The Court rejects Fransdilla's contentions.<br><br>Our review of the records of the trial reveals that contrary to Fransdilla's contentions, the State competently and credibly established her active participation in the execution of the robbery through Lalaine's testimony detailing her specific acts, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Q - Miss Yrreverre, do you recall if there was any unusual incident that happened on that particular date and time on February 20, 1991 between 3:00 o'clock to 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon?<br>A - Yes, sir.<br><br>Q - What was it?<br> A - On February 20, 1991, between 3:00 to 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon while I was resting at our sala I saw them and I met them at the gate and I asked the lady because there were four of them I asked the lady to come in.<br><br>Q - How did the lady come in?<br> A - When I saw the lady I asked the lady what is her purpose and she said I am from the POEA and she is looking for my sister Cynthia Yrreverre, sir.<br><br>Q - What happened after that?<br> A - When she inquired about my sister I told her that my sister Cynthia Yrreverre is in Japan embassy and she said if there is any other person she could talked to.<br><br>Q - What was your answer?<br> A - When she said that she is from POEA I recommended myself to her and I said you can talk to me and I allowed her to enter our house, sir.<br><br>Q - After you allowed that lady who represented herself to you that she is from the POEA to enter, what happened next?<br> A - I let her enter our house and I inquired and asked from her who are the persons she know in POEA, sir.<br><br>Q - And what happened next after that?<br> A - She mentioned a name whom according to her from the POEA but I do not remember anymore, sir.<br><br>Q - What happened next after that?<br> A - While we were chatting or conversing for a while she asked if she can use our telephone, sir.<br><br>Q - And what was your answer to that?<br> A - I said yes and I handed to her the cordless telephone, sir.<br><br>Q - What happened after you gave the telephone to the lady who represented herself that she is from the POEA?<br> A - After I gave the cordless telephone she keep on dialing, dialing and dialing and according to her she constantly dialing the number and she even remarked: "the person she is calling does not know how to use the telephone"...<br><br>Q - What happened after that remarks?<br> A - She still kept on dialing and she remarked that she did not know how to use the phone...<br><br>Q - What happened after that?<br> A - After that, she asked for a cigarette sir.<br><br>Q - Did you give to the lady who represented herself that she is from the POEA a cigarette?<br>A - Yes, sir.<br><br>Q - What happened next after that?<br>A - After I gave the cigarette the four (4) men entered suddenly and came in our house.<br><br>Q - Where did they come from?<br>A - I do not know, sir.<br><br>Q - From what direction of the house they came from Miss Witness, do you know?<br> A - They came from the outside of the gate, sir, and suddenly entered our house, sir.<br><br>Q - When for the first time did you see that lady who represented herself that she is from the POEA and the four (4) men burged (sic) in your house?<br> A- Last February 20, 1991 only, sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ATTY.

Fransdilla's non-presentation of her defense, despite her being directly incriminated by Lalaine, denied the Court her explanation for her specific overt acts of complicity in the robbery and thus rendered the incriminating evidence unrefuted. By this the Court simply means that Fransdilla did not discharge her burden of evidence, which is "the duty of a party to start and continue giving evidence at any stage of the trial until he has established a <i>prima facie</i> case, or the like duty of the adverse party to meet and overthrow that <i>prima facie</i> case thus established."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>As such, the prosecution successfully discharged its burden of proof against Fransdilla.<br><br>In the eyes of the law, conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a crime and decide to commit it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> For an accused to be validly held to have conspired with her co-accused in committing the crime, her overt acts must evince her active part in the execution of the crime agreed to be committed.

Here, Fransdilla was satisfactorily shown not to have been a mere passive co-conspirator, but an active one who had facilitated the access into the house by representing herself as an employee of the POEA. In that respect, it is not always required to establish that two or more persons met and explicitly entered into the agreement to commit the crime by laying down the details of how their unlawful scheme or objective would be carried out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Conspiracy can also be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense is perpetrated, or can be inferred from the acts of the several accused evincing their joint or common purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Once conspiracy is established, the act of each conspirator is the act of all.<br><br>In establishing conspiracy, the State could rely on direct as well as circumstantial evidence. Lalaine's testimony against Fransdilla constituted both kinds of evidence. Lalaine's direct testimony showed the latter's overt participation in the execution of the robbery, while the following circumstances indicated the unity of action and common purpose or design to commit the robbery among Fransdilla and her co-accused, specifically: (1) Fransdilla and her co-accused went together to the complainants' house at around 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. of February 20, 1991; (2) she talked to Joel to solicit information on the whereabouts of Cynthia; (3) upon learning that Cynthia was not home, she stepped outside the gate and talked to two men sitting inside a vehicle parked outside the house; (4) she pretended to be an employee of the POEA in order to gain entry into the house; (5) she performed acts purposely aimed to distract Lalaine in order to give her cohorts the opportunity to enter the house and commit the robbery; (5) during the robbery, she was not tied up like the household members, but moved freely around the house, and at one point Lalaine spotted her peeping into the bedroom where Lalaine was then being held; and (7) she and the others fled together in two separate vehicles after the robbery.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the CA justly concluded that the State established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt for of all the accused, including Fransdilla, for the robbery.<br><br><center><b>2.<br> Correction of the Indeterminate Sentence<br> was necessary to conform to the letter and spirit<br> the <i>Indeterminate Sentence Law</i></b><br></center><br>That the trial judge fixed the indeterminate sentence at "imprisonment of TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS and EIGHT (8) MONTHS of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as minimum to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY to TWENTY (20) YEARS of <i>reclusion temporal </i>as maximum" was a patent elementary error. Such fixing contravened the letter and spirit of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Section 1 of which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Hereafter, in imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished by the <i>Revised Penal Code,</i> or its amendments, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and the minimum which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense; and if the offense is punished by any other law, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same. <i>(As amended by Act No. 4225)</i></blockquote>The CA justifiably deemed it necessary to correct the indeterminate sentence. Under Section 1, <i>supra,</i> the minimum of the indeterminate sentence is a penalty "within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the [Revised Penal] Code for the offense," and the maximum is "that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code."

This objective cannot be achieved otherwise, for determining when the convict would be eligible for release on parole would be nearly impossible if the minimum and the maximum were as <i>indefinite</i> as the RTC fixed the indeterminate sentence. Indeed, that the sentence is an indeterminate one relates only to the fact that such imposition would leave the period between the minimum and the maximum penalties <i>indeterminate</i> "in the sense that he may, under the conditions set out in said Act, be released from serving said period in whole or in part."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>3.<br> Crime committed was the complex crime of<br> robbery in an inhabited house by armed men<br> under Article 299 of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i> and<br> robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons<br> under Article 294 of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i></b><br></center><br>Citing <i>Napolis v.

Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Roberto R. Concepción observed:<br><blockquote>Upon mature deliberation, We find ourselves unable to share the foregoing view. Indeed, one who, by breaking a wall, enters, with a deadly weapon, an inhabited house and steals therefrom valuable effects, without violence against or intimidation upon persons, is punishable under Art. 299 of the Revised Penal Code with <i>reclusion temporal</i>. Pursuant to the above view, adhered to in previous decisions, if, <i>aside from</i> performing said acts, the thief lays hand upon any person, without committing any of the crimes or inflicting any of the injuries mentioned in subparagraphs (1) to (4) of Art. 294 of the same Code, the imposable penalty - under paragraph (5) thereof- shall be <i>much lighter.</i> To our mind, this result and the process of reasoning that has brought it about, defy logic and reason.<br><br>The argument to the effect that the violence against or intimidation of a person supplies the "controlling qualification," is far from sufficient to justify said result. We agree with the proposition that robbery with "violence or intimidation against the person is evidently graver than ordinary robbery committed by force upon things," but,<i> precisely, for this reason,</i> We cannot accept the conclusion deduced therefrom in the cases above cited - <i>reduction</i> of the penalty for the latter offense owing to the concurrence of violation or intimidation which made it a <i>more serious</i> one. It is, to our mind, more plausible to believe that Art. 294 applies only where robbery with violence against or intimidation of a person takes place <i>without</i> entering an inhabited house, under the conditions set forth in Art. 299 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>We deem it more logical and reasonable to hold, as We do, when the elements of <i>both</i> provisions are present, that the crime is a <i>complex</i> one, calling for the imposition — as provided in Art. 48 of said Code — of the penalty for the most serious offense, in its maximum period, which, in the case at bar, is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period. This penalty should, in turn, be imposed in its maximum period - from nineteen (19) years, one (1) month and eleven (11) days to twenty (20) years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> - owing to the presence of the aggravating circumstances of nighttime. xxx.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><i>Napolis v.
