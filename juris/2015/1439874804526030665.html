Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Supreme Court already ruled that Section 196 of the NIRC does not include the transfer of real property from one corporation to another pursuant to a merger. It explained that:<br><blockquote>[W]e do not find merit in petitioner's contention that Section 196 covers all transfers and conveyances of real property for a valuable consideration. A perusal of the subject provision would clearly show it pertains only to sale transactions where real property is conveyed to a purchaser for a consideration. The phrase "granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed" is qualified by the word "sold" which means that documentary stamp tax under Section 196 is imposed on the transfer of realty by way of sale and does not apply to all conveyances of real property. Indeed, as correctly noted by the respondent, the fact that Section 196 refers to words "sold", "purchaser" and "consideration" undoubtedly leads to the conclusion that only sales of real property are contemplated therein.<br><br>Thus, petitioner obviously erred when it relied on the phrase "granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed" in claiming that all conveyances of real property regardless of the manner of transfer are subject to documentary stamp tax under Section 196. It is not proper to construe the meaning of a statute on the basis of one part. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It should be emphasized that in the instant case, the transfer of SPPC's real property to respondent was pursuant to their approved plan of merger. In a merger of two existing corporations, one of the corporations survives and continues the business, while the other is dissolved, and all its rights, properties, and liabilities are acquired by the surviving corporation. Although there is a dissolution of the absorbed or merged corporations, there is no winding up of their affairs or liquidation of their assets because the surviving corporation automatically acquires all their rights, privileges, and powers, as well as their liabilities. Here, SPPC ceased to have any legal personality and respondent PSPC stepped into everything that was SPPC's, pursuant to the law and the terms of their Plan of Merger.<br><br>Pertinently, a merger of two corporations produces the following effects, among others:<br><blockquote>Sec. 80. Effects of merger or consolidation. - x x x <br><br>x x x x<br><br>4. The surviving or the consolidated corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises of each of the constituent corporations; <b>and all property, real or personal, and all receivables due on whatever account, including subscriptions to shares and other choses in action, and all and every other interest of, or belonging to, or due to each constituent corporations, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in such surviving or consolidated corporation without further act or deed</b>;<br></blockquote>In a merger, the real properties are not deemed "sold" to the surviving corporation and the latter could not be considered as "purchaser" of realty since the real properties subject of the merger were merely absorbed by the surviving corporation by operation of law and these properties are deemed automatically transferred to and vested in the surviving corporation without further act or deed. Therefore, the transfer of real properties to the surviving corporation in pursuance of a merger is not subject to documentary stamp tax. As stated at the outset, documentary stamp tax is imposed only on all conveyances, deeds, instruments or writing where realty sold shall be conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers. The transfer of SPPC's real property to respondent was neither a sale nor was it a conveyance of real property for a consideration contracted to be paid as contemplated under Section 196 of the Tax Code. Hence, Section 196 of the Tax Code is inapplicable and respondent is not liable for documentary stamp tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Following the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, which dictates that when a court has reached a conclusion in one case, it should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we find that respondent is not liable for DST as the transfer of real properties from the absorbed corporations to respondent was pursuant to a merger. And having complied with the provisions of Sections 204(C)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and 229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the NIRC, we agree with the CTA that respondent is entitled to a refund of the DST it erroneously paid on various dates between October 31, 2001 to November 15, 2001 in the total amount of P14,140,980.00.<br><br>Likewise without merit is petitioner's contention that respondent cannot claim exemption under RA 9243 as this was enacted only in 2004 or after respondent's tax liability accrued. To be clear, respondent did not file its claim for tax refund or tax credit based on the exemption found in RA 9243. Rather, it filed a claim for tax refund or tax credit on the ground that Section 196 of the MRC does not include the transfer of real property pursuant to a merger. In fact, the <i>ratio decidendi</i> (or reason for the decision) in <i>Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was based on Section 196 of the NIRC, in relation to Section 80 of the Corporation Code, not RA 9243. In that case, RA 9243 was mentioned only to emphasize that "the enactment of the said law now removes any doubt and had made clear that the transfer of real properties as a consequence of merger or consolidation is not subject to [DST]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CTA in granting respondent's claim for tax refund or tax credit in the amount of P14,140,980.00, representing its erroneously paid DST for the taxable year 2001.<br><br>In closing, we must stress that taxes must not be imposed beyond what the law expressly and clearly declares as tax laws must be construed strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
