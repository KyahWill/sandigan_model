Any reading of Section 5 and of its individual components, such as Section 5.2(a), cannot be divorced from this purpose.<br><br><i>The inclusion of election surveys in the list of items regulated by the Fair Election Act is a recognition that election surveys are not a mere descriptive aggregation of data. Publishing surveys are a means to shape the preference of voters, inform the strategy of campaign machineries, and ultimately, affect the outcome of elections. Election surveys have a similar nature as election propaganda. They are expensive, normally paid for by those interested in the outcome of elections, and have tremendous consequences on election results.</i><br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Views vary on the precise extent to which surveys or "polls" shape voter preferences, if at all.<br><br>Election surveys have been critiqued for amplifying the notion of an election as a "horse race"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and for reducing elections to the lowest common denominator of percentage points or a candidate's erstwhile share in the vote market rather than focusing on issues, principles, programs, and platforms.<br><br>Several possible, albeit conflicting, effects of surveys on voter behavior have been postulated:<br><br>First, there is the <b><i>bandwagon effect</i></b> where "electors rally to support the candidate leading in the polls."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This "assumes that knowledge of a popular 'tide' will likely change voting intentions in [favor] of the frontrunner, that many electors feel more comfortable supporting a popular choice or that people accept the perceived collective wisdom of others as being enough reason for supporting a candidate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Second, there is the <b><i>underdog effect</i></b> where "electors rally to support the candidate trailing in the polls."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This shift can be motivated by sympathy for the perceived underdog.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Third, there is the <b><i>motivating effect</i></b> where "individuals who had not intended to vote are persuaded to do so,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> having been alerted to the fact of an election's imminence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Fourth, there is also the <b><i>demotivating effect</i></b> where "voters abstain from voting out of certainty that their candidate or party will win[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Fifth, there are reports of a behavior known as <b><i>strategic voting</i></b> where "voting is influenced by the chances of winning[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Lastly, there is also the theory of a <b><i>free-will effect</i></b> where "voters cast their ballots to prove the polls wrong[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Election surveys published during election periods create the "politics of expectations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Voters act in accordance with what is perceived to be an existing or emerging state of affairs with respect to how candidates are faring.<br><br>Of the six (6) effects, the bandwagon effect has a particular resonance and has been of concern. Surveys, or opinion polls, "by directly influencing individual-level support . . . , can be self-fulfilling prophecies and produce opinion cascades."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> "[A] poll's prediction may come to pass not only because it measures public opinion but also because it may influence public opinion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The bandwagon effect is of particular concern because of the observed human tendency to conform. Three (3) mechanisms through which survey results may induce conformity have been posited:<br><br><blockquote>(1) normative social influence, or people's desire to adopt the majority position in order to feel liked and accepted or believe they are on the winning team;<br><br>(2) informational social influence, or people learning from the 'wisdom of crowds' via social proof because they 'believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate . . . and will help [them] choose an appropriate course of action'; and<br><br>(3) people resolving cognitive dissonance by switching to the side they infer is going to win based on the poll.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Likewise, it has been argued that the bandwagon effect is but the obverse of the so-called false-consensus effect or false-consensus bias:<br><br><blockquote>The bandwagon effect, a form of conformity, is the mirror image of the false consensus effect, where people misperceive that their own behaviors and attitudes are more popular than they actually are. In the political domain, one mechanism underlying the false consensus effect is wishful thinking - people gaining utility from thinking their candidate is ahead or their opinions are popular.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br>The bandwagon effect induced by election surveys assumes even greater significance in considering the health of a democracy.<br><br>Integral to our appreciation of democracy is the recognition that democracy is fundamentally deliberative. It is rooted in the exchange and dialogue of ideas. Accordingly, free expression, not least of all from the minority and from those who do not conform, i.e., those who dissent and criticize, is indispensable:<br><br><blockquote>Proponents of the political theory on "deliberative democracy" submit that "substantial, open, [and] ethical dialogue is a critical, and indeed defining, feature of a good polity." This theory may be considered broad, but it definitely "includes [a] collective decision making with the participation of all who will be affected by the decision." It anchors on the principle that the cornerstone of every democracy is that sovereignty resides in the people. To ensure order in running the state's affairs, sovereign powers were delegated and individuals would be elected or nominated in key government positions to represent the people. On this note, the theory on deliberative democracy may evolve to the right of the people to make government accountable. Necessarily, this includes the right of the people to criticize acts made pursuant to governmental functions.<br><br>Speech that promotes dialogue on public affairs, or airs out grievances and political discontent, should thus be protected and encouraged.<br><br>Borrowing the words of Justice Brandeis, "it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies."<br><br>In this jurisdiction, this court held that "[t]he interest of society and the maintenance of good government demand a full discussion of public affairs."

On the legislature and studying emerging contrasts in the composition of its two chambers — the Senate and the House of Representatives — it has been noted:<br><br><blockquote>The old political families, however are not as strong in the Senate as they are in the House. This could be read, if not as a total repudiation by voters of family power, then at least as an attempt by them to tap other sources of national leadership. Celebrities and military and police officers have emerged as alternatives to traditional politicians. It could be that these new men and women have captured the popular imagination or that they are more in tune with the public pulse. But their emergence could very well be seen as an indication of the paucity of choices: Political parties, for one, have not succeeded in proffering a wider range of options to an electorate weary of trapos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></blockquote><br>This celebritification nurtures misleading notions of an enhanced or healthier democracy, one that opens avenues to a crop of political leaders not belonging to oligarchic families. Viewed critically however, this is nothing more than a pipe dream. New elites now share the political stage with the old. The tension between two contrary tendencies actually serves to preserve the status quo of elitism — an expanded elitism perhaps, but elitism no less. To evoke a truism, "the more things change, the more they stay the same":<br><br><blockquote>But the "celebritification" of the Senate can also be interpreted as the democratization of an exclusive body once reserved only for the very rich, the politically experienced, and the intellectually brilliant.

The first tendency is toward the new: The importance of name recall in national elections taking place in a media-inundated environment makes it easier for movie and media personalities, and harder for old-style politicians, to be elected. The second tendency is veering toward the old: At the district level, trapo-style patronage and machine politics remain deeply entrenched, giving political families the edge in elections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, where once there was elitism solely along lines of kinship — Alfred McCoy's so-called "anarchy of families" — now there is also elitism demarcated by name recall, populist projection, and media exposure, arguably, an "anarchy of celebrities."<br><br>Certainly, it is not the business of this court to engage in its own determination of the wisdom of policy. Nevertheless, having to grapple with the tasks of adjudication and interpretation, it has become necessary to bring to light the intent that underlies the disputed statutory provision, as well as the constitutional regime and social context, in which this provision is situated.<br><br><i>To reiterate, the inclusion of published election surveys in a statute that regulates election propaganda and other means through which candidates may shape voter preferences is itself telling of the recognition that published election surveys, too, may influence voter preferences. This inclusion is similarly telling of a recognition that, left unregulated, election surveys can undermine the purposes of ensuring "fair" elections. These recognitions are embedded in the Fair Election Act; they are not judicial constructs. In adjudicating with these' as bases, this court is merely adhering to the legislative imperative.</i><br><br><center>IV</center><br>It is necessary that the Fair Election Act be appreciated for what it is: a mechanism for ensuring equality. The Fair Election Act is a means to effect the "necessary condition" to a genuine democratic dialogue, to realizing a deliberative democracy. The concept of this "necessary condition" was previously considered by this court in <i>Diocese of Bacolod v. COMELEC</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In his seminal work, <i>Repressive Tolerance</i>, philosopher and social theorist Herbert Marcuse recognized how institutionalized inequality exists as a background limitation, rendering freedoms exercised within such limitation as merely "protecting] the already established machinery of discrimination." In his view, any improvement "in the normal course of events" within an unequal society, without subversion, only strengthens existing interests of those in power and control.<br><br>In other words, abstract guarantees of fundamental rights like freedom of expression may become meaningless if not taken in a real context. This tendency to tackle rights in the abstract compromises liberties. In his words:<br><br>Liberty is selfi-determination, autonomy—this is almost a tautology, but a tautology which results from a whole series of synthetic judgments. It stipulates the ability to determine one's own life: to be able to determine what to do and what not to do, what to suffer and what not. But the subject of this autonomy is never the contingent, private individual as that which he actually is or happens to be; it is rather the individual as a human being who is capable of being free with the others. And the problem of making possible such a harmony between every individual liberty and the other is not that of finding a compromise between competitors, or between freedom and law, between general and individual interest, common and private welfare in an established society, but of creating the society in which man is no longer enslaved by institutions which vitiate self-determination from the beginning. In other words, freedom is still to be created even for the freest of the existing societies.<br><br>Marcuse suggests that the democratic argument — with all opinions presented to and deliberated by the people — "implies a necessary condition, namely, that the people must be capable of deliberating and choosing on the basis of knowledge, that they must have access to authentic information, and that, on this basis, their evaluation must be the result of autonomous thought'." He submits that "[different opinions and 'philosophies' can no longer compete peacefully for adherence and persuasion on rational grounds: the 'marketplace of ideas' is organized and delimited by those who determine the national and the individual interest."<br><br>A slant toward left manifests from his belief that "there is a 'natural right' of resistance for oppressed and overpowered minorities to use extralegal means if the legal ones have proved to be inadequate." Marcuse, thus, stands for an equality that breaks away and transcends from established hierarchies, power structures, and indoctrinations. The tolerance of libertarian society he refers to as "repressive tolerance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></blockquote><br>What is involved here is petitioners' freedom of speech and of expression, that is, to publish their findings. More specifically, what is involved here is their right to political speech, that which "refers to speech 'both intended and received as a contribution to public deliberation about some issue,' 'foster[ing] informed and civic-minded deliberation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The nature of the speech involved, as well as the Fair Election Act's purpose of ensuring political equality, calls into operation the equality-based approach to weighing <i>liberty</i> to express vis-a-vis <i>equality</i> of opportunities. As explained in <i>Diocese of Bacolod</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In an equality-based approach, "politically disadvantaged speech prevails over regulation[,] but regulation promoting political equality prevails over speech." This view allows the government leeway to redistribute or equalize 'speaking power,' such as protecting, even implicitly subsidizing, unpopular or dissenting voices often systematically subdued within society's ideological ladder. This view acknowledges that there are dominant political actors who, through authority, power, resources, identity, or status, have capabilities that may drown out the messages of others. This is especially true in a developing or emerging economy that is part of the majoritarian world like ours.<br><br>. . . <br><br>The scope of the guarantee of free expression takes into consideration the constitutional respect for human potentiality and the effect of speech. It valorizes the ability of human beings to express and their necessity to relate. On the other hand, a complete guarantee must also take into consideration the effects it will have in a deliberative democracy. Skewed distribution of resources as well as the cultural hegemony of the majority may have the effect of drowning out the speech and the messages of those in the minority. In a sense, social inequality does have its effect on the exercise and effect of the guarantee of free speech. Those who have more will have better access to media that reaches a wider audience than those who have less. Those who espouse the more popular ideas will have better reception than the subversive and the dissenters of society. To be really heard and understood, the marginalized view normally undergoes its own degree of struggle.<br><br>The traditional view has been to tolerate the viewpoint of the speaker and the content of his or her expression. This view, thus, restricts laws or regulation that allows public officials to make judgments of the value of such viewpoint or message content. This should still be the principal approach.<br><br>However, the requirements of the Constitution regarding equality in opportunity must provide limits to some expression during electoral campaigns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></blockquote><br>The required judicial temperament in appraising speech in the context of electoral campaigns <i>which is principally designed to endorse a candidate</i>, both by candidates and / or political parties, on the one hand, and private citizens, on the other, has thus been articulated:<br><br><blockquote>Thus clearly, regulation of speech in the context of electoral campaigns made by candidates or the members of their political parties or their political parties may be regulated as to time, place, and manner. This is the effect of our rulings in <i>Osmeña v. COMELEC</i> and <i>National Press Club v. COMELEC</i>.<br><br>Regulation of speech in the context of electoral campaigns made by persons who are not candidates or who do not speak as members of a political party which are, taken as a whole, principally advocacies of a social issue that the public must consider during elections is unconstitutional. Such regulation is inconsistent with the guarantee of according the fullest possible range of opinions coming from the electorate including those that can catalyze candid, uninhibited, and robust debate in the criteria for the choice of a candidate.<br><br>This does not mean that there cannot be a specie of speech by a private citizen which will not amount to an election paraphernalia to be validly regulated by law.<br><br><i>Regulation of election paraphernalia will still be constitutionally valid if it reaches into speech of persons who are not candidates or who do not speak as members of a political party if they are not candidates, only if what is regulated is declarative speech that, taken as a whole, has for its principal object the endorsement of a candidate only. The regulation (a) should be provided by law, (b) reasonable, (c) narrowly tailored to meet the objective of enhancing the opportunity of all candidates to be heard and considering the primacy of the guarantee of free expression, and (d) demonstrably the least restrictive means to achieve that object. The regulation must only be with respect to the time, place, and manner of the rendition of the message. In no situation may the speech be prohibited or censored on the basis of its content. For this purpose, it will not matter whether the speech is made with or on private property</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> [Emphasis in the original]</blockquote><br><center>V<br></center><br>Concededly, what is involved here is not election propaganda per se. Election surveys, on their face, do not state or allude to preferred candidates. As a means, election surveys are ambivalent. To an academician, they are an aggrupation of data. To a journalist, they are matters for reportage. To a historian, they form part of a chronicle. Election surveys thus become unambiguous only when viewed in relation to the end for which they are employed. To those whose end is to get a candidate elected, election surveys, when limited to their own private consumption, are a means to formulate strategy. <i>When published, however, the tendency to shape voter preferences comes into play</i>. In this respect, published election surveys partake of the nature of election propaganda. It is then declarative speech in the context of an electoral campaign properly subject to regulation. Hence, Section 5.2 of the Fair Election Act's regulation of <i>published</i> surveys.<br><br>We thus proceed to evaluate Resolution No. 9674's requirement of disclosing the names of subscribers to election surveys in light of the requisites for valid regulation of declarative speech by private entities in the context of an election campaign:<br><br>First, the text of Section 5.2(a) of the Fair Election Act supports the inclusion of subscribers among those persons who "paid for the survey[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Thus, Resolution No. 9674 is a regulation finding basis in statute.<br><br>COMELEC correctly points out that in Section 5.2(a) of the Fair Election Act, those who "commissioned" and those who "paid for" the published survey are separated by the disjunctive term "or."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> This disassociates those who "commissioned" from those who "paid for" and identifies them as alternatives to each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Section 5.2(a) thus requires the disclosure of two (2) classes of persons: "[first,] those who commissioned or sponsored the survey; and [second,] those who paid for the survey."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>The second class makes no distinction between those who pay for a specific survey and those who pay for election surveys in general. Indeed, subscribers do not escape the burden of paying for the component articles comprising a subscription. They may pay for them in aggregate, but they pay for them just the same. From the text of Section 5.2(a), the legislative intent or regulatory concern is clear: "those who have financed, one way or another, the [published] survey"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> must be disclosed.<br><br>Second, not only an important or substantial state interest but even a compelling one reasonably grounds Resolution No. 9674's inclusion of subscribers to election surveys. Thus, regardless of whether an intermediate or a strict standard is used, Resolution No. 9674 passes scrutiny.<br><br>It is settled that constitutionally declared principles are a compelling state interest:<br><br><blockquote>Compelling governmental interest would include constitutionally declared principles. We have held, for example, that "the welfare of children and the State's mandate to protect and care for them, as <i>parens patriae</i>, constitute a substantial and compelling government interest in regulating . . . utterances in TV broadcast."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, we have established that the regulation of election surveys effects the constitutional policy, articulated in Article II, Section 26, and reiterated and affirmed in Article IX-C, Section 4 and Article XIII, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution, of "guarantee[ing] equal access to opportunities for public service[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>Resolution No. 9674 addresses the reality that an election survey is formative as it is descriptive. It can be a means to shape the preference of voters and, thus, the outcome of elections. In the hands of those whose end is to get a candidate elected, it is a means for such end and partakes of the nature of election propaganda. Accordingly, the imperative of "fair" elections impels their regulation.<br><br>Lastly, Resolution No. 9674 is "narrowly tailored to meet the objective of enhancing the opportunity of all candidates to be heard and considering the primacy of the guarantee of free expression"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> and is "demonstrably the least restrictive means to achieve that object."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>While it does regulate expression (i.e., petitioners' publication of election surveys), it does not go so far as to suppress desired expression. There is neither prohibition nor censorship specifically aimed at election surveys. The freedom to publish election surveys remains.

There is only room for application."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>Clarifications, however, are in order.<br><br>First, <b><i>verba legis</i></b> or the so-called plain-meaning rule applies only when the law is <i>completely</i> clear, such that there is <i>absolutely</i> no room for interpretation. Its application is premised on a situation where the words of the legislature are clear that its intention, insofar as the facts of a case demand from the point of view of a contemporary interpretative community, is neither vague nor ambiguous. This is a matter of judicial appreciation. It cannot apply merely on a party's contention of supposed clarity and lack of room for interpretation.<br><br>This is descriptive of the situation here.<br><br>Interestingly, both COMELEC and petitioners appeal to what they (respectively) construe to be plainly evident from Section 5.2(a)'s text: on the part of COMELEC, that the use of the words "paid for" evinces no distinction between direct purchasers and those who purchase via subscription schemes; and, on the part of petitioners, that Section 5.2(a)'s desistance from actually using the word "subscriber" means that subscribers are beyond its contemplation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> The variance in the parties' positions, considering that they are both banking on what they claim to be the Fair Election Act's plain meaning, is the best evidence of an extant ambiguity.<br><br>Second, statutory construction cannot lend itself to pedantic rigor that foments absurdity. The dangers of inordinate insistence on literal interpretation are commonsensical and need not be belabored. These dangers are by no means endemic to legal interpretation. Even in everyday conversations, misplaced literal interpretations are fodder for humor. A fixation on technical rules of grammar is no less innocuous. A pompously doctrinaire' approach to text can stifle, rather than facilitate, the legislative wisdom that unbridled textualism purports to bolster.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br>Third, the assumption that there is, in all cases, a universal plain language is erroneous. In reality, universality and uniformity of meaning is a rarity. A contrary belief wrongly assumes that language is static.<br><br>The more appropriate and more effective approach is, thus, holistic rather than parochial: to consider context and the interplay of the historical, the contemporary, and even the envisioned. Judicial interpretation entails the convergence of social realities and social ideals. The latter are meant to be effected by the legal apparatus, chief of which is the bedrock of the prevailing legal order: the Constitution. Indeed, the word in the vernacular that describes the Constitution — <i>saligan</i> — demonstrates this imperative of constitutional primacy.<br><br>Thus, we refuse to read Section 5.2(a) of the Fair Election Act in isolation. Here, we consider not an abstruse provision but a stipulation that is part of the whole, i.e., the statute of which it is a part, that is aimed at realizing the ideal of <i>fair</i> elections. We consider not a cloistered provision but a norm that should have a present authoritative effect to achieve the ideals of those who currently read, depend on, and demand fealty from the Constitution.<br><br><center>VII<br></center><br>We note with favor COMELEC's emphasis on the "wide latitude of discretion"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> granted to it in the performance of its constitutional duty to "[e]nforce and administer all laws arid regulations relative to the conduct of an election[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> But this is with the caution that it does not reach "grave abuse of discretion[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br><i>Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> had the following to say regarding factual findings made by COMELEC, an independent constitutional organ:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he rule that factual findings of administrative bodies will not be disturbed by courts of justice except when there is absolutely no evidence or no substantial evidence in support of such findings should be applied with greater force when it concerns the COMELEC, as the framers of the Constitution intended to place the COMELEC—created and explicitly made independent by the Constitution itself—on a level higher than statutory administrative organs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></blockquote><br>Proceeding from this, we emphasize that this norm of deference applies not only to factual findings. This applies with equal force to independent constitutional organs' general exercise of their functions. The constitutional placing of independent constitutional organs on a plane higher than those of administrative agencies created only by statute is not restricted to competence in fact-finding. It extends to all purposes for which the Constitution created them.<br><br>We reiterate, however, that our recognition of this deferential norm is made with caution. This rule of deference does not give independent constitutional organs, like COMELEC, license to gravely abuse their discretion. With respect to rule-making, while the wisdom of "subordinate legislation" or the rule-making power of agencies tasked with the administration of government is acknowledged, rule-making agencies are not given unfettered power to promulgate rules. As explained in <i>Gerochi v. Department of Energy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> it is imperative that subordinate legislation "be germane to the objects and purposes of the law and that the regulation be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> A regulation that purports to effect a statute but goes beyond the bounds of that statute is <i>ultra vires</i>; it is in excess of the rule-making agency's competence. Thus, it is void and ineffectual.<br><br>This is not the case here. There is no grave abuse of discretion. Resolution No. 9674 serves a constitutional purpose and works well within the bounds of the Constitution and of statute.<br><br><center>VIII</center><br>Petitioners argue that Resolution No. 9674 constitutes a prior restraint in that:<br><br><blockquote>Resolution No. 9674 makes it an election offense for a survey firm not to disclose the names of subscribers who have paid substantial amounts to them, even if ihe survey portions provided to them have not been published. 1'his requirement is unduly burdensome and onerous and constitutes a prior restraint on the right of survey firms to gather information on public opinion and disseminate it to the citizenry.<br><br>. . . If Resolution No. 9674 is allowed to stand, survey firms will no longer be able to operate because they will not have enough clients and will not be financially sustainable. COMELEC will finally be able to do indirectly what it could not do directly, which is to prohibit the conduct of election surveys and the publication or dissemination of the results to the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners' assertions are erroneous.<br><br><i>Chavez v. Gonzales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> explained the concept of prior restraint as follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>Prior restraint refers to official governmental restrictions on the press or other forms of expression in advance of actual publication or dissemination</i>. Freedom from prior restraint is largely freedom from government censorship of publications, whatever the form of censorship, and regardless of whether it is wielded by the executive, legislative or judicial branch of the government. Thus, it precludes governmental acts that required approval of a proposal to publish; licensing or permits as prerequisites to publication including the payment of license taxes for the privilege to publish; and even injunctions against publication. Even the closure of the business and printing offices of certain newspapers, resulting in the discontinuation of their printing and publication, are deemed as previous restraint or censorship. Any law or official that requires some form of permission to be had before publication can be made, commits an infringement of the constitutional right, and remedy can be had at the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The very definition of "prior restraint" negates petitioner's assertions. Resolution No. 9674 poses no prohibition or censorship specifically aimed at election surveys. Apart from regulating the manner of publication, petitioners remain free to publish election surveys. COMELEC correctly points out that "[t]he disclosure requirement kicks in <i>only upon, not prior to,</i> publication."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>In any case, the requirement of disclosing subscribers is neither unduly burdensome nor onerous. Prior to the promulgation of Resolution No. 9674, survey firms were already understood to be bound by the requirement to disclose those who commissioned or paid for published election surveys. Petitioners have been complying with this without incident since the Fair Election Act was enacted in 2001. After more than a decade of compliance, it is odd for petitioners to suddenly assail the disclosure requirement as unduly burdensome or onerous.<br><br>Petitioners' claim that "[i]f Resolution No. 9674 is allowed to stand, survey firms will no longer be able to operate because they will not have enough clients and will not be financially sustainable"<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[130]</sup></font> is too speculative and conjectural to warrant our consideration. The assumption is that persons who want to avail of election survey results will automatically be dissuaded from doing so when there is a requirement of submission of their names during the campaign period. This is neither self-evident, nor a presumption that is susceptible to judicial notice. There is no evidence to establish a causal connection.<br><br>Petitioners' free speech rights must be weighed in relation to the Fair Election Act's purpose of ensuring political equality and, therefore, the speech of others who want to participate unencumbered in our political spaces. On one hand, there are petitioners' right to publish and publications which are attended by the interests of those who can employ published data to their partisan ends. On the other, there is regulation that may effect equality and, thus, strengthen the capacity of those on society's margins or those who grope for resources to engage in the democratic dialogue. The latter fosters the ideals of deliberative democracy. It does not trump the former; rather, it provides the environment where the survey group's free speech rights should reside.<br><br><center>IX<br></center><br>Petitioners argue that Resolution No. 9674 violates Article III, Section 10 of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> They claim that it "unduly interferes with [their] existing contracts . . . by forcing [them] to disclose information that, under the contracts, is confidential or privileged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>For its part, COMELEC argues that "[t]he non-impairment clause of the Constitution must yield to the loftier purposes sought to be achieved by the government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> It adds that "[petitioners' existing contracts with third parties must be understood to have been made in reference to the possible exercise of the COMELEC's regulatory powers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>It is settled that "the constitutional guaranty of non-impairment... is limited by the exercise of the police power of the State, in the interest of public health, safety, morals and general welfare."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> "It is a basic rule in contracts that the law is deemed written into the contract between the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> The incorporation of regulations into contracts is "a postulate of the police power of the State."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>The relation of the state's police power to the principle of non-impairment of contracts was thoroughly explained in <i>Ortigas and Co.

Invariably described as "the most essential, insistent, and illimitable of powers" and "in a sense, the greatest and most powerful attribute of government," the exercise of the power may be judicially inquired into and corrected only if it is capricious, whimsical, unjust or unreasonable, there having been a denial of due process or a violation of any other applicable constitutional guarantee. As this Court held through Justice Jose P.

COMELEC's further reasoning that what Resolution No. 9674 intends to implement is Resolution No. 9615 and not the Fair Election Act itself is nothing but a circuitous denial of Resolution No. 9674's true nature. COMELEC's reasoning is its own admission that the assailed Resolution supplements what the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Fair Election Act provides. Ultimately, Resolution No. 9674 also implements the Fair Election Act and must, thus, comply with the requirements of its Section 13.<br><br>Accordingly, Resolution No. 9674 could not have become effective as soon as it was published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Star on April 25, 2013. Taking into consideration the seven-day period required by Section 13, the soonest that it could have come into effect was on May 2, 2013.<br><br>This notwithstanding, petitioners were not bound to comply with the requirement "to submit within three (3) days from receipt of this Resolution the names of all commissioners and payors of surveys published from February 12, 2013 to the date of the promulgation of this Resolution[.]"<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[147]</sup></font> As shall be discussed, COMELEC's (continuing) failure to serve copies of Resolution No. 9674 on petitioners prevented this three-day period from even commencing.<br><br><center>XI<br></center><br>Petitioners point out that they were never served copies of Resolution No. 9674. Thus, they claim that this Resolution's self-stated three-day period within which they must comply has not begun to run and that COMELEC's insistence on their compliance violates their right to due process. They add that COMELEC has also failed to provide them with copies of the criminal complaint subject of E.O. Case No. 13-222 for which the Subpoena dated July 1, 2013 was issued against them.<br><br>COMELEC, however, insists that "[petitioners were given fair notice of the Resolution"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> in that:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he-Notice dated 08 May 2013 sent to and received by petitioners not only makes reference to the Resolution by its number and title but also indicates its date of promulgation, the two newspapers of general circulation in which it was published, it date of publication, and, more important [sic], reproduces in full its dispositive portion[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup></blockquote><br>COMELEC adds that, in any case, petitioners were "able to secure a certified true copy of the [assailed] Resolution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> On the filing of a criminal complaint, COMELEC asserts that attached to the Subpoena served on petitioners was a copy of Resolution No. 13-0739 of the COMELEC En Bane which "provides a verbatim reproduction of the Memorandum of the Director of the Law Department detailing petitioners' failure to comply with the assailed Resolution and of the Memorandum of Commissioner [Christian Robert S.] Lim submitting the matter for the appropriate action of the COMELEC en bane."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br>COMELEC relies on infirm reasoning and reveals how, in criminally charging petitioners, it acted arbitrarily, whimsically, and capriciously, and violated petitioners' right to due process.<br><br>By its own reasoning, COMELEC admits that petitioners were never actually served copies of Resolution No. 9674 <i>after it was promulgated on April 23, 2013</i>. It insists, however, that this flaw has been remedied by service to petitioners of the May 8, 2013 Notice which reproduced Resolution No. 9674's dispositive portion.<br><br>Dismembering an official issuance by producing only a portion of it (even if the reproduced portion is the most significant, i.e., dispositive, portion) is not the same as serving on the concerned parties a copy of the official issuance itself. Petitioners may have been informed of what the dispositive portion stated, but it remains that they were never notified and served copies of the assailed Resolution itself. In Resolution No. 9674's own words, compliance was expected "within three (3) days from receipt of <i>this Resolution</i>[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> not of its partial, dismembered, reproduction.<br><br>Not having been served with copies of Resolution No. 9674 itself, petitioners are right in construing the three-day period for compliance as not having begun to run.

Thus, there was no basis for considering petitioners to have committed an election offense arising from this alleged violation.<br><br>It is of no consequence that the May 8, 2013 Notice warned petitioners that failure to comply with it "shall constitute an election offense punishable under the first and second paragraphs of Section 264 of the Omnibus Election Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> It is true that the Omnibus Election Code has been in force and effect long before Resolution No. 9674 was promulgated; nevertheless, the supposed violation of the Omnibus Election Code rests on petitioners' alleged non-compliance with Resolution No. 9674. This is a matter which, as we have demonstrated, is baseless, the three-day period for compliance not having even commenced.<br><br>It is similarly inconsequential that petitioners were subsequently able to obtain certified true copies of Resolution No. 9674. Petitioners' own diligence in complying with the formal requirements of Rule 65 petitions filed before this court cannot possibly be the cure for COMELEC's inaction. These certified true copies were secured precisely to enable petitioners to assail COMELEC's actions, not to validate them. It would be misguided to subscribe to COMELEC's suggestion that petitioners' diligence should be their own undoing. To accede to this would be to effectively intimidate parties with legitimate grievances against government actions from taking the necessary steps to comply with (formal) requisites for judicial remedies and, ultimately, prevent them from protecting their rights.<br><br>COMELEC's error is compounded by its failure to provide petitioners with copies of the criminal complaint subject of E.O. Case No. 13-222. COMELEC has neither alleged nor proven that it has done so. Per its own allegations, all it did was serve petitioners with the May 8, 2013 Notice and the July 1, 2013 Subpoena.<br><br>These facts considered, it was not only grave error, but grave abuse of discretion, for COMELEC to pursue unfounded criminal charges against petitioners.
