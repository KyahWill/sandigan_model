Santos, Jr. (Santos), along with one Roberto C. Esquivel (Esquivel), were among the candidates fielded by the Liberal Party (LP) to vie for local elective posts in Norzagaray, Bulacan, during the 13 May 2013 elections. Germar ran for the position of mayor, Santos ran for the position of councilor, and Esquivel ran for the position of vice-mayor.<br><br>Petitioner Feliciano P. Legaspi, on the other hand, was the National Unity Party's (NUP's) bet for mayor of Norzagaray during the 2013 polls.<br><br><center><i><u>The Election Results and the Petition for Disqualification</u></i></center><br>After the votes cast by the Norzagaray electorate were tallied, Germar emerged as the highest vote getter in the mayoralty race. Santos, for his part, also appeared to have secured enough votes to be the second councilor of the municipality. Esquivel, though, failed in his bid to become vice-mayor of Norzagaray.<br><br>Upon learning about the results of the tally, petitioner immediately filed before the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) of Norzagaray a motion to suspend the proclamation of Germar and Santos as winning candidates. Such motion, however, proved to be futile.<br><br>At exactly 7:45 a.m. on 14 May 2013, despite the petitioner's motion, the MBC proclaimed Germar and Santos as duly elected mayor and councilor of the municipality of Norzagaray, respectively.<br><br>A few hours<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> after the said proclamation, petitioner filed before the COMELEC a <i>Petition for Disqualification </i>against Germar, Santos, and Esquivel. In it, petitioner accused Germar, Santos, and Esquivel of having engaged in rampant vote buying during the days leading to the elections.<br><br>The <i>Petition for Disqualification</i> was docketed as SPA No. 13-323 (DC) and was assigned to the COMELEC First Division, then composed of Commissioners Lucenito N. Tagle (Commissioner Tagle), Christian Robert S. Lim (Commissioner Christian Lim) and Al A. Parreño (Commissioner Parreño).<br><br><center><u><i>COMELEC First Division and Special First Division</i></u></center><br>In due course, the COMELEC First Division took a vote on SPA No. 13-323 (DC). The vote of the division was an even 1-1 split, with Commissioner Tagle voting in favor of granting the petition for disqualification, but with Commissioner Christian Lim voting against it. The third member of the division, <i>i.e.</i>, Commissioner Parreño, was not able to provide the potential tie-breaking vote as he was then absent and attending to some other official business.<br><br>Due to the impasse created by the absence of one of its members, the COMELEC First Division called for the constitution of a <i>Special First Division</i> through which COMELEC Chairman Sixto S. Brillantes, Jr. sat in the First Division as acting member <i>vice</i> the absent Commissioner Parreño for purposes of SPA No. 13-323 (DC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On 3 October 2013, the COMELEC Special First Division, by a 2 to 1 vote, rendered a resolution: (1) disqualifying Germar and Santos for the positions of mayor and councilor, respectively, of Norzagaray; and (2) referring the criminal aspect of SPA No. 13-323 (DC) to the COMELEC Law Department for preliminary investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Germar, Santos, and Esquivel filed a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>.<br><br><center><i><u>The COMELEC En Banc and the Dismissal of the Electoral Aspect of SPA<br>No. 13-323 (DC)</u></i></center><br><br>On 10 July 2004, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> took a vote on the motion for reconsideration.

He protests that the dismissal was occasioned by a "misapplication" by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> of Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b><center>OUR RULING<br></center></b><br>We dismiss the present petition.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Let us start with the basics.<br><br>Section 7 of Article 1X-A of the Constitution obliges the COMELEC, like the other constitutional commissions, to decide all cases or matters before it by a "<i>majority vote of all its [m]embers.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> When such majority vote cannot be mustered by the COMELEC <i>en banc,</i> Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules provides the mechanism to avert a non-decision. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 6. <i>Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided. </i>- When the Commission <i>en banc</i> is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached, the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and in all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied.</blockquote><br>Verily, under the cited provision, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> is first required to rehear the case or matter that it cannot decide or resolve by the necessary majority. When a majority still cannot be had after the rehearing, however, there results a failure to decide on the part of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. The provision then specifies the<b> effects </b>of the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i>, failure to decide:<br><br><ol><li>If the action or proceeding is <i>originally commenced</i> in the COMELEC, <b>such action or proceeding shall be dismissed;</b><br><br></li><li> In <i>appealed</i> cases, <b>the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; </b>or<br><br></li><li> In <i>incidental matters</i>, <b>the petition or motion shall be denied</b>.</li></ol><br>As can be gleaned above, the effects of the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> failure to decide vary depending on the <i>type of case or matter </i>that is before the commission. Thus, under the provision, the <b>first effect</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, the dismissal of the action or proceeding) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an action or proceeding "<i>originally commenced in the commission";</i> the <b>second effect</b> (<i>i.e</i>., the affirmance of a judgment or order) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an "appealed case"; and the <b>third effect</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, the denial of the petition or motion) only applies when the case or matter before the COMELEC is an "<i>incidental matter</i>."<br><br><i>Mendoza v. Commission on Elections, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> gives us a key illustration of an application of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><i>Mendoza</i> involved an electoral protest that was originally filed before the COMELEC and which was raffled to one of its divisions. The COMELEC division to which the electoral protest was assigned granted that protest, prompting the protestee to file a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. When the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>took a vote on the motion for reconsideration, however, it foiled to obtain the necessary majority vote. Consequently, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> reheard the matter and then took another vote. However, the second vote also lacked the necessary majority. The final vote of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> was 3-1 (<i>i.e</i>., 3 in support of granting the protest and 1 dissent), with 3 members taking no part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On the basis of the foregoing, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> issued a resolution denying the motion for reconsideration (in effect sustaining the division's decision). The protestee challenged the foregoing resolution on the strength of the argument that the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to obtain the necessary majority should have resulted in the dismissal of the election protest case itself pursuant to the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br>When that dispute reached this Court in <i>Mendoza</i>, we sustained the protestee. We held that the first effect applied because the case before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> was an electoral protest that was "<i>originally commenced</i>" in the commission. We noted that while the electoral protest only reached the COMELEC<i> en banc</i> through the motion for reconsideration of the decision of a division, the same did not change the nature of the case before it; the motion for reconsideration not being an appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, we held that the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>to decide the motion for reconsideration would result—not in the denial of the said motion or the affirmance of the division's decision—but in the dismissal of the electoral protest itself, pursuant to the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing precepts, we shall now address the issues at hand.<br><br><b><center>II</center></b><br>The main thrust of petitioner's challenge is the supposed error of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> in applying the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules (by dismissing the electoral aspect of SPA No. 13-323 [DC]) when it was unable to reach a majority vote after the rehearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> According to petitioner, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> erred in treating SPA No. 13-323 (DC) as an action that was "<i>originally commenced in the commission</i>" under the said provision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As petitioner argues, an action can only be considered as having been "<i>originally commenced in the commission'</i>' under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules when that action was originally filed before the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>itself and, as such, is the very matter pending before it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioner then points out that, in this case, what was before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> was not the main petition itself but only a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the division in SPA No. 13-323 (DC). Hence, petitioner submits, the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to reach a majority vote in this case should result, not in the dismissal of the electoral aspect of SPA No. 13-323 (DC), but merely in the denial of the motion for reconsideration and the affirmance of the division's decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> did not err when it dismissed the electoral aspect of SPA No. 13-323 (DC) when it was unable to reach a majority vote after the rehearing. Contrary to what petitioner asserts, SPA No. 13-323 (DC) is most definitely an action that was filed originally before the COMELEC within the contemplation of the said provision. While SPA No. 13-323 (DC) reached the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> only through a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Special First Division, its character as an original case filed before the commission remains the same. Hence, the failure of COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to decide in this case properly results in the application of the first effect of Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><b><i>SPA No. 13-323 (DC) is an<br>Action "Originally Commenced in<br>the Commission" Under Section 6,<br>Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules</i></b><br><br>Petitioner, to begin with, misconstrues Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br>The phrase <i>"originally commenced in the commission"</i> in Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules is worded in plain language and, therefore, must be construed in its ordinary and natural sense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It simply means what it says. The phrase is meant to cover any action or proceeding that is filed, at the first instance, before the COMELEC—whether sitting in division or <i>en banc</i>—as contradistinguished from cases that are merely appealed to it. Petitioner's view that restricts such phrase to include only those actions or proceedings that are originally filed with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> itself (e.g., petition to declare failure of elections) has no basis and only obscures the otherwise clear import of the phrase's language.<br><br>In this case, the fact that SPA No. 13-323 (DC) is an action originally commenced in the COMELEC cannot at all be doubted. The records are crystal clear that the petition was first filed with the COMELEC and was raffled to the First Division for decision. It is a fresh petition—as it passed upon no other tribunal, body or entity prior to its filing with the COMELEC. Hence, for all intents and purposes, SPA No. 13-323 (DC) must be considered as an action "<i>originally commenced in the commission</i>" under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><b><i>Single Process of COMELEC in<br>Deciding Election Cases; COMELEC <br>en banc Correctly Dismissed <br>Electoral Aspect of SPA No. 13-323<br> (DC)</i></b><br><br>Petitioner's insistence that the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COME LEG Rules ought not to be applied since what was before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> was merely a motion for reconsideration and not the petition for disqualification itself, likewise has no merit. It is premised on the assumption that the proceedings in election cases before the COMELEC division are separate from those before the <i>en banc</i>—an assumption that has already been discredited by <i>Mendoza.</i><br><br>In <i>Mendoza</i>, we held that the COMELEC acts on election cases under a single and integrated process, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>[H]owever the jurisdiction of the COMELEC is involved, xxx, the COMELEC will act on the case in <b>one whole and single process: to repeat, in division, and if impelled by a motion for reconsideration, <i>en banc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></b></blockquote><br>In his concurring opinion in <i>Mendoza</i>, Justice Presbitero J. Velasco (Justice Velasco) described the act of filing a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> from a decision of a division in an election case as but "<i>part</i>" of such single and integrated process and is "<i>not an appeal</i>" from the latter to the former:<br><br><blockquote>At best, <b>the filing of a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> of a decision or resolution of the division of the COMELEC should be viewed as part of one integrated process</b>. Such motion for reconsideration before the COMELEC<i> en banc</i> is a constitutionally guaranteed remedial mechanism for parties aggrieved by a division decision or resolution. However, at the risk of repetition, it is not an appeal from the COMELEC division to the <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>Verily, when an election case originally filed with the COMELEC is first decided by a division, the subsequent filing of a motion for reconsideration from that decision before the<i> en banc</i> does not signify the initiation of a new action or case, but rather a mere continuation of an existing process. The motion for reconsideration—not being an appeal from the decision of the division to the <i>en banc</i>—only thus serves as a means of having the election case decided by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. Under this view, therefore, the nature of the election case as it was before the division remains the same even after it is forwarded to the <i>en banc </i>through a motion for reconsideration. Hence, the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to decide a motion for reconsideration from the decision of a division in an <i>original </i>election case would unquestionably bring to the fore the application of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br>This is exactly what happened in this case. In this case, SPA No. 13-323 (DC) was filed, at the first instance, with the COMELEC. Being a petition for disqualification filed under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> SPA No. 13-323 (DC) was initially raffled to and decided by a division of the commission. From that point, however, SPA No. 13-323 (DC) found its way to the COMELEC<i> en banc</i> after a motion for reconsideration from the decision of the division was filed. Hence, when the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> twice failed to reach the necessary majority to decide the electoral aspect of SPA No. 13-323 (DC), it applied the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules. We find absolutely nothing wrong with such application. It is, in fact, reinforced by the very provisions of the COMELEC Rules and by <i>Mendoza.</i><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>We next address the <i>contra</i> argument raised by Justice Velasco in his Dissenting Opinion.<br><br>Justice Velasco, in his dissent, shared petitioner's position that the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to reach a necessary majority in this case should have resulted merely in the denial of the motion for reconsideration and not in the dismissal of SPA No. 13-323 (DC) itself. The learned justice, however, justified the said position with an argument different from that advanced by petitioner: Justice Velasco, in essence, concedes that the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules applies in this case, but contends that the COMELEC<i> en banc</i> erred in <i>how</i> it applied the said provision.<br><br>Justice Velasco points out that the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules speaks of the dismissal of either an "<i>action"</i> or a "<i>proceeding</i>" — which, the good justice submits, supposedly pertains to different cases or matters that may be brought before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. After identifying what those matters are, Justice Velasco concluded that the word "<i>action</i>" as used under the subject provision has reference to the "<i>cases originally filed before the COMELEC division or en banc</i>" whilst the word "<i>proceeding</i>" under the same rule has reference to "<i>motions for reconsideration challenging the rulings</i> [of a division in election cases]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, Justice Velasco opines, the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>to reach a majority vote on a mere <i>motion for reconsideration</i> of a division decision in an original election case would - under the first effect of Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules - only lead to a dismissal of the "<i>proceeding</i>" or of the motion for reconsideration; not the dismissal of the <i>"action"</i> or of the election case itself.<br><br>Cognizant that the foregoing view is a betrayal of the principles laid down by the Court in <i>Mendoza</i>, Justice Velasco now clamors for a "<i>modification</i>" or an abandonment of our ruling in the said case insofar as how it applied the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Justice Velasco cautions the Court that pursuing <i>Mendoza's</i> interpretation of Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules is bound to lead to absurd and illogical results - such as one wherein a decision of a COMELEC division in an election case can simply be overturned by the COMELEC en banc even though the latter is not able to reach a majority vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Court is not convinced.<br><br><b><i>Meaning of the Words "Action" and <br>"Proceeding" Determinable From Other <br>Provisions of the COMELEC Rules; <br>Justice Velasco's Interpretation of the <br>Word "Proceeding" Contradicted By <br>COMELEC Rules, Taken As A Whole</i></b><br><br>The pin that holds Justice Velasco's argument is his interpretation of the terms "<i>action</i>" and "<i>proceeding</i>" under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules. While an isolated view of the contested terms does lend some degree of reason to the respected justice's interpretation, a more careful consideration of such terms in the context of the other parts of the COMELEC Rules, however, will quickly reveal the interpretation's fault. Verily, we are unable to accept it.<br><br>The words "<i>action</i>" and "<i>proceeding</i>" and even the entire phrase 'action or proceeding are not exclusive to Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules. Such words and phrase, in fact, appear in other parts of the COMELEC Rules, most notably in<b> Part V</b> thereof. To our minds, an examination of how the words "<i>action</i>" and "<i>proceeding</i>" and the phrase "<i>actions or proceedings</i>" were used in Part V of the COMELEC Rules is telling of how the COMELEC Rules actually intended such terms and phrase to be understood, which is, in the context of its other provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Part V of the COMELEC Rules, which is aptly titled "<i>Particular <b>Actions or Proceedings</b></i>" is one of the nine major parts of the COMELEC Rules. It is composed of Rules 20 to 34 of the COMELEC Rules, wherein each rule covers a specific "<i>action or proceeding</i>" that the COMELEC can take cognizance of, thus:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>COMELEC RULES OF PROCEDURE - PART V <br>PARTICULAR ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS</b><br></center><br><center>A. ORDINARY ACTIONS<br></center><ul><li>Rule 20 - Election Protests</li><li>Rule 21 - Quo Warranto</li><li>Rule 22 - Appeals from Decisions of Courts in Election Protest Cases</li></ul><br><center>B. SPECIAL ACTIONS<br></center><ul><li>Rule 23 - Petition to Deny Due Course To or Cancel Certificates of Candidacy</li><li>Rule 24 - Proceedings Against Nuisance Candidates</li><li>Rule 25 - Disqualification of Candidates</li><li>Rule 26 - Postponement of Suspension of Elections<br></li></ul><br><center>C.

ELECTION OFFENSES<br></center><ul><li>Rule 34 - Prosecution of Election Offenses</li></ul></blockquote>Evidently, what Part V actually discloses are the particular cases or matters that may be considered as "<i>actions or proceedings</i>" for purposes of the COMELEC Rules. Notably, all the actions or proceedings identified thereunder, save for the provisional remedy of injunction, are all <i>main</i> cases cognizable by the COMELEC. Notable too is that a <i>motion for reconsideration from a decision of a division</i> — which is but a part of a main case - is not among those included n Part V.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, we find Justice Velasco's formulation linking the term <i>"proceeding</i>" under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules with "<i>motions for reconsideration challenging the rulings</i> [of a division in election cases]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to be inconsistent with how such term was actually intended to be understood by the COMELEC Rules. Such a formulation, rooted as it was in an isolated analysis of the contested term, is out of touch with the rest of the provisions of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><b><i>Pursuing Mendoza Ruling <br>Will Not Lead to Absurdity </i></b><br><br>We likewise rebut Justice Velasco's submission that continuing with <i>Mendoza</i>'s interpretation of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules is bound to lead to absurd results.<br><br>To our minds, there is no "<i>absurdity</i>" in the fact that the decision of a division in an election case ceases to be a COMELEC decision as a consequence of the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to reach a majority vote on reconsideration. That fact, far from being absurd, is nothing but the natural and logical consequence of the application of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules which, in turn, only complements our Constitution.<br><br><b><center>IV<br></center></b><br>All told, we found no indications that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> had acted with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the electoral aspect of SPA No. 13-323 (DC).

Thus, prior to <i>Sevilla,</i> the Court, at first, in the December 1987 case of <i>Cua v.

He thus concludes that "[fjhree is not the majority of seven."<br><br>Had the framers intended that it should be the majority of the members who<i> participated or deliberated</i>, it would have clearly phrased it that way as it did with respect to the Supreme Court in Section 4(2), Article VIII of the Constitution:<br><br>x x x<br><br>For the foregoing reasons then, this Court hereby abandons the doctrine laid down in Cua and holds that the COMELEC En Banc <b>shall decide a case or matter brought before it by a majority vote of <i>"all its members," and NOT majority of the members who deliberated and voted thereon</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (words in brackets added)</blockquote><br>Justice Carpio-Morales would later on reiterate the ruling in <i>Estrella in Marcoleta v. COMELEC (Marcoleta)</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>From the 2-3 voting, it is readily discerned that the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> cannot overturn the First Division on mere two assenting votes. On the other hand, the same situation obtains in the case of the dissenters, there being a shortage of one vote to sustain the First Division's findings.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>Majority, in this case, means a vote of four members of the Comelec.</u> The Court in <i>Estrella v. Comelec </i>pronounced that Section 5 (a) of Rule 3 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure and Section 7 of Article IX-A of the Constitution require that a majority vote of <u>all the members</u> of the Comelec. and not only those who participated and took part in the deliberations, is necessary for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Verily, the four-vote requirement is the result of applying the plain-meaning rule or <i>verba legis</i> in interpreting Sec. 7, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution. This rule in statutory construction is expressed in the maxim,<i> index animi sermo</i>, or "speech is the index of intention." Furthermore, there is the maxim <i>verba legis non est recedendum,</i> or "from the words of a statute there should be no departure."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As the statute is clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Settled then is the rule that Sec. 7, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution, as couched, requires at least four (4) votes of the seven (7) members of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to rule on a pending incident before it. Failure to muster the threshold four (4) votes brings into play the application of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, which calls for a rehearing of the case.<br><br><b><i>The Decision of the COMELEC <br>division is affirmed by the failure to <br>obtain the necessary majority vote<br>from the COMELEC en banc</i></b><br><br>Recall that in dismissing the Petition for Disqualification, public respondent COMELEC applied <i>Mendoza</i>, wherein the Court ruled that the failure to secure the majority vote of all the members, despite rehearing, leads to the dismissal of the action, regardless of the ruling of the division, and despite obtaining the majority vote of those who participated in the deliberations. In <i>Mendoza,</i> therein petitioner Joselito R. Mendoza (Mendoza) was proclaimed winner of the 2007 gubernatorial election for the province of Bulacan, besting respondent Roberto M. Pagdanganan (Pagdanganan). On June 1, 2007, Pagdanganan filed an election protest that the COMELEC Second Division eventually granted, thereby annulling Mendoza's proclamation. Aggrieved, Mendoza moved for reconsideration with the <i>en banc, </i>but the COMELEC failed to reach a majority vote to either grant or deny the motion. Pursuant to its rules, the COMELEC en banc reheard the case but was, nevertheless, unsuccessful in obtaining the required majority vote for a ruling. Thus, in a<b> 3-1</b> vote, with three votes denying the motion, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> sustained the ruling of its Second Division.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On petition with the Court, Mendoza pointed out that because the necessary majority vote of four (4) was not obtained by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, respondent Pagdanganan's election protest ought to be dismissed. Agreeing, the Court, on March 25, 2010, ruled for Mendoza and explained that as an original action before the Commission, failure to muster the required majority vote would lead to the election protest's dismissal, not just of the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> As held:<br><br><blockquote>There is a difference in the result of the exercise of jurisdiction by the COMELEC over election contests. The difference inheres in the kind of jurisdiction invoked, which in turn, is determined by the case brought before the COMELEC. When a decision of a trial court is brought before the COMELEC for it to exercise appellate jurisdiction, the division decides the appeal but, if there is a motion for reconsideration, the appeal proceeds to the <i>banc</i> where a majority is needed for a decision. If the process ends without the required majority at the <i>banc,</i> the appealed decision stands affirmed. Upon the other hand, and this is what happened in the instant case,<b><u> if what is brought before the COMELEC is an original protest invoking the original jurisdiction of the Commission, the protest, as one whole process, is first decided by the division, which process is continued in the <i>banc</i> if there is a motion for reconsideration of the division ruling.

There is no first instance decision that can be deemed affirmed.</u></b><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[35]</sup></font> (underscoring in the original; emphasis added)</blockquote><br>It is this ruling in <i>Mendoza</i> that respondents urge Us to apply to sustain the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i>, dismissal of Legaspi's petition for disqualification. It bears stressing, however, that the Court in<i> Mendoza</i> was deeply divided insofar as this procedural aspect is concerned. The doctrine, therefore, commands further scrutiny.<br><br><blockquote><i>a. Dismissal of the action or <br>proceeding in original cases filed <br>with the COMELEC&nbsp; </i></blockquote><br>To begin with, Sec. 3, Art. IX-C of the Constitution pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. The Commission on Elections may sit<i> en banc</i> or in two divisions, and shall promulgate its rules of procedure in order to expedite disposition of election cases, including pre-proclamation controversies. <b>All such election cases shall be heard and decided in division, provided that motions for reconsideration of decisions shall be decided by the Commission <i>en banc</i></b>, (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>Clearly then, the Constitution no less bestows on the COMELEC divisions the authority to decide election cases. Their decisions arrived are capable of attaining finality, without need of any affirmative or confirmatory action on the part of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. For instance, if no motion for reconsideration is filed by the aggrieved party within five (5) days from the promulgation of the decision, the ruling becomes final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this sense, the process before the division should be deemed complete, although it can also be considered, in the bigger picture, as part of the integrated process of resolving an election case from start to finish, as when the case was originally initiated before the trial court.<br><br>The fact that the COMELEC division's decision may be referred to the <i>en banc </i>via a motion for reconsideration should in no way be considered as a diminution of its adjudicatory powers. Worth maintaining is this doctrine in <i>Mendoza</i>: <b>a motion for reconsideration is</b> a constitutionally guaranteed remedial mechanism for parties aggrieved by a division decision or resolution, but <b>not an appeal</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In the same vein, it was held in <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals (Apo Fruits Corporation)</i> that "[t]he Supreme Court sitting en banc is not an appellate court vis-a-vis its Divisions, and it exercises no appellate jurisdiction over the latter. Each division of the Court is considered not a body inferior to the Court en banc, and sits veritably as the Court en banc itself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This particular doctrine in <i>Mendoza</i> and <i>Apo Fruits Corporation</i> should be understood to have strengthened, rather than rendered nugatory, the adjudicatory powers of the COMELEC's and that of the Court's divisions - <b>that the decision of a division virtually amounts to a decision of the <i>en banc</i> and, as such, is potentially binding and conclusive on the parties.</b><br><br>The findings of the division can only be reversed and their impacts be undone by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> on reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to attain the required number of votes to either reverse or affirm the ruling of its division would, in turn, call for the application of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 6. Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided</b>. - When the Commission <i>en banc </i>is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached, the <b>action <u>or</u> proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission</b>; in appealed cases, the judgement or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied." (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>As can be gleaned, the result of the rule's application would vary, depending on whether the pending case is an original action, an appealed case, or an incidental matter. It then behooves this Court to properly categorize the petition for disqualification filed by Legaspi under either of the three.<br><br>In distinguishing an action originally commenced with the COMELEC from an appealed case, reference should be made to Article IX-C, Sec. 2(2) of the Constitution.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[40]</sup></font> According to the provision, the COMELEC is a constitutional commission vested with the exclusive original jurisdiction over election contests, involving regional, provincial and city officials, as well as <b>appellate</b> jurisdiction over election protests involving elective municipal and <i>barangay</i> officials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, in the case at bar, the petition for disqualification filed by Legaspi was correctly categorized by the <i>ponencia</i> as an election case <b>originally commenced in the Commission</b> because (1) private respondents were candidates for posts in the city government, (2) there is no trial court ruling elevated to the Commission to speak of, and (3) the motion for reconsideration filed by private respondents with the COMELEC en banc, as earlier stated, does not amount to an appeal.<br><br>Now on to the effect of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.<br><br>It is beyond cavil that for cases originally filed before it, the failure of the COMELEC to muster the required majority vote after rehearing would lead to the dismissal of the <b>action <u>or</u> proceeding</b> pending before it. The conjunctive word "or" clearly indicates that there is an intended distinction between the words "action" and "proceeding," such that in not all instances would the "action" originally commenced before the COMELEC will be dismissed in their entirety. Otherwise, to treat them similarly would mean that the words are superfluous, which is not the case.<br><br>It is the considered view that the "action" to be dismissed in cases originally commenced before the COMELEC under Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure pertains to those <b>originally and directly filed with the COMELEC division or <i>en banc</i></b>. As taught in <i>San Juan v. COMELEC</i>, the division has jurisdiction to hear and decide election cases, but as for motions for reconsideration of decisions rendered by the division, the COMELEC en banc has jurisdiction over the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On the other hand, the cases directly filed with the COMELEC en banc are those specifically provided in the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, such as petitions for postponement of elections under Sec. 1, Rule 26,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> petitions for failure of election under Sec. 2, Rule 26,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> complaints or charges for indirect contempt under Sec. 2, Rule 29,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> preliminary investigation of election offenses under Sec. 1, Rule 34,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and all other cases where the COMELEC division is not authorized to act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile "proceeding" refers to a procedural step that is part of a larger action or special proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This definition is broad enough to encompass the <b>motion for reconsideration challenging the rulings in the first set of cases above-described.</b> With this interpretation, the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to reach four (4) votes would not necessarily result in the dismissal of the original cases for it may be, as it is here, that only a procedural step, a "proceeding," the pending motion for reconsideration, ought to be disposed. Stated in the alternative, the failure of the COMELEC<i> en banc </i>to reach four (4) votes would result in the division ruling being sustained. This interpretation is consistent with the parallel procedure observed in the Court of Tax Appeals mandating that "[n]o decision of a Division of the Court may be reversed or modified except by the affirmative vote of four justices of the Court en banc acting on the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia,</i> however, counters that the "action or proceeding" referred to under Sec. 6, Rule 18 should be interpreted in relation to Part V of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, covering Rules 20-34, entitled "<i>Particular Actions or Proceedings.</i>" The ponencia adds that the itemization therein does not include motions for reconsideration that fall under Rule 18. It could not then be claimed, according to the <i>ponencia</i>, that the motion for reconsideration is a "proceeding" within the contemplation of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.<br><br>I respectfully disagree.<br><br>The strict construction offered by the <i>ponencia </i>offends the Constitution three times over: <b>(i) it circumvents the four-vote requirement under Sec. 7, Art. IX-A of the Constitution, (ii) it diminishes the adjudicatory powers of the COMELEC Divisions under Sec. 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution, and (iii) it unduly expands the jurisdiction of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>.</b><br><br><i>First</i>, recall that under Sec. 3, Article IX-C of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the COMELEC Divisions are granted adjudicatory powers to decide election cases. Recall further that under Sec. 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> as interpreted in <i>Marcoleta</i> and <i>Estrella</i>, four (4) votes are necessary for the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to decide a case. Naturally, the party moving for reconsideration, as the party seeking affirmative relief, has the burden of evidence in proving that the division committed reversible error.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Additionally, he or she also bears the corollary burden of convincing four (4) Commissioners to grant his or her plea.<br><br>This voting threshold, however, is easily rendered illusory by the application of the <i>Mendoza</i> ruling, which virtually allows the grant of a motion for reconsideration even though the movant fails to secure four votes in his or her favor. As in this case, <b>the ponencia suggests that in spite of securing only two (2) votes to grant the motion for reconsideration, the movants would nevertheless be declared the victors in this legal battle, in blatant violation of Sec. 7, Art. IX-A of the Constitution.</b><br><br><i>Second</i>, to exacerbate the situation, the circumvention of the four-vote requirement, in turn, trivializes the proceedings before the COMELEC divisions and presents rather paradoxical scenarios, to wit:<br><br><ol type="i"><li> The failure of the COMELEC<i> en banc</i> to muster the required majority vote only means that <b>it could not have validly decided the case. Yet curiously, it managed to reverse the ruling of a body that has properly exercised its adjudicatory powers</b>; and<br><br></li><li> A motion for reconsideration may be filed on the grounds that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision, order or ruling; or that the said decision, order or ruling is contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> If the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>does not find that either ground exists, there would be no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of the COMELEC division. Otherwise stated,<b> failure to muster four votes to sustain the motion for reconsideration should be understood as tantamount to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> finding no reversible error attributable to its division's ruling</b>. Said decision, therefore, ought to be affirmed, not reversed nor vacated.</li></ol><br>These resultant paradoxes are patently absurd. Under the majority's interpretation of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, <b>a movant, in situations such as this, need not even rely on the strength of his or her arguments and evidence to win a case, and may, instead, choose to rest on inhibitions and abstentions of COMELEC members to produce the same result</b>. To demonstrate herein, it is as though the<i> ponencia</i> counted the two (2) abstention votes in favor of the respondents for a total of four (4). This impedes and undermines the adjudicatory powers of the COMELEC divisions by allowing their rulings to be overruled by the en banc without the latter securing the necessary numbers to decide the case.<br><br><i>Third</i>, to countenance the majority's interpretation of the rule would expand the jurisdiction of the COMELEC en banc beyond constitutional bounds. To illustrate, under Sec. 3, Article IX-C,<b> the jurisdiction of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> in eases originally decided by the COMELEC divisions is limited to resolving the motions for reconsideration assailing the their rulings</b>. The dismissal by the COMELEC en banc, in applying Sec. 6, Rule 18 in election cases, should then be limited only to what it has jurisdiction over — that is the motion for reconsideration alone. To allow the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to modify, if not reverse, the ruling of the division when the Commission itself admitted that it failed to muster the required number of votes to do so would then run afoul the Constitution for it goes beyond dismissing the motion for reconsideration, and extends to disposing the originally filed petition in its entirety.<br><br>As a more viable alternative, this dissent submits that when the petition for disqualification was elevated through a motion for reconsideration to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, the decision of the Special First Division could have only been set aside by four votes in the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>granting the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> And when no decision on the motion was reached by the COMELEC en banc even after rehearing, what remains is the decision of the division, which was validly rendered pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The ruling of the division should then be considered affirmed, not vacated. Modifying the Mendoza doctrine to produce such an effect does not require any far-fetched or strained interpretation of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. As discussed, it simply requires construing the word <i>"proceeding"</i> in its plain meaning, beyond its alleged specialized use in Part V of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure as what the <i>ponencia</i> suggested, so as to include motions for reconsideration lodged with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>This alternative interpretation follows the basic precept in statutory construction that a statute should be construed in harmony with the Constitution.36 Indeed, the Court has not hesitated to declare unconstitutional and strike down enactments that are impossible to reconcile with Constitutional provisions. But when an interpretation is available allowing for the challenged enactment or its provisions to be salvaged, such alternative is more favored and is pursued, rather than resorting to creating legal vacuums. As in here, the interpretation offered in this dissent resolves the paradoxes and constitutional violations earlier outlined, without necessarily having to declare Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure unconstitutional. Moreover, it gives meaning and strengthens the adjudicatory powers bestowed on the COMELEC divisions under Sec. 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution, and reinforces the fact that their rulings are potentially binding and conclusive upon the parties, as earlier discussed. Likewise, it guarantees observance to the long-standing jurisprudence on the majority vote requirement under Sec. 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution. And lastly, it ensures that the COMELEC en banc exercises its jurisdiction within constitutional bounds.<br><br><blockquote><i>b. Pursuing the interpretation of<br>Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of<br> Procedure in Mendoza would lead to <br>absurd results</i></blockquote><br>Further enlightening on this discussion is the Separate Opinion in <i>Mendoza</i> of former Justice Carpio-Morales, who coincidentally, if not ironically, also penned the cases <i>Mendoza</i> was mainly predicated on: <i>Estrella </i>and <i>Marcoleta.</i> While concurring in the result, the former justice, in <i>Mendoza,</i> wrote:<br><br><blockquote>The bone of contention is the <u>manner of disposition</u> of a motion for reconsideration when in spite of rehearing, no decision is reached by the Comelec en banc which remains equally divided in opinion, <u>or</u> wherein the necessary majority still cannot be had. The rule states that "the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission."<br><br>I respectfully differ from the <i>ponencia.</i><br><br><b>There are cases which may be initiated at the Comelec <i>en banc, </i>the voting in which could also result to a stalemate. <u>The Comelec sits en banc in cases specifically provided by the Rules</u>, pre-prodamation cases upon a vote of a majority of its members, all other cases where a Division is not authorized to act, <i>inter alia.</i> These matters <u>include election offense cases, contempt proceedings, and postponement or declaration of failure of elections and the calling for a special elections</u>. In such cases, when the necessary majority in the Comelec <i>en banc</i> cannot be had even after a rehearing of the action, the effect is dismissal of the action.<br><br>In an election protest originally commenced in the Comelec and a decision is reached by the Division, it is, as the <i>ponencia</i> correctly posits, the <i>banc</i> that shall effectively "complete the process," which position hews well with Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr.'s view of "one integrated process," to which I also agree. <u>A motion for reconsideration before the Comelec <i>en banc</i> is one such proceeding that is a part of the entire procedural mechanism of election cases.</u> Ergo, when the necessary majority in the Comeiec <i>en banc</i> cannot be had even after a rehearing, the effect is dismissal of the proceeding. The motion for reconsideration should be dismissed.</b><br><br>As defined by Black, the term "proceeding" may refer to a <u>procedural step that is part of a larger action</u> or special proceeding. Black defines "process" as a series of actions, motions or occurrences.<br><br>The word "proceeding" could not have been used as an innocuous term. It was used to refer to matters requiring the resolution of the bane in cases originally commenced in the Comeiec that pass through a two-tiered process, as differentiated from actions initiated and totally completed at the <i>banc</i> level. It is a universal rule of application that a construction of a statute is to be favored, and must be adopted if reasonably possible, which will give meaning to every word, clause, and sentence of the statute and operation and effect to every part and provision of it.<br><br>Following the position of the <i>ponencia, </i>it is observed that in such cases where a Comeiec Division <u>dismisses</u> an election protest and the necessary majority is not reached after the rehearing of a motion for reconsideration, the Comeiec en banc, in effect, affirms such decision by similarly dismissing the "action." Under my submission, the result is the same but what is dismissed is the "proceeding" which is the motion for reconsideration. There should be no declaration of affirmance since, as the <i>ponencia</i> concedes, there is "no conclusive result in the form of a majority vote." The Comeiec <i>en banc</i> should dismiss the proceeding at hand but not the action, petition or case.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Since a majority vote was not attained after rehearing the Motion for Reconsideration, the <i>ponencia </i>states that the Comeiec<i> en banc</i> should have dismissed the election protest itself or, in effect, vacated the decision of the Division. Again I submit that it is the Motion for Reconsideration that is the "proceeding" which should, be dismissed. <b><i>First,</i> it is absurd for a deliberating body which arrived at "no conclusive result in the form of a majority vote" to do something about a matter on the table, much less to overturn it. <i>Second</i>, the resulting tyranny of the minority is unjust for, in such cases where the Comeiec <i>en banc</i> has a quorum of four, the protestee only needs to obtain the vote of just one Commissioner to frustrate the protestant's victory that was handed down by three Commissioners. <i>Third</i>, the <i>ponencia </i>incorrectly denotes that a body which <i>could not </i>pronounce a decision can effectively pronounce one and even one contrary to that of a body that <i>could </i>reach a decision. Otherwise stated, it downplays the significance of "the concurrence of a majority," which breathes life to any handiwork of the decision-making power of the Comeiec. Certainly, that was not the purpose and principle envisioned by the Comeiec Rules of Procedure.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>Echoing the sentiments of the esteemed Ombudsman, to dismiss the entire case - the petition for disqualification -because the majority vote at the en banc level was not mustered is as absurd as it is illogical. As demonstrated in the extant case, petitioner won before the COMELEC's Special First Division, which ruled to disqualify private respondents in light of the overwhelming evidence of vote-buying, their followers having been caught in <i>flagrante delicto. </i>Accordingly, respondents moved for reconsideration before the en banc. Necessarily, therefore, it was incumbent upon the private respondents to have the ruling of the division overturned by the Commission as it is elementary that the burden to prove a claim rests on the party asserting it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Here, since Germar and Santos failed to overcome such burden, the October 3, 2013 ruling of the COMELEC First Division should be deemed affirmed, binding and conclusive on the parties, lest private respondents be declared the victors in the case without themselves securing the required number of votes.<br><br>Applying the conclusions arrived at in the case at bar, there is no logical result other than to <b>modify the doctrine laid down in <i>Mendoza</i></b> insofar as the effect of the failure to muster the required majority vote in the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> even after rehearing is concerned, and to grant the instant petition to set a new precedent to govern cases lodged with the electoral tribunal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
