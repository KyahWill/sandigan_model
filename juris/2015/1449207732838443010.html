It is also grounded on principles of comity and judicial efficiency.<br><br>Consistent with the principle of comity, a tribunal's desistance in exercising jurisdiction on account of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is a deferential gesture to the tribunals of another sovereign. It is a measure that prevents the former's having to interfere in affairs which are better and more competently addressed by the latter. Further, <b><i>forum non conveniens entails a recognition</i></b> not only that tribunals elsewhere are <i>better suited to rule on and resolve</i> a controversy, but also, <b><i>that these tribunals are better positioned to enforce judgments and, ultimately, to dispense justice</i></b>. <i>Forum non conveniens</i> prevents the embarrassment of an awkward situation where a tribunal is rendered incompetent in the face of the greater capability — both analytical and practical — of a tribunal in another jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><i>Saudi Arabian Airlines</i> also discussed the need to raise <i>forum non conveniens</i> at the earliest possible time, and to show that a prior suit has been brought in another jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>On the matter of pleading <i>forum non conveniens</i>, we state the rule, thus: <i>Forum non conveniens must not only be clearly pleaded as a ground for dismissal; it must be pleaded as such at the earliest possible opportunity.
