				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners assail the Order dated 4 October 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> issued by Judge Felicitas O. Laron-Cacanindin (Judge Laron-Cacanindin) of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 17 (RTC Branch 17), in Civil Case No. 13-130820. The Order extended the 72-hour Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by Executive Judge Marino M. Dela Cruz, Jr. (Executive Judge Dela Cruz) in favor of respondents Silvestre, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to 20 days or until 21 October 2013 without need of posting bond.<br><br><center><b><u>The Antecedent Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The case stemmed from the issuance of Executive Order No. 140 (EO 140) on 2 September 2013, which created the Customs Policy Research Office (CPRO) in the Department of Finance (DOF). EO 140 states that the CPRO "shall be responsible for reviewing the customs administration policies, rules and procedures, and thereafter providing sound recommendations for the improvement of the same." Section 3 of EO 140 provides that "CPRO shall be composed of its organic personnel, as approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) upon recommendation of the DOF Secretary, augmented and reinforced by DOF and BOC personnel as well as those detailed or seconded from other agencies, whether attached to the DOF or not. x x x." Section 9 of EO 140 states that it shall "take effect immediately upon publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation." EO 140 was published in <i>Manila Bulletin</i> and <i>Philippine Star</i> on 17 September 2013.<br><br>On the same day of the publication of EO 140, Bureau of Customs (BOC) Commissioner Rozzano Rufino B. Biazon (Commissioner Biazon) issued Customs Personnel Order No. B-189-2013 (CPO 189-2013) detailing 27 BOC personnel holding the positions of Collector of Customs V and VI, including respondents in this case, to CPRO "effective immediately and valid until sooner revoked." CPO 189-2013 was approved by DOF Secretary Cesar V. Purisima (Secretary Purisima).<br><br>On 30 September 2013, respondents filed an action for Declaratory Relief with Application for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila. On 1 October 2013, Executive Judge Dela Cruz issued a TRO for a period of 72 hours enjoining petitioners or any person acting for and in their behalf from implementing CPO 189-2013. Thereafter, the case was raffled to the sala of Judge Laron-Cacanindin.<br><br>In the assailed Order of 4 October 2013, Judge Laron-Cacanindin extended Executive Judge Dela Cruz's 72-hour TRO for 20 days or until 21 October 2013. She then set the hearing for the issuance of a preliminary injunction on 18 October 2013.<br><br>On 21 October 2013, petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition before this Court, with prayer for the issuance of a TRO or a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. Petitioners alleged that the case involves personnel action affecting public officers which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission (CSC). Petitioners also alleged that respondents failed to exhaust all administrative remedies available to them before filing the petition before the RTC. Petitioners also alleged that CPO 189-2013 is an internal personnel order with application that is limited to and only within BOC and as such, it cannot be the subject of an action for declaratory relief.<br><br>In their Comment, respondents alleged that the case involves the validity and constitutionality of CPO 189-2013, and thus, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the CSC. Respondents further alleged that EO 140 violated Article 2 of the Civil Code when it became effective immediately after its publication.<br><br>In their Reply, petitioners alleged that respondents only assailed the validity of EO 140 to justify their filing of an action for declaratory relief. As regards its effectivity, petitioners alleged that EO 140 states that it shall "take effect immediately upon publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation."<br><br>In an Order dated 21 October 2013, Judge Laron-Cacanindin denied respondents' application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>In an Order dated 5 November 2013, Judge Laron-Cacanindin inhibited herself from further hearing the case.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The issues for determination by this Court are the following:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the action for declaratory relief filed by respondents;<br><br></li><li>Whether respondents failed to exhaust administrative remedies in filing the action before the RTC;<br><br></li><li>Whether EO 140 violated Article 2 of the Civil Code when it became effective immediately after its publication; and<br><br></li><li>Whether CPO 189-2013 was validly issued.<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of this Court</u></b><br></div><br><center><b><i>Jurisdiction over the Petition</i></b><br></center><br>The CSC has jurisdiction over all employees of government branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The CSC is the sole arbiter of controversies relating to the civil service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The rule is that disciplinary cases and cases involving personnel actions, including "appointment through certification, promotion, transfer, reinstatement, reemployment, detail, reassignment, demotion, and separation," are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CSC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This rule is embodied in Section 1, Rule V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws (Omnibus Rules) which states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. x x x.<br><br>As used in these Rules, any action denoting movement or progress of personnel in the civil service shall be known as personnel action. Such action shall include promotion, transfer, reinstatement, reemployment, detail, secondment, reassignment, demotion and separation, x x x.<br></blockquote>Under Section 8, Rule VII of the Omnibus Rules, "[a] detail is the movement of an employee from one department or agency which is temporary in nature, which does not involve a reduction in rank, status or salary and does not require the issuance of another appointment." CPO 189-2013 is an order detailing personnel from the BOC to CPRO under the DOF.<br><br>A reading of the petition filed before the RTC shows that respondents were questioning their mass detail and reassignment to CPRO. According to respondents, their detail was carried out in bad faith and was meant to remove them from their permanent positions in the BOC. The action appears to be a personnel action under the jurisdiction of the CSC.<br><br>However, the petition went beyond questioning the detail of respondents. Respondents further assailed the validity and constitutionality of CPO 189-2013. Respondents alleged that CPO 189-2013 was issued even before EC) 140, pursuant to which CPO 189-2013 was issued, became effective. Respondents alleged that CPO 189-2013 was issued to beat the deadline of the Commission on Elections' ban on personnel movement from 28 September 2013 to 20 October 2013 due to the scheduled barangay elections. When respondents raised the issue of validity and constitutionality of CPO 189-2013, the issue took the case beyond the scope of the CSC's jurisdiction because the matter is no longer limited to personnel action. Thus, the RTC did not abuse its discretion in taking cognizance of the action.<br><br><b><i>Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</i></b><br><br>Petitioners allege that respondents failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing the case with the RTC.<br><br>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies allows administrative agencies to carry out their functions and discharge their responsibilities within the specialized areas of their respective competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The doctrine entails lesser expenses and provides for the speedier resolution of controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Therefore, direct recourse to the trial court, when administrative remedies are available, is a ground for dismissal of the action.<br><br>The doctrine, however, is not without exceptions. Among the exceptions are: (1) where there is estoppel on the part of the party invoking the doctrine; (2) where the challenged administrative act is patently illegal, amounting to lack of jurisdiction; (3) where there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that will irretrievably prejudice the complainant; (4) where the amount involved is relatively so small as to make the rule impractical and oppressive; (5) where the question involved is purely legal and will ultimately have to be decided by the courts of justice; (6) where judicial intervention is urgent; (7) where the application of the doctrine may cause great and irreparable damage; (8) where the controverted acts violate due process; (9) where the issue of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies had been rendered moot; (10) where there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy; (11) where strong public interest is involved; and (12) in quo warranto proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondents allege that CPO 189-2013 is contrary to law and unconstitutional. Respondents assail CPO 189-2013 as patently illegal, arbitrary, and oppressive. This case clearly falls within the exceptions where exhaustion of administrative remedies need not be resorted to by respondents.<br><br><b><i>Effectivity of EO 140</i></b><br><br>Respondents allege that EO 140 took effect only on 2 October 2013, fifteen days after its publication in two newspapers of general circulation. Hence, respondents argue that when CPO 189-2013 was issued, EO 140 was not yet effective.<br><br>Article 2 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, as amended by Executive Order No. 200,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> is clear on this issue. It states:<br><blockquote>Art. 2. Laws shall take effect after fifteen days following the completion of their publication either in the Official Gazette, or in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines, unless it is otherwise provided.<br></blockquote>The proviso "unless it is otherwise provided" refers to an effectivity date other than after fifteen days following the completion of the law's publication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, it is within the discretion of the legislature, or the Executive Department in this case, whether to shorten or extend the fifteen-day period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> as long as there is compliance with the requirement of publication.<br><br>Here, Section 9 of EO 140 provides that the "order shall take effect immediately upon publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation." EO 140 was published in <i>Manila Bulletin</i> and <i>Philippine Star</i> on 17 September 2013. As such, EO 140 took effect on 17 September 2013.<br><br>In addition, the Court already ruled that "[interpretative regulations and those merely internal in nature, that is, regulating only the personnel of the administrative agency and not the public, need not be published."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> EO 140 is an internal regulation that affects primarily the personnel of the DOF and the BOC. It remains valid even without publication.<br><br><center><b><i>Validity of CPO 189-2013</i></b><br></center><br>Respondents assail the validity of CPO 189-2013. Respondents allege that under EO 140, CPRO shall be composed of its organic personnel, as approved by the DBM upon recommendation of the DOF Secretary. The organic personnel was supposed to be augmented and reinforced by DOF and BOC personnel. Respondents allege that they were detailed to CPRO even before its organic personnel could be constituted.<br><br>We rule for respondents.<br><br>Section 3 of EO 140 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. Personnel and Staffing Complement. The CPRO shall be composed of its organic personnel, as approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) upon recommendation of the DOF Secretary, augmented and reinforced by DOF and BOC personnel as well as those detailed or seconded from other agencies, whether attached to the DOF or not. In addition, the CPRO, upon approval of the DOF Secretary, may hire or engage technical consultants to provide necessary support in the performance of its mandate.<br></blockquote>Respondents were supposed to augment and reinforce the existing organic personnel of CPRO. Yet, at the time of respondents' detail, CPRO had not been formally organized. CPRO had no organic personnel that had been approved by the DBM upon recommendation of the DOF Secretary. The DOF Secretary had yet to promulgate rules and regulations and to prescribe procedures and processes to enable CPRO to effectively exercise its powers and duties, as required by Section 4 of EO 140.<br><br>In addition, under Section 8, Rule VII of the Omnibus Rules, a detail is temporary in nature. In fact, detail of employees is only allowed for a maximum, period for those occupying professional, technical, and scientific positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Section 8, Rule VII of the Omnibus Rules provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8. A detail is the movement of an employee from one department or agency to another which is temporary in nature, which does not involve a reduction in rank, status or salary and does not require the issuance of another appointment.<br><br>The employee detailed receives his salary only from his mother unit/agency.<br><br>Detail shall be allowed only for a maximum period in the case of employees occupying professional, technical and scientific position. If the employee believes that there is no justification for the detail, he may appeal his case to the Commission. Pending appeal, the decision to detail the employee shall be executory unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.<br></blockquote>Section 2 of CSC Resolution No. 021181, dated 13 September 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> clarified the maximum period of detail of employees. It states:<br><blockquote>Section 2. Duration of the detail. The detail shall be allowed only for a maximum period of one year. Details beyond one year may be allowed provided it is with the consent of the detailed employee. The extension or renewal of the period of the detail shall be within the authority of the mother agency.<br><br>If the employee believes that there is no justification for the detail, he/she may appeal his/her case to the proper Civil Service Commission Regional Office. Pending appeal, the detail shall be executory unless otherwise ordered by said regional office. Decision of said regional office may be further appealed to the Commission en banc.<br></blockquote>In this case, CPO 189-2013 did not provide for the period of respondents' detail. It only provided that the order "shall be effective immediately and valid until sooner revoked," making the detail of respondents indefinite. There was nothing to show that respondents were occupying professional, technical, and scientific positions that would have allowed their detail for the maximum period provided under Section 8, Rule VII of the Omnibus Rules. Further, CSC Resolution No. 021181 did not distinguish between an ordinary employee and an employee occupying professional, technical, and scientific position. Hence, it should have been specified that the maximum period of respondents' detail should not exceed one year.<br><br>Petitioners assert, and we quote:<br><blockquote>There is a cancer of corruption we must extinguish. The drive to rid the government of graft and corruption deserves the support of everyone.<br><br>The principle of good governance cannot, should not, be trivialized nor oversimplified by tenuous whimpering and individualism intended to detract from the urgent need to cleanse the Republic from a mainstream culture of unabated corruption, perpetuated with impunity and sense of self-entitlement. The issue at hand is not about who, but what; it is not about individual loss, but about national gain. Whether from the birth pains of reform, this nation can gain a foothold, nay, a stride into restoring this nation into its prideful place from the clutches of a "<i>kleptocratic</i> mafia" that had gained a strangehold into one of the nation's primary sources of revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, we commend and support the reforms being undertaken in the different agencies of the government. However, we cannot allow department heads to take shortcuts that will undermine and disregard the basic procedures of the law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petition.

On 17 September 2013, without waiting for [Executive Order] No. 140's effectivity on 2 October 2013, the [Bureau of Customs] issued [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013, signed by [Bureau of Customs] Commissioner Rozzano Rufino B. Biazon and approved by [Department of Finance] Secretary, Cesar V. Purisima on even date. [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 states:<br><blockquote>Under Section 3 of Executive Order No. 140, series of 2013, the Customs Policy Research Office (the "CPRO") shall be composed of its organic personnel, augmented and reinforced by personnel from the Department of Finance and Bureau of Customs as well as those (sic) detailed or seconded from other agencies. Pursuant to the foregoing, the following personnel are detailed from the Bureau of Customs to [the Customs Policy Research Office] under the Department of Finance:<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>9. Thus, [private respondents'] original and permanent appointments in plantilla positions as Collectors of Customs VI and V were effectively and constructively revoked even before the effectivity of [Executive Order] No. 140 creating the [Customs Policy Research Office].<br><br>They are all "<i>detailed</i>" to the [Customs Policy Research Office] <i>without any appointment papers</i> providing for their specific functions, status, salary grades, ranks, and designation. By virtue of the assailed issuance, [<i>private respondents</i>'] <i>were all removed from their respective permanent positions</i> as Collectors of Customs to form a supposed "research body."<br><br>10. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM), pursuant to [Executive Order] No. 140 has not even approved the composition of the organic personnel of the [Customs Policy Research Office]. Neither has the [Department of Finance] appeared to. have made the requisite recommendation for that purpose, as mandated by [Executive Order] No. 140.<br><br>11. While they have not been officially notified thereof, [private respondents] were reliably informed of the issuance of [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 and [petitioners'] attempt to <i>unlawfully "detail"</i> them to the [Customs Policy Research Office].<br><br>. . . .<br><br>13. While the [Bureau of Customs] Commissioner's authority to reorganize is recognized, it is neither absolute nor unbridled. The exercise thereof should not violate the law and the 1987 Constitution. The Constitution clearly mandates that "no officer or employee of the civil service shall be <i>removed or suspended</i> except for cause provided by law."<br><br>14. Section 703 of [Republic Act] No. 1937, as amended, provides that:<br><blockquote><i>Assignment of Customs Officers and Employees to other duties</i>. - The Commissioner of Customs may, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance, assign any employee of the Bureau of Customs to any port, service, division or office <i>within</i> the Bureau or assign him duties as the best interest of the service may require, in accordance with the staffing pattern or organizational set-up as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of Finance: Provided, that such assignment shall not affect the tenure of office of the employees nor result in the change of status, demotion in rank and/or deduction of salary.<br></blockquote>15. Section 2 of [Republic Act] No. 6656 [or An Act to Protect the Security of Tenure of Civil Service Officers and Employees in the Implementation of Government Reorganization] further provides that due notice and hearing are required to <i>remove</i> a public officer or employee pursuant to a bona fide <i>reorganization</i>, viz:<br><blockquote>No officer or employee in the career service shall be <i>removed</i> except for a valid cause and after due notice and hearing. A valid cause for <i>removal</i> exists when, pursuant to a bona fide <i>reorganization</i>, a position has been abolished or rendered redundant or there is a need to merge, divide, or consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service, or other lawful causes allowed by the Civil Service Law.<br></blockquote>16. Thus, while the necessity and indispensability of reorganization when public interest demands may be justified, civil service employees, much more career service officers with permanent appointments like [private respondents], cannot be <i>removed, suspended, or demoted</i> from office except for cause provided by law.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>18. In this case, [<i>Customs Personnel Order</i>] <i>No. B-l89-2013 allegedly "detailed" all 15</i> [<i>private respondents</i>], <i>together with 12 other Collectors of Customs, to an advisory capacity</i> of a policy coordinating body (CPRO) under the guise of reorganization, <i>thus effectively rendering vacant the 27 positions of collector of customs</i> throughout the country.<br><br>19. Section 8, Rule VII of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 91-1631, otherwise known as the "Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations," provides that a <i>"detail" is "the movement of an employee from one department or agency to another which is temporary in nature, which does not involve a reduction in rank, status or salary and does not require the issuance of another appointment."</i><br><br>20. The patent nullity of [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 is readily apparent since Section 703 of [the Tariff and Customs Code] merely authorizes the [Bureau of Customs] Commissioner to <i>assign or move</i> [Bureau of Customs] personnel only within the Bureau. Since the [Customs Policy Research Office] is a newly created "office" outside of the [Bureau of Customs], the [Bureau of Customs] Commissioner's issuance of [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 which "details" [private respondents] to the [Customs Policy Research Office] is clearly an ultra vires act, and is therefore invalid. In fact, the [Bureau of Customs] Commissioner's own admission proves this ultra vires and invalid issuance, thus:<br><blockquote>"It is more than a reshuffle because [private respondents] have actually been <i>transferred</i> to the [Department of Finance], <i>out of the Bureau of Customs</i>" Biazon said in an ANC interview, confirming news first reported by the Philippine Daily Inquirer. "Instead of just reassignment [to] another port, they're basically <i>reassigned to another office</i>."<br><br>"After their transfer out of the [Bureau of Customs], the next-in-rank collectors or division heads are <i>taking over</i> as officers-in-charge of the different ports," he said.<br></blockquote>21. There is no bona fide reorganization that took place. [Private respondents'] <i>mass</i> "<i>detail</i>" to the [Customs Policy Research Office] was without any clear or definite direction as to their career status and functions. As a consequence, [private respondents] were intentionally and effectively placed on a "floating status."<br><br>22. Furthermore, [Executive Order] No. 140 clearly provides that the [Customs Policy Research Office] shall be composed of its organic personnel, and that said policy research body - after the organization of its own organic personnel - shall merely be augmented and reinforced by Department of Finance and Bureau of Customs personnel. Despite the absence of any organic personnel, much less approval from the Department of Budget and Management or even a recommendation from the [Department of Finance], [private respondents] have, in speed haste, already been ordered to be "<i>detailed</i>" by the [Bureau of Customs] to the [Customs Policy Research Office], and thus, effectively <i>removed</i> from their current respective permanent positions.<br><br>23. The landmark case of <i>Dario v. Mison, et al.</i>, where the Supreme Court voided the personnel reorganization within the [Bureau of Customs], is highly instructive in this case, thus:<br><blockquote><i>Reorganizations in this jurisdiction have been regarded as valid provided they are pursued in good faith</i>.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>24. By no stretch of the imagination can the issuance of [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 be said to have been carried out in good faith. The undue haste in issuing [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 clearly shows that respondents are attempting to beat the deadline on the COMELEC election ban on <b><i>personnel movement</i></b> from 28 September 2013 to 28 October 2013 due to the forthcoming Barangay Elections. It cannot be denied that [Executive Order] No. 140, which was signed by the President on 2 September 2013, has yet to take effect on 2 October 2013, which is 15 days after its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation. On 17 September 2013, however, the [Bureau of Customs] already issued [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013, which is based on [Executive Order] No. 140, and attempted to serve copies thereof to [respondents] on 26 to 27 September 2013 supposedly just in time before the COMELEC election ban on personnel movement takes effect on 28 September 2013.<br><br>25. More importantly, [Executive Order] No. 140 mandates that the transfer of [Bureau of Customs] personnel should merely augment or reinforce the organic personnel of the [Customs Policy Research Office]. Obviously, without any organic personnel, there is still nothing to augment or reinforce. . . . Hence, [private respondents'] "detail" to the [Customs Policy Research Office] absent any compliance with the requirements under [Executive Order] No. 140, was surely carried out in bad faith, and was meant to <i>illegally remove</i> [<i>private respondents</i>] <i>from their respective permanent positions</i>, in blatant violation of the law and the Constitution.<br><br>26. It should also be stressed that [private respondents] were appointed as Collectors of Customs with Position Titles VI and V, with specific functions, duties, titles, and ranks clearly provided for in their respective appointment papers. In contrast, their supposed "<i>detail</i>" to the [Customs Policy Research Office] under [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 does not even provide for a definite period of duty, their titles, new functions, or ranks.<br><br>27. Moreover, under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 06-05, otherwise known as the "<i>Guidelines on Designation</i>" it is clear that:<br><blockquote>. . . .<br><br>B. Designees can only be designated to positions within the level they are currently occupying. However, Division Chiefs may be designated to perform the duties of third level positions<br><br>First level personnel cannot be designated to perform the duties of second level positions.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>29. The basis of [private respondents'] <b><i>reassignment</i></b> or the exigency necessary to <b><i>remove</i></b> them from their positions is likewise inexistent. Such blanket "detail" relinquishes [private respondents'] permanent positions as Collectors of Customs without due process and is contrary to their Constitutional right to security of tenure. Clearly, the disparity between the positions of a Collector of Customs and a mere researcher is blatant. Therefore, the transfer from the former to the latter unmistakeably denotes <b><i>demotion</i></b>....<br><br>. . . .<br><br>30. In the case of <i>Pastor v. City of Pasig</i>, the Supreme Court held that a reassignment or even detail which is indefinite and which results in a reduction of rank and status is effectively a <i><b>constructive dismissal</b> from the service</i>. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>31. The principles on <i>constructive dismissal</i> clearly find analogous application to [private respondents]. By definition, constructive dismissal is a quitting because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank or a diminution of pay. The test of constructive dismissal is whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his position under the circumstances. It is an act amounting to dismissal but is made to appear as if it were not. Constructive dismissal is therefore a <i>dismissal in disguise</i>. The law recognizes and resolves this situation in favor of employees in order to protect their rights and interests from the coercive acts of the employer. Thus, the Supreme Court has ruled that the management prerogative to transfer an employee "cannot be used as a subterfuge by the employer to rid himself of an undesirable worker."<br><br>32. Evidently, [private respondents'] "<i>detail</i>" <i>to the</i> [<i>Customs Policy Research Office</i>] operated as a blanket and forced relinquishment of their permanent positions as Collectors of Customs in violation of their right to security of tenure. In view thereof, it behooves upon this Honorable Court to correct such abuse of powers and retain [private respondents] to their rightful ranks.<br><br>. . . . <br><br>35. ... in accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tañada v. Tuvera</span>, laws and executive issuances shall take effect after fifteen (15) days following the completion of their publication in the Official Gazette, or in a newspaper of general circulation.<br><br>36. In this case, [Executive Order] No. 140 was published in the 17 September 2013 issue of the broadsheet newspaper, Manila Bulletin. Thus, following the above legal standards, it is clear that [Executive Order] No. 140 has yet to take legal effect on 2 October 2013. In other words, the [Bureau of Customs'] issuance of [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 on 17 September 2013 simply, has no legal basis, and is therefore premature and patently invalid. To deprive [private respondents] of their permanent positions as Collectors of Customs and to "detail" all 15 of them indefinitely as members of a research body on the basis of an invalid [Bureau of Customs] and [Department of Finance] order are not only illegal but also unconstitutional for being violative of [private respondents'] right to security of tenure.<br><br>37. An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, inoperative, as if it had not been passed. . . . For these reasons, [Customs Personnel Order] No. B-189-2013 should be nullified and set aside, and its enforcement enjoined.<br><br>38. . . . The consequence [of implementing Customs Personnel Order No. B-189-2013] that is also readily obvious is the chaos entailed in port operations, the collection of much needed Government revenues and public service as [private respondents] perform functions either as District Collectors of all the 17 Collection Districts in the country, or as Deputy Collectors for administration, assessment and operation in those different ports.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>41.

Plainly then, the propriety of the Notice relates to the implementation of the CARP, which is under the quasi-judicial jurisdiction of the DAR. <b><i>Thus, the DAR could not be ousted from its authority by the simple expediency of appending an allegedly constitutional or legal dimension to an issue that is clearly agrarian.</i></b><br></blockquote>The legal recourse undertaken by Trinidad Valley Realty and Development Corporation, et al. is on all-fours with the remedy adopted by the private respondents in Cuenca. In this case, Trinidad Valley Realty and Development Corporation, et al. <i>cloaked the issue as a constitutional question — assailing the constitutionality of administrative issuances promulgated to implement the agrarian reform law — in order to annul the titles issued therein</i>. In <i>Cuenca</i>, private respondents assailed the constitutionality of EO 45 in order to annul the Notice of Coverage issued therein. The only difference is that in <i>Cuenca</i>, private respondents directly filed with the RTC their complaint to obtain the aforesaid reliefs while in this case, Trinidad Valley Realty and Development Corporation, et al. filed their original petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the RTC <i>after</i> the protest of Trinidad Valley Realty and Development Corporation against the coverage of its landholding under CARP was dismissed by the DAR Regional Director and such dismissal was affirmed by DAR OIC Secretary Jose Mari B.

In this case, the petitioners had stated in their petition that respondents assessed them interest and penalties on their <i>outstanding loans</i>, initiated foreclosure proceedings against petitioner Rafael Martelino as evidenced by the notice of extra-judicial sale and threatened to foreclose the mortgages of the other petitioners, all in disregard of their right to suspend payment to Shelter for its failure to complete the subdivision. <i>Said statements clearly mean one thing: petitioners had already suspended paying their amortization payments</i>. Unfortunately, their actual suspension of payments defeated the purpose of the action to secure an authoritative declaration of their supposed right to suspend payment, for their guidance.

A petition for declaratory relief gives a practical remedy for ending controversies that have not reached the state where another relief is immediately available; and supplies the need for a form of action that will set controversies at rest before they lead to a repudiation of obligations, an invasion of rights, and a commission of wrongs.<br><br>In the case at bar, <i>the petition for declaratory relief became unavailable by [Executive Order No. 10's] enforcement and implementation</i>.

The trial court, therefore, had <b><i>no jurisdiction</i></b> over the petition for declaratory relief.<br><br>There are several aspects of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is "the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong." It is conferred by law, which may either be the Constitution or a statute. Jurisdiction over the subject matter means "the nature of the cause of action and the relief sought."

Hence, it is disregarded (1) when there is a violation of due process, (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question, (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned, (5) when there is irreparable injury, (6) when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an alter ego of the President bears the implied and assumed approval of the latter, (7) when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable, (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim, (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings, (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, and (11) when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention."
