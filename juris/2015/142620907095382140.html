She recounted that her mother died of cancer in December 2000. In June 2001, her uncle, who acted as her father, also died of lung cancer. The following year, in April, her brother died of acute leukemia. In May of same year, her father-in-law also succumbed to cancer of the pancreas. In April 2003, her husband died due to heart attack.

As such, it was her duty to collect and receive, by herself or through a duly appointed cashier, all monies in payment of all legal fees; as well as to receive deposits, fines, and dues. A Clerk of Court, or an acting Clerk of Court, has the duty to ensure full compliance with the circulars of this Court and the Court Administrator on deposits or collections of court funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Clerks of Court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court’s funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises. As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard, and physical plant manager thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is the duty of the Clerks of Court to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities. They are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. It is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds. Clerks of Court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice. Thus, an unwarranted failure to fulfil these responsibilities deserves administrative sanctions and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Ms. Miranda’s failure to deposit her collections constitutes gross neglect of duties and dishonesty as an accountable officer entrusted with the collection of money belonging to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It is a wilful violation of SC Circular No. 3-91, as amended by Circular No. 3-2000, and SC Circular No. 50-95.<br><br>While this Court can no longer impose the penalty of dismissal from the service on Ms. Miranda because she has already resigned, such resignation does not render the Complaint against her moot. Resignation is not and should not be a convenient way or strategy to evade administrative liability when a court employee is facing administrative sanction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>With respect to Ms. Cruz, while she has admitted the delay in the deposit of her collections, she has also explained that the reason for her shortcomings was the series of unfortunate events that befell her and her family for several years. She has further substantiated her claims of the demise of her family members. While her explanation and supporting documents do not absolve her of liability, this Court deems her deserving of compassion and humanitarian consideration. Furthermore, she had already retired in 2008.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds Ms EMILIA A. MIRANDA, former OIC-Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, guilty of dishonesty, gross neglect of duty, and grave misconduct. In lieu of the DISMISSAL that her offense carries, which can no longer be imposed by reason of her resignation, Ms. Miranda is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of FORFEITURE of whatever benefits are still due her from the government, except accrued leave credits, if any, that she earned; and is likewise declared to be DISQUALIFIED from employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or –controlled corporations.<br><br>Ms. EMILIA A. MIRANDA is directed, within ten (10) days from receipt of notice, to do as follows:<br><br><ol><li>RESTITUTE the shortages incurred in the following funds:<br><br><table  ="" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><u><i><b>Fund</b></i></u></div></td> <td width="22%"><div align="CENTER"><u><i><b>Amount</b></i></u></div></td> <td width="28%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Fiduciary Fund </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P565,000.00 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Schedule 2</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">83,036.40</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Schedule 1</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Mediation Fund </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">315,500.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Schedule 3</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Judiciary Development Fund </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">7,754.00 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Schedule 4</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>Victim’s Compensation Fund </td> <td><div align="RIGHT">730.00 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Schedule 5</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>Legal Research Fund </td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,213.60 </u></div></td> <td align="center"><div><u>Schedule 6</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><b>Total </b></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u><b>P980,234.00</b></u></div></td> <td><u>&nbsp;</u></td> </tr> </tbody></table></li></ol><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2. <b>SUBMIT</b> to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, FMO-OCA the copies of the machine-validated deposit slips, all within ten (10) days from receipt of notice as proof of compliance with item 1.<br><br>3. <b>PAY</b> a <b>FINE</b> of <b>TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000)</b> for her unremitted collections which should have earned interest if the same were remitted on time;<br><br>The FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, is DIRECTED to do the following:<br><br>1.
