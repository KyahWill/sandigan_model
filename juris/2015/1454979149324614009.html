It thus ordered the cancellation of the emancipation patents issued in favor of respondents. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' <i>Decision</i> reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The assailed decision of the DARAB is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

Thus, the sale contracts entered into by Bernardina should only affect her own share and not those of her children.<br><br>Their contention is completely devoid of merit.<br><br>It is settled in <i>Hospicio de San Jose de Barili, Cebu City v. Department of Agrarian Reform</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that land transfers mandated under PD 27 are not considered conventional sales under our civil laws. In <i>Hospicio</i>, we ruled that a provision in the law prohibiting the <b>sale</b> of properties donated to a charitable organization incorporated by the same law did <b>not</b> bar the implementation of agrarian reform laws as regards the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The Court explained:<br><blockquote>Generally, sale arises out of a contractual obligation. Thus, it must meet the first essential requisite of every contract that is the presence of consent. Consent implies an act of volition in entering into the agreement.<br><br>The absence or vitiation of consent renders the sale either void or voidable.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br><b>The twin process of expropriation of lands under agrarian reform and the payment of just compensation is akin to a <u>forced sale</u></b>, which has been aptly described in common law jurisdictions as "sale made under the process of the court, and in the mode prescribed by law," and "which is not the voluntary act of the owner, such as to satisfy a debt, whether of a mortgage, judgment, tax lien, etc." The term has not been precisely defined in this jurisdiction, but reference to the phrase itself is made in Articles 223, 232, 237 and 243 of the Civil Code, which uniformly exempt the family home "from execution, forced sale, or attachment." <b>Yet a <u>forced sale is clearly different</u> from the sales described under Book V of the Civil Code which are conventional sales, <u>as it does not arise from the consensual agreement of the vendor and vendee, but by compulsion of law</u>. Still, since law is recognized as one of the sources of obligation, there can be no dispute on the efficacy of a forced sale, so long as it is authorized by law.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Thus, for as long as the property is covered under PD 27, the obligation to transfer ownership of the property arises. Consent of one, some or all of the co-owners to the transfer is immaterial to its validity.<br><br><i>Voluntary Land Transfer/Direct Payment scheme merely modes of implementation</i><br><br>Bernardina chose to enter into a <i>Voluntary Land Transfer/Direct Payment Scheme</i>. This is allowed under Executive Order No. (EO) 228,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> which provides for the different modes of payment and compensation for land transfers under PD 27:<br><blockquote>Section 1. All qualified farmer beneficiaries are now deemed full owners as of October 21, 1972 of the land they acquired by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 27.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Section 3. <b><u>Compensation shall be paid to the landowners in any of the following modes,</u></b> at the option of the landowners:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Bond payment over ten (10) years, with ten percent (10%) of the value of the land payable immediately in cash, and the balance in the form of LBP bonds bearing market rates of interest that are aligned with 90-day treasury bills rates, net of applicable final withholding tax.

It does not serve to remove the transaction over the property from the coverage of agrarian reform laws.<br><br><i>On the exercise of petitioners' right of retention</i><br><br>Petitioners claim that the property falls within the seven (7) hectare retention limit given to landowners. They assert that "[t]he property in question has a total land area of more than 14 hectares and the petitioners are all in all ten (10) of them and if they exercise their right of retention, they are entitled to at least 3 hectares each."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>It is true that the right of retention is constitutionally guaranteed, subject to reasonable limits prescribed by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In <i>Daez v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>xxx It serves to mitigate the effects of compulsory land acquisition by balancing the rights of the landowner and the tenant and by implementing the doctrine that social justice was not meant to perpetrate an injustice against the landowner. A retained area, as its name denotes, is land which is not supposed to anymore leave the landowner's dominion, thus sparing the government from the inconvenience of taking land only to return it to the landowner afterwards, which would be a pointless process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, under PD 27, an affected landowner may retain an area of not more than seven (7) hectares if such landowner is cultivating such area or will now cultivate it. Under Republic Act No. (RA) 6657,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> retention by the landowner is not to exceed five (5) hectares, and three (3) hectares to each child, under certain specified conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>As with any other right, this right of retention may be waived by the landowner. In cases of voluntary transactions involving covered land, a landowner seeking to exercise his right to retain is <i>presumed</i> to have already exercised the same, or at the very least, expected to exercise it simultaneous to the transaction. DAR Administrative Order No. 11, Series of 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> provides:<blockquote>E. Period Within Which to Exercise the Right of Retention<br><br>1. Under Compulsory Acquisition (CA)<br><blockquote>The right of retention and the possibility of award to children, where applicable, must be availed of by the landowner <b>within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of Notice of Coverage</b> from the DAR that his landholding is subject to compulsory acquisition. Failure to respond within the specified period and after due notice would mean that the landowner <b>waives</b> his right to choose which area to retain.<br></blockquote>2. Under Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS)<br><blockquote>The right to retention may be exercised <b>at the time the land is voluntarily offered for sale</b>. The VOS should indicate the landowner's choice of retained area, which should be not more than five (5) hectares, plus the area/s to be awarded to the qualified children. These areas should be specifically identified and segregated from the portion covered by the VOS.<br><br>A landowner who voluntarily offered his retained area for CARP coverage may be allowed to withdraw his offer. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> subsequently issued likewise provides:<br><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>A landowner is deemed to have <b>waived</b> his right of retention over a parcel of land by the performance of any of the following acts:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>Signing of the Landowner-Tenant Production Agreement and Farmer's Undertaking (LTPA-FU) covering the subject property;<br><br></li><li><b>Entering into a direct-payment scheme agreement as evidenced by a Deed of Transfer over the subject property;</b> and<br><br></li><li>Signing/submission of other documents indicating consent to have the subject property covered, such as the form letter of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) on the disposition of the cash and bond portions of a land transfer claim for payment, and the Deed of Assignment, Warranties and Undertaking executed in favor of the LBP. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>In addition, under the 2003 Rules and Procedures Governing Landowner Retention Rights, failure to state an intention to retain <i>upon offer to sell or application under the voluntary land transfer/direct payment scheme</i> shall result in a waiver of the right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In this case, Bernardina is deemed to have already waived the right to a retained area when she entered into a voluntary land transfer/direct payment scheme with respondents over the property, without any qualification as to the exercise of her right of retention. Petitioners, as Bernardina's successors-in-interest, are bound by her waiver.<br><br><i>On the issue of illegal conversion</i><br><br>We find it unnecessary to rule on petitioners' claim of illegal conversion at this time. For one, the record is completely bereft of proof to support such contention. More importantly, such claim involves factual questions which cannot be resolved by this Court, as it is not a trier of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><i>The Court of Appeals erred in ordering the cancellation of the emancipation patents issued in respondents' names</i><br><br>The Court of Appeals ordered the nullification of the emancipation patents issued to respondents. This, the Court of Appeals said, was without prejudice to their application for the issuance of new patents after showing complete compliance with the requirements for their issuance. It reasoned thus:<br><blockquote>However, although the tenant-farmers are already deemed owners of the land they till, they are still required to pay the cost of the land. In the case at bar, <b>there is no competent evidence to prove that the respondents have paid the full amortizations for the lots awarded to them</b>. While the Regional Adjudicator stated in his decision that the respondents have paid the full amortizations as per certification dated May 2, 2001 by the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer, Eduardo A. Martinez, nothing of such sort could be found from the records. Indeed, findings of facts by administrative bodies are usually accorded with respect and not disturbed by the appellate court, but this applies only if the same is supported by the evidence on record. The petitioners have consistently raised the lack of full payment of their landholdings from the Regional Adjudicator to the DARAB and to this Court, but the respondents never bothered to present proofs of payment after the lapse of considerable length of time. Neither did they dispute the allegation. In the absence of such evidence, it can be presumed that full payment has not been effected by the respondents.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>It could be gleaned from PD 266, in relation to PD 27 and the jurisprudence applying the same, <b>that emancipation patents should be issued only after full payment of the amortizations as determined by law</b>. Although the respondents have been issued emancipation patents, and as could be inferred from PD 266, such issuance could indicate payment of the full amortization of the land covered thereby, the same could not be relied upon in this case inasmuch as the <b>petitioners managed to produce receipts of payment issued to some of the respondents clearly showing that they were issued after the date of the questioned emancipation patents. On that score, it could be said that the questioned EPs were issued <i>sans</i> complete compliance with the process for the application of PD 27</b>. Under the prevailing jurisprudence, the respondents may complete payment of the unpaid amortizations under RA 6657, the present Agrarian Reform Law. But until such time that the respondents have shown full payment thereof, they are not entitled to the issuance of emancipation patents. Accordingly, the EPs already issued to them are hereby cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>We find that the Court of Appeals erred in ordering the cancellation of respondents' emancipation patents.<br><br><i>First</i>, and as previously discussed, the law allows for different modes of payment of the value of the land acquired pursuant to PD 27, including voluntary arrangements for direct transfer/payment schemes <i>under terms and conditions mutually acceptable to both parties</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Under EO 229, these voluntary arrangements are subject to the approval of the DAR for compliance with the guidelines for voluntary transfers. These guidelines are:<br><blockquote>Section 8. <i>Voluntary Land Transfer</i>.—xxx The general guidelines for voluntary land transfer are:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The beneficiaries are determined by the DAR to be the same individuals who would be eligible to purchase the land in case the government under this Order acquired the land for resale;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The area of land to be transferred is no less than the area which the government, under this Order, would otherwise acquire for resale;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The terms and conditions of the government's standing offer to purchase from the landowner and standing offer to resell to the beneficiaries are fully known and understood by both parties;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The voluntary transfer agreement shall include sanctions for non-compliance by either party and shall be binding and irrevocable for both parties, and shall be duly recorded at and monitored by the DAR.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The records of this case show that Bernardina chose to enter into a Voluntary Land Transfer/Direct Payment Scheme. The Landowner-Tenant Fanners Deed of Undertaking executed between the parties on May 23, 1989 also contains the signatures of DAR representatives, implying compliance with the applicable guidelines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This Deed of Undertaking, with its terms and conditions voluntarily agreed upon by the parties, should be held binding upon Bernardina and her successors-in-interest.<br><br>Second. There is nothing in the Deed of Undertaking to show that the parties conditioned the issuance of emancipation patents in respondents' favor on the complete payment of the value of their corresponding lots. Thus, the fact that payments were made subsequent to the issuance of the patents does not affect the validity of the patents' issuance.<br><br>The Deed's salient portions read:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li><b>That the LANDOWNER does hereby convey and transfer pursuant to PD 27 to the FARMER-BENEFICIARIES the parcels of land</b> for and in consideration of the amount indicated opposite their names below:<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br></li><li>That the amount indicated will be paid in cash or its equivalent in kind to the LANDOWNER without any interest;<br><br><center>xxx</center></li></ol><ol start="6"><li>That in case the FARMER-BENEFICIARIES opt to pay the LANDOWNER in installment basis, the land value will be increased to P10,000 per hectare which will be amortized by the FARMER-BENEFICIARIES for a period of three (3) years only;<br><br></li><li>That <b>in case of failure</b> of the FARMER-BENEFICIARIES <b>to pay the landholdings awarded to him for a period of three (3) years</b>, the LANDOWNER has the right to <b>foreclose</b> on the property and subsequently award it to other qualified beneficiary within the locality; xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></li></ol></blockquote>We likewise note the consequence provided by the parties for respondents' failure to pay amortizations. Under their agreement, failure of the farmer-beneficiary to pay for a period of three (3) years will be cause for the <b>foreclosure by the landowner</b> of their corresponding portion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This proviso further supports the view that title over the properties immediately vested upon respondents, without prejudice to Bernardina's right to foreclose on the property in case of default on payment for the stipulated period.<br><br><i>Prior complete payment of just compensation is not required for issuance of titles in cases of Voluntary Land Transfer/Direct Payment Scheme</i><br><br>We are aware of the rule requiring full payment of just compensation prior to the issuance of an emancipation patent. Such was the consistent pronouncement of this Court in <i>Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <i>Paris v. Alfeche</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> <i>Coruña v. Cinamin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> and <i>Reyes v. Barrios</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> among others. The foregoing cases, however, do not involve voluntary land transactions similar to the arrangement chosen by the parties in this case. For this reason, we find that the rule requiring prior complete payment does not find application here.<br><br>Moreover, under DAR Administrative Order No. 13, Series of 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> which sets forth the rules governing voluntary land transfers and/or direct payment schemes, "[t]he terms and conditions of [voluntary land transfer/direct payment scheme] should include the <i>immediate transfer of possession and ownership of the land in favor of the identified beneficiaries</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Thus, title, whether in the form of an Emancipation Patent or a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), can be issued upon execution of the agreement between the landowner and the farmer-beneficiary.<br><br>In fact, DAR Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 1994<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> provides that one of the grounds for the <b>cancellation</b> of registered emancipation patents or CLOAs is "default in the obligation to pay an aggregate of three (3) consecutive amortizations in <i>case of voluntary land transfer/direct payment scheme, except in cases of fortuitous events and force majeure</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, and barring other grounds for invalidity, we find no irregularity in the issuance of respondents' emancipation patents. It was therefore error for the Court of Appeals to have ordered the cancellation of respondents' emancipation patents on such ground.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
