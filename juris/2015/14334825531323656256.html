				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Republic Act No. 8975 does not sanction splitting a cause of action in order for a party to avail itself of the ancillary remedy of a temporary restraining order from this court.

The time periods for the validity of temporary restraining orders issued by trial courts should be strictly followed. No preliminary injunction should issue unless the evidence to support the injunctive relief is clear and convincing.<br><br>We are asked by Dynamic Builders &amp; Construction Co. (Phil.), Inc.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 58 could not have envisioned a simultaneous resort to this court by one that had already filed an action before the Regional Trial Court without violating the basic rules on proscription against the splitting of a cause of action, multiplicity of suits, and forum shopping.<br><br>Rule 2, Section 3 of the Rules of Court provides that "[a] party may not institute more than one suit for a single cause of action." Moreover, Section 4 discusses the splitting of a single cause of action in that "if two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others." The splitting of a cause of action "violate[s] the policy against multiplicity of suits, whose primary objective [is] to avoid unduly burdening the dockets of the courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>This Petition seeks to enjoin the execution of public respondent's Decision and Resolution on the protest — the same Decision and Resolution sought to be set aside in the Petition before the Regional Trial Court. In essence, petitioner seeks the same relief through two separate Petitions filed before separate courts. This violates the rule against forum shopping.<br><br>Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court requires the plaintiff or principal party to certify under oath that he or she has not commenced any action involving the same issues in any court. This court has discussed this rule against forum shopping:<br><blockquote>In essence, forum shopping is the practice of litigants resorting to two different fora for the purpose of obtaining the same relief, to increase their chances of obtaining a favorable judgment. In determining whether forum shopping exists, it is important to consider the vexation caused to the courts and the parties-litigants by a person who asks appellate courts and/or administrative entities to rule on the same related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same relief, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions by the different courts or fora on the same issues. We have ruled that forum shopping is present when, in two or more cases pending, there is identity of (1) parties (2) rights or causes of action and reliefs prayed for and (3) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action, will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>Private respondent alleges that petitioner did not even notify the Regional Trial Court of Bago City, Negros Occidental, of its Petition filed before this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The second paragraph of Article XVII, Section 58 of Republic Act No. 9184 simply means it does not preclude a direct filing before this court in proper cases.<br><br>The Rules of Court provides for original concurrent jurisdiction by the Regional Trial Court, the Court of Appeals, and this court in entertaining petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, or mandamus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> However, parties must adhere to the principle of hierarchy of courts. This was discussed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dimson (Manila), Inc., et al. v. Local Water Utilities Administration</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><blockquote>Clearly, the proper recourse to a court action from decisions of the BAC, such as this one, is to file a <i>certiorari</i> not before the Supreme Court but before the regional trial court which is vested by R.A. No. 9184 with jurisdiction to entertain the same. In the recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">First United Constructors Corporation v. Poro Point Management Corporation</span>, we held that while indeed the <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction of the regional trial court is concurrent with this Court's, that fact alone does not allow an unrestricted freedom of choice of the court forum. But since this is not an iron-clad rule and the full discretionary power to take cognizance of and assume jurisdiction over special civil actions for <i>certiorari</i> directly filed with the Court may actually be exercised by it, it is nevertheless imperative that the Court's intervention be called for by exceptionally compelling reasons or be warranted by the nature of the issues involved. In other words, a direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue the writ will be allowed only when there are special and important reasons clearly and specifically set out in the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The hierarchy of courts must be respected. The doctrine with respect to hierarchy of courts was designed so that this court will have more time to focus on its constitutional tasks without the need to deal with causes that also fall within the lower courts' competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This court acts on petitions for extraordinary writs under Rule 65 "only when absolutely necessary or when serious and important reasons exist to justify an exception to the policy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Consistent with these rules and doctrines, the remedy contemplated by Article XVII, Section 58 of Republic Act No. 9184 is either an action under Rule 65 before the Regional Trial Court or the proper action filed before this court. However, direct resort to this court can prosper only when the requisites for direct invocation of this court's original jurisdiction are present.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Prohibition is a preventive remedy. This court has held that injunctive remedies will not lie for acts already accomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The acts sought to be enjoined in this case included the implementation of the Construction Shoreline Protection Project awarded to private respondent HLJ Construction and Enterprise.

This prohibition shall not apply when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise. The applicant shall file a bond, in an amount to be fixed by the court, which bond shall accrue in favor of the government if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought.<br><br>If after due hearing the court finds that the award of the contract is null and void, the court may, if appropriate under the circumstances, award the contract to the qualified and winning bidder or order a rebidding of the same, without prejudice to any liability that the guilty party may incur under existing laws. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner submits that since the repealing clause of Republic Act No. 8975 has "amended accordingly" Presidential Decree No. 1818, the prohibition no longer extends to this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Section 9 reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 9.

On issues clearly outside this dimension and involving questions of law, this Court declared that courts could not be prevented from exercising their power to restrain or prohibit administrative acts. In such cases, let the hammer fall and let it fall hard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>We also consider the second paragraph of Republic Act No. 8975, Section 3 on the exception to the prohibition:<br><blockquote>This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes or controversies instituted by a private party, including but not limited to cases filed by bidders or those claiming to have rights through such bidders involving such contract/project. <i>This prohibition shall not apply when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise</i>. The applicant shall file a bond, in an amount to be fixed by the court, which bond shall accrue in favor of the government if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In other words, the Regional Trial Court can issue injunctive relief against government infrastructure projects, even those undertaken by local governments, considering that the prohibition in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8957 only mentions <i>national</i> government projects. These courts can issue injunctive relief when there are compelling constitutional violations — only when the right is clear, there is a need to prevent grave and irreparable injuries, and the public interest at stake in restraining or enjoining the project while the action is pending far outweighs the inconvenience or costs to the party to whom the project is awarded.<br><br>Republic Act No. 8975 mentions the constitutional provision in that "[t]he use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Statute cannot be interpreted as to violate protected rights. Thus, the above conditions safeguard against lower court issuances of provisional injunctive relief in cases not falling within the exception.<br><br>These safeguards are also consistent with the law's policy for the expeditious implementation of government projects that ultimately benefit the public:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Declaration of Policy. - Article XII, Section 6 of the Constitution states that the use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good. Towards this end, the State shall <i>ensure the expeditious and efficient- implementation and completion of government infrastructure projects</i> to avoid unnecessary increase in construction, maintenance and/or repair costs and to immediately enjoy the social and economic benefits therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>There is no need for this court to labor on petitioner's arguments regarding violations of due process and equal protection of the law and the alleged grave injustice and irreparable injury petitioner suffered. The Petition's incorporation of its discussion on these arguments, as made in its Petition before the Regional Trial Court docketed as Civil Case No. 1459, only emphasizes the splitting of a cause of action committed.<br><br>In any event, the general rule of prohibition under Republic Act No. 8975 does not preclude lower courts from assuming jurisdiction when the ultimate relief prayed for is to nullify a national government infrastructure project and its implementation:<br><blockquote>However, it must be clarified that Republic Act No. 8975 does not ordinarily warrant the outright dismissal of any complaint or petition before the lower courts seeking permanent injunctive relief from the implementation of national government infrastructure projects. What is expre'ssly prohibited by the statute is the issuance of the provisional reliefs of temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and preliminary mancatory injunctions. <i>It does not preclude the lower courts from assuming jurisdiction over complaints or petitions that seek as ultimate relief the nullification or implementation of a national government infrastructure project</i>. A statute such as Republic Act No. 8975 cannot diminish the constitutionally mandated judicial power to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Section 3 of the law in fact mandates, thus:<br><blockquote>If after due hearing the court finds that the award of the contract is null and void, the court may, if appropriate under the circumstances, award the contract to the qualified and winning bidder or order a rebidding of the same, without prejudice to any liability that the guilty party may incur under existing laws.<br></blockquote>Thus, when a court is called upon to rule on an initiatory pleading ing any material aspect pertinent to a national government infrastructure project, the court ordinarily may not dismiss the action based solely on Republic Act No. 8975 but is merely enjoined from granting provisional reliefs. If no other ground obtains to dismiss the action, the court should decide the case on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>We decide on petitioner's verified Petition to Cite Respondent for Contempt alleging violation of this court's September 18, 2006 status quo Order.<br><br>In its Comment, private respondent HLJ Construction and Enterprise explains that it has no intention to disobey the Resolution.
