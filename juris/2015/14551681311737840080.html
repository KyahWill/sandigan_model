BPI also alleged that as registered owner of the properties subject of the foreclosure, it has the right to the immediate possession of the property and its right to immediate possession is impaired by the grant of the appeal.<br><br>On the other hand, Spouses Co and Jupiter maintained that the proper remedy is an ordinary appeal, instead of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, because there is no grave abuse of discretion when the court issues a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> They added that the possession of a third party in a writ of possession is an exemption to the ministerial and non-judicial proceedings in a petition for writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> on June 27, 2011 denying the appeal of Spouses Co and Jupiter filed on October 21, 2005, and affirming the Amended Order dated December 8, 2005.

Further, the petition for rehabilitation was filed later than the petition for writ of possession. BPI also claimed that the rulings in <i>Bank of Commerce</i> and <i>Sulit</i> do not apply to this case.<br><br>On February 5, 2014, BPI manifested<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that the properties are still in the possession of Spouses Co and the writ of possession is necessary to deliver their possession to BPI.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><ol><li>Whether the writ of possession was validly issued;<br><br></li><li>Whether the RTC Br. 196 erred in giving due course to the <i>Notice of Appeal</i> of Spouses Co and Jupiter from its Order dated September 30, 2005 and Amended Order dated December 8, 2005 granting the writ of possession in favor of BPI;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not Act No. 3135, as amended, violates the Constitution; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the CA erred in denying the consolidation of LRC Case No. 03-0063 with Civil Case No. 02-0331.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b><br></div><br><i>Validity of the Issuance of the Writ of Possession</i><br><br>Under Section 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, the purchaser in a foreclosure sale may apply for a writ of possession during the redemption period. Upon the purchaser's filing of an <i>ex parte</i> petition and posting of the appropriate bond, the RTC shall, as a matter of course, order the issuance of the writ of possession in the purchaser's favor. But equally well settled is the rule that a writ of possession will issue as a matter of course, even without the filing and approval of a bond, after consolidation of ownership and the issuance of a new TCT in the name of the purchaser.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Upon expiration of the redemption period, the right of the purchaser to the possession of the foreclosed property becomes absolute. This right to possession is based on the purchaser's ownership of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In like manner, the mere filing of an <i>ex parte</i> motion for the issuance of the writ of possession would suffice and the filing of a bond is no longer necessary. This is because possession has become the absolute right of the purchaser as the confirmed owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Spouses Co and Jupiter do not deny that they failed to redeem the properties mortgaged within the redemption period. Consequently, ownership over the properties was consolidated in the name of BPI and new titles were issued in its name. Thus, as the new registered owner, BPI is even more entitled to the possession of the properties and has the unmistakable right to file an <i>ex parte</i> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession.<br><br>Spouses Co insist that the petition for issuance of a writ of possession should have been denied because of the pendency of the petition for nullification of the foreclosure sale, and the petition for rehabilitation, and the stay order. We are not persuaded.<br><br>The mere pendency of a petition for corporate rehabilitation and the issuance of a stay order do not and cannot enjoin the courts from the enforcement of claims; neither does it make the case unique and peculiar. In <i>Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. DNG Realty and Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we reiterated the rule in <i>New Frontier Sugar Corporation v. Regional Trial Court, Branch 39, Iloilo City</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that a stay order or the suspension of the enforcement of all claims against the corporation shall commence only from the time the rehabilitation receiver is appointed and a stay order is issued.<br><br>In <i>Town and Country Enterprises, Inc. v. Qinsumbing, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which presents the same set of facts with this case, we held:<br><blockquote>Considering that Metrobank acquired ownership over the mortgaged properties upon the expiration of the redemption period on 6 February 2002, TCEI is also out on a limb in invoking the Stay Order issued by the Rehabilitation Court on 8 October 2002 and the approval of its rehabilitation plan on 29 March 2004. An essential function of corporate rehabilitation is, admittedly, the Stay Order which is a mechanism of suspension of all actions and claims against the distressed corporation upon the dis­appointment of a management committee or rehabilitation receiver. The Stay Order issued by the Rehabilitation Court in SMC Case No. 023-02 cannot, however, apply to the mortgage obligations owing to Metrobank which had already been enforced even before TCEI's filing of its petition for corporate rehabilitation on 1 October 2002.<br><br>In <i>Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. DNG Really and Development Corporation</i>, the Court upheld the validity of the writ of possession procured by the creditor despite the subsequent issuance of a stay order in the rehabilitation proceedings instituted by the debtor. In said case. Equitable PCI Bank (<i>Equitable</i>) foreclosed on 30 June 2003 the mortgage executed in its favor by DNG Realty and Development Corporation (DNG) and was declared the highest bidder at the 4 September 2003 public auction of the property. On 21 October 2003, DNG also instituted a petition for corporate rehabilitation which resulted in the issuance of a Stay Order on 27 October 2003. Having caused the recording of the Certificate of Sale on 3 December 2003, on the other hand, Equitable executed an affidavit of consolidation of its ownership which served as basis for the issuance of a new title in its favor on 10 December 2003. Equitable subsequently filed an action for the issuance of a writ of possession on 17 March 2004 which was eventually granted on 6 September 2004. In affirming the validity of the certificate of sale, certificate of title and writ of possession issued in favor of Equitable, the Court ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>In RCBC, we upheld the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of the mortgage properties of BF Homes wherein RCBC emerged as the highest bidder as it was done before the appointment of the management committee. Noteworthy to mention was the fact that the issuance of the certificate of sale in RCBC's favor, the consolidation of title, and the issuance of the new titles in RCBC's name had also been upheld notwithstanding that the same were all done after the management committee had already been appointed and there was already a suspension of claims. Thus, applying <i>RCBC v. IAC</i> in this case, since the foreclosure of respondent DNG's mortgage and the issuance of the certificate of sale in petitioner EPCIB's favor were done prior to the appointment of a Rehabilitation Receiver and the Stay Order, all the actions taken with respect to the foreclosed mortgage property which were subsequent to the issuance of the Stay Order were not affected by the Stay Order. Thus, <i>after the redemption period expired without respondent redeeming the foreclosed properly, petitioner becomes the absolute owner of the property and it was within its right to ask for the consolidation of title and the issuance of new title in its name as a consequence of ownership; thus, it is entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the property</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Citations omitted) (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote></blockquote>In this case, the auction sale on July 12, 2000, the registration and annotation of the certificate of sale on August 22, 2000 and the issuance of new titles in favor of BPI in 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> as well as the petition for issuance of the writ of possession were all completed before the filing of the petition for rehabilitation and the issuance of the stay order in September 2003. Thus, after the redemption period expired without respondent redeeming the foreclosed property, BPI became the absolute owner of the property and it was within its right to move for the consolidation of title and the issuance of new title in its name as a consequence of ownership; thus, it is entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><i>Remedy to assail an order granting a writ of possession</i><br><br>We find no merit in BPI's argument that the order of the RTC Br. 196 granting a writ of possession is merely interlocutory from which no appeal may be taken.<br><br>In <i>Mallari v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we ruled that it is the ministerial duty of the trial court to issue a writ of possession in favor of the purchaser who has already consolidated its title. After the consolidation of title in the buyer's name for failure of the mortgagor to redeem the property, the writ of possession becomes a matter of right. Its issuance to a purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale is merely a ministerial function. The trial court <i>has no discretion</i> on this matter. Hence, any assertion of discretion in connection with such issuance is misplaced, and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is not a proper remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The order for the issuance of a writ of possession being final, it is a proper subject for appeal.<br><br>We clarify, however, that this remedy of appeal is different from the remedy provided in Section 8 of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> An error of judgment committed by a court in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction is not the same as grave abuse of discretion. Errors of judgment are correctible by appeal while those of jurisdiction are reviewable by <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In <i>680 Home Appliances, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> we explained that Act No. 3135 finds no application after the lapse of the redemption period, and the remedy of a debtor to contest the possession of the property is a separate action, and not the appeal provided for in Section 8 of the Act. We explained:<br><blockquote>In a number of cases, the Court declared that Section 8 of Act No. 3135 is the available remedy to set aside a writ of possession, without considering whether the writ involved in each of these cases was issued during or after the lapse of the redemption period. Upon revaluation, we find it necessary to make a distinction and clarify when the remedy under Section 8 of Act No. 3135 may be availed of.<br><br>xxx<br><br>Act No. 3135 governs only the manner of the sale and redemption of the mortgaged real property in an extrajudicial foreclosure; proceedings beyond these, <i>i.e.</i>, upon the lapse of the redemption period and the consolidation of the purchaser's title, are no longer within its scope. xxx<br><br>As pointed out, the remedy provided under Section 8 of Act No. 3135 to the debtor becomes available only after the purchaser acquires <b><i>actual</i></b> possession of the property. This is required because until then the debtor, as the owner of the property, does not lose his right to possess.<br><br>However, <b>upon the lapse of the redemption period without the debtor exercising his right of redemption and the purchaser consolidates his title, it becomes unnecessary to require the purchaser to assume actual possession thereof before the debtor may contest it</b>. Possession of the land becomes an absolute right of the purchaser, as this is merely an incident of his ownership. In fact, the issuance of the writ of possession at this point becomes ministerial for the court. The debtor contesting the purchaser's possession may no longer avail of the remedy under Section 8 of Act No. 3135, but should pursue a separate action <i>e.g.</i>, action for recovery of ownership, for annulment of mortgage and/or annulment of foreclosure. FSAMI's consolidation of ownership therefore makes the remedy under Section 8 of Act No. 3135 unavailable for 680 Home. 680 Home cannot assail the writ of possession by filing a petition in LRC No. M-5444.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citations omitted) (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><i>Constitutionality of Act No. 3135, as amended</i><br><br>Spouses Co alleged that the <i>ex parte</i> nature of the proceedings under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 violates the due process clause of the Constitution. In <i>Rayo v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company</i>, we already ruled that the issuance of the writ of possession in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings docs not violate the mortgagor's right to constitutional due process, thus:<br><blockquote>First, there was no violation of petitioner's right to constitutional due process. In a long line of cases, we have consistently ruled that the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of the purchaser in a foreclosure sale of a mortgaged property under Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended is a ministerial duty of the court. The purchaser of the foreclosed property, upon <i>ex parte</i> application and the posting of the required bond, has the right to acquire possession of the foreclosed property during the 12-month redemption period and with more reason, after the expiration of the redemption period.<br><br>An <i>ex parte</i> petition for the issuance of a writ of possession under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 is not, strictly speaking, a "judicial process" as contemplated in Article 433 of the Civil Code. It is a judicial proceeding for the enforcement of one's right of possession as purchaser in a foreclosure sale. It is not an ordinary suit filed in court, by which one party "sues another for the enforcement of a wrong or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong." It is a non-litigious proceeding authorized in an extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage pursuant to Act No. 3135, as amended, and is brought for the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or consent by any person adversely interested. It is a proceeding where the relief is granted without requiring an opportunity for the person against whom the relief is sought to be heard. No notice is needed to be served upon persons interested in the subject property.<br><br>xxx<br><br>Now, petitioner is challenging the constitutionality of Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended, lie avers that Section 7 violates the clue process clause because, by the mere&nbsp; filing of an <i>ex parte</i> motion in the proper cadastral court, the purchaser in a foreclosure sale is allowed to obtain possession of the foreclosed property during the redemption period.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners attempt to challenge the constitutionality of Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended, constitutes a collateral attack that is not allowed. We fully agree with the appellate court's ruling, for reasons of public policy, the constitutionality of a law cannot be attacked collaterally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis and citations omitted)<br></blockquote><i>On the propriety of consolidation</i><br><br>Spouses Co claim that based on our rulings in <i>Philippine Savings Bank v.
