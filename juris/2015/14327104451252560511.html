No. 103917, pending with the CA after the trial court dismissed Lexber's rehabilitation petition in its May 23, 2008 order. <b>Because of this supervening event, the Court is also compelled to deny the present petition. We so rule to avoid any conflicting ruling with the CA's decision in CA G.R. No. 103917, which is reviewing the rehabilitation petition's dismissal but for a different and more substantive reason, <i>i.e.</i>, the disapproval of Lexber's rehabilitation plan.</b><br><br>This possibility of rendering conflicting decisions among reviewing courts is one of the reasons why the Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (<i>2008 Rules</i>) amended the Interim Rules' provision on the available procedural remedies after the filing of the rehabilitation petition. This has also been further amended in the new Financial Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (<i>2013 Rules</i>).<br><br>Under the Interim Rules, a motion for reconsideration is a prohibited pleading.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[25]</sup></font> This is no longer true under the 2008 Rules and the new 2013 Rules, which implemented the procedural changes outlined below:<br><br><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b>2008 Rules</b></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b>2013 Rules</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"><b>Rule 8 <br> Procedural Remedies </b></div> <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Section 1. </b><i>Motion for Reconsideration. </i>-A party may file a motion for reconsideration of any order issued by the court prior to the approval of the rehabilitation plan. <b>No relief can be extended to the party aggrieved by the court's order on the motion through a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.

Any issue arising from a denied motion for reconsideration may only be raised as an assigned error in the Rule 43 petition and may not be questioned in a separate Rule 65 petition. The exception to this is when the issue only arose after the issuance of the order denying or approving the rehabilitation plan.<br><br>This procedural guideline had been further amended in the 2013 Rules where any relief from the trial court's denial of a motion for reconsideration is no longer available. Moreover, the CA's mode of review is now through Rule 65 and not Rule 43. But despite this further change, the 2013 Rules retained the guideline in the 2008 Rules <b>that review may be sought from the CA <i>only after the rehabilitation court issues an order approving or disapproving the rehabilitation plan.</i></b><br><br>Thus, if after the filing of the rehabilitation petition the trial court is satisfied that the jurisdictional requirements were complied with, the initial hearing shall commence and the petition for rehabilitation shall be given due course.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <b><u>At this stage, no appeal or <i>certiorari</i> petition may yet be filed as any remedy is only available after the order approving or disapproving the rehabilitation plan</u>. This is to avoid the present situation where there are multiple petitions filed with the appellate courts from which conflicting decisions may be rendered.</b><br><br>But since these procedural rules were not yet in place when the facts of this case occurred, the Court's remedy is to deny the present petition in order to avoid pre-empting the proceedings in CA G.R. No. 103917.<br><br>Despite this denial, the Court still deems it appropriate to resolve the substantive issues which Lexber raised vis-a-vis the Interim Rules. This is to correct any erroneous legal reasoning which the CA committed, and uphold controlling legal principles for the benefit of the bench, the bar and the public.<br><br><b><i>The HLURB's prior request for the&nbsp; <br>appointment of a rehabilitation receiver<br> is not a condition precedent before the <br>trial court can give due course to a <br>rehabilitation petition.</i></b><br><br>To
 support its argument that the HLURB's prior request is a condition 
precedent that must be complied with before the trial court can give due
 course to a rehabilitation petition of a real estate company like 
Lexber, the CA invoked Section 6(c) of PD-902-A as basis. The pertinent 
part of this provision states:<br><br><blockquote><i>[T]he [SEC] may 
appoint a rehabilitation receiver of corporations, partnerships or other
 associations supervised or regulated by <b>other government agencies, <u>such as banks and insurance companies, upon request of the government agency concerned</u></b>. [Emphasis supplied.]</i><br></blockquote><br>Notably,
 the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEOs) jurisdiction over 
rehabilitation cases had already been transferred to the regional trial 
courts acting as commercial courts by virtue of Republic Act (RA) 8799<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or the Securities Regulation Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 The CA argues that despite this jurisdictional transfer, the 
substantive provisions of PD 902-A, particularly those powers which the 
SEC may exercise in rehabilitation cases, remain.<br><br>The CA is 
correct in this line of reasoning. However it erred in interpreting 
Section 6(c) to mean that no rehabilitation petition of a corporation 
that the HLURB regulates, can be heard unless a prior request of this 
agency for the appointment of a rehabilitation receiver was made.<br><br>The CA explains that its reasoning is consistent with the rule that if there is a particular agency regulating a business,<i> e.g., the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)</i>
 over banks, and the Insurance Commission (IC) over insurance companies,
 no rehabilitation petition can be initiated without their request for 
the appointment of a receiver.<br><br>The error in this generalization is its failure to identify the distinction between the enumerated examples in Section 6(c), <i>i.e.,</i> banks and insurance companies, and Lexber, a construction and real estate company.<br><br>Under Section 30<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of RA 7653,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which had been retained under Section 69<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of RA 8971,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the designation of a conservator or the appointment of a receiver for the rehabilitation of banks and quasi-banks, is vested exclusively with the Monetary Board. On the other hand, PD 612<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> specifically mandates the IC to designate the receiver of an insurance company in case of its insolvency or rehabilitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the respective charters of the BSP and the IC specifically authorize them to appoint a receiver in case a company under their regulation is undergoing corporate rehabilitation. Notably, this is not the case with the HLURB. Its enabling law does not grant it this particular power.<br><br>Section 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of Executive Order 64836 of the HLURB's charter, enumerates the powers that the HLURB is authorized to exercise.<br><br>Section 8 of the same law also provides the functions which had been transferred from the National Housing Authority to the HLURB, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Regulation of the real estate trade and business;<br></li><li>Registration of subdivision lots and condominium projects;<br></li><li>Issuance of license to sell subdivision lots and condominium units in the registered units;<br></li><li>Approval of performance bond and the suspension of license to sell;<br></li><li>Registration of dealers, brokers and salesman engaged in the business of selling subdivision lots or condominium units;<br></li><li>Revocation of registration of dealers, brokers and salesmen;<br></li><li>Approval or mortgage on any subdivision lot or condominium unit made by the owner of developer;<br></li><li>Granting of permits for the alteration of plans and the extension of period for completion of subdivision or condominium projects;<br></li><li>Approval of the conversion to other purposes of roads and open spaces found within the project which have been donated to the city or municipality concerned;<br></li><li>Regulation of the relationship between lessors and lessees; and<br></li><li>Hear and decide cases on unsound real estate business practices; claims involving refund filed against project owners, developers, dealers, brokers or salesmen and cases of specific performance.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>An examination of these functions confirms that in sharp contrast to the BSP and the IC, nowhere in the HLURB's charter is it expressly or impliedly granted the power to appoint the rehabilitation receivers of financially distressed corporations under its supervision and regulation.<br><br>An administrative agency's powers are limited to those expressly conferred on it or granted by necessary or fair implication in its enabling act. In our constitutional framework, which mandates a limited government, its branches and administrative agencies exercise only those powers delegated to them as "defined either in the Constitution or in legislation, or in both."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Notably, the powers granted to the HLURB are focused on its regulation of real estate companies to ensure that the investing public is protected from fraudulent real estate practices. These powers do not touch upon the HLURB's authority to intervene in the general corporate acts, <i>e.g</i>. the rehabilitation, of those under its supervision.<br><br>While it may be argued that the HLURB should be informed of the financial rehabilitation of a real estate company, to enable it to intelligently and meaningfully exercise its functions, the law is clear that the HLURB's prior request for the appointment of a receiver of real estate companies, is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> before the trial court can give due course to their rehabilitation petition.<br><br><b><i>The lapse of the 180-day period for the <br>approval of the rehabilitation plan should<br>not automatically result to the dismissal of<br>the rehabilitation petition.</i></b><br><br>In ruling for the outright dismissal of Lexber's rehabilitation petition, the CA noted that the trial court failed to approve Lexber's rehabilitation plan within 180 days from the date of the initial hearing, thus prompting the application of Rule 4, Section 11 of the Interim Rules, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 11</b>. <i>Period of the Stay Order </i>- The stay order shall be effective from the date of its issuance until the dismissal of the petition or the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings.<br><br><b>The petition <u>shall be dismissed</u> if no rehabilitation plan is approved by the court upon the lapse of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the initial hearing. <u>The court may grant an extension beyond this period</u></b> only if it appears by convincing and compelling evidence that the debtor may successfully be rehabilitated.<b> In no instance, however, shall the period for approving or disapproving a rehabilitation plan exceed <u>eighteen (18) months from the date of filing of the petition</u>.</b> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>The CA explained that the word "shall" is a word of command. Thus, the essential effect of the non-approval of the rehabilitation plan after 180 days from the initial hearing is the dismissal of the rehabilitation petition.<br><br>However, while the general rule in statutory construction is that the words "shall," "must," "ought," or "should" are of mandatory character in common parlance, it is also well-recognized in law and equity that this is not an absolute rule or inflexible criterion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The records of the present case show that on May 4, 2007, Lexber filed a motion for the extension of the period for the approval of the rehabilitation plan. However, the trial court never issued a resolution on this motion. Instead, on June 12, 2007, it issued an order giving due course to the petition. The records also reveal that after the initial hearing, the trial court had to conduct additional hearings even after the lapse of the 180-day period.<br><br>Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Lexber could not be faulted for the non-approval of the rehabilitation plan within the 180-day period. A petitioner-corporation should not be penalized if the trial court needed more time to evaluate the rehabilitation plan. Notably, in the present case, Lexber filed a motion for the extension of the 180-day period. However, the trial court did not issue a resolution on this motion. Instead, it issued an order giving due course to the petition, which also fell within the 18-month limit prescribed under the law.<br><br>Rule 2, Section 2 of the Interim Rules dictates the courts to liberally construe the rehabilitation rules in order to carry out the objectives of Sections 6(c) of PD 902-A, as amended, and to assist the parties in obtaining a just, expeditious, and inexpensive determination of rehabilitation cases.<br><br>The trial court's decision to approve or disapprove a rehabilitation plan is not a ministerial function and would require its extensive study and analysis. As it turned out, after careful scrutiny of the rehabilitation petition, and its annexes, the trial court eventually disapproved Lexber's rehabilitation plan and dismissed the rehabilitation petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>DENY</b> the present petition in view of the pendency of CA G.R.
