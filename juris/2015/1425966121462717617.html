It is now settled that all treasury bonds (including PEACe Bonds), regardless of the number of purchasers/lenders at the time of origination/issuance are considered deposit substitutes.&nbsp; In the case of zero-coupon bonds, the discount (i.e. difference between face value and purchase price/discounted value of the bond) is treated as interest income of the purchaser/holder.&nbsp;

The word “any” plainly indicates that the period contemplated is the entire term of the bond, and not merely the point of origination or issuance. . . . Thus, by taking the PEACe bonds out of the ambit of deposits [sic] substitutes and exempting it from the 20% Final Tax, an exemption in favour of the PEACe Bonds was created when no such exemption is found in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On October 11, 2011, a “Memo for Trading Participants No. 58-2011 was issued by the Philippine Dealing System Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries (“PDS Group”).&nbsp; The Memo provides that in view of the pronouncement of the DOF and the BIR on the applicability of the 20% FWT on the Government Bonds, no transfer of the same shall be allowed to be recorded in the Registry of Scripless Securities (“ROSS”) from 12 October 2011 until the redemption payment date on 18 October 2011.&nbsp; Thus, the bondholders of record appearing on the ROSS as of 18 October 2011, which include the Petitioners, shall be treated by the BTr as the beneficial owners of such securities for the relevant [tax] payments to be imposed thereon.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 2011, replying to an urgent query from the Bureau of Treasury, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued <b>BIR Ruling No. DA 378-2011</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> clarifying that the final withholding tax due on the discount or interest earned on the PEACe Bonds should “be imposed and withheld not only on RCBC/CODE NGO but also [on] ‘all subsequent holders of the Bonds.’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 2011, petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and/or mandamus (with urgent application for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> before this court.<br><br>On October 18, 2011, this court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> “enjoining the implementation of BIR Ruling No. 370-2011 against the [PEACe Bonds,] . . . subject to the condition that the 20% final withholding tax on interest income therefrom shall be withheld by the petitioner banks and placed in escrow pending resolution of [the] petition.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>On October 28, 2011, RCBC and RCBC Capital filed a motion for leave of court to intervene and to admit petition-in-intervention<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> dated October 27, 2011, which was granted by this court on November 15, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on November 9, 2011, petitioners filed their “Manifestation with Urgent Ex Parte Motion to Direct Respondents to Comply with the TRO.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; They alleged that on the same day that the temporary restraining order was issued, the Bureau of Treasury paid to petitioners and other bondholders the amounts representing the face value of the Bonds, net however of the amounts corresponding to the 20% final withholding tax on interest income, and that the Bureau of Treasury refused to release the amounts corresponding to the 20% final withholding tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On November 15, 2011, this court directed respondents to: “(1) SHOW CAUSE why they failed to comply with the October 18, 2011 resolution; and (2) COMPLY with the Court’s resolution in order that petitioners may place the corresponding funds in escrow pending resolution of the petition.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>On the same day, CODE-NGO filed a motion for leave to intervene (and to admit attached petition-in-intervention with comment on the petition-in-intervention of RCBC and RCBC Capital).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; The motion was granted by this court on November 22, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>On December 1, 2011, public respondents filed their compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; They explained that: 1) “the implementation of [BIR Ruling No. 370-2011], which has already been performed on October 18, 2011 with the withholding of the 20% final withholding tax on the face value of the PEACe bonds, is already <i>fait accompli </i>. . . when the Resolution and TRO were served to and received by respondents BTr and National Treasurer [on October 19, 2011]”;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and 2) the withheld amount has <i>ipso facto</i> become public funds and cannot be disbursed or released to petitioners without congressional appropriation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents further aver that “[i]nasmuch as the . . .

It said only that the bond issue was limited to the 19-lender rule and therefore was exempted from the 20 percent withholding tax. . . .<br><br>The secondary reserve eligibility was finally mentioned in the Treasury Notice that was released on 15 October 2001, one day before the auction.<br><br>On the day of the auction the Treasury gave further clarification on the tax exemption and secondary reserve eligibility features of the PEACe Bonds.<br><br>We do not know what time this memo was released to the dealers, considering that the cutoff time for submitting bids was 12 noon. But this memo is also an indication that until the day of the auction itself, RCBC’s rival bidders needed further clarification on crucial aspects of the PEACe Bond float that should have been factored into their bids.<br><br>No mention at all was made of Insurance Commission eligibility, or that winning bidders could apply to Insurance Commission for eligibility.<br><br>Based on this information, we surmise that the GSEDs had far less time than CODE-NGO/RCBC to look for investors, price the bonds accordingly and submit a winning bid. On the other hand, because CODE-NGO and RCBC had worked on this flotation since the beginning and knew all the details surrounding the auction before it was announced to the bidders, they were extremely prepared to bid appropriately. They also had a seven-month headstart over their rival bidders, to mobilize the PhP10 billion of resources — whose nature has yet to be determined — needed to snag the entire auction. Between a bank that had seven months to accumulate several billions of pesos and others that had only a week’s notice — the cost of capital of the latter would be significantly much higher. This cost of quickly liquefying assets contributed to the costs of and the consequent weaker ability of the other banks to bid aggressively even if they intended to.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>If the auction were a ‘level playing field’ where GSEDs have the same competencies and access to the same information, the chances of RCBC winning all its four bids is 24 in 3,575,880 (0.0007 percent). Despite such odds RCBC won all its four bids. This means that RCBC operated on either a tremendous advantage, or on a dire need far greater than its competitors, or both.”<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 292.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Id. at 27.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Id. at 27 and 497.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Id. at 1060–1074.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Id. at 1060.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Id. at 1066.
