Rhodora Calinawan and the defendant herself; the same is proven by Exhs. 1 – 1-B-4; 2 – 2-A; 3; 4 – 4-H-2; 5 – 5-G-2; 6 – 6-G-2; 7 – 7-E-2; 8 – 8-C; 9 – 9-M; 9-N – 9-EE; 15 – 15-A2; 15-B – 15-B-5; 15-B2 – 15-Z.<br><br>(2) That defendant paid plaintiff the total amount of P10,592,194.80 before plaintiff abandoned the work (Exhs. 16 – 16-Q).<br><br>(3) That defendant had to finish the work abandoned by plaintiff, incurring substantial additional expenses therefor.&nbsp; This is also supported not only by her testimony, but by documentary evidence presented by her (Exhs. 21; 20 – 20-A; 21 – 21-F; 22 – 22-CCC; 23 – 23-M; 24 – 24-JJJ; 25 – 25-S; 26 – 26-QQ; 28 – 28-AAAA-130; 29 – 29-JJJ).<br><br>(4) As to the claim of defendant for moral damages, the Court finds that she is entitled to moral damages, but not for the amount she is claiming.&nbsp; The testimony given by defendant on how the problems created by plaintiff affected her personally is believable; and furthermore, it is supported by official receipts of an Acupuncture Consultant (Exhs. 30-34).&nbsp; This is one of the cases wherein moral damages are allowed by Article 2220 of the New Civil Code.&nbsp; Breach of Contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.<br><br>(5) With respect to exemplary damages, the Court perceives that same should be granted, but moderates the same.&nbsp; Plaintiff being in the construction business to the public, should be deterred from doing to others, what it did to defendant.&nbsp; This is one of the situations envisioned by Article 2229 of the New Civil Code, for exemplary damages.<br><br>(6) The Court is convinced that attorney’s fees should also be adjudicated, considering the work that counsel for defendant undertook.&nbsp; Attorney’s fees should be adjudicated, in accordance with Article 2208 of the New Civil Code.<br><br>(7) The Court is also persuaded to grant penalties for delay, as provided for in the agreement between the parties (Exhs. 11-B-1 and 11-B-2).<br><br>(8) The Court, however, is not inclined to grant additional consequential damages of P1,600,000.00, because this court finds that this claim has not been properly supported.<br><br>(9) Finally, the Court is inclined to grant defendant’s claim, for lost rentals, which is properly supported by the testimony of defendant and very plausible under the circumstances, because one of the duplex apartments was constructed for rental income purposes and its completion and rental was very much delayed, because of the fault of plaintiff.<br><br>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, plaintiff FAJ Construction &amp; Development Corporation is hereby ordered to pay defendant Susan Saulog, the following amounts:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">P3,213,575.91 as actual damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Lost rentals of P5,391,456.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Moral damages of P500,000.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Exemplary damages of P500,000.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Penalties for delay amounting to P1,387,500.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(6) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Attorney’s fees of P20,000.00, plus appearance fee of P4,000.00 per appearance, payable to Atty.

CV No. 88385, the appeal essentially argued that the trial court erred in holding petitioner liable to the respondent for the amounts stated in the decretal portion of the trial court’s decision.&nbsp; In addition, petitioner contended that it was erroneous for the trial court to have dismissed its complaint for failure to prosecute, as it should not be penalized for the negligence of its counsel in the handling of Civil Case No. Q-02-45865, which is the sole reason for the dismissal thereof.<br><br>On November 29, 2011, the CA rendered the assailed Decision affirming with modification the January 30, 2006 Decision of the trial court, pronouncing thus:<br><br><blockquote>Appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> now questions anew the propriety of the dismissal of the complaint on ground of failure to prosecute.&nbsp; Appellant argues that it should not be made to suffer the consequences of the negligence or mistakes of its counsel.<br><br>This Court finds that any disquisition on this issue is improper for being barred by <i>res judicata</i>. x x x<br><br>More, appellant’s case was dismissed for failure to prosecute because of the numerous delays caused by its counsel.&nbsp; Appellant cannot be excused from the actions of its counsel since it is likewise a settled rule that mistake[s] of counsel binds the client.&nbsp; It is only in case of gross or palpable negligence of counsel when courts must step in and accord relief to a client who suffered thereby. x x x<br><br>The next issue is: did appellee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> adequately prove her right to actual damages for rectification of appellant’s defective work?&nbsp; Article 1715 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br>Article 1715.&nbsp; The contractor shall execute the work in such a manner that it has the qualities agreed upon and has no defects which destroy or lessen its value or fitness for its ordinary or stipulated use.&nbsp; Should the work be not of such quality, the employer may require that the contractor remove the defect or execute another work.&nbsp; If the contractor fails or refuses to comply with this obligation, the employer may have the defect removed or another work executed, at the contractor’s cost.<br><br>Evidently, Article 1715 gives the employer the options to require the removal of the work, to rectify the flaws in their work, or to have the work done at the expense of the contractor.<br><br>Here, the defective workmanship was amply proven by Architect Rhodora Calinawan’s testimony and documentary evidence i.e., photographs, receipts, and list of the expenses needed to rectify appellant’s poorly crafted work.&nbsp; Hence, We sustain the award of actual damages based on these testimonial and documentary evidence.<br><br>Regarding the penalty for delay in the amount of One Million Three Hundred Eighty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,387,500.00), the same should also be sustained.&nbsp; A contract is the law between the parties, and they are bound by its stipulations so long as they are not contrary to law, customs, public policy and public morals.&nbsp; The penalty for delay is agreed upon by the parties themselves.&nbsp; The fact that appellant was already delayed in the completion of the duplex is undisputed.&nbsp; In fact, record shows that on January 24, 2000, appellee approved the extension requested by appellant.&nbsp; This request for extension, by itself, is already proof of delay.&nbsp; Thus, at the time appellant abandoned the project, it already incurred delay.&nbsp; Verily, it is only proper that appellant be made to pay the penalty for delay after appellee no longer agreed to any further extension.<br><br>We now go to the issue of damages.<br><br>Moral damages are recoverable for breach of contract where the breach was wanton, reckless, malicious or in bad faith, oppressive or abusive.&nbsp; However, moral damages are improperly awarded, absent a specific finding and pronouncement from the trial court that a party acted in such manner.&nbsp; Here, the only basis of the trial court in granting moral damages of P500,000.00 was appellee’s gratuitous claim that she suffered sleepless nights for her frozen shoulder and trigger finger, supposedly evidenced by 5 official receipts issued by her acupuncturist whom she paid P400.00 per receipt.&nbsp; No evidence, however, was adduced showing that her frozen shoulder and trigger finger were the direct result of the delayed project.&nbsp; The basis for such award is too shallow and evidently untenable, hence, the same must be deleted.<br><br>As a consequence, the award of exemplary damages should also be vacated. x x x<br><br>Also, appellee does not dispute the fact that the total contract price was P12,500,000.00.&nbsp; After paying more than P10,500,000.00, appellee made several demands for the parts that did not meet the agreed specifications.&nbsp; On the other hand, appellant was of the firm belief that it had the right to work stoppage, as authorized under the contractor’s manual.&nbsp; Both parties honestly believed that their respective actions were justified, hence, no bad faith can be attributed to either party to merit the award of damages.<br><br>Too, this Court finds that the trial court erred in holding appellant liable for lost rentals in the amount of Five Million Three Hundred Ninety One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Six Pesos (P5,391,456.00).&nbsp; Unrealized profits fall under the category of actual or compensatory damages.&nbsp; If there exists a basis for reasonable expectation of profits had there been no breach of contract, indemnification for damages based on such expected profits is proper.&nbsp; Here, appellee did not present any evidence to show that there was already a potential lessee to one of the units of the duplex.&nbsp; Even assuming that appellee may have presented evidence to show the existence of a future lessee, she should have presented a contract of lease showing the contract price.&nbsp; She should have also shown that the rental rate, at that time and in that area was, similar or at least approximately close to the amount of P160,000.00 per month.&nbsp; Without any of these evidence, damages based on lost rental is purely speculative.&nbsp; In the same way that one could speculate that the unit will be rented out, a person cannot be precluded from speculating that the other unit may be occupied by a close relative for free.&nbsp; The court must rely on competent evidence and must avoid any speculation or give premium to self-serving allegations.&nbsp; As stated, the award of P5,391,456.00 is in the nature of actual damages.&nbsp; To be recoverable, actual damages must not only be capable of proof, but must actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty.&nbsp; Courts cannot simply rely on speculation, conjecture, or guesswork in determining the fact and amount of damages.&nbsp; To justify an award of actual damages, there must be competent proof of the actual amount of loss.&nbsp; Credence can be given only to claims which are duly supported by receipts x x x.&nbsp; These are not present in the case at bar.<br><br>As for attorney’s fees, it is well settled that the law allows judicial discretion to determine whether or not attorney’s fees are appropriate. The surrounding circumstances of each case are to be considered.&nbsp; Here, We resolve to delete the award of attorney’s fees since the trial court did not make any particular finding that any of the instances enumerated in Art. 2208 of the Civil Code exists.&nbsp; More, it is settled that the award of attorney’s fees is the exception rather than the general rule.&nbsp; Counsel’s fees are not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.<br><br>The trial court correctly imposed 6% interest on all awarded amounts commencing from the date of the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at 6% per annum.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION, deleting the award of lost rentals, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees, including appearance fee.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration, but in a February 24, 2012 Resolution, the CA denied the same.&nbsp; Hence, the present Petition.<br><br>Issues<br><br>In a January 28, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> this Court resolved to give due course to the Petition, which raises the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT RES JUDICATA APPLIES IN THE INSTANT CASE.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT PETITIONER IS LIABLE FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES, AND IN IMPOSING THE PENALTY FOR DELAY AND AWARDING INTEREST ON ALL AMOUNTS DUE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments<br></i></b><br>In its Petition and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> seeking to reverse and set aside the assailed CA dispositions and praying that judgment be rendered absolving it from the adjudged pecuniary liabilities or, in the alternative, that a new trial of its case be held, petitioner argues that <i>res judicata</i> cannot be made as basis to deny it the opportunity to question the dismissal of its case and to present its evidence because the dismissal of its Petition in G.R. No. 166336 was not an adjudication of the case on its merits; that the dismissal of Civil Case No. Q-02-45865 was not due to its fault, but solely the gross negligence of its counsel; that the case should not have been dismissed as it was not guilty of lack of diligence in failing to continue with trial with reasonable promptitude;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> that it should not be made liable for the adjudged liabilities as they are bereft of factual and legal basis; that respondent’s witness, architect Rhodora Calinawan (Calinawan), was not competent to testify, nor was she an objective, reliable, or trustworthy witness; that the supposed actual damages suffered by respondent have not been adequately proved; that when respondent refused to pay the outstanding balance, petitioner was justified in stopping work, and any damages suffered by respondent thereafter may not be attributed to it but constitute <i>damnum absque injuria</i>; that the adjudged penalty for its supposed delay is excessive; and that there is no basis to award interest.<br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> respondent contends that the issue of whether the trial and appellate courts correctly decided the amount of damages is a factual issue which is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court; that with respect to the dismissal of petitioner’s case in Civil Case No. Q-02-45865 for failure to prosecute, <i>res judicata</i> applies; that petitioner’s claim that it should not be bound by the negligence of its counsel cannot stand because it was itself negligent in the prosecution of its case despite having been given by the trial court all the opportunity to present evidence; that with respect to the issue of damages, the factual findings of the trial and appellate courts may not be disturbed; that petitioner failed to present evidence to controvert the trial and appellate courts’ findings; that the pecuniary liabilities were justified as petitioner was guilty of delay, abandonment, and defective workmanship; that there is no ground to reduce the amount of penalties for petitioner’s delay; and that the award of interest was proper.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court denies the Petition.<br><br>Petitioner’s claim that <i>res judicata</i> cannot apply has no merit.&nbsp; This Court, in G.R. No. 166336, found nothing wrong in the judgment of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 82239 affirming the dismissal of petitioner’s Complaint in Civil Case No. Q-02-45865 for failure to prosecute.&nbsp; In fact, the Court found that the appellate court had not committed any reversible error.&nbsp; This finding of lack of any reversible error is now final with the entry of judgment in G.R. No. 166336.&nbsp; Thus, petitioner could no longer prove its case, other than to present controverting evidence on respondent’s counterclaim.<br><br><blockquote>The Court has repeatedly said that minute resolutions dismissing the actions filed before it constitute actual adjudications on the merits.&nbsp; They are the result of thorough deliberation among the members of the Court.&nbsp; When the Court does not find any reversible error in the decision of the CA and denies the petition, there is no need for the Court to fully explain its denial, since it already means that it agrees with and adopts the findings and conclusions of the CA.&nbsp; The decision sought to be reviewed and set aside is correct.&nbsp; It would be an exercise in redundancy for the Court to reproduce or restate in the minute resolution denying the petition the conclusions that the CA reached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>Next, petitioner’s argument that it should not be punished for the negligence of its counsel deserves the same treatment.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that we have not seen any reason to reverse the CA’s ruling on this matter; on the other hand, the record will disclose that petitioner was itself neglectful of its duties relative to its case, and it continued to retain the services of its counsel which it now conveniently claims to be negligent, even after repeatedly suffering from the latter’s claimed lack of care.&nbsp; It appears that despite witnessing firsthand the caliber of its lawyer during the initial presentation of its evidence in 2003, petitioner changed counsel only after the trial court’s January 30, 2006 Decision on respondent’s counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The general rule still applies that the mistakes of counsel bind his client.<br><br>On the issue of liability, we find – relying on the identical findings of the trial and appellate courts – that petitioner is guilty of violating the construction agreement, for its defective and incomplete work, delay, and for unjustified abandonment of the project.&nbsp; Indeed, we find no reason to disturb the identical pronouncements of the trial court and the CA.&nbsp; The same holds true with respect to the issue of damages raised by petitioner; it requires an inquiry into the facts, which is no longer this Court’s realm.&nbsp; In a case previously decided by this <i>ponente</i> concerning a construction contract and where similar allegations of abandonment, delay and defective workmanship were advanced, it was held that –<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner endeavors to convince us to determine, yet again, the weight, credence, and probative value of the evidence presented.&nbsp; This cannot be done in this petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court where only questions of law may be raised by the parties and passed upon by us.&nbsp; In <i>Fong v. Velayo,</i> we defined a question of law as distinguished from a question of fact, viz:<br><blockquote>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.&nbsp; For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.&nbsp; The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.&nbsp; Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the [question] posed is one of fact.&nbsp; Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.</blockquote>It has already been held that the determination of the existence of a breach of contract is a factual matter not usually reviewable in a petition filed under Rule 45.&nbsp; We will not review, much less reverse, the factual findings of the Court of Appeals especially where, as in this case, such findings coincide with those of the trial court, since we are not a trier of facts x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>There is no ground either to doubt the testimony of Calinawan, who testified on the defective quality of petitioner’s work and the state of construction after the latter abandoned the project.&nbsp; Her testimony merely corroborates already existing evidence – such as photographs – as well as the testimony of respondent herself.&nbsp; All in all, these pieces of evidence collectively proved the facts in issue.&nbsp; Besides, Calinawan need not be qualified as an expert witness in order to testify on facts which are readily apparent to the eye, and even to the layman: it does not require an expert to conclude that flooring is sloppily done, or that the electrical outlet and switch are not aligned, or that the flooring is stained with paint, or that incorrect colored cement was used to fill the gap between tiles, or that a door jamb needs repair, or that grouting of tiles is sloppily done, or that there are unwanted bubbles in the varnishing works, or that the parquet flooring is unaligned or uneven, or that the window sills are dirty, or that windows lacked the necessary screws and rubber, or that the roof panels are damaged, or that the installation of asphalt shingles on the roof was improper.&nbsp; Any ordinary individual building a home would readily notice such defects.<br><br>Since respondent suffered damages as a result of petitioner’s defective and delayed work and unjustified abandonment of the project, the principle of <i>damnum absque injuria</i> cannot apply.&nbsp; The principle cannot apply when there is an abuse of a person’s right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Coming now to the issue of delay, we find that the trial and appellate courts’ grant of P1,387,500.00 not excessive; it is, in fact, liberal.&nbsp; Construction period was agreed upon at 240 days from receipt by petitioner of a notice to proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Said notice was issued on June 18, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> thus giving petitioner approximately eight months from said date, or – roughly computed – up to February 18, 2000, to complete the project.&nbsp; Yet, petitioner was still working on the project as late as on November 22, 2000, after which it stopped work and abandoned the project; this fact is not denied by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, petitioner was already delayed for more than nine months – that is, beginning March 2000 and ending November of the same year – or approximately 270 days.&nbsp; At P12,500.00 agreed penalty imposed for each day of delay, petitioner should be correspondingly liable to respondent for P3,375,000.00 liquidated damages, more or less, under the construction agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Yet, the courts below awarded a mere P1,387,500.00; this award is certainly not excessive and should remain, accepted as it is without question by the respondent.<br><br>Finally, the imposition of 6% interest <i>per annum</i> is proper.&nbsp; Indeed, as correctly held by the CA, when an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> from the filing of the complaint until its full satisfaction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
