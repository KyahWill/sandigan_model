No. 03210 convicting accused-appellant Enrique Galvez of four counts of qualified rape.<br><br>Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> for four counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, and four counts of sexual abuse under Section 5 (b), Article III, R.A. No. 7610 were filed against the accused-appellant.&nbsp; Except for the dates of the commission of the crimes, all the Informations for the rape charges were worded similarly as in the Information for Criminal Case No. 228-95<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 14<sup>th</sup> day of May, 1995 at Sitio [XXX], Brgy.

There, AAA told her father what had happened to her. AAA’s father brought her to the Subic Police Station, where she gave a Sworn Statement [about the alleged incidents of rape].&nbsp; Afterwards, AAA’s father brought her to the San Marcelino District Hospital, where AAA was examined by Dra. Echaluse.<br><br>The Medico-legal Certificate issued by Dra. Echaluse revealed the following:<br><blockquote>“DIAGNOSIS/ FINDINGS:<br><br>- <b>Old Hymenal tears on the 3:00, 6:00, 9:00 o’clock position.</b><br>- (-) Negative smear for spermatozoa.<br>- Cervix- Pink, firm with whitish discharge.<br>- No hematoma, echymosis, abrasion.<br>- No menarche.” (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>)</blockquote>On the other hand, the defense presented the lone testimony of accused-appellant Galvez, in order to establish the following:<br><br>Upon his brother’s request, accused-appellant Galvez allowed his thirteen (13) year old niece, private complainant AAA, to stay in his house.&nbsp; According to accused-appellant, no unusual incidents occurred from May 14 to 16 and May 18, 1995 while AAA was at his house. Accused-appellant Galvez denied AAA’s accusation that he had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; According to accused-appellant, it was his brother, the father of AAA, who molested AAA. Accused-appellant Galvez added that, on May 18, 1995, he went to his brother’s house. There, accused-appellant Galvez saw AAA’s mother, who was mute, standing at the door of her house.&nbsp; Private complainant AAA’s mother, using her two (2) index fingers, demonstrated the acts of embracing and kissing. Accused-appellant Galvez then confronted his brother about the gestures made by AAA’s mother.&nbsp; However, accused-appellant’s brother ran away. Accused-appellant Galvez ran after his brother and told him, “Baboy[,] pati anak mo inaasawa mo”.<br><br>Afterwards, when accused-appellant Galvez was unable to catch his brother, accused-appellant went back and told the incident to accused-appellant’s mother-in-law.<br><br>Accused-appellant Galvez only came to know of the charges of Rape and violation of Sec. 5 (b), Art. III, R.A. 7610 against him when he was arrested by the barangay officials.</blockquote><br>Subsequently, four (4) sets of Information for the crime of Rape under the Revised Penal Code, and another four (4) sets of Information for violation of Sec. 5 (b), Art. III, R.A. No. 7610, otherwise known as “Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act” were filed against accused-appellant Galvez.<br><br>Accused-appellant pleaded “NOT GUILTY” to all charges.<br><br>On May 2, 2007, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 74, Olongapo City, rendered its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and convicted accused-appellant of four counts of sexual abuse under R.A.

No. 7610 and rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, for the same act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the trial court is <b>AFFIRMED</b>, with the following <b>MODIFICATIONS</b>:<br><br>a.)

Ortega</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we explained how to resolve this doubt in the victim’s age:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Given the doubt as to AAA’s exact age, the RTC properly convicted Ortega only of simple rape punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In <i>People v. Alvarado,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we did not apply the death penalty because the victim’s age was not satisfactorily established, thus:<br><blockquote>“We agree, however, that accused-appellant should not have been meted the death penalty on the ground that the age of complainant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. The information alleged that, on July 26, 1997, the date of the rape, Arlene was 14 years old. In her testimony, Arlene stated that she was 14 years old at the time of the incident. Accused-appellant confirmed this during the presentation of the defense evidence, but Lonelisa Alvarado, complainant’s mother, testified that Arlene was born on November 23, 1983, which would mean she was only 13 years old on the date of the commission of the crime. No other evidence was ever presented, such as her certificate of live birth or any other document, to prove Arlene’s exact age at the time of the crime. <b><u>As minority is a qualifying circumstance, it must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. There must be independent evidence proving the age of the victim, other than the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the absence of denial by accused-appellant. Since there is doubt as to Arlene’s exact age, accused-appellant must be held guilty of simple rape only and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</u></b>”<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>We further stressed in <i>People v. Villarama</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>“Court decisions on the rape of minors invariably state that, in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty, there must be independent evidence showing the age of the victim. Testimonies on the victim’s age given by the prosecution witnesses or the lack of denial of the accused or even his admission thereof on the witness stand [are] not sufficient. This Court has held that, to justify the imposition of the death penalty for rape committed against a child below 7, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clarity as the crime itself. <b><u>The failure to sufficiently establish the victim’s age with factual certainty and beyond reasonable doubt is fatal and consequently bars conviction for rape in its qualified form</u></b>.” (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>It must likewise be remembered that the minority of the victim must concur with the second component which is the third degree relationship between the victim and the offender. As to such second component of the qualifying circumstance, <i>People v. Libo-on</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> teaches:<br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that this attendant circumstance, as well as the other circumstances <b><u>introduced by Republic Act Nos. 7659</u></b> and 8493 are in the nature of qualifying circumstances. These attendant circumstances are not ordinary aggravating circumstances which merely increase the period of the penalty. Rather, these are special qualifying circumstances which <b><u>must be specifically pleaded or alleged with certainty in the information</u></b>; otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed.<br><br>In this regard, we have previously held that if the offender is merely a relation – not a parent, ascendant, step-parent, or guardian or common-law spouse of the mother of the victim – it must be alleged in the information that he is “a relative by consanguinity or affinity (as the case may be) within the third civil degree.”&nbsp; Thus, in the instant case, <b><u>the allegation that accused-appellant is the uncle of private complainant is not specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying circumstance of relationship</u></b>. The relationship by consanguinity or affinity between appellant and complainant was not alleged in the information in this case. Even if it were so alleged, <b><u>it was still necessary to specifically allege that such relationship was within the third civil degree</u></b>. (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Since the Informations contained only a statement that the accused-appellant was the uncle of AAA without stating that they were relatives within the third civil degree, the qualifying circumstance of relationship cannot likewise be appreciated in the case at bar.<br><br>In sum, since the prosecution was able to prove the elements of carnal knowledge and the moral ascendancy of accused-appellant over AAA but failed to clearly prove the age of AAA and allege the third degree relationship between accused-appellant and AAA, accused-appellant should be convicted of the crimes of simple rape only.<br><br><b><i>Because the crime committed was<br>simple rape, the award of civil<br>indemnity and damages should be<br>reduced.</i></b><br><br>The CA awarded civil indemnity and moral damages of P75,000 and exemplary damages of P30,000.&nbsp; The award of the CA is premised on the fact that the accused was convicted of qualified rape.&nbsp; Since the crime committed is simple rape, the amounts awarded must be modified.<br><br>In a simple rape case, the victim is entitled to P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages and P30,000 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Interest at the rate of 6% per annum on all damages awarded in this case is likewise proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DISMISS</b> the appeal and <b>AFFIRM with MODIFICATION</b> the Decision dated January 14, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 03210. Accused-appellant Enrique Galvez is hereby convicted of four counts of simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of simple rape.&nbsp; He is ordered to pay AAA civil indemnity of P50,000 and moral damages of P50,000 and exemplary damages of P30,000 for each count of simple rape.&nbsp; Interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded in this case reckoned from the finality of this Decision until fully paid shall likewise be paid by accused-appellant.<br><br>With costs against accused-appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Perez,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup></i> and <i>Jardeleza, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><div align="right"><b><u>August 26, 2015</u></b><br></div><br><br><center><b>N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T</b></center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on ___<u><b>July 29, 2015</b></u>___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on August 26, 2015 at 9:08 a.m.<br><br><br><center>Very truly yours,<br><b>(SGD)<br>WILFREDO V.
