Intervention in an action is neither compulsory nor mandatory but only optional and permissive. Second, to warrant intervention, two requisites must concur: (a) the movant has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, and (b) intervention must not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the parties nor should the claim of the intervenor be capable of being properly decided in a separate proceeding. The interest, which entitles a person to intervene in a suit, must involve the matter in litigation and of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment. Civil Case No. 6695 was an action for permanent injunction and damages. As a stranger to the case, private respondent had neither legal interest in a permanent injunction nor an interest on the damages to be imposed, if any, in Civil Case No. 6695. To allow him to intervene would have unnecessarily complicated and prolonged the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>It may be argued that respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc. should have intervened in the case filed before the trial court. However, respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc.'s interests, or its properties, were not part of the issues raised in petitioner Sunrise Garden Corporation's Complaint.

Within the said twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order.

During the hearings before the Court of Appeals, counsel for petitioner Sunrise Garden Corporation placed much emphasis on its argument that respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc. did not prove ownership over the property but did not refute the primary issue of lack of jurisdiction over respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc. This is an admission that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">J.

As a general proposition, one who seeks an affirmative relief is deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. It is by reason of this rule that we have had occasion to declare that the filing of motions to admit answer, for additional time to file answer, for reconsideration of a default judgment, and to lift order of default with motion for reconsideration, is considered voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction. This, however, is tempered by the concept of conditional appearance, such that a party who makes a special appearance to challenge, among others, the court's jurisdiction over his person cannot be considered to have submitted to its authority.<br><br>Prescinding from the foregoing, it is thus clear that:<br><br> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Special appearance operates as an exception to the general rule on voluntary appearance;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Accordingly, objections to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant must be explicitly made, i.e., set forth in an unequivocal manner; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Failure to do so constitutes voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the court, especially in instances where a pleading or motion seeking affirmative relief is filed and submitted to the court for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> (Citations omitted)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The appearance of respondent First Alliance Real Estate Development, Inc. and K-9 Security Agency should not be deemed as a voluntary appearance because it was for the purpose of questioning the jurisdiction of the trial court.
