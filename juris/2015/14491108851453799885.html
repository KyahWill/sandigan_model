EUSEBIO has already long received and enjoyed the amount of the purchase price of the subject land from petitioners.<br><br>b. The value of the purchase price of PHP36,863.00 paid in 1983 have since then greatly depreciated. If petitioners had deposited that money in bank or loaned it to another person instead of purchasing EUSEBIO's property, it would have at least earned some interest. However, the Court of Appeals incorrectly assumed that the return of the purchase price would be sufficient compensation to the petitioners.<br><br>c. The value of the improvements introduced by petitioners on the subject property is much greater than the purchase price that they initially paid on the land. Petitioners estimate the value of the improvements, including hundreds of various fruit-bearing trees and four residential houses, to be at least PHP900,000.00. Because of these improvements, not only can respondents sell the land at a much higher price, they can even sell the improvements and profit from them. It would be the height of injustice if all the petitioners would receive in turning over the subject property to the respondents is the purchase price that was previously paid EUSEBIO under the deed of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, the heirs of Borromeo argue that the testimonies of Norberta Borromeo and Susan Borromeo Morales on their relationship to Eusebio Borromeo were not refuted by the Malios Spouses.

They are now barred from claiming reimbursement since this was not raised at the first instance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Based on the arguments of the parties, the issues for resolution are:<br><br>First, whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the Decision of the trial court and ordering the reconveyance of the property from petitioners Spouses Eliseo Maltos and Rosita Maltos to respondents heirs of Eusebio Borromeo;<br><br>Second, whether the Court of Appeals erred in not applying the doctrine of in pari delicto; and <br><br>Finally, whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that petitioners Spouses Eliseo Maltos and Rosita Maltos are not entitled to reimbursement for the improvements they introduced on the land.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The five-year period prohibiting the sale of land obtained under homestead or free patent is provided under Section 118 of the Public Land Act, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 118.

In <i>Jocson v. Soriano</i>, we held that the conservation of a family home is the purpose of homestead laws. The policy of the state is to foster, families as the foundation of society, and thus promote general welfare. . . .<br><br>Section 118 of CA 141, therefore, is predicated on public policy. Its violation gives rise to the cancellation of the grant and the reversion of the land and its improvements to the government at the instance of the latter. The provision that "nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to that expiration of the five-year period" is mandatory and any sale made in violation of such provision is void and produces no effect whatsoever, just like what transpired in this case. Clearly, it is not within the competence of any citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Republic v.

Pursuant to such benevolent intention the State prohibits the sale or encumbrance of the homestead (Section 116) within five years after the grant of the patent. After that five-year period the law impliedly permits alienation of the homestead; but in line with the primordial purpose to favor the homesteader and his family the statute provides that such alienation or conveyance (Section 117) shall be subject to the right of repurchase by the homesteader, his widow or heirs within five years. This section 117 is undoubtedly a complement of Section 116. It aims to preserve and keep in the family of the homesteader that portion of public land which the State had gratuitously given to him. It would, therefore, be in keeping with this fundamental idea to hold, as we hold, that the right to repurchase exists not only when the original homesteader makes the conveyance, but also when it is made by his widow or heirs. This construction is clearly deducible from the terms of the statute.<br></blockquote><br>The effect of violating the five-year prohibitory period is provided under Section 124 of the Public Land Act, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 124. Any acquisition, conveyance, alienation, transfer, or other contract made or executed in violation of any of the provisions of sections one hundred and eighteen, one hundred and twenty, one hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and twenty-two, and one hundred and twenty-three of this. Act shall be unlawful and null and void from its execution and shall produce the effect of annulling and cancelling the grant, title, patent, or permit originally issued, recognized or confirmed, actually or presumptively, and cause the reversion of the property and its improvements to the State.</blockquote><br>In this case, Section 101<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> of the Public Land Act is applicable since title already vested in Eusebio Borromeo's name. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that the sale was made within the five-year prohibitory period. Thus, there is sufficient cause to revert the property in favor of the state. However, this court cannot declare reversion of the property in favor of the state in view of the limitation imposed by Section 101 that an action for reversion must first be filed by the Office of the Solicitor General. <br><br><center>III<br></center><br>The doctrine of in pari delicto non oritur actio is inapplicable when public policy will be violated.<br><br>constitute criminal offenses.<br><br>The in pari delicto rule is provided under Articles 1411 and 1412 of the Civil Code.

When the nullity proceeds from the illegality of the cause or object of the contract,&nbsp; and the act constitutes a criminal offense, both parties being in pari delicto, they shall have no action against each other, and both shall be prosecuted.

The other, who is not at fault, may demand the return of what he has given without any obligation to comply with his promise.</blockquote><br><i>Santos</i> involved the sale of a parcel of land within the five-year prohibitory period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The Roman Catholic Church raised the defense of in pari delicto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> It was also argued by the Rornan Catholic Church that the effect of the sale would be the reversion of the] property to the state.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> This court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 124 of the Public Land Act indeed provides that any acquisition, conveyance or transfer executed in violation of any of its provisions shall be null and void and shall produce the effect of annulling and cancelling the grant or patent and cause the reversion of the property to the State, and the principle of <i>pari delicto</i> has been applied by this Court in a number of cases wherein the parties to a transaction have proven to be guilty of effected the transaction with knowledge of the cause of its invalidity. But we doubt if these principles can now be invoked considering the philosophy and the policy behind the approval of the Public Land Act. The principle underlying pari delicto as known here and in the United States is not absolute in its application. It recognizes certain exceptions one of them being when its enforcement or application runs counter to an avowed fundamental policy or to public interest. As stated by us in the Rellosa case, "<i>This doctrine is subject to one important limitation, namely, [']whenever public policy is considered advanced by allowing either party to sue for relief against the transaction[']"</i><br><br>The case under consideration comes within the exception above adverted to. Here appellee desires to nullify a transaction which was done in violation of the law. <i>Ordinarily the principle of pari delicto would apply to her because her predecessor-in-interest has carried out the sale with the presumed knowledge of its illegality, but because the subject of the transaction is a piece of public land, public policy requires that she, as heir, be not prevented from re-acquiring it because it was given by law to her family for her home and cultivation. This is the policy on which our homestead law is predicated. This right cannot be waived. "It is not within the competence of any citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve.</i>" We are, therefore, constrained to hold that appellee can maintain the present action it being in furtherance of this fundamental aim of our homestead law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The non-application of the in pari delicto rule where public policy would be violated has also been applied in other cases.<br><br>In <i>Pajuyo v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> this court held that in pari delicto "is not [applicable to [e]jectment [c]ases"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> and cited <i>Drilon v. Gaurana</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> which discussed the policy behind ejectment cases:<br><br><blockquote>It must be stated that the purpose of an action of forcible entry and detainer is that, regardless of the actual condition of the title to the property, the party in peaceable quiet possession shall not be turned out by strong hand, violence or terror. In affording this remedy of restitution the object of the statute is to prevent breaches of the peace and criminal disorder which would ensue from the withdrawal of the remedy, and the reasonable hope such withdrawal would create that some advantage must accrue to those persons who, believing themselves entitled to the&nbsp; possession of property, resort to force to gain possession rather than to&nbsp; some appropriate action in the courts to assert their claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote><br>This court elucidated that:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, the application of the principle of <i>pari delicto </i>to a case of ejectment between squatters is fraught with danger. To shut out relief to squatters on the ground of <i>pari delicto</i> would openly invite mayhem and lawlessness. A squatter would oust another squatter from possession of the lot that the latter had illegally occupied, emboldened by the knowledge that the courts would leave them where they are. Nothing would then stand in the way of the ousted squatter from re-claiming his prior possession at all cost.<br><br>Petty warfare over possession of properties is precisely what ejectment cases or actions for recovery of possession seek to prevent.

The prevention of unjust enrichment is a recognized public policy of the State, for Article 22 of the Civil Code explicitly provides that "[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other meins, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him."

As a matter of fact, Section 29 of the Public Land Law (Commonwealth Act No. 141) expressly ordains that any sale and encumbrance made without the previous approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources "shall be null and void and shall produce the effect of annulling the acquisition and reverting property and all rights thereto to the State, and all payments on the purchase price theretofore made to the Government shall be forfeited." . . . .<br><br>In fact, even if a sales application were already given due course by the Director of Lands, the applicant is not thereby conferred any right over the land covered by the application.

It is at this stage, when the award is made, that the land can be considered "disposed of by the Government," since the aforestated right of the applicant has the effect of withdrawing the land from the public domain that is "disposable" by the Director of Lands under the provisions of the Public Land Act. . . . However, the disposition is merely provisional because the applicant has still to comply with the requirements prescribed by law before . . . . any patent is issued.
