It only provides that the benefits shall be “less accountabilities,” which should not be interpreted to include such possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The fact that majority of NAFLU’s members were not occupants of respondent Solid Mills’ property is evidence that possession of the property was not contemplated in the agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; “Accountabilities” should be interpreted to refer only to accountabilities that were incurred by petitioners while they were performing their duties as employees at the worksite.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp;

The regular courts have jurisdiction over this issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; It is independent from the issue of payment of petitioners’ monetary benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>For these reasons, and because, according to petitioners, the amount of monetary award is no longer in question, petitioners are entitled to 12% interest per annum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also argue that Teodora Mahilom and Carlito Damian are entitled to their claims.&nbsp;

The term “accountability” should be given its natural and ordinary meaning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it should be interpreted as “a state of being liable or responsible,” or “obligation.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp;

It was improper to raise this claim for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; In any case, Teodora Mahilom’s claim was asserted long after the three-year prescriptive period provided in Article 291 of the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Lastly, according to respondents, it would be unjust if Carlito Damian would be allowed to receive monetary benefits again, which he, admittedly, already received from Solid Mills.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br><b>The National Labor Relations <br>Commission may preliminarily <br>determine issues related to rights<br>arising from an employer-employee<br>relationship</b><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission has jurisdiction to determine, preliminarily, the parties’ rights over a property, when it is necessary to determine an issue related to rights or claims arising from an employer-employee relationship.<br><br>Article 217 provides that the Labor Arbiter, in his or her original jurisdiction, and the National Labor Relations Commission, in its appellate jurisdiction, may determine issues involving claims arising from employer-employee relations.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>ART. 217. JURISDICTION OF LABOR ARBITERS AND THE COMMISSION.</i> – (1) Except as otherwise provided under this Code, the Labor Arbiters shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide within thirty (30) calendar days after the submission of the case by the parties for decision without extension, even in the absence of stenographic notes, the following cases involving workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:<br><ol><li>Unfair labor practice cases;<br></li><li>Termination disputes;<br></li><li>If accompanied with a claim for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file involving wages, rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;<br></li><li>Claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from the employer-employee relations;<br></li><li>Cases arising from any violation of Article 264 of this Code, including questions involving the legality of strikes and lockouts; and<br></li><li><i>Except claims for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and maternity benefits, all other claims, arising from employer-employee relations including those of persons in domestic or household service, involving an amount exceeding five thousand pesos (P5,000.00), regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for reinstatement</i>.</li></ol>(2) The Commission shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioners’ claim that they have the right to the immediate release of their benefits as employees separated from respondent Solid Mills is a question arising from the employer-employee relationship between the parties.<br><br>Claims arising from an employer-employee relationship are not limited to claims by an employee.&nbsp; Employers may also have claims against the employee, which arise from the same relationship.<br><br>In <i>Bañez v. Valdevilla</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> this court ruled that Article 217 of the Labor Code also applies to employers’ claim for damages, which arises from or is connected with the labor issue.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Whereas this Court in a number of occasions had applied the jurisdictional provisions of Article 217 to claims for damages filed by employees, we hold that by the designating clause “arising from the employer-employee relations” Article 217 should apply with equal force to the claim of an <i>employer</i> for actual damages against its dismissed employee, where the basis for the claim arises from or is necessarily connected with the fact of termination, and should be entered as a counterclaim in the illegal dismissal case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i>Bañez</i> was cited in <i>Domondon v. National Labor Relations Commission.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; One of the issues in Domondon is whether the Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction to decide an issue on the transfer of ownership of a vehicle assigned to the employee.&nbsp; It was argued that only regular courts have jurisdiction to decide the issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>This court ruled that since the transfer of ownership of the vehicle to the employee was connected to his separation from the employer and arose from the employer-employee relationship of the parties, the employer’s claim fell within the Labor Arbiter’s jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><i>As a general rule, therefore, a claim only needs to be sufficiently connected to the labor issue raised and must arise from an employer-employee relationship for the labor tribunals to have jurisdiction.</i><br><br>In this case, respondent Solid Mills claims that its properties are in petitioners’ possession by virtue of their status as its employees.&nbsp; Respondent Solid Mills allowed petitioners to use its property as an act of liberality.&nbsp; Put in other words, it would not have allowed petitioners to use its property had they not been its employees.&nbsp; The return of its properties in petitioners’ possession by virtue of their status as employees is an issue that must be resolved to determine whether benefits can be released immediately.&nbsp; The issue raised by the employer is, therefore, connected to petitioners’ claim for benefits and is sufficiently intertwined with the parties’ employer-employee relationship.&nbsp; Thus, it is properly within the labor tribunals’ jurisdiction.<br><br><center>II</center><br><b>Institution of clearance procedures<br>has legal bases</b><br><br>Requiring clearance before the release of last payments to the employee is a standard procedure among employers, whether public or private.&nbsp; Clearance procedures are instituted to ensure that the properties, real or personal, belonging to the employer but are in the possession of the separated employee, are returned to the employer before the employee’s departure.<br><br>As a general rule, employers are prohibited from withholding wages from employees.&nbsp; The Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 116. Withholding of wages and kickbacks prohibited</b>. It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to withhold any amount from the wages of a worker or induce him to give up any part of his wages by force, stealth, intimidation, threat or by any other means whatsoever without the worker’s consent.</blockquote><br>The Labor Code also prohibits the elimination or diminution of benefits. Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 100. Prohibition against elimination or diminution of benefits</b>. Nothing in this Book shall be construed to eliminate or in any way diminish supplements, or other employee benefits being enjoyed at the time of promulgation of this Code.</blockquote><br>However, our law supports the employers’ institution of clearance procedures before the release of wages.&nbsp; As an exception to the general rule that wages may not be withheld and benefits may not be diminished, the Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 113. Wage deduction</b>. No employer, in his own behalf or in behalf of any person, shall make any deduction from the wages of his employees, except:<br><br>1. In cases where the worker is insured with his consent by the employer, and the deduction is to recompense the employer for the amount paid by him as premium on the insurance;<br><br>2. For union dues, in cases where the right of the worker or his union to check-off has been recognized by the employer or authorized in writing by the individual worker concerned; and<br><br><i>3. In cases where the employer is authorized by law or regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment. </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Civil Code provides that the employer is authorized to withhold wages for debts due:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1706. Withholding of the wages, except for a debt due, shall not be made by the employer.<br></blockquote><br>“Debt” in this case refers to any obligation due from the employee to the employer.&nbsp; It includes any accountability that the employee may have to the employer.&nbsp; There is no reason to limit its scope to uniforms and equipment, as petitioners would argue.<br><br>More importantly, respondent Solid Mills and NAFLU, the union representing petitioners, agreed that the release of petitioners’ benefits shall be “less accountabilities.”<br><br>“Accountability,” in its ordinary sense, means obligation or debt.&nbsp; The ordinary meaning of the term “accountability” does not limit the definition of accountability to those incurred in the worksite.&nbsp; As long as the debt or obligation was incurred by virtue of the employer-employee relationship, generally, it shall be included in the employee’s accountabilities that are subject to clearance procedures.<br><br>It may be true that not all employees enjoyed the privilege of staying in respondent Solid Mills’ property.&nbsp; However, this alone does not imply that this privilege when enjoyed was not a result of the employer-employee relationship.&nbsp; Those who did avail of the privilege were employees of respondent Solid Mills.&nbsp; Petitioners’ possession should, therefore, be included in the term “accountability.”<br><br>Accountabilities of employees are personal.&nbsp; They need not be uniform among all employees in order to be included in accountabilities incurred by virtue of an employer-employee relationship.<br><br>Petitioners do not categorically deny respondent Solid Mills’ ownership of the property, and they do not claim superior right to it.&nbsp; What can be gathered from the findings of the Labor Arbiter, National Labor Relations Commission, and the Court of Appeals is that respondent Solid Mills allowed the use of its property for the benefit of petitioners as its employees.&nbsp; Petitioners were merely allowed to possess and use it out of respondent Solid Mills’ liberality.&nbsp; The employer may, therefore, demand the property at will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The return of the property’s possession became an obligation or liability on the part of the employees when the employer-employee relationship ceased.&nbsp; Thus, respondent Solid Mills has the right to withhold petitioners’ wages and benefits because of this existing debt or liability.&nbsp; In <i>Solas v. Power and Telephone Supply Phils., Inc., et al., </i>this court recognized this right of the employer when it ruled that the employee in that case was not constructively dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>There was valid reason for respondents’ withholding of petitioner’s salary for the month of February 2000. Petitioner does not deny that he is indebted to his employer in the amount of around P95,000.00. Respondents explained that petitioner’s salary for the period of February 1-15, 2000 was applied as partial payment for his debt and for withholding taxes on his income; while for the period of February 15-28, 2000, petitioner was already on absence without leave, hence, was not entitled to any pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></blockquote><br>The law does not sanction a situation where employees who do not even assert any claim over the employer’s property are allowed to take all the benefits out of their employment while they simultaneously withhold possession of their employer’s property for no rightful reason.<br><br>Withholding of payment by the employer does not mean that the employer may renege on its obligation to pay employees their wages, termination payments, and due benefits.&nbsp; The employees’ benefits are also not being reduced.&nbsp; It is only subjected to the condition that the employees return properties properly belonging to the employer.&nbsp; This is only consistent with the equitable principle that “no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>For these reasons, we cannot hold that petitioners are entitled to interest of their withheld separation benefits.&nbsp; These benefits were properly withheld by respondent Solid Mills because of their refusal to return its property.<br><br><center>III</center><br><br><b>Mahilom and Damian are not <br>entitled to the benefits claimed</b><br><br>Teodora Mahilom is not entitled to separation benefits.<br><br>Both the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals found that Teodora Mahilom already retired long before respondent Solid Mills’ closure.&nbsp; They found that she already received her retirement benefits.
