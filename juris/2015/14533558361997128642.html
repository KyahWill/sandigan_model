Besides, in the JSFI, the parties already agreed that TPC is a generation company under the EPIRA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In addition, it is not liable for deficiency VAT, even if, for the sake of argument, its sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC are not zero-rated, as an assessment cannot be issued in a refund case, not to mention that the BIR's period to assess had already prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petitions are bereft of merit.<br><br><b><i>Both the administrative and the judicial claims were timely and validly filed.</i></b><br><br>Pursuant to Section 112 (A)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and (D)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the NIRC, a taxpayer has two (2) years from the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated sales were made within which to file with the CIR an administrative claim for refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to such sales. The CIR, on the other hand, has 120 days from receipt of the complete documents within which to act on the administrative claim. Upon receipt of the decision, a taxpayer has 30 days within which to appeal the decision to the CTA. However, if the 120-day period expires without any decision from the CIR, the taxpayer may appeal the, inaction to the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we said that the 120+30-day period must be strictly observed except from the date of issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on December 10, 2003, which allowed taxpayers to file a judicial claim without waiting for the end of the 120-day period, up to the date of promulgation of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> on October 6, 2010, where we declared that compliance with the 120+30-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional.<br><br>In this case, TPC applied for a claim for refund or credit of its unutilized input VAT for the taxable year 2002 on December 22, 2003. Since the CIR did not act on its application within the 120-day period, TPC appealed the inaction on April 22, 2004. Clearly, both the administrative and the judicial claims were filed within the prescribed period provided in Section 112 of the NIRC.<br><br>Also, the administrative claim was not <i>pro forma</i> as TPC submitted documents to support its claim for refund and even manifested its willingness to submit additional documents if necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The CIR, however, never requested TPC to submit additional documents. Thus, she cannot now raise the issue that TPC failed to submit the complete documents.<br><br>Neither do we find the alleged failure of TPC to submit all relevant documents set out in RMO No. 53-98 fatal to its claim. In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Team Sual Corporation (formerly Mirant Sual Corporation)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> we said that:<br><blockquote>The CIR's reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced. There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of a refund or credit of input VAT. The subject of RMO 53-98 states that it is a "Checklist of Documents to be Submitted by a Taxpayer upon <b>Audit</b> of his Tax Liabilities ...." In this case, TSC was applying for a grant of refund or credit of its input tax. There was no allegation of an audit being conducted by the CIR. Even assuming that RMO 53-98 applies, it specifically states that some documents are required to be submitted by the taxpayer "if applicable."<br><br>Moreover, if TSC indeed failed to submit the complete documents in support of its application, the CIR could have informed TSC of its failure, consistent with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 42-03. However, the CIR did not inform TSC of the document it failed to submit, even up to the present petition. The CIR likewise raised the issue of TSC's alleged failure to submit the complete documents only in its motion for reconsideration of the CTA Special First Division's 4 March 2010 Decision. Accordingly, we affirm the CTA EB's finding that TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, and submitted the complete documents in support of its application for refund or credit of its input tax at the same time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>In view of the foregoing, we find that both the administrative and the judicial claims were timely and validly filed.<br><br>Now, as to the validity of TPC's claim, there is no question that TPC is entitled to a refund or credit of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales of electricity to NPC for the taxable year 2002 pursuant to Section 108 (B) (3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the NIRC, as amended, in relation to Section 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the Revised Charter of the NPC, as amended. Hence, the only issue to be resolved is whether TPC is entitled to a refund of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC.<br><br><b><i>TPC is not entitled to a refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to its sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC.</i></b><br><br>Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the EPIRA provides that the sale of generated power by generation companies shall be zero-rated. Section 4(x) of the same law states that a generation company "refers to any person or entity authorized by the ERC to operate facilities used in the generation of electricity." Corollarily, to be entitled to a refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to the sale of electricity under the EPIRA, a taxpayer must establish: (1) that it is a generation company, and (2) that it derived sales from power generation.<br><br>In this case, TPC failed to present a COC from the ERC during the trial. On partial reconsideration, TPC argued that there was no need for it to present a COC because the parties already stipulated in the JSFI that TPC is a generation company and that it became entitled to the rights under the EPIRA when it filed its application with the ERC on June 20, 2002.<br><br>We find the arguments raised by TPC unavailing.<br><br>There is nothing in the JSFI to show that the parties agreed that TPC is a generation company under the EPIRA. The pertinent portions of the JSFI read:<br><blockquote><center><u>JOINTLY STIPULATED FACTS</u><br></center><br>1. [TPC] is principally engaged in the business of power generation and subsequent sale thereof to the [NPC, CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>2.

Effective 26 June 2001, sales of generated power by generation companies became VAT zero-rated by virtue of Section 4(x) in relation to Section 6 of the EPIRA and Rule 5, Section 6 of the Rules and Regulations to Implement the EPIRA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Obviously, the parties did not stipulate that TPC is a generation company. They only stipulated that TPC is engaged in the business of power generation and that it filed an application with the ERC on June 20, 2002. However, being engaged in the business of power generation does not make TPC a generation company under the EPIRA. Neither did TPC's filing of an application for COC with the ERC automatically entitle TPC to the rights of a generation company under the EPIRA.<br><br>At this point, a distinction must be made between a generation facility and a generation company. A generation facility is defined under the EPIRA Rules and Regulations as "a facility for the production of electricity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> While a generation company, as previously mentioned, "refers to any person or entity authorized by the ERC to operate facilities used in the generation of electricity." Based on the foregoing definitions, what differentiates a generation facility from a generation company is that the latter is authorized by the ERC to operate, as evidenced by a COC.<br><br>Under the EPIRA, all new generation companies and existing generation facilities are required to obtain a COC from the ERC. New generation companies must show that they have complied with the requirements, standards, and guidelines of the ERC before they can operate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As for existing generation facilities, they must submit to the ERC an application for a COC together with the required documents within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of the EPIRA Rules and Regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Based on the documents submitted, the ERC will determine whether the applicant has complied with the standards and requirements for operating a generation company. If the applicant is found compliant, only then will the ERC issue a COC.<br><br>In this case, when the EPIRA took effect in 2001, TPC was an existing generation facility. And at the time the sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC were made in 2002, TPC was not yet a generation company under EPIRA. Although it filed an application for a COC on June 20, 2002, it did not automatically become a generation company. It was only on June 23,2005, when the ERC issued a COC in favor of TPC, that it became a generation company under EPIRA. Consequently, TPC's sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC cannot qualify for VAT zero-rating under the EPIRA.<br><br>Neither can TPC rely on VAT Ruling No. 011-5, which considered the sales of electricity of Hedcor effectively zero-rated from the effectivity of the EPIRA despite the fact that it was issued a COC only on November 5, 2003, as this is a specific ruling, issued in response to the query made by Hedcor to the CIR. As such, it is applicable only to a particular taxpayer, which is Hedcor. Thus, it is not a general interpretative rule that can be applied to all taxpayers similarly situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, in considering TPC's sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC for taxable year 2002 as invalid zero-rated sales, and in consequently denying TPC's claim for refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to the said sales of electricity.<br><br><b><i>TPC is not liable for deficiency VAT.</i></b><br><br>But while TPC's sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC are not zero-rated, we cannot hold it liable for deficiency VAT by imposing 10% VAT on said sales of electricity as what the CIR wants us to do.<br><br>As a rule, taxes cannot be subject to compensation because the government and the taxpayer are not creditors and debtors of each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> However, we are aware that in several cases, we have allowed the determination of a taxpayer's liability in a refund case, thereby allowing the offsetting of taxes.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Tax Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> we allowed offsetting of taxes in a tax refund case because there was an existing deficiency income and business tax assessment against the taxpayer. We said that "[t]o award such refund despite the existence of that deficiency assessment is an absurdity and a polarity in conceptual effects" and that "to grant the refund without determination of the proper assessment and the tax due would inevitably result in multiplicity of proceedings or suits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>South African Airways v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> we permitted offsetting of taxes because the correctness of the return filed by the taxpayer was put in issue.<br><br>In the recent case of <i>SMI-ED Philippines Technology, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we also allowed offsetting because there was a need for the court to determine if a taxpayer claiming refund of erroneously paid taxes is more properly liable for taxes other than that paid. We explained that the determination of the proper category of tax that should have been paid is not an assessment but is an incidental issue that must be resolved in order to determine whether there should be a refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> However, we clarified that while offsetting may be allowed, the BIR can no longer assess the taxpayer for deficiency taxes in excess of the amount claimed for refund if prescription has already set in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>But in all these cases, we allowed offsetting of taxes only because the determination of the taxpayer's liability is intertwined with the resolution of the claim for tax refund of erroneously or illegally collected taxes under Section 229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the NIRC. A situation that is not present in the instant case.<br><br>In this case, TPC filed a claim for tax refund or credit under Section 112 of the NIRC, where the issue to be resolved is whether TPC is entitled to a refund or credit of its unutilized input VAT for the taxable year 2002. And since it is not a claim for refund under Section 229 of the NIRC, the correctness of TPC s VAT returns is not an issue. Thus, there is no need for the court to determine whether TPC is liable for deficiency VAT.<br><br>Besides, it would be unfair to allow the CIR to use a claim for refund under Section 112 of the NIRC as a means to assess a taxpayer for any deficiency VAT, especially if the period to assess had already prescribed. As we have said, the courts have no assessment powers, and therefore, cannot issue assessments against taxpayers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The courts can only review the assessments issued by the CIR, who under the law is vested with the powers to assess and collect taxes and the duty to issue tax assessments within the prescribed period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petitions are hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
