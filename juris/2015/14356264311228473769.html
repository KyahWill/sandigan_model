				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">All Filipinos are entitled to the protection of the rights guaranteed in the Constitution.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari with application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure praying that judgment be rendered reversing and setting aside the June 16, 2011 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and September 13, 2011 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 113006.<br><br>Petitioner Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) is a foreign corporation established and existing under the laws of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has a Philippine office located at 4/F, Metro House Building, Sen. Gil J. Puyat Avenue, Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In its Petition filed with this court, Saudia identified itself as follows:<br><blockquote>1. Petitioner SAUDIA is a foreign corporation established and existing under the Royal Decree No. M/24 of 18.07.1385H (10.02.1962G) in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ("KSA"). <i>Its Philippine Office is located at 4/F Metro House Building, Sen, Gil J.

They then entered into Cabin Attendant contracts with Saudia: Ma. Jopette M. Rebesencio (Ma. Jopette) on May 16, 1990;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Montassah B.

They alleged that the termination was made solely because they were pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>As respondents alleged, they had informed Saudia of their respective pregnancies and had gone through the necessary procedures to process their maternity leaves. Initially, Saudia had given its approval but later on informed respondents that its management in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia had disapproved their maternity leaves. In addition, it required respondents to file their resignation letters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Respondents were told that if they did not resign, Saudia would terminate them all the same. The threat of termination entailed the loss of benefits, such as separation pay and ticket discount entitlements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Specifically, Ma. Jopette received a call on October 16, 2006 from Saudia's Base Manager, Abdulmalik Saddik (Abdulmalik).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Montassah was informed personally by Abdulmalik and a certain Faisal Hussein on October 20, 2006 after being required to report to the office one (1) month into her maternity leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Rouen Ruth was also personally informed by Abdulmalik on October 17, 2006 after being required to report to the office by her Group Supervisor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Loraine received a call on October 12, 2006 from her Group Supervisor, Dakila Salvador.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Saudia anchored its disapproval of respondents' maternity leaves and demand for their resignation on its "Unified Employment Contract for Female Cabin Attendants" (Unified Contract).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Under the Unified Contract, the employment of a Flight Attendant who becomes pregnant is rendered void. It provides:<br><blockquote>(H) Due to the essential nature of the Air Hostess functions to be physically fit on board to provide various services required in normal or emergency cases on both domestic/international flights beside her role in maintaining continuous safety and security of passengers, and since <i>she will not be able to maintain the required medical fitness while at work in case of pregnancy, accordingly, <b>if the Air Hostess becomes pregnant at any time during the term of this contract, this shall render her employment contract as void and she will be terminated due to lack of medical fitness</b></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In their Comment on the present Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> respondents emphasized that the Unified Contract took effect on September 23, 2006 (the first day of Ramadan),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> well after they had filed and had their maternity leaves approved. Ma. Jopette filed her maternity leave application on September 5, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Montassah filed her maternity leave application on August 29, 2006, and its approval was already indicated in Saudia's computer system by August 30, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Rouen Ruth filed her maternity leave application on September 13, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and Loraine filed her maternity leave application on August 22, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Rather than comply and tender resignation letters, respondents filed separate appeal letters that were all rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Despite these initial rejections, respondents each received calls on the morning of November 6, 2006 from Saudia's office secretary informing them that their maternity leaves had been approved. Saudia, however, was quick to renege on its approval. On the evening of November 6, 2006, respondents again received calls informing them that it had received notification from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia that their maternity leaves had been disapproved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Faced with the dilemma of resigning or totally losing their benefits, respondents executed handwritten resignation letters. In Montassah's and Rouen Ruth's cases, their resignations were executed on Saudia's blank letterheads that Saudia had provided. These letterheads already had the word "RESIGNATION" typed on the subject portions of their headings when these were handed to respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On November 8, 2007, respondents filed a Complaint against Saudia and its officers for illegal dismissal and for underpayment of salary, overtime pay, premium pay for holiday, rest day, premium, service incentive leave pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, separation pay, night shift differentials, medical expense reimbursements, retirement benefits, illegal deduction, lay-over expense and allowances, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The case was initially assigned to Labor Arbiter Hermino V. Suelo and docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 00-11-12342-07.<br><br>Saudia assailed the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It claimed that all the determining points of contact referred to foreign law and insisted that the Complaint ought to be dismissed on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It added that respondents had no cause of action as they resigned voluntarily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On December 12, 2008, Executive Labor Arbiter Fatima Jambaro-Franco rendered the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dismissing respondents' Complaint. The dispositive portion of this Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises' considered, judgment is hereby rendered <b>DISMISSING</b> the instant complaint for lack of jurisdiction/merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>On respondents' appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission's Sixth Division reversed the ruling of Executive Labor Arbiter Jambaro-Franco. It explained that "[considering that complainants-appellants are OFWs, the Labor Arbiters and the NLRC has [sic] jurisdiction to hear and decide their complaint for illegal termination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On the matter of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, it noted that there were no special circumstances that warranted its abstention from exercising jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> On the issue of whether respondents were validly dismissed, it held that there was nothing on record to support Saudia's claim that respondents resigned voluntarily.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the November 19, 2009 National Labor Relations Commission Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the appeal impressed with merit.

The Decision dated November 19, 2009 issued by public respondent, Sixth Division of the National Labor Relations Commission - National Capital Region is <b>MODIFIED</b> only insofar as the computation of the award of separation pay and backwages. For greater clarity, petitioners are ordered to pay private respondents separation pay which shall be computed from private respondents' first day of employment up to the finality of this decision, at the rate of one month per year of service and backwages which shall be computed from the date the private respondents were illegally terminated until finality of this decision. Consequently, the ten percent (10%) attorney's fees shall be based on the total amount of the award. The assailed Decision is affirmed in all other respects.<br><br>The labor arbiter is hereby <b>DIRECTED</b> to make a recomputation based on the foregoing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>In the Resolution dated September 13, 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, this Appeal was filed.<br><br>The issues for resolution are the following:<br><br>First, whether the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission may exercise jurisdiction over Saudi Arabian Airlines and apply Philippine law in adjudicating the present dispute;<br><br>Second, whether respondents' voluntarily resigned or were illegally terminated; and<br><br>Lastly, whether Brenda J.

Other than its bare allegation, there is no basis for concluding that "Saudia Jeddah" is distinct from "Saudia Manila."<br><br>What is clear is Saudia's statement in its own Petition that what it has is a "Philippine Office . . . located at 4/F Metro House Building, Sen. Gil J. Puyat Avenue, Makati City."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Even in the position paper that Saudia submitted to the Labor Arbiter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> what Saudia now refers to as "Saudia Jeddah" was then only referred to as "Saudia Head Office at Jeddah, KSA,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> while what Saudia now refers to as "Saudia Manila" was then only referred to as "Saudia's office in Manila."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>By its own admission, Saudia, while a foreign corporation, has a Philippine office.<br><br>Section 3(d) of Republic Act No.. 7042, otherwise known as the Foreign Investments Act of 1991, provides the following:<br><blockquote><b>The phrase "<i>doing business</i>" shall include . . . opening offices, whether called "liaison" offices or branches;</b> . . . and any other act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements and contemplate to that extent the performance of acts or works, or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the business organization. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A plain application of Section 3(d) of the Foreign Investments Act leads to no other conclusion than that Saudia is a foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines. As such, Saudia may be sued in the Philippines and is subject to the jurisdiction of Philippine tribunals.<br><br>Moreover, since there is no real distinction between "Saudia Jeddah" and "Saudia Manila" — the latter being nothing more than Saudia's local office — service of summons to Saudia's office in Manila sufficed to vest jurisdiction over Saudia's person in Philippine tribunals.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Saudia asserts that Philippine courts and/or tribunals are not in a position to make an intelligent decision as to the law and the facts. This is because respondents' Cabin Attendant contracts require the application of the laws of Saudi Arabia, rather than those of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It claims that the difficulty of ascertaining foreign law calls into operation the principle of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, thereby rendering improper the exercise of jurisdiction by Philippine tribunals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>A choice of law governing the validity of contracts or the interpretation of its provisions dees not necessarily imply <i>forum non conveniens</i>. Choice of law and <i>forum non conveniens</i> are entirely different matters.<br><br>Choice of law provisions are an offshoot of the fundamental principle of autonomy of contracts. Article 1306 of the Civil Code firmly ensconces this:<br><blockquote>Article 1306. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<br></blockquote>In contrast, <i>forum non conveniens</i> is a device akin to the rule against forum shopping. It is designed to frustrate illicit means for securing advantages and vexing litigants that would otherwise be possible if the venue of litigation (or dispute resolution) were left entirely to the whim of either party.<br><br>Contractual choice of law provisions factor into transnational litigation and dispute resolution in one of or in a combination of four ways: (1) procedures for settling disputes, e.g., arbitration; (2) forum, i.e., venue; (3) governing law; and (4) basis for interpretation. <i>Forum non conveniens</i> relates to, but is not subsumed by, the second of these.<br><br>Likewise, contractual choice of law is not determinative of jurisdiction. Stipulating on the laws of a given jurisdiction as the governing law of a contract does not preclude the exercise of jurisdiction by tribunals elsewhere. The reverse is equally true: The assumption of jurisdiction by tribunals does not <i>ipso facto</i> mean that it cannot apply and rule on the basis of the parties' stipulation. In <i>Hasegawa v. Kitamura</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>Analytically, jurisdiction and choice of law are two distinct concepts. Jurisdiction considers whether it is fair to cause a defendant to travel to this state; choice of law asks the further question whether the application of a substantive law V'hich will determine the merits of the case is fair to both parties. The power to exercise jurisdiction does not automatically give a state constitutional authority to apply forum law. While jurisdiction and the choice of the <i>lex fori</i> will often, coincide, the "minimum contacts" for one do not always provide the necessary "significant contacts" for the other. The question of whether the law of a state can be applied to a transaction is different from the question of whether the courts of that state have jurisdiction to enter a judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>As various dealings, commercial or otherwise, are facilitated by the progressive ease of communication and travel, persons from various jurisdictions find themselves transacting with each other. Contracts involving foreign elements are, however, nothing new. Conflict of laws situations precipitated by disputes and litigation anchored on these contracts are not totally novel.<br><br>Transnational transactions entail differing laws on the requirements Q for the validity of the formalities and substantive provisions of contracts and their interpretation. These transactions inevitably lend themselves to the possibility of various fora for litigation and dispute resolution. As observed by an eminent expert on transnational law:<br><blockquote>The more jurisdictions having an interest in, or merely even a point of contact with, a transaction or relationship, the greater the number of potential fora for the resolution of disputes arising out of or related to that transaction or relationship. In a world of increased mobility, where business and personal transactions transcend national boundaries, the jurisdiction of a number of different fora may easily be invoked in a single or a set of related disputes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>Philippine law is definite as to what governs the formal or extrinsic validity of contracts. The first paragraph of Article 17 of the Civil Code provides that "[t]he forms and solemnities of contracts . . . shall be governed by the laws of the country in which they are executed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (i.e., <i>lex loci celebrationis</i>).<br><br>In contrast, there is no statutorily established mode of settling conflict of laws situations on matters pertaining to substantive content of contracts. It has been noted that three (3) modes have emerged: (1) <i>lex loci contractus</i> or the law of the place of the making; (2) <i>lex loci solutionis</i> or the law of the place of performance; and (3) <i>lex loci intentionis</i> or the law intended by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Given Saudia's assertions, of particular relevance to resolving the present dispute is <i>lex loci intentionis</i>.<br><br>An author observed that Spanish jurists and commentators "favor <i>lex loci intentionis</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> These jurists and commentators proceed from the Civil Code of Spain, which, like our Civil Code, is silent on what governs the intrinsic validity of contracts, and the same civil law traditions from which we draw ours.<br><br>In this jurisdiction, this court, in <i>Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee v. V.P. Eusebio Construction, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> manifested preference for allowing the parties to select the law applicable to their contract":<br><blockquote>No conflicts rule on essential validity of contracts is expressly provided for in our laws. The rule followed by most legal systems, however, is that the intrinsic validity of a contract must be governed by the <i>lex contractus</i> or "proper law of the contract." This is the law voluntarily agreed upon by the parties (the <i>lex loci voluntatis</i>) or the law intended by them either expressly or implicitly (the <i>lex loci intentionis</i>). The law selected may be implied from such factors as substantial connection with the transaction, or the nationality or domicile of the parties. Philippine courts would do well to adopt the first and most basic rule in most legal systems, namely, <i>to allow the parties to select the law applicable to their contract, subject to the limitation that it is not against the law, morals, or public policy of the forum and that the chosen law must bear a substantive relationship to the transaction</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Saudia asserts that stipulations set in the Cabin Attendant contracts require the application of the laws of Saudi Arabia. It insists that the need to comply with these stipulations calls into operation the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> and, in turn, makes it necessary for Philippine tribunals to refrain from exercising jurisdiction.<br><br>As mentioned, contractual choice of laws factors into transnational litigation in any or a combination of four (4) ways. Moreover, <i>forum non conveniens</i> relates to one of these: choosing between multiple possible fora.<br><br>Nevertheless, the possibility of parallel litigation in multiple fora — along with the host of difficulties it poses — is not unique to transnational litigation. It is a difficulty that similarly arises in disputes well within the bounds of a singe jurisdiction.<br><br>When parallel litigation arises strictly within the context of a single jurisdiction, such rules as those on forum shopping, <i>litis pendentia</i>, and <i>res judicata</i> come into operation. Thus, in the Philippines, the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure provide for willful and deliberate forum shopping as a ground not only for summary dismissal with prejudice but also for citing parties and counsels in direct contempt, as well as for the imposition of administrative sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Likewise, the same rules expressly provide that a party may seek the dismissal of a Complaint or another pleading asserting a claim on the ground "[t]hat there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause," i.e., <i>litis pendentia</i>, or "[t]hat the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> i.e., <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><i>Forum non conveniens</i>, like the rules of forum shopping, <i>litis pendentia</i>, and <i>res judicata</i>, is a means of addressing the problem of parallel litigation. While the rules of forum shopping, <i>litis pendentia</i>, and <i>res judicata</i> are designed to address the problem of parallel litigation within a single jurisdiction, <i>forum non conveniens</i> is a means devised to address parallel litigation arising in multiple jurisdictions.<br><br><i>Forum non conveniens</i> literally translates to "the forum is inconvenient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It is a concept in private international law and was devised to combat the "less than honorable" reasons and excuses that litigants use to secure procedural advantages, annoy and harass defendants, avoid overcrowded dockets, and select a "friendlier" venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> addresses the same rationale that the rule against forum shopping does, albeit on a multijurisdictional scale.<br><br><i>Forum non conveniens</i>, like <i>res judicata</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> is a concept originating in common law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, unlike the rule on <i>res judicata</i>, as well as those on <i>litis pendentia</i> and forum shopping, <i>forum non conveniens</i> finds no textual anchor, whether in statute or in procedural rules, in our civil law system. Nevertheless, jurisprudence has applied <i>forum non conveniens</i> as basis for a court to decline its exercise of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><i>Forum non conveniens</i> is soundly applied not only to address parallel litigation and undermine a litigant's capacity to vex and secure undue advantages by engaging in forum shopping on an international scale. It is also grounded on principles of comity and judicial efficiency.<br><br>Consistent with the principle of comity, a tribunal's desistance in exercising jurisdiction on account of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is a deferential gesture to the tribunals of another sovereign. It is a measure that prevents the former's having to interfere in affairs which are better and more competently addressed by the latter. Further, <i>forum non conveniens</i> entails a recognition not only that tribunals elsewhere are <i>better suited to rule on and resolve</i> a controversy, but also, that these tribunals are <i>better positioned to enforce judgments</i> and, ultimately, to dispense justice. <i>Forum non conveniens</i> prevents the embarrassment of an awkward situation where a tribunal is rendered incompetent in the face of the greater capability — both analytical and practical — of a tribunal in another jurisdiction.<br><br>The wisdom of avoiding conflicting and unenforceable judgments is as much a matter of efficiency and economy as it is a matter of international courtesy. A court would effectively be neutering itself if it insists on adjudicating a controversy when it knows full well that it is in no position to enforce its judgment. Doing so is not only an exercise in futility; it is an act of frivolity.

Neither the mere invocation of <i>forum non conveniens</i> nor the averment of foreign elements operates to automatically divest a court of jurisdiction. Rather, a court should renounce jurisdiction only "after 'vital facts are established, to determine whether special circumstances' require the court's desistance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> As the propriety of applying <i>forum non conveniens</i> is contingent on a factual determination, it is, therefore, a matter of defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The second sentence of Rule 9, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is exclusive in its recital of the grounds for dismissal that are exempt from the omnibus motion rule: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter; (2) <i>litis pendentia</i>; (3) <i>res judicata</i>; and (4) prescription. Moreover, dismissal on account of<i> forum non conveniens</i> is a fundamentally discretionary matter. It is, therefore, not a matter for a defendant to foist upon the court at his or her own convenience; rather, it must be pleaded at the earliest possible opportunity.<br><br>On the matter of pleading <i>forum non conveniens</i>, we state the rule, thus: <i>Forum non conveniens must not only be clearly pleaded as a ground for dismissal; it must be pleaded as such at the earliest possible opportunity.

Thus, <i>a defendant must also plead and show that a prior suit has, in fact, been brought in another jurisdiction</i>.<br><br>The existence of a prior suit makes real the vexation engendered by duplicitous litigation, the embarrassment of intruding into the affairs of another sovereign, and the squandering of judicial efforts in resolving a dispute already lodged and better resolved elsewhere.

On this, the moving party bears the burden of proof.<br><br>A number of factors affect the assessment of an alternative forum's adequacy.

It is not the primarily pivotal consideration in this case.<br><br>In any case, even a further consideration of the applicability of <i>forum non conveniens</i> on the incidental matter of the law governing respondents' relation with Saudia leads to the conclusion that it is improper for Philippine tribunals to divest themselves of jurisdiction.<br><br><i>Any evaluation of the propriety of contracting parties' choice of a forum and'its incidents must grapple with two (2) considerations: first, the availability and adequacy of recourse to a foreign tribunal; and second, the question of where, as between the forum court and a foreign court, the balance of interests inhering in a dispute weighs more heavily.</i><br><br>The first is a pragmatic matter. It relates to the viability of ceding jurisdiction to a foreign tribunal and can be resolved by juxtaposing the competencies and practical circumstances of the tribunals in alternative fora. Exigencies, like the statute of limitations, capacity to enforce orders and judgments, access to records, requirements for the acquisition of jurisdiction, and even questions relating to the integrity of foreign courts, may render undesirable or even totally unfeasible recourse to a foreign court. As mentioned, we consider it in the greater interest of prudence that a defendant show, in pleading <i>forum non conveniens</i>, that litigation has commenced in another jurisdiction and that a foieign tribunal has, in fact, chosen to exercise jurisdiction.<br><br>Two (2) factors weigh into a court's appraisal of the balance of interests inhering in a dispute: first, the vinculum which the parties and their relation have to a given jurisdiction; and second, the public interest that must animate a tribunal, in its capacity as an agent of the sovereign, in choosing to assume or decline jurisdiction. The first is more concerned with the parties, their personal circumstances, and private interests; the second concerns itself with the state and the greater social order.<br><br>In considering the vinculum, a court must look into the preponderance of linkages which the parties and their transaction may have to either jurisdiction. In this respect, factors, such as the parties' respective nationalities and places of negotiation, execution, performance, engagement or deployment, come into play.<br><br>In considering public interest, a court proceeds with a consciousness that it is an organ of the state. It must, thus, determine if the interests of the sovereign (which acts through it) are outweighed by those of the alternative jurisdiction. In this respect, the court delves into a consideration of public policy. Should it find that public interest weighs more heavily in favor of its assumption of jurisdiction, it should proceed in adjudicating the dispute, any doubt or .contrary view arising from the preponderance of linkages notwithstanding.<br><br>Our law on contracts recognizes the validity of contractual choice of law provisions. Where such provisions exist, Philippine tribunals, acting as the forum court, generally defer to the parties' articulated choice.<br><br>This is consistent with the fundamental principle of autonomy of contracts. Article 1306 of the Civ:l Code expressly provides that "[t]he contracting parties may establish 'such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Nevertheless, while a Philippine tribunal (acting as the forum court) is called upon to respect the parties' choice of governing law, such respect must not be so permissive as to lose sight of considerations of law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy that underlie the contract central to the controversy.<br><br>Specifically with respect to public policy, in <i>Pakistan International Airlines Corporation v. Ople</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> this court explained that:<br><blockquote>counter-balancing the principle of autonomy of contracting parties is the equally general rule that provisions of applicable law, especially <i>provisions relating to matters affected with public policy, are deemed written inta the contract</i>. Put a little differently, the governing principle is that parties may not contract away applicable provisions of law especially peremptory provisions dealing with matters heavily impressed with public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Article II, Section 14 of the 1987 Constitution provides that "[t]he State ... shall ensure the fundamental equality before the law of women and men." Contrasted with Article II, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution's statement that "[n]o person shall ... be denied the equal protection of the laws," Article II, Section 14 exhorts the State to "ensure." This does not only mean that the Philippines shall not countenance nor lend legal recognition and approbation to measures that discriminate on the basis of one's being male or female. It imposes an obligation to <i>actively engage</i> in securing the fundamental equality of men and women.<br><br>The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), signed and ratified by the Philippines on July 15, 1980, and on August 5, 1981, respectively,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> is part of the law of the land. In view of the widespread signing and ratification of, as well as adherence (in practice) to it by states, it may even be said that many provisions of the CEDAW may have become customary international law. The CEDAW gives effect to the Constitution's policy statement in Article II, Section 14. Article I of the CEDAW defines "discrimination against women" as:<br><blockquote>any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>The constitutional exhortation to ensure fundamental equality, as illumined by its enabling law, the CEDAW, must inform and animate all the actions of all personalities acting on behalf of the State. It is, therefore, the bounden duty of this court, in rendering judgment on the disputes brought before it, to ensure that no discrimination is heaped upon women on the mere basis of their being women. This is a point so basic and central that all our discussions and pronouncements — regardless of whatever averments there may be of foreign law — must proceed from this premise.<br><br>So informed and animated, we emphasize the glaringly discriminatory nature of Saudia's policy. As argued by respondents, Saudia's policy entails the termination of employment of flight attendants who become pregnant. At the risk of stating the obvious, <i>pregnancy is an occurrence that pertains specifically to women</i>. Saudia's policy excludes from and restricts employment on the basis of no other consideration but sex.<br><br>We do not lose sight of the reality that pregnancy does present physical limitations that may render difficult the performance of functions associated with being a flight attendant. Nevertheless, it would be the height of iniquity to view pregnancy as a disability so permanent and immutable that, it must entail the termination of one's employment. It is clear to us that any individual, regardless of gender, may be subject to exigencies that limit the performance of functions. However, we fail to appreciate how pregnancy could be such an impairing occurrence that it leaves no other recourse but the complete termination of the means through which a woman earns a living.<br><br>Apart from the constitutional policy on the fundamental equality before the law of men and women, it is settled that contracts relating to labor and employment are impressed with public interest. Article 1700 of the Civil Code provides that "[t]he relation between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good."<br><br>Consistent with this, this court's pronouncements in <i>Pakistan International Airlines Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> are clear and unmistakable:<br><blockquote>Petitioner PIA cannot take refuge in paragraph 10 of its employment agreement which specifies, firstly, the law of Pakistan as the applicable law of the agreement, and, secondly, lays the venue for settlement of any dispute arising out of or in connection with the agreement "<i>only</i> [in] courts of Karachi, Pakistan". The first clause of paragraph 10 cannot be invoked to prevent the application of Philippine labor laws and'regulations to the subject matter of this case, <i>i.e.</i>, the employer-employee relationship between petitioner PIA and private respondents. <i>We have already pointed out that the relationship is much affected with public interest and that the otherwise applicable Philippine laws and regulations cannot be rendered illusory by the parties agreeing upon some other law to govern their relationship</i>. . . . Under these circumstances, paragraph 10 of the employment agreement cannot be given effect so as to oust Philippine agencies and courts of the jurisdiction vested upon them by Philippine law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As the present dispute relates to (what the respondents allege to be) the illegal termination of respondents' employment, this case is immutably a matter of public interest and public policy. Consistent with clear pronouncements in law and jurisprudence, Philippine laws properly find application in and govern this case. 'Moreover, as this premise for Saudia's insistence on the application <i>forum non conveniens</i> has been shattered, it follows that Philippine tribunals may properly assume jurisdiction over the present controversy. Philippine jurisprudence provides ample illustrations of when a court's renunciation of jurisdiction on account of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is proper or improper.'<br><br>In <i>Philsec Investment Corporation v.

In that case, private respondent Marcelo G. Santos was working in the Sultanate of Oman when he received a letter from Palace Hotel recruiting him for employment in Beijing, China. Santos accepted the offer. Subsequently, however, he was released from employment supposedly due to business reverses arising from political upheavals in China (i.e., the Tiananmen Square incidents of 1989). Santos later filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal impleading Palace Hotel's General Manager, Mr. Gerhard Schmidt, the Manila Hotel International Company Ltd. (which was, responsible for training Palace Hotel's personnel and staff), and the Manila Hotel Corporation (which owned 50% of Manila Hotel International Company Ltd.'s capital stock).<br><br>In ruling against the National Labor Relations Commission's exercise of jurisdiction, this court noted that the main aspects of the case transpired in two (2) foreign jurisdictions, Oman and China, and that the case involved purely foreign elements. Specifically, Santos was directly hired by a foreign employer through correspondence sent to Oman. Also, the proper defendants were neither Philippine nationals nor engaged in business in the Philippines, while the main witnesses were not residents of the Philippines. Likewise, this court noted that the National Labor Relations Commission was in no position to conduct the following: first, determine the law governing the employment contract, as it was entered into in foreign soil; second, determine the facts, as Santos' employment was terminated in Beijing; and third, enforce its judgment, since Santos' employer, Palace Hotel, was incorporated under the laws of China and was not even served with summons.<br><br>Contrary to <i>Manila Hotel</i>, the case now before us does not entail a preponderance of linkages that favor a foreign jurisdiction.<br><br>Here, the circumstances of the parties and their relation do not approximate the circumstances enumerated in <i>Puyat</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> which this court recognized as possibly justifying the desistance of Philippine tribunals from exercising jurisdiction.<br><br>First, there is no basis for concluding that the case can be more conveniently tried elsewhere. As established earlier, Saudia is doing business in the Philippines. For their part, all four (4) respondents are Filipino citizens maintaining residence in the Philippines and, apart from their previous employment with Saudia, have no other connection to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It would even be to respondents' inconvenience if this case were to be tried elsewhere.<br><br>Second, the records are bereft of any indication that respondents filed their Complaint in an effort to engage in forum shopping or to vex and inconvenience Saudia.<br><br>Third, there is no indication of "unwillingness to extend local judicial facilities to non-residents or aliens."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> That Saudia has managed to bring the present controversy all the way to this court proves this.<br><br>Fourth, it cannot be said that the local judicial machinery is inadequate for effectuating the right sought to be maintained. Summons was properly served on Saudia and jurisdiction over its person was validly acquired.<br><br>Lastly, there is not even room for considering foreign law. Philippine law properly governs the present dispute.<br><br>As the question of applicable law has been settled, the supposed difficulty of ascertaining foreign law (which requires the application of <i>forum non conveniens</i>) provides no insurmountable inconvenience or special circumstance that will justify depriving Philippine tribunals of jurisdiction.<br><br>Even if we were to assume, for the sake of discussion, that it is the laws of Saudi Arabia which should apply, it does not follow that Philippine tribunals should refrain from exercising jurisdiction. To. recall our pronouncements in Puyat,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> as well as in <i>Bank of America, NT&amp;SA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> it is not so much the <u>mere applicability</u> of foreign law which calls into operation <i>forum non conveniens</i>. Rather, what justifies a court's desistance from exercising jurisdiction is "[t]he <u>difficulty</u> of ascertaining foreign law"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> or the inability of a "Philippine Court to make an intelligent decision as to the law[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Consistent with <i>lex loci intentionis</i>, to the extent that it is proper and practicable (i.e., "to make an intelligent decision"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>), Philippine tribunals may apply the foreign law selected by the parties. In fact, (albeit without meaning to make a pronouncement on the accuracy and reliability of respondents' citation) in this case, respondents themselves have made averments as to the laws of Saudi Arabia. In their Comment, respondents write:<br><blockquote>Under the Labor Laws of Saudi Arabia and the Philippines[,] it is illegal and unlawful to terminate the employment of any woman by virtue of pregnancy. The law in Saudi Arabia is even more harsh and strict [sic] in that no employer can terminate the employment of a female worker or give her a warning of the same while on Maternity Leave, the specific provision of Saudi Labor Laws on the matter is hereto quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>"An employer may not terminate the employment of a female worker or give her a warning of the same while on maternity leave."

First, all the parties are based in the Philippines and all the material incidents transpired in this jurisdiction. Thus, the parties may conveniently seek relief from Philippine tribunals. Second, Philippine tribunals are in a position to make an intelligent decision as to the law and the facts. Third, Philippine tribunals are in a position to enforce their decisions. There is no compelling basis for ceding jurisdiction to a foreign tribunal. Quite the contrary, the immense public policy considerations attendant to this case behoove Philippine tribunals to not shy away from their duty to rule on the case.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Respondents were illegally terminated.<br><br>In <i>Bilbao v.

Evidently, the very nature of a maternity leave means that a pregnant employee will not report for work <i>only temporarily</i> and that she will resume the performance of her duties as soon as the leave allowance expires.<br><br>It is also clear that respondents exerted all efforts to' remain employed with Saudia. Each of them repeatedly filed appeal letters (as much as five [5] letters in the case of Rebesencio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>) asking Saudia to reconsider the ultimatum that they resign or be terminated along with the forfeiture of their benefits.

This minutia fails to surmount all the other indications negating any voluntariness on respondents' part. If at all, these same resignation letters are proof of how any supposed resignation did not arise from respondents' own initiative. As earlier pointed out, respondents' resignations were executed on Saudia's blank letterheads that Saudia had provided.
