				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Is the presentation of a stock certificate a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for proving one’s shareholding in a corporation?

The dismissal shall have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise declared by the Court.”</blockquote>Going into the merits, the Court is of the considered opinion that the documents presented in the compliance failed to defeat the challenge of the defendant.&nbsp; “A mere typewritten statement advising a stockholder of the extent of his ownership in a corporation xxx cannot be considered a formal Certificate of Stock”. (SEC opinion. 20 October 1970, cited in Bitong vs. CA)<br><br>Further, in a derivative suit, it is required that stockholder is an owner of a stock certificate at the time of the suit.&nbsp; The documents presented are not updated.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered this case is ordered DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>The petitioners appealed the dismissal.<br><br>On June 6, 2012, the CA promulgated its assailed decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Order dated 28 June 2010 of the Regional Trial Court of Bangued, Abra, Branch 1, in Civil Case No. 2070 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>After the CA denied the petitioners’ motion for reconsideration on October 15, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the petitioners have come to the Court for review.<br><br><b><center>Issue<br></center></b><br>To be resolved is whether the RTC properly dismissed Special Civil Action Case No. 2070 on the ground of the petitioners’ failure to comply with the order issued by the RTC on March 8, 2010 to produce stock certificates.&nbsp; In other words, the Court should determine whether or not the petitioners were<i> bona fide</i> stockholders of Abra Valley.<br><br><b><center>Ruling of the Court</center></b><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, we stress that the Court’s determination is limited to resolving the issue concerning the status or relation of the petitioners with Abra Valley.&nbsp; Whether or not the petitioners could exercise their right to inspect Abra Valley’s corporate books, records and minutes of meetings, and be furnished with financial statements, and whether or not they could demand the immediate holding of the annual stockholders’ meeting are matters to be tried and resolved by the RTC.<br><br><b><center>1.<br>Petitioners were stockholders of Abra Valley</center></b><br>In their amended complaint, the petitioners alleged that they were <i>bona fide</i> stockholders of Abra Valley.&nbsp; On the other hand, the respondents claimed as an affirmative defense that the petitioners were not Abra Valley’s stockholders.<br><br>In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence, or evidence that is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto.&nbsp; Thus, the party, whether the plaintiff or the defendant, who asserts the affirmative of an issue bears the <i>onus</i> to prove his assertion in order to obtain a favorable judgment. From the plaintiff the burden to prove his positive assertions never parts. Yet, for the defendant, an affirmative defense is one that is not a denial of an essential ingredient in the plaintiff’s cause of action, but rather one that, if established, will be a good defense – i.e., an “avoidance” of the claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The petitioners’ causes of action against the respondents were premised on Sections 50, 74 and 75 of the <i>Corporation Code</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 50. <i>Regular and special meetings of stockholders or members</i>. – Regular meetings of <b>stockholders</b> or members shall be held annually on a date fixed in the by-laws, or if not so fixed, on any date in April of every year as determined by the board of directors or trustees: Provided, That written notice of regular meetings shall be sent to all stockholders or members of record at least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting, unless a different period is required by the by-laws.<br><br>Section 74. <i>Books to be kept; stock transfer agent</i>. – x x x<br><br>The records of all business transactions of the corporation and the minutes of any meetings shall be open to inspection by any director, trustee, <b>stockholder</b> or member of the corporation at reasonable hours on business days and he may demand, in writing, for a copy of excerpts from said records or minutes, at his expense.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 75. <i>Right to financial statements</i>. – Within ten (10) days from receipt of a written request of any <b>stockholder </b>or member, the corporation shall furnish to him its most recent financial statement, which shall include a balance sheet as of the end of the last taxable year and a profit or loss statement for said taxable year, showing in reasonable detail its assets and liabilities and the result of its operations. (Emphasis ours)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Conformably with these provisions, the petitioners had to establish that they were stockholders of Abra Valley. Indeed, the CA concluded that it was the petitioners who had failed to discharge the burden of proving their stock ownership because they did not produce their stock certificates.<br><br>We reverse the CA.<br><br>First of all, the present issue was the offshoot of the RTC’s resolution of the <i>Motion for Preliminary Hearing of Special and Affirmative Defenses</i>, wherein the respondents alleged that the petitioners were not stockholders of Abra Valley; and that they had no cause of action against the respondents. Being the parties who filed the <i>Motion for Preliminary Hearing of Special and Affirmative Defenses</i>, the respondents bore the burden of proof to establish that the petitioners were not stockholders of Abra Valley. The respondents’ assertion therein, albeit negative, partook of a good defense that, if established, would result to their “avoidance” of the claim. On that basis, the CA erroneously laid the burden of proof on the petitioners.<br><br>Secondly, the petitioners, assuming that they bore the burden of proving their status as stockholders of Abra Valley, nonetheless discharged their burden despite their non-production of the stock certificates.<br><br>A stock certificate is <i>prima facie </i>evidence that the holder is a shareholder of the corporation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but the possession of the certificate is not the sole determining factor of one’s stock ownership. A certificate of stock is merely: –<br><br><blockquote>x x x the paper representative or tangible evidence of the stock itself and of the various interests therein. <b>The certificate is not stock in the corporation but is merely evidence of the holder's interest and status in the corporation, his ownership of the share represented thereby, but is not in law the equivalent of such ownership.</b> It expresses the contract between the corporation and the stockholder, but it is not essential to the existence of a share in stock or the creation of the relation of shareholder to the corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>To establish their stock ownership, the petitioners actually turned over to the trial court through their <i>Compliance and Manifestation</i> submitted on April 7, 2010 the various documents showing their ownership of Abra Valley’s shares,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> specifically: the official receipts of their payments for their subscriptions of the shares of Abra Valley; and the copies duly certified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that Abra Valley had issued shares in favor of the petitioners, such as the issuance of part of authorized and unissued capital stock; the letter dated June 17, 1987; the secretary’s certificate dated June 17, 1987; and the general information sheet.<br><br>And, thirdly, the petitioners adduced competent proof showing that the respondents had allowed the petitioners to become members of the Board of Directors. According to the <i>Minutes of the Annual Meeting of Directors and Stockholders of the Abra Valley College of January 29, 1989,</i> which was among the documents submitted to the trial court on April 7, 2010 through the <i>Compliance and Manifestation</i>, the petitioners attended the annual meeting of January 29, 1989 as stockholders of Abra Valley, and participated in the election of the Board of Directors at which some of them were chosen as members. Considering that Section 23 of the <i>Corporation Code </i>requires every director to be the holder of at least one share of capital stock of the corporation of which he is a director, the respondents would not have then allowed any of the petitioners to be elected to sit in the Board of Directors as members unless they believed that the petitioners so elected were not disqualified for lack of stock ownership. Neither did the respondents thereafter assail their acts as Board Directors. Conformably with the doctrine of estoppel, the respondents could no longer deny the petitioners’ status as stockholders of Abra Valley. The application of the doctrine of estoppel, which is based on public policy, fair dealing, good faith and justice, is only appropriate because the purpose of the doctrine is to forbid one from speaking against his own act, representations, or commitments to the injury of another to whom he directed such act, representations, or commitments, and who reasonably relied thereon. The doctrine springs from equitable principles and the equities in the case, and is designed to aid the law in the administration of justice where without its aid injustice might result. The Court has applied the doctrine wherever and whenever special circumstances of the case so demanded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, the dismissal of Special Civil Action Case No. 2070 on June 28, 2010 on the basis that “the documents presented are not Stock Certificates as boldly announced by the plaintiff’s counsel, hence, plaintiffs failed to comply with the order of the Court dated March 8, 2010” was unwarranted and unreasonable. Although Section 3, Rule 17 of the <i>Rules of Court</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> expressly empowers the trial court to dismiss the complaint <i>motu proprio </i>or upon motion of the defendant if, for no justifiable cause, the plaintiff fails to comply with any order of the court, the power to dismiss is not to wielded indiscriminately, but only when the non-compliance constitutes a willful violation of an order of consequence to the action. Dismissal of the action can be grossly oppressive if it is based on non-compliance with the most trivial order of the court considering that the dismissal equates to “an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise declared by the court.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> A line of demarcation must be drawn between an order whose non-compliance impacts on the case, and an order whose non-compliance causes little effect on the case. For example, the non-compliance of an order to the plaintiff to amend his complaint to implead an indispensable party as defendant should be sanctioned with dismissal with prejudice unless the non-compliance was upon justifiable cause, like such party not within the jurisdiction of the court.<br><br>As we have seen, however, the dismissal of Special Civil Action Case No. 2070 by virtue of Section 3, Rule 17 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> should be undone because the petitioners’ production of the stock certificates was rendered superfluous by their submission of other competent means of establishing their shareholdings in Abra Valley.<br><br><b><center>2.<br>Petitioners were entitled to demand<br>the production of the STB of Abra Valley</center></b><br>The respondents insist that the petitioners should establish that the indorsement of the stock certificates by the original holders was registered in their favor in the STB of Abra Valley.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>We do not agree with this insistence.<br><br>A person becomes a stockholder of a corporation by acquiring a share through either purchase or subscription.&nbsp; Here, the petitioners acquired their shares in Abra Valley: (1) by subscribing to 36 shares each from Abra Valley’s authorized and unissued capital stock;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and (2) by purchasing the shareholdings of existing stockholders, as borne out by the latter’s indorsement on the stock certificates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In determining the validity of the transfer of shares through purchase, we resort to Section 63 of the <i>Corporation Code</i>, which pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 63. <i>Certificate of stock and transfer of shares.</i> – x x x Shares of stock so issued are personal property and may be transferred by delivery of the certificate or certificates indorsed by the owner or his attorney-in-fact or other person legally authorized to make the transfer. No transfer, however, shall be valid, except as between the parties, until the transfer is recorded in the books of the corporation showing the names of the parties to the transaction, the date of the transfer, the number of the certificate or certificates and the number of shares transferred.<br><br>No shares of stock against which the corporation holds any unpaid claim shall be transferable in the books of the corporation.</blockquote><br>In this regard, the Court has instructed in <i>Ponce v. Alsons Cement Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [A] transfer of shares of stock not recorded in the stock and transfer book of the corporation is non-existent as far as the corporation is concerned. As between the corporation on the one hand, and its shareholders and third persons on the other, the corporation looks only to its books for the purpose of determining who its shareholders are.&nbsp; It is only when the transfer has been recorded in the stock and transfer book that a corporation may rightfully regard the transferee as one of its stockholders. From this time, the consequent obligation on the part of the corporation to recognize such rights as it is mandated by law to recognize arises.</blockquote><br>Nonetheless, in <i>Lanuza v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court has underscored that the STB is not the exclusive evidence of the matters and things that ordinarily are or should be written therein, for parol evidence may be admitted to supply omissions from the records, or to explain ambiguities, or to contradict such records, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [A] stock and transfer book is the book which records the names and addresses of all stockholders arranged alphabetically, the installments paid and unpaid on all stock for which subscription has been made, and the date of payment thereof; a statement of every alienation, sale or transfer of stock made, the date thereof and by and to whom made; and such other entries as may be prescribed by law.&nbsp; A stock and transfer book is necessary as a measure of precaution, expediency and convenience since it provides the only certain and accurate method of establishing the various corporate acts and transactions and of showing the ownership of stock and like matters.&nbsp; <b>However, a stock and transfer book, like other corporate books and records, is not in any sense a public record, and thus is not exclusive evidence of the matters and things which ordinarily are or should be written therein.&nbsp; In fact, it is generally held that the records and minutes of a corporation are not conclusive even against the corporation but are <i>prima facie </i>evidence only, and may be impeached or even contradicted by other competent evidence.&nbsp; Thus, parol evidence may be admitted to supply omissions in the records or explain ambiguities, or to contradict such records</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Considering that Abra Valley’s STB was not in the possession of the petitioners, or at their disposal, they could not be reasonably expected or justly compelled to prove that their stock subscriptions and purchases were recorded therein. This, more than any other, was precisely why they filed their <i>Motion for Production/Inspection of Documents</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to compel the respondents to produce the STB, but the RTC did not act on the motion.<br><br>Unfortunately, the CA concurred with the RTC’s inaction on the ground that “the Stock and Transfer Book is one of the corporate books which may be examined only by a stockholder-of-record.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In our view, the CA thereby grossly erred. The rules of discovery, including Section 1, Rule 27 of the <i>Rules of Court</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> governing the production or inspection of any designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects or tangible things not privileged, which contain or constitute evidence material to any matter involved in the action and which are in the other party’s possession, custody or control, are to be accorded broad and liberal interpretation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In<i> Republic v. Sandiganbayan,</i> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court has dwelt on the breadth of discovery in the following tenor:<br><br><blockquote>What is chiefly contemplated is the discovery of every bit of information which may be useful in the preparation for trial, such as the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts; those relevant facts themselves; and the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things. Hence, the “deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment. No longer can the time-honored cry of ‘fishing expedition’ serve to preclude a party from inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent’s case. Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation. To that end, either party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession. The deposition-discovery procedure simply advances the stage at which the disclosure can be compelled from the time of trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing the possibility, of surprise,”...<br></blockquote><br>In light of the foregoing, the RTC should have favorably acted on the petitioners’ <i>Motion for Production/Inspection of Documents</i> in order to enable the petitioners, consistent with the recognized privileges and disabilities, to enable them to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts to be determined in Special Civil Action Case No. 2070, and thereby prevent the trial from being carried on in the dark, at least from their side.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Doing so would not have caused any prejudice to the respondents, for, after all, even had the petitioners not filed the <i>Motion for Production/Inspection of Documents</i>, the respondents would themselves also&nbsp; be expected to produce the STB in court in order to substantiate their affirmative defense that the petitioners were not stockholders-of-record of Abra Valley. Verily, that there was no entry or record in the STB showing the petitioners to be stockholders of Abra Valley was no valid justification for the respondents not to produce the same. Otherwise, the disputable presumption under Section 3 (e) of Rule 131 of the <i>Rules of Court </i>that “evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced” could arise against them.<br><br>For sure, the transfer of shares in favor of the petitioners was made through the indorsement by the original holders who were presumably the registered owners of the shares, coupled with the delivery of the stock certificates. Such procedure conformed to Section 63 of the <i>Corporation Code.</i> Although Abra Valley did not yet recognize such stock purchases until the surrender of the stock certificates to the corporate secretary to enable the latter to exercise the ministerial duty of recording the transfers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> there was no way of avoiding or evading the production of the STB in court on the part of the respondents. The STB would definitely be relevant and necessary for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the petitioners’ subscriptions to the authorized and unissued capital stock of Abra Valley had been duly registered.<br><br>Lastly, we take notice of the petitioners’ submission of the certification issued on April 3, 2001 by Abra Valley’s corporate secretary stating that the petitioners were shareholders “as per Records of the Stock and Transfer Book of the Abra Valley Colleges” belied the respondents’ claim that no entry or record had been made in the STB.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision promulgated on June 6, 2012 in C.A.-G.R.
