He points out that considerable time has already elapsed, and to serve the ends of justice, the controversy must finally and totally be laid to rest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></center><br>Two issues thus arise for this Court' resolution:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>Whether the petitioner engaged in forum shopping; and<br><br></li><li>Whether Judge Manalastas's decision to continue hearing the civil case was improper.<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b><br></div><br><b>The petition is without merit.</b><br><br>We rule that (1) the petitioner engaged in forum shopping, and (2) Judge Manalastas's decision to continue hearing the civil case is <i>not</i> improper.<br><br><b><i>The Petitioner Engaged in Forum Shopping</i></b><br><br>As a rule, forum shopping is committed by a party who, having received an adverse judgment in one forum, seeks another opinion in another court other than by appeal or the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>. Conceptually, forum shopping is the institution of two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Forum shopping also exists when, as a result of an adverse decision in one forum <b>or in anticipation thereof</b>, a party seeks a favorable opinion in another forum through means other than an appeal or <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>There is likewise forum shopping when the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><i>Litis pendentia</i> is a Latin term meaning "a pending suit" and is variously referred to in some decisions as <i>Lis pendens</i> and <i>auter action pendant</i>. As a ground for the dismissal of a civil action, it refers to the situation where two actions are pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, so that one of them becomes unnecessary and vexatious. It is based on the policy against multiplicity of suits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>There is <i>litis pendentia</i> when the following requisites are present: identity of the parties in the two actions; substantial identity in the causes of action and in the reliefs sought by the parties; and the identity between the two actions should be such that any judgment that may be rendered in one case, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Otherwise stated, the test is whether the two (or more) pending cases have identity of parties, of rights or causes of action, and of the reliefs sought. Willful and deliberate violation of the rule against it is a ground for summary dismissal of the case; it may also constitute direct contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Appeals and petitions for <i>certiorari</i> are normally outside the scope of forum shopping because of their nature and purpose; they grant a litigant the remedy of elevating his case to a superior court for review.<br><br>It is assumed, however, that <b>the filing of the appeal or petition for <i>certiorari</i> is properly or regularly invoked</b> in the usual course of judicial proceedings, and <b>not when the relief sought</b>, through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> or appeal, is <b>still pending</b> with or has yet to be decided by the respondent court or court of origin, tribunal, or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial authority, <i>e.g.</i>, a still pending motion for reconsideration of the order assailed via a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><i>Forum Shopping at the Court of Appeals</i><br><br>We agree with the CA that the petitioner engaged in forum shopping.<br><br>At the time the petitioner filed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the CA, the RTC had yet to resolve the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order earlier filed with the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The petitioner took pains to explain that the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order did not include Judge Manalastas's denial of his Motions for Inhibition.<br><br>The petitioner fails to convince us of the merits of this claim.<br><br>Although the arguments supporting the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order pertained solely to the issue of declaration of default, the prayer was direct and plain.<br><br>It read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, <b>it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that the Omnibus Order dated October 17, 2005, be RECONSIDERED AND SET ASIDE</b>, and that defendant Villamor's Motion to Dismiss dated February 18, 2005, and Supplemental Motion to Dismiss dated February 18, 2005, BE GRANTED. <b>It is <u>further</u> prayed that the order of default issued against Villamor be lifted or set aside.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner prayed that the Omnibus Order be reconsidered and set aside, period. He did not pray that it be partially reconsidered and set aside only insofar as the order of default was concerned. With respect to the "order of default," the petitioner <u>further</u> prayed that this order "be lifted or set aside," thus implying that the petitioner asked for more than the lifting of this order.<br><br>Notably, the motion's preliminary statements were also unambiguous. The petitioner stated in clear terms that he was moving for the reconsideration of the Omnibus Order; again, without qualification. Nowhere in the preliminary statements did the petitioner indicate that he was only moving for a partial reconsideration of the Omnibus Order.<br><br>The petitioner's failure to state in unequivocal terms that he was only moving for the partial reconsideration of the Omnibus Order may or may not have been intentional. But, regardless of the petitioner's intention, the result is the same: the motion prayed for the reversal and setting aside of the Omnibus Order in its entirety. For all intents and purposes, the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order necessarily included the relief also prayed for in the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br>Even if we accept the petitioner's explanation that the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order did not raise the issue of Judge Manalastas's inhibition, and that it was meant to be a partial reconsideration of the Omnibus Order, the petitioner <i>still</i> cannot deny that he engaged in forum shopping.<br><br><b>We find it undisputed that <u>during the pendency</u> of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in the CA and the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order in the RTC, the petitioner filed with the RTC his Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case.</b><br><br>The petitioner's claim that he did not engage in forum shopping completely crumbles when this new Motion is considered. <b>Three remedies were then pending in two separate tribunals, all praying for the same relief: the inhibition of Judge Manalastas.</b><br><br><i>First</i>, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, prayed among others, that <br><br>xxx after proceedings duly had, render judgment:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(i) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">ANNULLING the Omnibus Order dated October 17, 2005 insofar as public respondent judge therein denied petitioner's Motion For Inhibition dated March 1, 2005, Supplemental Motion For Inhibition dared April 12, 2005 and Second Supplemental Motion For Inhibition dated June 21, 2005;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(ii)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> <b>ORDERING the inhibition of public respondent judge in Civil Case No. 70251 xxx</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><i>Second</i>, the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case prayed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is prayed that the Honorable Presiding Judge <b>inhibit herself from further proceeding with the instant case</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Third</i> (and as already explained), the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order prayed that Judge Manalastas set aside the Omnibus Order in its entirety, which would logically result in her inhibition from hearing the case.<br><br>The petitioner, however, insists that the filing of the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case was the necessary consequence of the administrative complaint. The petitioner argues that the pendency of the administrative complaint should result in Judge Manalastas's inhibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>He asserts that the basis of the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case was Judge Manalastas's <i>gross ignorance of the law, and bias and partiality</i> while the basis of the Motions for Inhibitions — denied by Judge Manalastas and later the subject of the Omnibus Order elevated to the CA through the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> — was Judge Manalastas's grave abuse of discretion in refusing to inhibit from hearing the civil case because of bias and prejudice.<br><br>The petitioner argues that the grounds relied upon in the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> were different and distinct from those in support of the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In sum, the petitioner claims that the remedies were based on different grounds and that they should not be treated as praying for the same relief.<br><br>We do not find the petitioner's position persuasive.<br><br>A perusal of the administrative complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> would show that the petitioner raised, as one of the grounds for imputing gross ignorance of the law to Judge Manalastas, her refusal to inhibit. In fact, the petitioner copied the allegations from the Motions for Inhibitions and generally pasted them on the administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Glaringly, the petitioner used the same ground to support the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case. As earlier stated, the petitioner likewise prayed for the same relief in both of these remedies.<br><br>These only lead to one inevitable conclusion: the petitioner engaged in forum shopping by simultaneously raising the same issues in different tribunals, relying on the same ground founded on the same facts, hoping that both or either court would grant his prayer.<br><br>Further, in anticipation of an adverse ruling in the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order, the petitioner, without waiting for Judge Manalastas's resolution, filed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the CA hoping to obtain a favorable ruling.<br><br>To reiterate, the petitioner filed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> while the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order was pending. This violates Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court which provides that the availability of a remedy in the ordinary course of law precludes the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>; under this rule, the petition's dismissal is the necessary consequence if recourse to Rule 65 is prematurely taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Had the petitioner waited for the resolution of the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> would have been regularly and properly invoked in the usual course of judicial proceedings and should not have been dismissed by the CA.<br><br>In fact, if the CA had strictly applied Rule 65, it could have summarily dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> on <i>another ground</i> in addition to forum shopping.<br><br>One of the essential requisites of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is that there is neither appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law for the purpose annulling or modifying the questioned proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>There was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy to annul or modify the Omnibus Order. The petitioner should have expressly included in the MR with Motion to Lift Default Order the denial of his Motions for Inhibition so that Judge Manalastas could have properly reconsidered her Omnibus Order in its entirety.<br><br>In the end, it was the petitioner's precipitate resort to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> that was his own undoing.<br><br><i>Forum Shopping in this Court</i><br><br>The petitioner likewise committed forum shopping when he submitted for this Court's resolution an issue still pending with the RTC.<br><br>We do not know if the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case was still pending with or had been resolved by the RTC when the petitioner filed the present petition. The petitioner kept silent on its status, in violation of his commitment under the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping he had filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>What we know is that the administrative complaint, the basis of the said motion, was still pending when the present petition was filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>To recap, the petitioner anchored his administrative complaint on Judge Manaiastas's gross ignorance of the law. Among the grounds relied upon was Judge Manaiastas's bias and partiality, the same ground used in the Motions for Inhibition, which later became the subject of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> (the CA's resolution dismissing the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> is now subject of the present petition). The petitioner subsequently filed with the RTC the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case.<br><br>The series of events shows that the petitioner filed the present petition when the administrative complaint, and very likely, the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case were both pending.<br><br>Again, the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case and the present petition prayed for the <b>same relief</b>.<br><br>We note that the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case prays "that the <b>Honorable Presiding Judge inhibit herself from further proceeding with the instant case,</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> while the present petition prays that -<br><blockquote>xxx (b) after proceeding duly had, render judgment:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(i) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">SETTING ASIDE the Resolution dated January 31, 2006 x x x of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

In short, all the badges of forum shopping are present.<br><br>In <i>Montes v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we found that the petitioner therein engaged in forum shopping when he filed with this Court a petition for prohibition while his motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his petition for <i>certiorari</i> was still pending in the CA. Although the purpose of a petition for prohibition is different from that of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, we ruled that there was forum shopping because the reliefs sought were the same — to restrain a government official from implementing the same order.<br><br>In like manner, it does not matter that the <i>apparent</i> purpose of the administrative complaint (the source of the Motion for Inhibition on Account of Administrative Case) is distinct from that of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> (the source of the present petition). The controlling consideration is that they are both geared towards achieving the same goal: the inhibition of Judge Manalastas from hearing the civil case.<br><br>The petitioner cannot hide under the cloak of characterization and labels to escape from the consequences of his actions. If we allow this, the evil sought to be prevented by the rule against forum shopping would result.<br><br><b>We remind the petitioner and his lawyer that forum shopping constitutes abuse of court processes, which tends to degrade the administration of justice, to wreak havoc upon orderly juridical procedure, and to add to the congestion of the already burdened dockets of the courts.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Further, the rule proscribing forum shopping seeks to foster candor and transparency between lawyers and their clients in appearing before the courts — to promote the orderly administration of justice, prevent undue inconvenience upon the other party, and save the precious time of the courts.

The grounds relied upon by the petitioner do not fall under the first paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court which enumerates the grounds for compulsory inhibition. We have held that the issue of voluntary inhibition is primarily a matter of <b>conscience and sound discretion</b> on the part of the judge based on his or her rational and logical assessment of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><i>Second,</i> bare allegations of bias and prejudice are not enough, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence, to overcome the presumption that a judge will undertake his noble role to dispense justice according to law and evidence without fear or favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Nothing on record shows that the petitioner ever submitted evidence of bias and prejudice.<br><br>Villamor's claims that Judge Manalastas's impartiality was allegedly compromised because (1) she and the respondent stood as godparents to a child of a common friend, and (2) that her husband was a partner of a law firm which represented a client whose claim against the petitioner was similar to the respondent's, do not suffice to overthrow the presumption that Judge Manalastas will dispense justice according to law and evidence without fear or favor.<br><br>Because this act is discretionary, Judge Manalastas is in the best position to determine whether or not there was a need to inhibit from the case; thus, her decision to hear the case, in the higher interest of justice, equity, and public interest, should be respected.<br><br>While a party has the right to seek the inhibition or disqualification of a judge who does not appear to be wholly free, disinterested, impartial, and independent in handling the case, this right must be weighed with her duty to decide cases without fear or pressure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In these lights, we see no reason to reverse Judge Manalastas's decision to proceed with hearing the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, we <b>DENY</b> the petition and <b>AFFIRM</b> the January 31, 2006 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
