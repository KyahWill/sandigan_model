				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the Petitions for Review filed by Solidbank Corporation (Solidbank) in G.R. No. 166581, and Danilo H. Lazaro (Lazaro) in G.R. No. 167187 from the 19 January 2004 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 01 July 2004 Amended Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 14 January 2005 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.SP No. 73629.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>As culled from the CA, the antecedent facts are as follows:<br><blockquote>Petitioner Danilo H. Lazaro (Lazaro) joined respondent Solidbank Corporation on December 21, 1992. He rose from the ranks until he became Vice President, Head of the Branch Banking Group, Region 6 (Southern Luzon branches).<br><br>On August 21, 1995, the Imus branch, one of the bank's branches under Lazaro, was audited for the first time by the bank's internal auditors, known as the Audit and Credit Examination Services (ACES). The audit uncovered certain irregularities committed by the branch manager and the accountant involving loan releases without proper documentation and approval of the Region Head and other appropriate approving bodies. Respondent bank was allegedly defrauded in the amount of P43 million through the fraudulent acts and/or activities allegedly committed by some officers of the said branch office, in connivance with some individual borrowers.<br><br>Lazaro immediately tendered his resignation effective February 15, 1996, out of delicadeza, when his name was dragged by the ACES Audit Report into the Imus branch loan anomaly with a sweeping allegation "that he has given blanket authority to all the Branch Managers in his region to commit loans up to P1 Million subject to his confirmation." He was not however included among those criminally charged by the bank.<br><br>Lazaro's resignation was not accepted by respondent bank president Vistan who categorically cleared him of any liability on the Imus case with the assurance that he (Vistan) personally, does not believe that petitioner Lazaro has anything to do with the said irregularity. Respondent Vistan persuaded Lazaro to stay and help resolve the Imus case. Thus was then assigned in a special project attached to the office of the legal counsel.<br><br>Pursuant to respondent Vistan's instruction to concentrate on the Imus branch loans, Lazaro worked and coordinated closely with the bank's legal counsel. The bank filed criminal charges against several persons including the Imus Branch Manager, the accountant and four borrowers.<br><br>Petitioner's Christmas bonus which was credited to his account on November 13, 1996 was ordered reversed by a debit memo from respondent's bank Human Resource Department (HRD) on November 15, 1996. Aggrieved, Lazaro wrote a letter to respondent Vistan seeking clarification. There was no response from respondent Vistan.<br><br>On December 13, 1996, petitioner Lazaro was told by Ed Buenaventura of the Motorpool Section to surrender his service car. Later, Lazaro found out that his payroll for December 1-15, 1996 was not credited to his payroll account. He thus wrote another letter to respondent Vistan reiterating his earlier request for clarification. Again, there was no answer.<br><br>Lazaro requested for a meeting with respondent Vistan. On January 7, 1997, they met together with respondent SVP Jazmines at the latter's office. Ten (10) months and twenty two (22) days after Lazaro was assigned to special projects, respondent bank president Vistan verbally dismissed petitioner Lazaro upon the recommendation of and after consultation with respondent Senior Vice President Jazmines because his (Lazaro's) continued presence "might be used as a basis to accuse the bank of abetting a senior officer who has been implicated by a "customer" in a case of public inquiry." The dismissal was made retroactive November 30, 1996, more that [sic] a month before he was informed of his dismissal.<br><br>On April 24, 1997, petitioner Lazaro filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, non-payment of earned wages and bonus, reinstatement, backwages including moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Labor Arbiter Ruling</b><br></div><br>On 8 November 2001, Labor Arbiter (LA) Geobel Bartolabac issued a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dismissing the Complaint filed by Lazaro. The LA pointed out that absent any evidence that Lazaro was still performing the functions of a banker is tantamount to the bank's implied acceptance of his voluntary and irrevocable resignation. However, considering that he was "reasonably made to believe that his job would be given back to him by virtue of his earnest effort to recover whatever losses that respondent bank may have incurred as a result of the alleged scam,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and in view of the cessation of the bank's operation, Lazaro was awarded the following amounts:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal.<br><br>Respondent Solid Bank Corporation is, however, ordered to pay complainant Danilo H. Lazaro the following:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="60%">1.

The NLRC affirmed with modifications the Decision rendered by LA Bartolabac, by deleting the award of moral and exemplary damages, as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the two (2) appeals assailing the Decision in this case are hereby, DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>The appealed Decision is hereby, AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION by deleting the award of moral and exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>Both parties moved for the reconsideration of the April 2002 Decision, but the motions were denied by the NLRC in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> promulgated on 22 August 2002, as follows:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration filed by complainant-appellant and partial motion for reconsideration filed by respondents-appellants are denied for lack of merit.<br><br>No further motion for reconsideration shall be entertained. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>THE CA RULING</b><br></div><br>Upon appeal of Lazaro, the CA, in its 19 January 2004 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> ruled that reassignment does not sever the tie between the employer and the employee. The fact that Solidbank still exercised control over Lazaro and assigned him to tasks that was deemed necessary for the bank indicates that there was no severance of the employer-employee relationship. Nonetheless, considering the cessation of the bank's operation, the appellate court was constrained to award Lazaro separation pay, backwages and other amounts due him, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

(Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>On 3 February 2004 and 5 May 2004, Solidbank filed its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> respectively. Lazaro also filed his Motion for Clarification and/or Partial Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> on 27 January 2004.<br><br>On 1 July 2004, the appellate court issued an Amended Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> correcting the amount of separation pay, backwages and unpaid salary for December 1996, as follows:<br><blockquote>[On separation pay]<br><br>However, We agree with Solidbank's assertion that petitioner is no longer entitled to an increase in the original award for separation pay given by the NLRC considering that petitioner did not question the same in his petition. Hence, the amount of P890,383.56 shown <b>in Item No. 1 (decretal portion of our January 19, 2004 Decision)</b> representing petitioner's separation pay starting December 21, 1992 up to the promulgation of this decision is hereby <b>corrected and reverted</b> to the sum awarded by the NLRC in the total amount of <b>P431,701.12</b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[On backwages]<br><br>We hold that petitioner was illegally dismissed and is therefore entitled to backwages. However, We admit error in the computation of the same <b>(Item No. 2, decretal portion, January 19, 2004 Decision) due to inadvertence</b>. This Court multiplied his monthly salary of <b>P53,962.64</b> by <b>6 years instead of <u>43 months</u></b>, thus awarding only <b>P323,775.84</b>. To arrive at the correct amount of petitioner's backwages, we have to <b>multiply his monthly salary by 43 months, <i>viz</i>: <u>P53,962.64</u> x 43 = <u>P2,320,993.52</u> less P40,375.10 = <u><i>P2,280,018.42</i></u></b>.

The appellate court again corrected the amount of separation pay, backwages and unpaid salary for December 1996 by reviewing Lazaro's gross monthly pay, including all allowances and benefits due to him:<br><blockquote>We are taking cognizance of the oversight committed in the computation of the separation pay and backwages. However, considering that the Court cannot determine the other benefits allegedly enjoyed regularly by the petitioner to come up with his gross monthly salary, We based the gross monthly salary of petitioner in the amount of <b>P53,962.64</b> according to the submitted evidence which were not contested by the private respondent. It is also noted that petitioner never questioned the computation of his monthly salary at P53,962.64 as contained in the decisions and resolutions of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC and this Court. Hence, in Our Amended Decision dated July 1, 2004, a re-computation of the separation pay and backwages due petitioner was made.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Petitioner correctly argues that in the computation of the separation pay and backwages, the whole amount of his salaries plus benefits, bonuses and general increases to which he would have been entitled shall be included. However, the record is bereft of any evidence showing the other monthly benefits, bonuses, etc., aside from his monthly salary of P53,962.64 which is not contested by both parties.<br><br>With respect to the 150% gross monthly salary pay for every year of service as separation pay based on the Solidbank-MetroBank Merger Agreement, We believe that the petitioner is not entitled to such benefit. He did not apply for the same and he was not offered said separation benefits by the respondent bank.<br><br>The computation of the <b>separation pay should be based on the petitioner's proven monthly salary (P53,962.64) from December 21, 1992 up to the promulgation of this resolution</b> or for such additional years upon final execution. Likewise, petitioner's <b>backwages should be computed based on petitioner's proven monthly salary (P53,962.64) from the time of his illegal dismissal on November 30, 1996 up to the promulgation of this resolution</b>.

However, the Court has consistently ruled that the same must be computed only up to the time the employer ceased operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It cannot be held liable to pay separation pay beyond such closure of business because even if the illegally dismissed employees would be reinstated, they could not possibly work beyond the time of the cessation of its operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This is especially true when the closure was "due to legitimate business reasons and not merely an attempt to defeat the order of reinstatement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Considering that Solidbank ceased operations in 2000, Lazaro may then rightfully be considered as covered by the Solidbank-Metrobank Merger-Integration Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The agreement dictates that separation pay will be given to Solidbank employees not absorbed by Metrobank, with the gross monthly pay increased by 150%.<br><br>We disagree with the CA that Lazaro is not covered by the Merger-Integration Agreement because he did not apply for the same and was not offered separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The argument behooves logic, for how can Metrobank offer him the agreement when he was illegally dismissed as early as November 1996 and the merger only took place in June 2000. Following the premise that an illegal dismissal is a void dismissal, then Lazaro is still considered to have been employed until the merger took place. He may therefore be considered as not having received any offer from Metrobank to join the new company.<br><br>We thus compute Lazaro's separation pay from the time of his employment in 21 December 1992 up to the cessation of Solidbank's business in 31 July 2000 or 7.64 years, multiplied by his gross monthly pay increased by 150%.<br><br><b>b. Backwages</b><br><br>On the other hand, backwages are computed from the time of dismissal until the finality of the decision ordering separation pay, and not merely until promulgation of the Court's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> However, considering that Solidbank ceased operations in 31 July 2000, we must compute backwages only up to the time of such cessation. To compute "backwages beyond the date of the cessation of business would not only be unjust, but confiscatory, as well as violative of the Constitution depriving the employer of his property rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Using this yardstick, we therefore compute Lazaro's backwages from the time of his illegal dismissal on 21 December 1992 up to the time when Solidbank ceased operations on 31 July 2000, or 91.67 months, multiplied by his gross monthly pay earlier determined.<br><br><b><i>Damages and attorney's fees may only be awarded when the employee is illegally dismissed in bad faith and compelled to litigate to protect his rights by reason of the unjustified acts of the employer.</i></b><br><br>We have said that while "dismissal may be contrary to law but by itself alone, it does not establish bad faith to entitle the dismissed employee to moral damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> We must note that "bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence - it imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong. It means a breach of a known duty through some motive or interest or ill-will that partakes of the nature of fraud."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The award of moral and exemplary damages thus cannot be justified solely upon the premise that the employer dismissed his employee without authorized cause and due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On the matter of attorney's fees, we have established that "attorney's fees may be awarded only when the employee is illegally dismissed in bad faith and is compelled to litigate or incur expenses to protect his rights by reason of the unjustified acts of his employer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> However, "[t]here must always be a factual basis for the award of attorney's fees. This is consistent with the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>After reviewing the records, we see no evidence that Lazaro's dismissal was tainted with bad faith nor is there any basis for the award of attorney's fees. We therefore delete the award of damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>We will no longer touch upon the award of 1996 Christmas bonus and compensatory benefit as these were not appealed by both parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the 19 January 2004 Decision, 1 July 2004 Amended Decision and 14 January 2005 Resolution of the CA in CA-G.R.
