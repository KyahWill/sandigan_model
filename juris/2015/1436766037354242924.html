				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before Us are two consolidated Petitions filed under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Court, concerning <b>Service Contract No. 46 (SC-46)</b>, which allowed the exploration, development, and exploitation of petroleum resources within Tañon Strait, a narrow passage of water situated between the islands of Negros and Cebu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The Petition docketed as <b>G.R. No. 180771</b> is an original Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, <i>Mandamus</i>, and Injunction, which seeks to enjoin respondents from implementing SC-46 and to have it nullified for willful and gross violation of the 1987 Constitution and certain international and municipal laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Petition docketed as <b>G.R. No. 181527</b> is an original Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition, and <i>Mandamus</i>, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) issued by the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Region VII in connection with SC-46; to prohibit respondents from implementing SC-46; and to compel public respondents to provide petitioners access to the pertinent documents involving the Tañon Strait Oil Exploration Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>ANTECEDENT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 180771, collectively referred to as the "Resident Marine Mammals" in the petition, are the toothed whales, dolphins, porpoises, and other cetacean species, which inhabit the waters in and around the Tañon Strait. They are joined by Gloria Estenzo Ramos (Ramos) and Rose-Liza Eisma-Osorio (Eisma-Osorio) as their legal guardians and as friends (to be collectively known as "the Stewards") who allegedly empathize with, and seek the protection of, the aforementioned marine species. Also impleaded as an unwilling co-petitioner is former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, for her express declaration and undertaking in the ASEAN Charter to protect the Tañon Strait, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 181527 are the Central Visayas Fisherfolk Development Center (FIDEC), a non-stock, non-profit, non-governmental organization, established for the welfare of the marginal fisherfolk in Region VII; and Cerilo D. Engarcial (Engarcial), Ramon Yanong (Yanong) and Francisco Labid (Labid), in their personal capacities and as representatives of the subsistence fisherfolk of the municipalities of Aloguinsan and Pinamungajan, Cebu.<br><br>Named as respondents in both petitions are the late Angelo T. Reyes, as then Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE); Jose L. Atienza, as then Secretary of the DENR; Leonardo R. Sibbaluca, as then DENR-Regional Director for Region VII and Chairman of the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape Management Board; Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Ltd. (JAPEX), a company organized and existing under the laws of Japan with a Philippine branch office; and Supply Oilfield Services, Inc. (SOS), as the alleged Philippine agent of JAPEX.<br><br>In G.R. No. 181527, the following were impleaded as additional public respondents: Alan C. Arranguez (Arranguez) and Antonio Labios (Labios), in their capacities as then Director of the EMB, Region VII and then Regional Director of the DOE, Region VII, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On June 13, 2002, the Government of the Philippines, acting through the DOE, entered into a Geophysical Survey and Exploration Contract-102 (GSEC-102) with JAPEX. This contract involved geological and geophysical studies of the Tañon Strait. The studies included surface geology, sample analysis, and reprocessing of seismic and magnetic data. JAPEX, assisted by DOE, also conducted geophysical and satellite surveys, as well as oil and gas sampling in Tañon Strait.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On December 21, 2004, DOE and JAPEX formally converted GSEC-102 into SC-46 for the exploration, development, and production of petroleum resources in a block covering approximately 2,850 square kilometers offshore the Tañon Strait.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>From May 9 to 18, 2005, JAPEX conducted seismic surveys in and around the Tañon Strait. A multi-channel sub-bottom profiling covering approximately 751 kilometers was also done to determine the area's underwater composition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>JAPEX committed to drill one exploration well during the second sub-phase of the project. Since the well was to be drilled in the marine waters of Aloguinsan and Pinamungajan, where the Tañon Strait was declared a protected seascape in 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> JAPEX agreed to comply with the Environmental Impact Assessment requirements pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1586, entitled "Establishing An Environmental Impact Statement System, Including Other Environmental Management Related Measures And For Other Purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2007, the Protected Area Management Board<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Tañon Strait (PAMB-Tañon Strait) issued Resolution No. 2007-001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> wherein it adopted the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) commissioned by JAPEX, and favorably recommended the approval of JAPEX's application for an ECC.<br><br>On March 6, 2007, the EMB of DENR Region VII granted an ECC to the DOE and JAPEX for the offshore oil and gas exploration project in Tañon Strait.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Months later, on November 16, 2007, JAPEX began to drill an exploratory well, with a depth of 3,150 meters, near Pinamungajan town in the western Cebu Province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This drilling lasted until February 8, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>It was in view of the foregoing state of affairs that petitioners applied to this Court for redress, via two separate original petitions both dated December 17, 2007, wherein they commonly seek that respondents be enjoined from implementing SC-46 for, among others, violation of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>On March 31, 2008, SOS filed a Motion to Strike<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> its name as a respondent on the ground that it is not the Philippine agent of JAPEX. In support of its motion, it submitted the branch office application of JAPEX,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> wherein the latter's resident agent was clearly identified. SOS claimed that it had acted as a mere logistics contractor for JAPEX in its oil and gas exploration activities in the Philippines.<br><br>Petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards opposed SOS's motion on the ground that it was premature, it was pro-forma, and it was patently dilatory. They claimed that SOS admitted that "it is in law a (<i>sic</i>) privy to JAPEX" since it did the drilling and other exploration activities in Tañon Strait under the instructions of its principal, JAPEX. They argued that it would be premature to drop SOS as a party as JAPEX had not yet been joined in the case; and that it was "convenient" for SOS to ask the Court to simply drop its name from the parties when what it should have done was to either notify or ask JAPEX to join it in its motion to enable proper substitution. At this juncture, petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards also asked the Court to implead JAPEX Philippines as a co­respondent or as a substitute for its parent company, JAPEX.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On April 8, 2008, the Court resolved to consolidate G.R. No. 180771 and G.R. No. 181527.<br><br>On May 26, 2008, the FIDEC manifested<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> that they were adopting <i>in toto</i> the Opposition to Strike with Motion to Implead filed by petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards in G.R. No. 180771.<br><br>On June 19, 2008, public respondents filed their Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that they were not objecting to SOS's Motion to Strike as it was not JAPEX's resident agent. JAPEX during all this time, did not file any comment at all.<br><br>Thus, on February 7, 2012, this Court, in an effort to ensure that all the parties were given ample chance and opportunity to answer the issues herein, issued a Resolution directing the Court's process servicing unit to again serve the parties with a copy of the September 23, 2008 Resolution of the Court, which gave due course to the petitions in G.R. Nos. 180771 and 181527, and which required the parties to submit their respective memoranda. The February 7, 2012 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> reads as follows:<br><blockquote><b>G.R. No. 180771</b> (Resident Marine Mammals of the Protected Seascape Tañon Strait, <i>e.g.</i>, Toothed Whales, Dolphins, Porpoises and Other Cetacean Species, et al. vs. Hon.

On March 20, 2012, JAPEX Philippines, Ltd. (JAPEX PH), by way of special appearance, filed a Motion to Admit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> its Motion for Clarification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> wherein JAPEX PH requested to be clarified as to whether or not it should deem the February 7, 2012 Resolution as this Court's Order of its inclusion in the case, as it has not been impleaded. It also alleged that JAPEX PH had already stopped exploration activities in the Tañon Strait way back in 2008, rendering this case moot.<br><br>On March 22, 2012, JAPEX PH, also by special appearance, filed a Motion for Extension of Time<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to file its Memorandum. It stated that since it received the February 7, 2012 Resolution on February 23, 2012, it had until March 22, 2012 to file its Memorandum. JAPEX PH then asked for an additional thirty days, supposedly to give this Court some time to consider its Motion for Clarification.<br><br>On April 24, 2012, this Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> granting JAPEX PH's Motion to Admit its Motion for Clarification. This Court, addressing JAPEX PH's Motion for Clarification, held:<br><blockquote>With regard to its Motion for Clarification (By Special Appearance) dated March 19, 2012, this Court considers JAPEX Philippines. Ltd. as a real party-in-interest in these cases. Under Section 2, Rule 3 of the 1997 Rules of Court, a real party-in-interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Contrary to JAPEX Philippines, Ltd.'s allegation that it is a completely distinct corporation, which should not be confused with JAPEX Company, Ltd., JAPEX Philippines, Ltd. is a mere branch office, established by JAPEX Company, Ltd. for the purpose of carrying out the latter's business transactions here in the Philippines. Thus, JAPEX Philippines, Ltd., has no separate personality from its mother foreign corporation, the party impleaded in this case.<br><br>Moreover, Section 128 of the Corporation Code provides for the responsibilities and duties of a resident agent of a foreign corporation:<br><blockquote>SECTION 128. <i>Resident agent; service of process</i>. — The Securities and Exchange Commission shall require as a condition precedent to the issuance of the license to transact business in the Philippines by any foreign corporation that such corporation file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a written power of attorney designating some person who must be a resident of the Philippines, on whom any summons and other legal processes may be served in all actions or other legal proceedings against such corporation, and consenting that service upon such resident agent shall be admitted and held as valid as if served upon the duly authorized officers of the foreign corporation at its home office. Any such foreign corporation shall likewise execute and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an agreement or stipulation, executed by the proper authorities of said corporation, in form and substance as follows:<br><br>"The (name of foreign corporation) does hereby stipulate and agree, in consideration of its being granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission a license to transact business in the Philippines, that if at any time said corporation shall cease to transact business in the Philippines, or shall be without any resident agent in the Philippines on whom any summons or other legal processes may be served, then in any action or proceeding arising out of any business or transaction which occurred in the Philippines, service of any summons or other legal process may be made upon the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such service shall have the same force and effect as if made upon the duly-authorized officers of the corporation at its home office."<br><br>Whenever such service of summons or other process shall be made upon the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commission shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, transmit by mail a copy of such summons or other legal process to the corporation at its home or principal office. The sending of such copy by the Commission shall be a necessary part of and shall complete such service. All expenses incurred by the Commission for such service shall be paid in advance by the party at whose instance the service is made.<br><br>In case of a change of address of the resident agent, it shall be his or its duty to immediately notify in writing the Securities and Exchange Commission of the new address.<br></blockquote>It is clear from the foregoing provision that the function of a resident agent is to receive summons or legal processes that may be served in all actions or other legal proceedings against the foreign corporation. These cases have been prosecuted in the name of JAPEX Company, Ltd., and JAPEX Philippines Ltd., as its branch office and resident agent, had been receiving the various resolutions from this Court, as evidenced by Registry Return Cards signed by its representatives.<br></blockquote>And in the interest of justice, this Court resolved to grant JAPEX PH's motion for extension of time to file its memorandum, and was given until April 21, 2012, as prayed for, within which to comply with the submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Without filing its Memorandum, JAPEX PH, on May 14, 2012, filed a motion, asking this Court for an additional thirty days to file its Memorandum, to be counted from May 8, 2012. It justified its request by claiming that this Court's April 24, 2012 Resolution was issued past its requested deadline for filing, which was on April 21, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On June 19, 2012, this Court denied JAPEX PH's second request for additional time to file its Memorandum and dispensed with such filing.<br><br>Since petitioners had already filed their respective memoranda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and public respondents had earlier filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that they were adopting their Comment dated March 31, 2008 as their memorandum, this Court submitted the case for decision.<br><br><center><b><i>Petitioners' Allegations</i></b><br></center><br>Protesting the adverse ecological impact of JAPEX's oil exploration activities in the Tañon Strait, petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards aver that a study made after the seismic survey showed that the fish catch was reduced drastically by 50 to 70 percent. They claim that before the seismic survey, the average harvest per day would be from 15 to 20 kilos; but after the activity, the fisherfolk could only catch an average of 1 to 2 kilos a day. They attribute this "reduced fish catch" to the destruction of the "<i>payao</i>" also known as the "fish aggregating device" or "artificial reef."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards also impute the incidences of "fish kill"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> observed by some of the local fisherfolk to the seismic survey. And they further allege that the ECC obtained by private respondent JAPEX is invalid because public consultations and discussions with the affected stakeholders, a pre-requisite to the issuance of the ECC, were not held prior to the ECC's issuance.<br><br>In its separate petition, petitioner FIDEC confirms petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards' allegations of reduced fish catch and lack of public consultations or discussions with the fisherfolk and other stakeholders prior to the issuance of the ECC. Moreover, it alleges that during the seismic surveys and drilling, it was barred from entering and fishing within a 7-kilometer radius from the point where the oilrig was located, an area greater than the 1.5-kilometer radius "exclusion zone" stated in the IEE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It also agrees in the allegation that public respondents DENR and EMB abused their discretion when they issued an ECC to public respondent DOE and private respondent JAPEX without ensuring the strict compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements under the Environmental Impact Assessment system, the Fisheries Code, and their implementing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It further claims that despite several requests for copies of all the documents pertaining to the project in Taflon Strait, only copies of the PAMB-Tañon Strait Resolution and the ECC were given to the fisherfolk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><i><b>Public Respondents' Counter-Allegations</b></i><br></center><br>Public respondents, through the Solicitor General, contend that petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards have no legal standing to file the present petition; that SC-46 does not violate the 1987 Constitution and the various laws cited in the petitions; that the ECC was issued in accordance with existing laws and regulations; that public respondents may not be compelled by <i>mandamus</i> to furnish petitioners copies of all documents relating to SC-46; and that all the petitioners failed to show that they are entitled to injunctive relief. They further contend that the issues raised in these petitions have been rendered moot and academic by the fact that SC-46 had been mutually terminated by the parties thereto effective June 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>ISSUES</u></b><br></center><br>The following are the issues posited by petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards in G.R.

No. 181527, petitioner FIDEC presented the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER OR NOT SERVICE CONTRACT NO. 46 EXECUTED BETWEEN RESPONDENTS DOE AND JAPEX SHOULD BE NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE FOR BEING IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE 1987 PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION AND APPLICABLE LAWS;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE OFF-SHORE OIL EXPLORATION CONTEMPLATED UNDER SERVICE CONTRACT NO. 46 IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE WITHOUT A LAW BEING DULY PASSED EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE OIL EXPLORATION BEING CONDUCTED WITHIN THE TANON STRAIT PROTECTED SEASCAPE VIOLATES THE RIGHTS AND LEGAL PROTECTION GRANTED TO PETITIONERS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND APPLICABLE LAWS.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE (ECC) FOR SUCH AN ENVIRONMENTALLY CRITICAL PROJECT INSIDE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY CRITICAL AREA SUCH AS THE TANON STRAIT PROTECTED SEASCAPE CONFORMED TO LAW AND EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS ON THE MATTER.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENTS MAY BE COMPELLED BY MANDAMUS TO FURNISH PETITIONERS WITH COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE TANON STRAIT OIL EXPLORATION PROJECT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>In these consolidated petitions, this Court has determined that the various issues raised by the petitioners may be condensed into two primary issues:<br><ol type="I"><li>Procedural Issue: <i>Locus Standi</i> of the Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards, petitioners in G.R.

Courts have decided cases otherwise moot and academic under the following exceptions:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) There is a grave violation of the Constitution;<br><br>2) The exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved;<br><br>3) The constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and<br><br>4) The case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></div><br>In this case, despite the termination of SC-46, this Court deems it necessary to resolve these consolidated petitions as almost all of the foregoing exceptions are present in this case. Both petitioners allege that SC-46 is violative of the Constitution, the environmental and livelihood issues raised undoubtedly affect the public's interest, and the respondents' contested actions are capable of repetition.<br><br><center><b><i>Procedural Issues<br><br>Locus Standi of Petitioners Resident Marine Mammals and Stewards</i></b><br></center><br>The Resident Marine Mammals, through the Stewards, "claim" that they have the legal standing to file this action since they stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment in this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Citing <i>Oposa v.

Douglas, dissenting to the conventional thought on legal standing, opined:<br><blockquote>The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage, x x x.<br><br>Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation.

The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it. Those people who have a meaningful relation to that body of water—whether it be a fisherman, a canoeist, a zoologist, or a logger—must be able to speak for the values which the river represents and which are threatened with destruction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>The primary reason animal rights advocates and environmentalists seek to give animals and inanimate objects standing is due to the need to comply with the strict requirements in bringing a suit to court. Our own 1997 Rules of Court demand that parties to a suit be either natural or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law. It further necessitates the action to be brought in the name of the real party-in-interest, even if filed by a representative, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><center>Rule 3 <br>Parties to Civil Actions<br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Who may be parties; plaintiff and defendant</i>. - Only natural or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may be parties in a civil action. The term "plaintiff " may refer to the claiming party, the counter-claimant, the cross-claimant, or the third (fourth, etc.)-party plaintiff. The term "defendant" may refer to the original defending party, the defendant in a counterclaim, the cross-defendant, or the third (fourth, etc.)-party defendant.<br><br>Sec. 2. <i>Parties in interest</i>. - A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest.<br><br>Sec. 3. <i>Representatives as parties</i>. - Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.<br></blockquote>It had been suggested by animal rights advocates and environmentalists that not only natural and juridical persons should be given legal standing because of the difficulty for persons, who cannot show that they by themselves are real parties-in-interests, to bring actions in representation of these animals or inanimate objects. For this reason, many environmental cases have been dismissed for failure of the petitioner to show that he/she would be directly injured or affected by the outcome of the case. However, in our jurisdiction, <i>locus standi</i> in environmental cases has been given a more liberalized approach. While developments in Philippine legal theory and jurisprudence have not progressed as far as Justice Douglas's paradigm of legal standing for inanimate objects, the current trend moves towards simplification of procedures and facilitating court access in environmental cases.<br><br>Recently, the Court passed the landmark <b>Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> which allow for a "citizen suit," and permit any Filipino citizen to file an action before our courts for violations of our environmental laws:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Citizen suit</i>. - <b>Any Filipino citizen in representation of others, including minors or generations yet unborn, may file an action to enforce rights or obligations under environmental laws.</b> Upon the filing of a citizen suit, the court shall issue an order which shall contain a brief description of the cause of action and the reliefs prayed for, requiring all interested parties to manifest their interest to intervene in the case within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof. The plaintiff may publish the order once in a newspaper of a general circulation in the Philippines or furnish all affected barangays copies of said order.<br><br>Citizen suits filed under R.A. No. 8749 and R.A. No. 9003 shall be governed by their respective provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote>Explaining the rationale for this rule, the Court, in the Annotations to the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, commented:<br><blockquote><i>Citizen suit</i>. To further encourage the protection of the environment, the Rules enable litigants enforcing environmental rights to file their cases as citizen suits. This provision liberalizes standing for all cases filed enforcing environmental laws and collapses the traditional rule on personal and direct interest, <b>on the principle that humans are stewards of nature</b>. The terminology of the text reflects the doctrine first enunciated in <i>Oposa v. Factoran</i>, insofar as it refers to minors and generations yet unborn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Although this petition was filed in 2007, years before the effectivity of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, it has been consistently held that rules of procedure "may be retroactively applied to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage and will not violate any right of a person who may feel that he is adversely affected, inasmuch as there is no vested rights in rules of procedure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Elucidating on this doctrine, the Court, in <i>Systems Factors Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> held that:<br><blockquote>Remedial statutes or statutes relating to remedies or modes of procedure, which do not create new or take away vested rights, but only operate in furtherance of the remedy or confirmation of rights already existing, do not come within the legal conception of a retroactive law, or the general rule against retroactive operation of statutes. Statutes regulating the procedure of the courts will be construed as applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage. Procedural laws are retroactive in that sense and to that extent, x x x.<br></blockquote>Moreover, even before the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases became effective, this Court had already taken a permissive position on the issue of <i>locus standi</i> in environmental cases. In <i>Oposa</i>, we allowed the suit to be brought in the name of generations yet unborn "based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Furthermore, we said that the right to a balanced and healthful ecology, a right that does not even need to be stated in our Constitution as it is assumed to exist from the inception of humankind, carries with it the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In light of the foregoing, the need to give the Resident Marine Mammals legal standing has been eliminated by our Rules, which allow any Filipino citizen, as a steward of nature, to bring a suit to enforce our environmental laws. It is worth noting here that the Stewards are joined as real parties in the Petition and not just in representation of the named cetacean species. The Stewards, Ramos and Eisma-Osorio, having shown in their petition that there may be possible violations of laws concerning the habitat of the Resident Marine Mammals, are therefore declared to possess the legal standing to file this petition.<br><br><center><b><i>Impleading Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as an Unwilling Co-Petitioner</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioners Stewards in <b>G.R.

Steward Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo happens to be the incumbent President of the Philippine Islands. She is personally impleaded in this suit as an unwilling co-petitioner by reason of her express declaration and undertaking under the recently signed ASEAN Charter to protect Your Petitioners' habitat, among others. She is meantime dominated as an unwilling co-petitioner due to lack of material time in seeking her signature and imprimatur hereof and due to possible legal complications that may hereafter arise by reason of her official relations with public respondents under the alter ego principle in political law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>This is incorrect.<br><br>Section 10, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 10. <i>Unwilling co-plaintiff</i>. - If the consent of any party who should be joined as plaintiff can not be obtained, he may be made a defendant and the reason therefor shall be stated in the complaint.<br></blockquote>Under the foregoing rule, when the consent of a party who should be joined as a plaintiff cannot be obtained, he or she may be made a party defendant to the case. This will put the unwilling party under the jurisdiction of the Court, which can properly implead him or her through its processes. The unwilling party's name cannot be simply included in a petition, without his or her knowledge and consent, as such would be a denial of due process.<br><br>Moreover, the reason cited by the petitioners Stewards for including former President Macapagal-Arroyo in their petition, is not sufficient to implead her as an unwilling co-petitioner. Impleading the former President as an unwilling co-petitioner, for an act she made in the performance of the functions of her office, is contrary to the public policy against embroiling the President in suits, "to assure the exercise of Presidential duties and functions free from any hindrance or distraction, considering that being the Chief Executive of the Government is a job that, aside from requiring all of the office holder's time, also demands undivided attention."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Therefore, former President Macapagal-Arroyo cannot be impleaded as one of the petitioners in this suit.

They also insist that paragraphs 2 and 3, which refer to the grant of exclusive fishing right to Filipinos, are not applicable to SC-46 as the contract does not grant exclusive fishing rights to JAPEX nor does it otherwise impinge on the FIDEC's right to preferential use of communal marine and fishing resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the Court<br>On the legality of Service Contract No. 46 <br><i>vis-a-vis</i> Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution</i></b><br></center><br>The petitioners insist that SC-46 is null and void for having violated Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote><b>Section 2.</b> All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State.

In <i><i>La Bugal</i></i>, we held that the deletion of the words "service contracts" in the 1987 Constitution did not amount to a ban on them <i>per se</i>. In fact, in that decision, we quoted in length, portions of the deliberations of the members of the Constitutional Commission (ConCom) to show that in deliberating on paragraph 4, Section 2, Article XII, they were actually referring to service contracts as understood in the 1973 Constitution, albeit with safety measures to eliminate or minimize the abuses prevalent during the martial law regime, to wit:<br><blockquote><b><i><u>Summation of the ConCom Deliberations</u></i></b><br><br>At this point, we sum up the matters established, based on a careful reading of the ConCom deliberations, as follows:<br><br>In their deliberations on what was to become paragraph 4, the framers used the term <i>service contracts</i> in referring to <i>agreements x x x involving either technical or financial assistance</i>.<br><br>They spoke of <i>service contracts</i> as the concept was understood in the 1973 Constitution.<br><br>It was obvious from their discussions that they were not about to ban or eradicate <i>service contracts</i>.<br><br>Instead, <i>they were plainly crafting provisions to put in place safeguards that would eliminate or minimize the abuses prevalent during the marital law regime</i>. In brief, they were going to permit service contracts with foreign corporations as contractors, but with safety measures to prevent abuses, as an exception to the general norm established in the first paragraph of Section 2 of Article XII. This provision reserves or limits to Filipino citizens and corporations at least 60 percent of which is owned by such citizens — the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources.<br><br>This provision was prompted by the perceived insufficiency of Filipino capital and the felt need for foreign investments in the EDU of minerals and petroleum resources.<br><br>The framers for the most part debated about the sort of safeguards that would be considered adequate and reasonable. But some of them, having more "radical" leanings, wanted to ban service contracts altogether; for them, the provision would permit aliens to exploit and benefit from the nation's natural resources, which they felt should be reserved only for Filipinos.<br><br>In the explanation of their votes, the individual commissioners were heard by the entire body. They sounded off their individual opinions, openly enunciated their philosophies, and supported or attacked the provisions with fervor. Everyone's viewpoint was heard.<br><br>In the final voting, the Article on the National Economy and Patrimony — including paragraph 4 allowing service contracts with foreign corporations as an exception to the general norm in paragraph 1 of Section 2 of the same article — was resoundingly approved by a vote of 32 to 7, with 2 abstentions.<br><br><u><b><i>Agreements Involving Technical Or Financial Assistance Are Service Contracts with Safeguards</i></b></u><br><br>From the foregoing, we are impelled to conclude that the phrase <i>agreements involving either technical or financial assistance</i>, referred to in paragraph 4, are in fact service contracts. But unlike those of the 1973 variety, the new ones are between foreign corporations acting as contractors on the one hand; and on the other, the government as principal or "owner" of the works. In the new service contracts, the foreign contractors provide capital, technology and technical know-how, and managerial expertise in the creation and operation of large-scale mining/extractive enterprises; and the government, through its agencies (DENR, MGB), actively exercises control and supervision over the entire operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>In summarizing the matters discussed in the ConCom, <b>we established that paragraph 4, with the safeguards in place, is the exception to paragraph 1, Section 2 of Article XII</b>. The following are the safeguards this Court enumerated in <i>La Bugal</i>:<br><blockquote>Such service contracts may be entered into only with respect to minerals, petroleum and other mineral oils. The grant thereof is subject to several safeguards, among which are these requirements:<br><br>(1) The service contract shall be crafted in accordance with a general law that will set standard or uniform terms, conditions and requirements, presumably to attain a certain uniformity in provisions and avoid the possible insertion of terms disadvantageous to the country.<br><br>(2) The President shall be the signatory for the government because, supposedly before an agreement is presented to the President for signature, it will have been vetted several times over at different levels to ensure that it conforms to law and can withstand public scrutiny.<br><br>(3) Within thirty days of the executed agreement, the President shall report it to Congress to give that branch of government an opportunity to look over the agreement and interpose timely objections, if any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>Adhering to the aforementioned guidelines, this Court finds that SC-46 is indeed null and void for noncompliance with the requirements of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b><i>1. The General Law on Oil Exploration</i></b><br><br>The disposition, exploration, development, exploitation, and utilization of indigenous petroleum in the Philippines are governed by Presidential Decree No. 87 or the Oil Exploration and Development Act of 1972.

For instance, Republic Act No. 7160, more popularly known as the Local Government Code of 1991, expressly repealed a number of laws, including a specific provision in Presidential Decree No. 87, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>SECTION 534. <i>Repealing Clause</i>. — (a) Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, otherwise known as the "Local Government Code," Executive Order No. 112 (1987), and Executive Order No. 319 (1988) are hereby repealed.<br><br>(b) Presidential Decree Nos. 684, 1191, 1508 and such other decrees, orders, instructions, memoranda and issuances related to or concerning the barangay are hereby repealed.<br><br>(c) The provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 4 of Republic Act No. 1939 regarding hospital fund; Section 3, a (3) and b (2) of Republic Act No. 5447 regarding the Special Education Fund; Presidential Decree No. 144 as amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 559 and 1741; Presidential Decree No. 231 as amended; Presidential Decree No. 436 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 558; and Presidential Decree Nos. 381, 436, 464, 477, 526, 632, 752, and 1136 are hereby repealed and rendered of no force and effect.<br><br>(d) Presidential Decree No. 1594 is hereby repealed insofar as it governs locally-funded projects.<br><br>(e) The following provisions are hereby repealed or amended insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Code: Sections 2, 16 and 29 of Presidential Decree No. 704; <b>Section 12 of Presidential Decree No. 87</b>, as amended; Sections 52, 53, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74 of Presidential Decree No. 463, as amended; and Section 16 of Presidential Decree No. 972, as amended, and<br><br>(f) All general and special laws, acts, city charters, decrees, executive orders, proclamations and administrative regulations, or part or parts thereof which are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Code are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.

As we held in <i>Villareña v. The Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> "[i]mplied repeals are not lightly presumed." It is a settled rule that when laws are in conflict with one another, every effort must be exerted to reconcile them. In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Marcopper Mining Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>The two laws must be absolutely incompatible, and a clear finding thereof must surface, before the inference of implied repeal may be drawn. The rule is expressed in the maxim, <i>interpretare et concordare leqibus est optimus interpretendi, i.e.</i>, every statute must be so interpreted and brought into accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. The fundament is that the legislature should be presumed to have known the existing laws on the subject and not have enacted conflicting statutes. Hence, all doubts must be resolved against any implied repeal, and all efforts should be exerted in order to harmonize and give effect to all laws on the subject. (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Moreover, in cases where the statute seems to be in conflict with the Constitution, but a construction that it is in harmony with the Constitution is also possible, that construction should be preferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This Court, in <i>Pangandaman v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> expounding on this point, pronounced:<br><blockquote>It is a basic precept in statutory construction that a statute should be interpreted in harmony with the Constitution and that the spirit, rather than the letter of the law determines its construction; for that reason, a statute must be read according to its spirit and intent, x x x. (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Consequently, we find no merit in petitioners' contention that SC-46 is prohibited on the ground that there is no general law prescribing the standard or uniform terms, conditions, and requirements for service contracts involving oil exploration and extraction.<br><br>But note must be made at this point that while Presidential Decree No. 87 may serve as the general law upon which a service contract for petroleum exploration and extraction may be authorized, as will be discussed below, the exploitation and utilization of this energy resource in the present case may be allowed only through a law passed by Congress, since the Tañon Strait is a NIPAS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> area.<br><br><b><i>2. President was not the signatory to SC-46 and the same was not submitted to Congress</i></b><br><br>While the Court finds that Presidential Decree No. 87 is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a general law, the absence of the two other conditions, that the President be a signatory to SC-46, and that Congress be notified of such contract, renders it null and void.<br><br>As SC-46 was executed in 2004, its terms should have conformed not only to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 87, but also to those of the 1987 Constitution. The Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1306. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, <i>provided they are not contrary to law</i>, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>In <i>Heirs of San Miguel v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> this Court held that:<br><blockquote>It is basic that the law is deemed written into every contract. Although a contract is the law between the parties, the provisions of positive law which regulate contracts are deemed written therein and shall limit and govern the relations between the parties, x x x. (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Paragraph 4, Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution requires that the President himself enter into any service contract for the exploration of petroleum. SC-46 appeared to have been entered into and signed only by the DOE through its then Secretary, Vicente S. Perez, Jr., contrary to the said constitutional requirement. Moreover, public respondents have neither shown nor alleged that Congress was subsequently notified of the execution of such contract.<br><br>Public respondents' implied argument that based on the "alter ego principle," their acts are also that of then President Macapagal-Arroyo's, cannot apply in this case. In <i>Joson v. Torres</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> we explained the concept of the alter ego principle or the doctrine of qualified political agency and its limit in this wise:<br><blockquote>Under this doctrine, which recognizes the establishment of a single executive, all executive and administrative organizations are adjuncts of the Executive Department, the heads of the various executive departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive, and, <b>except in cases where the Chief Executive is required by the Constitution or law to act in person or the exigencies of the situation demand that he act personally</b>, the multifarious executive and administrative functions of the Chief Executive are performed by and through the executive departments, and the acts of the Secretaries of such departments, performed and promulgated in the regular course of business, are, unless disapproved or reprobated by the Chief Executive presumptively the acts of the Chief Executive. (Emphasis ours, citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>While the requirements in executing service contracts in paragraph 4, Section 2 of Article XII of the 1987 Constitution seem like mere formalities, they, in reality, take on a much bigger role. As we have explained in <i>La Bugal</i>, they are the safeguards put in place by the framers of the Constitution to "eliminate or minimize the abuses prevalent during the martial law regime."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, they are not just mere formalities, which will only render a contract unenforceable but not void, if not complied with. They are requirements placed, not just in an ordinary statute, but in the fundamental law, the non-observance of which will nullify the contract. Elucidating on the concept of a "constitution," this Court, in <i>Manila Prince Hotel v. Government Service Insurance System</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> held:<br><blockquote>A constitution is a system of fundamental laws for the governance and administration of a nation. It is supreme, imperious, absolute and unalterable except by the authority from which it emanates. It has been defined as <i>the fundamental and paramount law of the nation</i>. It prescribes the permanent framework of a system of government, assigns to the different departments their respective powers and duties, and establishes certain fixed principles on which government is founded. The fundamental conception in other words is that it is a supreme law to which all other laws must conform and in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered. <b>Under the doctrine of constitutional supremacy, if a law or contract violates any norm of the constitution that law or contract whether promulgated by the legislative or by the executive branch or entered into by private persons for private purposes is null and void and without any force and effect</b>. Thus, <i>since the Constitution is the fundamental, paramount and supreme law of the nation, it is deemed written in every statute and contract</i>. (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote>As this Court has held in <i>La Bugal</i>, our Constitution requires that the President himself be the signatory of service agreements with foreign-owned corporations involving the exploration, development, and utilization of our minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils. This power cannot be taken lightly.<br><br>In this case, the public respondents have failed to show that the President had any participation in SC-46. Their argument that their acts are actually the acts of then President Macapagal-Arroyo, absent proof of her disapproval, must fail as the requirement that the President herself enter into these kinds of contracts is embodied not just in any ordinary statute, but in the Constitution itself. These service contracts involving the exploitation, development, and utilization of our natural resources are of paramount interest to the present and future generations. Hence, safeguards were put in place to insure that the guidelines set by law are meticulously observed and likewise to eradicate the corruption that may easily penetrate departments and agencies by ensuring that the President has authorized or approved of these service contracts herself.<br><br>Even under the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 87, it is required that the Petroleum Board, now the DOE, obtain the President's approval for the execution of any contract under said statute, as shown in the following provision:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Execution of contract authorized in this Act</i>. - Every contract herein authorized shall, subject to the approval of the President, be executed by the Petroleum Board created in this Act, after due public notice pre-qualification and public bidding or concluded through negotiations. In case bids are requested or if requested no bid is submitted or the bids submitted are rejected by the Petroleum Board for being disadvantageous to the Government, the contract may be concluded through negotiation.<br><br>In opening contract areas and in selecting the best offer for petroleum operations, any of the following alternative procedures may be resorted to by the Petroleum Board, subject to prior approval of the President[.]<br></blockquote>Even if we were inclined to relax the requirement in <i>La Bugal</i> to harmonize the 1987 Constitution with the aforementioned provision of Presidential Decree No. 87, it must be shown that the government agency or subordinate official has been authorized by the President to enter into such service contract for the government. Otherwise, it should be at least shown that the President subsequently approved of such contract explicitly. None of these circumstances is evident in the case at bar.<br><br><center><b><u>Service Contract No. 46 <i>vis-a-vis</i> Other Laws</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 180771 claim that SC-46 violates Section 27 of Republic Act. No. 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, which bans all marine exploration and exploitation of oil and gas deposits. They also aver that Section 14 of Republic Act No. 7586 or the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992 (NIPAS Act), which allows the exploration of protected areas for the purpose of information-gathering, has been repealed by Section 27 of Republic Act No. 9147. The said petitioners further claim that SC-46 is anathema to Republic Act No. 8550 or the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998, which protects the rights of the fisherfolk in the preferential use of municipal waters, with the exception being limited only to research and survey activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The FIDEC, for its part, argues that to avail of the exceptions under Section 14 of the NIPAS Act, the gathering of information must be in accordance with a DENR-approved program, and the exploitation and utilization of energy resources must be pursuant to a general law passed by Congress expressly for that purpose. Since there is neither a DENR-approved program nor a general law passed by Congress, the seismic surveys and oil drilling operations were all done illegally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The FIDEC likewise contends that SC-46 infringes on its right to the preferential use of the communal fishing waters as it is denied free access within the prohibited zone, in violation not only of the Fisheries Code but also of the 1987 Constitutional provisions on subsistence fisherfolk and social justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Furthermore, the FIDEC believes that the provisions in Presidential Decree No. 87, which allow offshore drilling even in municipal waters, should be deemed to have been rendered inoperative by the provisions of Republic Act No. 8550 and Republic Act No. 7160, which reiterate the social justice provisions of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The public respondents invoke the rules on statutory construction and argue that Section 14 of the NIPAS Act is a more particular provision and cannot be deemed to have been repealed by the more general prohibition in Section 27 of Republic Act No. 9147. They aver that Section 14, under which SC-46 falls, should instead be regarded as an exemption to Section 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Addressing the claim of petitioners in G.R. No. 180771 that there was a violation of Section 27 of Republic Act No. 9147, the public respondents assert that what the section prohibits is the exploration of minerals, which as defined in the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, exclude energy materials such as coal, petroleum, natural gas, radioactive materials and geothermal energy. Thus, since SC-46 involves oil and gas exploration, Section 27 does not apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>The public respondents defend the validity of SC-46 and insist that it does not grant exclusive fishing rights to JAPEX; hence, it does not violate the rule on preferential use of municipal waters. Moreover, they allege that JAPEX has not banned fishing in the project area, contrary to the FIDEC's claim. The public respondents also contest the attribution of the declining fish catch to the seismic surveys and aver that the allegation is unfounded. They claim that according to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources' fish catch data, the reduced fish catch started in the 1970s due to destructive fishing practices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the Court<br>On the legality of Service Contract No. 46 <i>vis-a-vis</i> Other Laws</i></b><br></center><br>Although we have already established above that SC-46 is null and void for being violative of the 1987 Constitution, it is our duty to still rule on the legality of SC-46 <i>vis-a-vis</i> other pertinent laws, to serve as a guide for the Government when executing service contracts involving not only the Tañon Strait, but also other similar areas. While the petitioners allege that SC-46 is in violation of several laws, including international ones, their arguments focus primarily on the protected status of the Tañon Strait, thus this Court will concentrate on those laws that pertain particularly to the Tañon Strait as a protected seascape.<br><br>The Tañon Strait is a narrow passage of water bounded by the islands of Cebu in the East and Negros in the West. It harbors a rich biodiversity of marine life, including endangered species of dolphins and whales. For this reason, former President Fidel V. Ramos declared the Tañon Strait as a protected seascape in 1998 by virtue of Proclamation No. 1234 - <i>Declaring the Tañon Strait situated in the Provinces of Cebu, Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental as a Protected Area pursuant to the NIP AS Act and shall be known as Tañon Strait Protected Seascape</i>. During former President Joseph E. Estrada's time, he also constituted the Tañon Strait Commission via Executive Order No. 76 to ensure the optimum and sustained use of the resources in that area without threatening its marine life. He followed this with Executive Order No. 177,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> wherein he included the mayor of Negros Occidental Municipality/City as a member of the Tañon Strait Commission, to represent the LGUs concerned.

Consequently each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section and so as to produce a harmonious whole. It is not proper to confine the attention to the one section to be construed. It is always an unsafe way of construing a statute or contract to divide it by a process of etymological dissection, into separate words, and then apply to each, thus separated from its context, some particular definition given by lexicographers, and then reconstruct the instrument upon the basis of these definitions. An instrument must always be construed as a whole, and the particular meaning to be attached to any word or phrase is usually to be ascertained from the context, the nature of the subject treated of and the purpose or intention of the parties who executed the contract, or of the body which enacted or framed the statute or constitution, x x x.<br></blockquote><b>Surveying for energy resources under Section 14 is not an exemption from complying with the EIA requirement in Section 12; instead, Section 14 provides for <i>additional</i> requisites before any exploration for energy resources may be done in protected areas.</b><br><br>The rationale for such additional requirements are incorporated in Section 2 of the NIPAS Act, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.

This means that when the seismic surveys were done in the Tañon Strait, no such environmental impact evaluation was done. Unless seismic surveys are part of the management plan of the Tañon Strait, such surveys were dona in violation of Section 12 of the NIPAS Act and Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1586, which provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 4.</b> <i>Presidential Proclamation of Environmentally Critical Areas and Projects</i>. - The President of the Philippines may, on his own initiative or upon recommendation of the National Environmental Protection Council, by proclamation declare certain projects, undertakings or areas in the country as environmentally critical.

With court approval, animal advocacy organizations may bring suit on behalf of nonhuman animals in the same way court-appointed guardians bring suit on behalf of mentally-challenged humans who possess an enforceable right but lack the ability to enforce it themselves</i>.<br><br>In the controversial but pivotal <i>Should Trees Have Standing?</i>-<i>Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects</i>, Christopher D. Stone asserts that the environment should possess the right to seek judicial redress even though it is incapable of representing itself. While asserting the rights of speechless entities such as the environment or nonhuman animals certainly poses legitimate challenges - such as identifying the proper spokesman - the American legal system is already well-equipped with a reliable mechanism by which nonhumans may obtain standing via a judicially-established guardianship. Stone notes that other speechless - and nonhuman - entities such as corporations, states, estates, and municipalities have standing to bring suit on their own behalf. There is little reason to fear abuses under this regime as procedures for removal and substitution, avoiding conflicts of interest, and termination of a guardianship are well established.<br><br><i>In fact, the opinion in Animal Lovers suggests that such an arrangement is indeed possible. The court indicated that ALVA might have obtained standing in its own right if it had an established history of dedication to the cause of the humane treatment of animals. It noted that the Fund for Animals had standing and indicated that another more well-known advocacy organization might have had standing as well. The court further concluded thai an organization's standing is more than a derivative of its history, but history is a relevant consideration where organizations are not well-established prior to commencing legal action. ALVA was not the proper plaintiff because it could not identify previous activities demonstrating its recognized activism for and commitment to the dispute independent of its desire to pursue legal action. The court's analysis suggests that a qualified organization with a -demonstrated commitment to a cause could indeed bring suit on behalf of the speechless in the form of a court-sanctioned guardianship</i>.<br><br><i>This Comment advocates a shift in contemporary standing doctrine to empower non-profit organizations with an established history of dedication to the cause and relevant expertise to serve as official guardians ad litem on behalf of nonhuman animals interests</i>. The American legal system has numerous mechanisms for representing the rights and interests of nonhumans; any challenges inherent in extending these pre-existing mechanisms to nonhuman animals are minimal compared to an interest in the proper administration of justice. To adequately protect the statutory rights of nonhuman animals, the legal system must recognize those statutory rights independent of humans and provide a viable means of enforcement. Moreover, the idea of a guardianship for speechless plaintiffs is not new and has been urged on behalf of the natural environment. Such a model is even more compelling as applied to nonhuman animals, because they are sentient beings with the ability to feel pain and exercise rational thought. Thus, animals are qualitatively different from other legally protected nonhumans and therefore have interests deserving direct legal protection.<br><br>Furthermore, the difficulty of enforcing the statutory rights of nonhuman animals threatens the integrity of the federal statutes designed to protect them, essentially rendering them meaningless. Sensing that laws protecting nonhuman animals would be difficult to enforce, Congress provided for citizen suit provisions: the most well-known example is found in the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Such provisions are evidence of legislative intent to encourage civic participation on behalf of nonhuman animals. Our law of standing should reflect this intent and its implication that humans are suitable representatives of the natural environment, which includes nonhuman animals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>When a court allows guardianship as a basis of representation, animals are considered as similarly situated as individuals who have enforceable rights but, for a legitimate reason (e.g., cognitive disability), are unable to bring suit for themselves. They are also similar to entities that by their very nature are incapable of speaking for themselves (e.g., corporations, states, and others).<br><br>In our jurisdiction, persons and entities are recognized both in law and the Rules of Court as having standing to sue and, therefore, may be properly represented as real parties in interest. The same cannot be said about animals.<br><br>Animals play an important role in households, communities, and the environment. While we, as humans, may feel the need to nurture and protect them, we cannot go as far as saying we represent their best interests and can, therefore, speak for them before the courts. As humans, we cannot be so arrogant as to argue that we know the suffering of animals and that we know what remedy they need in the face of an injury.<br><br>Even in Hogan's discussion, she points out that in a case before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, <i>Animal Lovers Volunteer Ass'n v. Weinberger</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the court held that an emotional response to what humans perceive to be an injury inflicted on an animal is not within the "zone-of-interest" protected by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Such sympathy cannot stand independent of or as a substitute for an actual injury suffered by the claimant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The ability to represent animals was further limited in that case by the need to prove "genuine dedication" to asserting and protecting animal rights:<br><blockquote><i>What ultimately proved fatal to ALVA's claim, however, was the court's assertion that standing doctrine further required ALVA to differentiate its genuine dedication to the humane treatment of animals from the general disdain for animal cruelty shared by the public at large. In</i> doing so, the court found ALVA's asserted organizational injury to be abstract and thus relegated ALVA to the ranks of the "concerned bystander."<br><br>In fact, the opinion in <i>Animal Lovers</i> suggests that such an arrangement is indeed possible. <i>The court indicated that ALVA might have obtained standing in its own right if it had an established history of dedication to the cause of the humane treatment of animals</i>. It noted that the Fund for Animals had standing and indicated that another more well-known advocacy organization might have had standing as well. <i>The court further concluded that an organization's standing is more than a derivative of its history, but history is a relevant consideration where organizations are not well-established prior to commencing legal action</i>.

A citizen suit allows any Filipino to act as a representative of a party who has enforceable rights under environmental laws before Philippine courts, and is defined in Section 5:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. Citizen suit. - Any Filipino citizen in representation of others, including minors or generations yet unborn, may file an action to enforce rights or obligations under environmental laws. Upon the filing of a citizen suit, the court shall issue an order which shall contain a brief description of the cause of action and the reliefs prayed for, requiring all interested parties to manifest their interest to intervene in the case within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof. The plaintiff may publish the order once in a newspaper of a general circulation in the Philippines or furnish all affected barangays copies of said order.<br></blockquote><b><i>There is no valid reason in law or the practical requirements of this case to implead and feign representation on behalf of animals. To have done so betrays a very anthropocentric view of environmental advocacy. There is no way that we, humans, can claim to speak for animals let alone present that they would wish to use our court system, which is designed to ensure that humans seriously carry their responsibility including ensuring a viable ecology for themselves, which of course includes compassion for all living things.</i></b><br><br>Our rules on standing are sufficient and need not be further relaxed.<br><br>In <i>Arigo v. Swift</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> I posed the possibility of further reviewing the broad interpretation we have given to the rule on standing. While representatives are not required to establish direct injury on their part, they should only be allowed to represent after complying with the following:<br><blockquote>[I]t is imperative for them to indicate with certainty the injured parties on whose behalf they bring the suit. Furthermore, the interest of those they represent must be based upon concrete legal rights. It is not sufficient to draw out a perceived interest from a general, nebulous idea of a potential "injury."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>I reiterate my position in <i>Arigo v. Swift</i> and in <i>Paje v. Casiño</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> regarding this rule alongside the appreciation of legal stahding in <i>Oposa v. Factoran</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for environmental cases. In <i>Arigo</i>, I opined that procedural liberality, especially in cases brought by representatives, should be used with great caution:<br><blockquote><i>Perhaps it is time to revisit the ruling in Oposa v. Factoran.<br><br>That case was significant in that, at that time, there was need to call attention to environmental concerns in light of emerging international legal principles. While "intergenerational responsibility" is a noble principle, it should not be used to obtain judgments that would preclude future generations from making their own assessment based on their actual concerns. The present generation must restrain itself from assuming that it can speak best for those who will exist at a different time, under a different set of circumstances. In essence, the unbridled resort to representative suit will inevitably result in preventing future generations from protecting their own rights and pursuing their own interests and decisions. It reduces the autonomy of our children and our children's children. Even before they are born, we again restricted their ability to make their own arguments.<br><br>It is my opinion that, at best, the use of the Oposa doctrine in environmental cases should be allowed only when a) there is a clear legal basis for the representative suit; b) there are actual concerns based squarely upon an existing legal right; c) there is no possibility of any countervailing interests existing within the population represented or those that are yet to be born; and d) there is an absolute necessity for such standing because there is a threat of catastrophe so imminent that an immediate protective measure is necessary. Better still, in the light of its costs and risks, we abandon the precedent all together.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Similarly, in <i>Paje</i>:<br><blockquote>A person cannot invoke the court's jurisdiction if he or she has no right or interest to protect. He or she who invokes the court's jurisdiction must be the "owner of the right sought to be enforced." In other words, he or she must have a cause of action. An action may be dismissed on the ground of lack of cause of action if the person who instituted it is not the real party in interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The term "interest" under the Rules of Court must refer to a material interest that is not merely a curiosity about or an "interest in the question involved." The interest must be present and substantial. It is not a mere expectancy or a future, contingent interest.<br><br>A person who is not a real party in interest may institute an action if he or she is suing as representative of a real party in interest. When an action is prosecuted or defended by a representative, that representative is not and does not become the real party in interest. The person represented is deemed the real party in interest. The representative remains to be a third party to the action instituted on behalf of another.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>To sue under this rule, two elements must be present: "(a) the suit is brought on behalf of an identified party whose right has been violated, resulting in some form of damage, and (b) the representative authorized by law or the Rules of Court to represent the victim."<br><br>The Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases allows filing of a citizen's suit. A citizen's suit under this rule allows any Filipino citizen to file an action for the enforcement of environmental law on behalf of minors or generations yet unborn. It is essentially a representative suit that allows persons who are not real parties in interest to institute actions on behalf of the real party in interest.<br><br>The expansion of what constitutes "real party in interest" to include minors and generations yet unborn is a recognition of this court's ruling in <i>Oposa v. Factor</i>. This court recognized the capacity of minors (represented by their parents) to file a class suit on behalf of succeeding generations based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility to ensure the future generation's access to and enjoyment of [the] country's natural resources.<br><br>To allow citizen's suits to enforce environmental rights of others, including future generations, is dangerous for three reasons:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>, they run the risk of foreclosing arguments of others who are unable to take part in the suit, putting into, question its representativeness. <i>Second</i>, varying interests may potentially result in arguments that are bordering on political issues, the resolutions of which do not fall upon this court. <i>Third</i>, automatically allowing a class or citizen's suit on behalf of minors and generations yet unborn may result in the oversimplification of what may be a complex issue, especially in light of the impossibility of determining future generation's true interests on the matter.<br></blockquote>In citizen's suits, persons who may have no interest in the case may file suits for others. Uninterested persons will argue for the persons they represent, and the court will decide based on their evidence and arguments. Any decision by the court will be binding upon the beneficiaries, which in this case are the minors and the future generations. The court's decision will be res judicata upon them and conclusive upon the issues presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The danger in invoking <i>Oposa v. Factoran</i> to justify all kinds of environmental claims lies in its potential to diminish the value of legitimate environmental rights. Extending the application of "real party in interest" to the Resident Marine Mammals, or animals in general, through a judicial pronouncement will potentially result in allowing petitions based on mere concern rather than an actual enforcement of a right. It is impossible for animals to tell humans what their concerns are. At best, humans can only surmise the extent of injury inflicted, if there be any. Petitions invoking a right and seeking legal redress before this court cannot be a product of guesswork, and representatives have the responsibility to ensure that they bring "reasonably cogent, rational, scientific, well-founded arguments"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> on behalf of those they represent.<br><br>Creative approaches to fundamental problems should be welcome.

Resident Marine Mammals and the human petitioners have no legal standing to file any kind of petition.<br><br>However, I agree that petitioners in G.R.

In Rule 3, Section 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 9. <i>Non-joinder of necessary parties to be pleaded</i>.</b> —<br><br>Whenever in any pleading in which a claim is asserted a necessary party is not joined, the pleader shall set forth his name, if known, and shall state why he is omitted.

Petitioners should not take it upon themselves to simply implead any party who does not consent as a petitioner. This places the unwilling co-petitioner at the risk of being denied due process.<br><br>Besides, Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo cannot be a party to this suit. As a co-equal constitutional department, we cannot assume that the President needs to enforce policy directions by suing his or her alter-egos.

Besides, it opens judicial review to further subjectivity from those who spoke during the Constitutional Commission deliberations who may not have predicted how their words will be used.

The Constitution is what society relies upon even at present.<br><br>SC-46 is neither a financial assistance nor a technical assistance agreement.<br><br>Even supposing for the sake of argument that it is, it could not be declared valid in light of the standards set forth in <i>La Bugal-B'laan Tribal Association, Inc. v.

The Tañon Strait being a protected seascape under Presidential Decree No. 1234<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> requires that the exploitation and utilization of energy resources from that area are explicitly covered by a law passed by Congress specifically for that purpose, pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 7586 or the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992:<br><blockquote>SEC. 14.
