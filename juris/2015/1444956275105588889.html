				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Excise tax on petroleum products is essentially a tax on property, the direct liability for which pertains to the statutory taxpayer (<i>i.e</i>., manufacturer, producer or importer). Any excise tax paid by the statutory taxpayer on petroleum products sold to any of the entities or agencies named in Section 135 of the <i>National Internal Revenue Code </i>(NIRC) exempt from excise tax is deemed illegal or erroneous, and should be credited or refunded to the payor pursuant to Section 204 of the NIRC. This is because the exemption granted under Section 135 of the NIRC must be construed in favor of the property itself, that is, the petroleum products.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b></center><br>Before the Court is the <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i> filed by petitioner Chevron Philippines, Inc.

The Supreme Court held that the exemption from excise tax payment on petroleum products under Section 135(a) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, is conferred on international carriers who purchased the same for their use or consumption outside the Philippines.

However, the issue raised here is whether the importer (<i>i.e.</i>, Chevron) was entitled to the refund or credit of the excise taxes it paid on petroleum products sold to CDC, a tax-exempt entity under Section 135(c) of the NIRC. Notwithstanding that the claims for refund or credit of excise taxes were premised on different subsections of Section 135 of the NIRC, the basic tax principle applicable was the same in both cases - that excise tax is a tax on property; hence, the exemption from the excise tax expressly granted under Section 135 of the NIRC must be construed in favor of the petroleum products on which the excise tax was initially imposed.<br><br>Accordingly, the excise taxes that Chevron paid on its importation of petroleum products subsequently sold to CDC were illegal and erroneous, and should be credited or refunded to Chevron in accordance with Section 204 of the NIRC.<br><br>We explain.<br><br>Under Section 129<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the NIRC, as amended, excise taxes are imposed on two kinds of goods, namely: (a) goods manufactured or produced in the Philippines for domestic sales or consumption or for any other disposition; and (b) things imported. Undoubtedly, the excise tax imposed under Section 129 of the NIRC is a tax on property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>With respect to imported things, Section 131 of the NIRC declares that excise taxes on imported things shall be paid by the owner or importer to the Customs officers, conformably with the regulations of the Department of Finance and before the release of such articles from the customs house, unless the imported things are exempt from excise taxes and the person found to be in possession of the same is other than those legally entitled to such tax exemption. For this purpose, the statutory taxpayer is the importer of the things subject to excise tax.<br><br>Chevron, being the statutory taxpayer, paid the excise taxes on its importation of the petroleum products.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Section 135 of the NIRC states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 135. <b>Petroleum Products Sold to International Carriers and Exempt Entities or Agencies</b>. - Petroleum products sold to the following are exempt from excise tax:<br><br>(a) International carriers of Philippine or foreign registry on their use or consumption outside the Philippines: <i>Provided</i>, That the petroleum products sold to these international carriers shall be stored in a bonded storage tank and may be disposed of only in accordance with the rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner;<br><br>(b) Exempt entities or agencies covered by tax treaties, conventions and other international agreement for their use or consumption: <i>Provided, however,</i> That the country of said foreign international carrier or exempt entities or agencies exempts from similar taxes petroleum products sold to Philippine carriers, entities or agencies; and<br><br><b>(c) Entities which are by law exempt from direct and indirect taxes</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Pursuant to Section 135(c), <i>supra,</i> petroleum products sold to entities that are by law exempt from direct and indirect taxes are exempt from excise tax. The phrase <i>which are by law exempt from direct and indirect taxes</i> describes the entities to whom the petroleum products must be sold in order to render the exemption <i>operative</i>. Section 135(c) should thus be construed as an exemption in favor of the petroleum products on which the excise tax was levied in the first place. The exemption cannot be granted to the buyers - that is, the entities that are by law exempt from direct and indirect taxes - because they are not under any legal duty to pay the excise tax.<br><br>CDC was created to be the implementing and operating arm of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority to manage the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As a duly-registered enterprise in the CSEZ, CDC has been exempt from paying direct and indirect taxes pursuant to Section 24<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[21]</sup></font> of Republic Act No. 7916 (<i>The Special Economic Zone Act of 1995</i>), in relation to Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9400 (Amending Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the <i>Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as its liability for the payment of the excise taxes accrued immediately upon importation and prior to the removal of the petroleum products from the customshouse, Chevron was bound to pay, and actually paid such taxes. But the status of the petroleum products as exempt from the excise taxes would be confirmed only upon their sale to CDC in 2007 (or, for that matter, to any of the other entities or agencies listed in Section 135 of the NIRC). Before then, Chevron did not have any legal basis to claim the tax refund or the tax credit as to the petroleum products.<br><br>Consequently, the payment of the excise taxes by Chevron upon its importation of petroleum products was deemed illegal and erroneous upon the sale of the petroleum products to CDC. Section 204 of the NIRC explicitly allowed Chevron as the statutory taxpayer to claim the refund or the credit of the excise taxes thereby paid, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>SEC 204. <b>Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes</b>. - The Commissioner may -<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>(C) Credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and, in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund within two (2) years after payment of the tax or penalty: Provided, however, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund.</b></blockquote><br>It is noteworthy that excise taxes are considered as a kind of indirect tax, the liability for the payment of which may fall on a person other than whoever actually bears the burden of the tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Simply put, the statutory taxpayer may shift the economic burden of the excise tax payment to another - usually the buyer.<br><br>In cases involving excise tax exemptions on petroleum products under Section 135 of the NIRC, the Court has consistently held that it is the statutory taxpayer, not the party who only bears the economic burden, who is entitled to claim the tax refund or tax credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> But the Court has also made clear that this rule does not apply where the law grants the party to whom the economic burden of the tax is shifted by virtue of an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes. In which case, such party must be allowed to claim the tax refund or tax credit even if it is not considered as the statutory taxpayer under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The general rule applies here because Chevron did not pass on to CDC the excise taxes paid on the importation of the petroleum products, the latter being exempt from indirect taxes by virtue of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916, in relation to Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9400, not because Section 135(c) of the NIRC exempted CDC from the payment of excise tax.<br><br>Accordingly, conformably with Section 204(C) of the NIRC, <i>supra</i>, and pertinent jurisprudence, Chevron was entitled to the refund or credit of the excise taxes erroneously paid on the importation of the petroleum products sold to CDC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> petitioner Chevron Philippines, Inc.'s <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i>; <b>DIRECTS</b> respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue to refund the excise taxes in the amount of P6,542,400.00 paid on the petroleum products sold to Clark Development Corporation in the period from August 2007 to December 2007, or to issue a tax credit certificate of that amount to Chevron Philippines, Inc.<br><br>No pronouncement on costs of suit.<br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta</i>, and <i>Perez, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Mendoza, Perlas-Bernabe,</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.,</i> joins the dissent of J.

However, two years after, the Court reversed its April 25, 2012 Decision. Thus, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> dated February 19, 2014, the Court granted <i>Pilipinas Shell's</i> motion for reconsideration and allowed its claim for refund. In reversing its earlier Decision, the Court ratiocinated that:<br><br><blockquote>We maintain that Section 135(a), in fulfillment of international agreement and practice to exempt aviation fuel from excise tax and other impositions, prohibits the passing [on] of the excise tax to international carriers [that buy] petroleum products from local manufacturers/sellers such as respondent. However, we agree that there is a need to re[-]examine the effect of denying the domestic manufacturers/sellers' claim for refund of the excise taxes they already paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers, and its serious implications on our Government's commitment to the goals and objectives of the Chicago Convention.<br><br>The Chicago Convention, which established the legal framework for international civil aviation, did not deal comprehensively with tax matters. Article 24(a) of the Convention simply provides that fuel and lubricating oils on board an aircraft of a Contracting State, on arrival in the territory of another Contracting State and retained on board on leaving the territory of that State, shall be exempt from customs duty, inspection fees or similar national or local duties and charges. Subsequently, the exemption of airlines from national taxes and customs duties on spare parts and fuel has become a standard element of bilateral air service agreements (ASAs) between individual countries.<br><br>The importance of exemption from aviation fuel tax was underscored in the following observation made by a British author in a paper assessing the debate on using tax to control aviation emissions and the obstacles to introducing excise duty on aviation fuel, thus:<br><blockquote>Without any international agreement on taxing fuel, it is highly likely that moves to impose duty on international flights, either at a domestic or European level, would encourage 'tankering': carriers filling [fuel tanks to the limit] whenever they [land] outside the EU to avoid paying tax. Clearly, this would be entirely counterproductive. Aircraft would be travelling further than necessary to fill up in low-tax jurisdictions; in addition they would be burning up more fuel when carrying the extra weight of a full fuel tank.<br></blockquote>With the prospect of declining sales of aviation jet fuel x x x to international carriers on account of major domestic oil companies' unwillingness to shoulder the burden of excise tax, or of petroleum products being sold to said carriers by local manufacturers or sellers at still high prices, the practice of "tankering" would not be discouraged. This scenario does not augur well for the Philippines' growing economy and the booming tourism industry. Worse, our Government would be risking retaliatory action under several bilateral agreements with various countries. Evidently, construction of the tax exemption provision in question should give primary consideration to its broad implications on our commitment under international agreements.<br><br>In view of the foregoing reasons, we find merit in respondent's motion for reconsideration. We therefore hold that respondent, as the statutory taxpayer who is directly liable to pay the excise tax on its petroleum products, is entitled to a refund or credit of the excise taxes it paid for petroleum products sold to international carriers, the latter having been granted exemption from the payment of said excise tax under Sec. 135(a) of the NIRC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon close examination, I find it imperative to abandon our February 19, 2014 ruling in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><i>The NIRC does not distinguish between<br>petroleum products sold to international<br> carriers and those sold to tax-exempt <br>entities</i>.</b><br><br>To begin with, the ratiocination adopted therein applies only to international carriers under Section 135(a) of the NIRC, and not to tax-exempt entities under paragraphs (b)<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[51]</sup></font> and (c) of the same provision. Also, said ruling creates an unreasonable classification or distinction between petroleum products sold to international carriers, and those sold to tax-exempt entities, because manufacturers, sellers, and importers would be allowed to claim a tax refund or credit only under Section 135(a) of the NIRC but not under paragraphs (b) and (c) of the same provision. This is unfair considering that the NIRC does not make a distinction between them.<br><br>More important, the prospect of declining sales of aviation jet fuel sold to international carriers on account of the unwillingness of major domestic oil companies to shoulder the burden of excise tax, which in a way encourages "tankering," hinges on speculation. Neither is it a legal justification to grant manufacturers a refund or credit of the excise taxes paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers.<br><br><b><i>Granting the tax refund or credit <br>would constitute judicial legislation.</i></b><br><br>In the same vein, I cannot subscribe to petitioner's postulation that the denial of its claim would result in serious adverse consequences on the supply of fuel to tax-exempt entities under Section 135(c) of the NIRC as oil companies would be unwilling to sell petroleum products to customers operating within the special economic zone. This is not only unsubstantiated but is also not a legal ground to grant petitioner's claim for tax refund or credit. It bears stressing that tax refunds, just like tax exemptions must not rest on vague, uncertain or indefinite inference but should be granted only by a clear and unequivocal provision of law on the basis of language too plain to be mistaken, as taxes are the lifeblood of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, unless there is a clear grant of tax exemption or refund in the law, the Court cannot grant petitioner's claim for tax refund or credit as this would constitute judicial legislation, which is not allowed.<br><br><b><i>Section 135 of the NIRC is not a refund <br>provision.</i></b><br><br>Notably, Section 135 of the NIRC is not a refund provision as it does not provide for a tax refund in favor of the buyers, <i>i.e.</i>, international carriers and tax-exempt entities, and the sellers of petroleum products. Thus, there is no legal basis to grant petitioner's claim for tax refund or credit.<br><br>Besides, if the lawmakers intended to allow manufacturers, sellers, and importers to claim a refund of excise taxes paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers and tax-exempt entities under Section 135 of the NIRC, they would have expressly provided for it, just like in Section 130(D) of the same Code, which categorically allows the refund or credit of excise taxes paid on goods which are locally produced or manufactured and subsequently exported. Obviously, the absence of a tax refund provision in the NIRC in favor of these manufacturers, sellers, and importers of petroleum products only proves that the lawmakers never intended to grant such kind of refund.<br><br>In addition, since the excise taxes on the petroleum products were paid pursuant to the NIRC, in this case, Section 131 (A) of the NIRC, these cannot be considered as illegally or erroneously collected taxes. Thus, a claim for tax refund under Section 229<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the NIRC will also not prosper.<br><br><b><i>Section 135 of the NIRC is not a tax <br>exemption in favor of manufacturers,<br> sellers, and importers of petroleum <br>products.</i></b><br><br>Neither can Section 135 of the NIRC be construed as a tax exemption in favor of manufacturers, sellers, and importers, which would allow them to claim a refund or credit of the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products sold to international carriers and tax-exempt entities. In fact, a simple reading of the provision clearly shows that it is a tax exemption in favor of the buyers, the international carriers and tax-exempt entities under Section 135 of the NIRC. And as the Court in its April 25, 2012 Decision in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> has previously said, "the tax exemption being enjoyed by the buyer cannot be the basis of a claim for exemption by the manufacturer, seller, or importer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, petitioner cannot use this provision to claim an exemption from the payment of excise tax.<br><br>However, while Section 135 of the NIRC is construed as a tax exemption in favor of the buyers, we have consistently ruled that they are not entitled to a refund or credit of the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products because they are not the statutory taxpayers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> If so, how could the international carriers and the tax-exempt entities under Section 135 of the NIRC, as buyers, benefit from such exemption? The answer is simple. Section 135 of the NIRC exempts them from paying excise taxes passed on by manufacturers, sellers, and importers to buyers of petroleum products. An excise tax, as we have often said, is an indirect tax wherein the tax liability falls on one person but the burden thereof can be shifted or passed on to another person, such as the consumer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus, pursuant to Section 135 of the NIRC, manufacturers, sellers, and importers have no choice but to shoulder the burden of the excise tax as their buyers, the international carriers and the tax-exempt entities under the said provision, are exempt from paying excise tax on petroleum products.<br><br><b><i>Section 135 of the NIRC merely<br>prohibits the shifting or passing <br>on of the burden of excise tax.</i></b><br><br>As I see it then, Section 135 of the NIRC should simply be construed as prohibition on the shifting or passing on of the burden of excise tax to international carriers and tax-exempt entities, which purchase petroleum products from manufacturers, sellers, and importers. As aptly explained in the Decision dated April 25, 2012 in <i>Pilipinas Shell,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Section 135 of the NIRC merely allows international carriers or, in this case, tax-exempt entities, to purchase petroleum products without the excise tax component as an added cost in the price fixed by the manufacturers, sellers, or importers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In other words, while generally excise taxes paid by manufacturers, sellers, and importers may be shifted or passed on to their buyers, Section 135 of the NIRC provides for an exception as it prohibits manufacturers, sellers, and importers from shifting or passing on the excise taxes they paid on the petroleum products sold to international carriers and tax-exempt entities under the said provision.<br><br><b><i>The BIR Rulings and RMO cited by<br>petitioner should not override, supplant,<br>or modify the law.</i></b><br><br>As to the RMO and BIR Rulings cited by petitioner, the Court is not bound by these administrative interpretations or rulings. As we have consistently ruled, interpretations placed upon a statute by the executive officers, whose duty is to enforce it, are not conclusive and will be ignored if judicially found to be erroneous as the courts will not countenance administrative issuances that override, instead of remaining consistent and in harmony with, the law they seek to apply and implement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>All told, I find that the CTA in this case, did not err in denying petitioner's claim for tax refund or credit. To be clear, Section 135 of the NIRC, upon which petitioner anchors its claim, is not a tax refund provision nor is it a tax exemption in favor of manufacturers, sellers, and importers of petroleum products. Rather, it is a tax exemption for excise tax on petroleum products in favor of the international carriers and the tax-exempt entities under the said provision. It is a prohibition preventing manufacturers, sellers, and importers from shifting or passing on the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products they sold to their buyers, the entities enumerated in the said provision.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I submit that the doctrine laid down in the Resolution dated February 19, 2014 in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> should be abandoned.

The legal basis for exemption from excise tax on petroleum is not the same for each of the three instances enumerated in Section 135. Understandably, the discussion in <i>Pilipinas Shell </i>concerning a refund claim under Section 135(a) makes reference to a distinct historical and policy context of the tax exemption of aviation fuel for international carriers. On the other hand, Section 135(b) pertains to our government's obligations under international and bilateral agreements conditioned on reciprocal grant of exemption from similar taxes on petroleum products sold to Philippine carriers, entities or agencies.<br><br>With respect to Section 135(c), the provision merely recognizes the fiscal incentives and privileges granted by the legislature to certain entities, among which is the Clark Development Corporation (CDC), to which petitioner sold petroleum products allegedly without passing on the customs duties and excise tax previously paid by petitioner.<br><br>The Court in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> maintained that Section 135(a) prohibits the passing of the excise tax to the exempt entities and agencies that purchase petroleum products from local oil companies. This statement would be redundant under Section 135(c) which covers buyers expressly conferred exemption from both direct and indirect taxes. Moreover, unlike Section 135(b) which is based on the principle of reciprocity, Section 135(a) applies to all international carriers pursuant to the provisions of the Chicago Convention. The exemption of aviation fuel used in international flights is mainly "enshrined in the legal framework of international aviation."<br><br>Section 135(a) states that petroleum products sold to international carriers are exempt from the payment of excise tax if (a) these petroleum products sold to international carrier are bonded in a storage tank; and (b) the disposition thereof shall be in accordance with the duly promulgated rules and regulations of the Secretary of Finance. It is to be noted that under Section 130(A)(2), excise taxes on locally manufactured petroleum products are paid before removal from the place of production while excise taxes on imported petroleum products are paid before removal from customs custody. Thus, the petroleum products sold and delivered to international carriers are sourced from tax-paid inventories.<br><br>Since these petroleum products sold to international carriers are billed net of excise taxes, the question arises whether the manufacturer/importer/seller, such as petitioner oil company, is allowed to refund the excise taxes it paid.<br><br>Interpretation of our national tax laws should be geared towards fulfilling our treaty obligations and avoid consequences that will not help promote air safety and sound development of international aviation. Upon considerations of these primary goals of the Chicago Convention and the current state of the aviation industry, the Court in <i>Pilipinas Shell </i>thus found it imperative to re-examine the effect of denying the claims for refund of excise taxes paid by the local oil companies.<br><br><b><i>Factual basis of other<br>cited consequences</i></b><br><br>The reality is that excise tax is an indirect tax usually passed on to the purchaser of the petroleum products. It is reasonable to conclude that non-recovery of this cost by the manufacturers and importers of petroleum products would affect business decisions resulting in higher prices or deprioritizing aviation customers. However, the dissent dismisses this scenario as mere speculation despite the huge sum subject of the present case and similar claims for refund filed by oil companies in accordance with the rules and regulation issued by the BIR.<br><br>Parenthetically, even airline companies of the developed countries are facing financial challenges due to "very high fixed costs" of fleets of aircraft and aircraft staff salaries. Their precarious financial condition necessitated adjustments to minimize operating expenses and enable them to offer cheap budget fares to the travelling public. Such survival strategies help avert bankruptcy which will result in the loss of employment to thousands of airline personnel, inconvenience to business travelers, and negatively impact the tourism industry.<br><br>Further, "tankering," the act of carrying a full fuel tank to avoid paying the tax while travelling outside one's national territory, is not just an imagined effect cited in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i>. In the 1997 study<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> conducted by the Secretariat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the occurrence of "tankering" was already recognized. It stated that "[M]ore tankering would occur as a result of an unevenly applied fuel charge, and this might lead to an increase in CO2 emissions due to the additional weight carried by aircraft."<br><br><b><i>Claim for refund under<br>Section 135(c)</i></b><br><br>It is argued that a claim for refund of the excise taxes paid on petroleum products sold to a tax-exempt entity under Section 135(c) should be denied as there is nothing therein that provides a tax refund in favor of the buyers and the sellers of petroleum products. The dissent further points out that such provision for the refund of excise tax by manufacturers, sellers and importers of petroleum products should have been expressly included in Section 130(D) which allows refund or credit of excise taxes paid on locally produced or manufactured goods subsequently exported. And while Section 135 is construed as a tax exemption in favor of the buyers, this Court has consistently ruled that they are not entitled to a refund or credit of the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products because they are not the statutory taxpayers.<br><br>It was thus postulated that international carriers and tax exempt entities as <i>buyers</i> could not benefit from Section 135 of the NIRC considering that this Court has consistently ruled they are not entitled to a refund or credit of the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products because they are not the statutory taxpayers. The provision simply exempts them from paying the excise taxes passed on by manufacturers, sellers and importers to buyers of petroleum products.<br><br>In my humble view, such is not the correct interpretation of Section 135 as applied to the present controversy involving a tax-exempt entity under paragraph (c).<br><br>CDC was created pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 80 issued on April 3, 1993 by President Fidel V.

We thus affirmed the CTA decision granting the refund of customs duties paid on petroleum products which was passed on as part of the selling price to respondent, an enterprise registered with EPZA.<br><br><i>Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> involved petitioner's claim for refund of excise taxes passed on by Petron. One of the issues identified by the Court in the case was whether the CTA should have granted the claim for refund. In resolving the said issue, the Court ruled that the CTA erred when it disallowed petitioner's claim due to its failure to present invoices as there is nothing in CTA Circular No. 1-95 that requires its presentation. The Court also categorically stated that there is no dispute that petitioner is entitled to exemption from the payment of excise taxes by virtue of its being an EPZA-registered enterprise.<br><br>More recently, the Court in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Associated Smelting and Refining Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> resolved the issue of whether respondent, a PEZA-registered enterprise, is the proper party to claim the tax credit/refund on the excise taxes paid on the petroleum products purchased from Petron. We thus held:<br><br><blockquote>The next pivotal question then that must be resolved is whether PASAR has the legal personality to file the claim for the refund of the excise taxes passed on by Petron. The petitioner insists that PASAR is not the proper party to seek a refund of an indirect tax, such as an excise tax or Value Added Tax, because it is not the statutory taxpayer. The petitioner's argument, however, has no merit.<br><br>The rule that it is the statutory taxpayer which has the legal personality to file a claim for refund finds no applicability in this case. In <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i> the Court distinguished between the kinds of exemption enjoyed by a claimant in order to determine the propriety of a tax refund claim. "<b>If the law confers an exemption from both direct or <u>indirect taxes</u>, a claimant is entitled to a tax refund even if it only bears the economic burden of the applicable tax.</b> On the other hand, if the exemption conferred only applies to direct taxes, then the statutory taxpayer is regarded as the proper party to file the refund claim." In PASAR's case, Section 17 of P.D. No. 66, as affirmed in <i>Commissioner of Customs,</i> specifically declared that supplies, including petroleum products, whether used directly or indirectly, shall not be subject to internal revenue laws and regulations. Such exemption includes the payment of excise taxes, which was passed on to PASAR by Petron. PASAR, therefore, is the proper party to file a claim for refund.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[10]</sup></font> (Boldface in original text)</blockquote><br>A similar ruling was made in <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which held that since PAL is exempt from direct and indirect taxes under its franchise, it is endowed with the legal personality to file the subject tax refund claim, notwithstanding the fact that it is not the statutory taxpayer. The Court explained at length the basis for the rule:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Section 204(c) of the NIRC states that it is the statutory taxpayer which has the legal personality to file a claim for refund. Accordingly, in cases involving excise tax exemptions on petroleum products under Section 135 of the NIRC, the Court has consistently held that it is the statutory taxpayer who is entitled to claim a tax refund based thereon and not the party who merely bears its economic burden.<br><br>For instance, in the<i> Silkair</i> case, Silkair (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (Silkair Singapore) filed a claim for tax refund based on Section 135(b) of the NIRC as well as Article 4(2) of the Air Transport Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of Singapore. The Court denied Silkair Singapore's refund claim since the tax exemptions under both provisions were conferred on the statutory taxpayer, and not the party who merely bears its economic burden. As such, it was the Petron Corporation (the statutory taxpayer in that case) which was entitled to invoke the applicable tax exemptions and not Silkair Singapore which merely shouldered the economic burden of the tax. As explained in <i>Silkair</i>:<br><blockquote><b>The proper party to question, or seek a refund of, an indirect tax is the statutory taxpayer, the person on whom the tax is imposed by law and who paid the same even if he shifts the burden thereof to another.</b> Section 130(A)(2) of the NIRC provides that "[u]nless otherwise specifically allowed, the return shall be filed and the excise tax paid by the manufacturer or producer before removal of domestic products from place of production." Thus, Petron Corporation, not Silkair, is the statutory taxpayer which is entitled to claim a refund based on Section 135 of the NIRC of 1997 and Article 4(2) of the Air Transport Agreement between RP and Singapore.<br><br>Even if Petron Corporation passed on to Silkair the burden of the tax, the additional amount billed to Silkair for jet fuel is not a tax but part of the price which Silkair had to pay as a purchaser. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>However, the abovementioned rule should not apply to instances where the law clearly grants the party to which the economic burden of the tax is shifted an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes. In which case, the latter must be allowed to claim a tax refund even if it is not considered as the statutory taxpayer under the law. Precisely, this is the peculiar circumstance which differentiates the <i>Maceda </i>case from <i>Silkair</i>.<br><br>To elucidate, in <i>Maceda</i>, the Court upheld the National Power Corporation's (NPC) claim for a tax refund since its own charter specifically granted it an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes, viz:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he Court rules and declares that the oil companies which supply bunker fuel oil to NPC have to pay the taxes imposed upon said bunker fuel oil sold to NPC. By the very nature of indirect taxation, the economic burden of such taxation is expected to be passed on through the channels of commerce to the user or consumer of the goods sold.<b><u> Because, however, the NPC has been exempted from both direct and indirect taxation, the NPC must be held exempted from absorbing the economic burden of indirect taxation</u></b>. This means, on the one hand, that the oil companies which wish to sell to NPC absorb all or part of the economic burden of the taxes previously paid to BIR, which they could shift to NPC if NPC did not enjoy exemption from indirect taxes. This means also, on the other hand, that the NPC may refuse to pay the part of the "normal" purchase price of bunker fuel oil which represents all or part of the taxes previously paid by the oil companies to BIR. <b>If NPC nonetheless purchases such oil from the oil companies — because to do so may be more convenient and ultimately less costly for NPC than NPC itself importing and hauling and storing the oil from overseas — NPC is entitled to be reimbursed by the BIR for that part of the buying price of NPC which verifiably represents the tax already paid by the oil company-vendor to the BIR</b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Notably, the Court even discussed the <i>Maceda</i> ruling in <i>Silkair</i>, highlighting the relevance of the exemptions in NPC's charter to its claim for tax refund:<br><blockquote>Silkair nevertheless argues that it is exempt from indirect taxes because the Air Transport Agreement between RP and Singapore grants exemption "from the same customs duties, inspection fees and other duties or taxes imposed in the territory of the first Contracting Party." <b><u>It invokes <i>Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr.</i> which upheld the claim for tax credit or refund by the National Power Corporation (NPC) on the ground that the NPC is exempt even from the payment of indirect taxes</u></b>.<br><br>Silkair's argument does not persuade. In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company</i>, this Court clarified the ruling in <i>Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr., viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>It may be so that in<i> Maceda vs. Macaraig, Jr.</i>, the Court held that an exemption from "<i>all taxes</i>" granted to the National Power Corporation (NPC) under its charter includes both direct and indirect taxes. But far from providing PLDT comfort, <i>Maceda</i> in fact supports the case of herein petitioner, the correct lesson of Maceda being that an exemption from "<i>all taxes</i>" excludes indirect taxes, <b><u>unless the exempting statute, like NPC's charter, is so couched as to include indirect tax from the exemption</u></b>. Wrote the Court:<br><blockquote>x x x However, the amendment under Republic Act No. 6395 enumerated the details covered by the exemption. Subsequently, P.D. 380, made even more specific the details of the exemption of NPC to cover, among others, <b>both direct and indirect taxes</b> on all petroleum products used in its operation. Presidential Decree No. 938 [NPC's amended charter] amended the tax exemption by simplifying the same law in general terms. It succinctly exempts NPC from "all forms of taxes, duties[,] fees..."<br><br>The use of the phrase "all forms" of taxes demonstrates the intention of the law to give NPC all the tax exemptions it has been enjoying before. . .<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is evident from the provisions of P.D. No. 938 that its purpose is to maintain the tax exemption of NPC from <b><i>all forms</i></b> of taxes including indirect taxes as provided under R.A. No. 6395 and P.D. 380 if it is to attain its goals.<br></blockquote>The exemption granted under Section 135(b) of the NIRC of 1997 and Article 4(2) of the Air Transport Agreement between RP and Singapore cannot, without a clear showing of legislative intent, be construed as including indirect taxes. Statutes granting tax exemptions must be construed in<i> strictissimi juris </i>against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority, and if an exemption is found to exist, it must not be enlarged by construction. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Based on these rulings, it may be observed that<b> the propriety of a tax refund claim is hinged on the kind of exemption which forms its basis. If the law confers an exemption from both direct or indirect taxes, a claimant is (entitled to a tax refund even if it only bears the economic burden of the applicable tax</b>. On the other hand, if the exemption conferred only applies to direct taxes, then the statutory taxpayer is regarded as the proper party to file the refund claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The aforesaid statement in the dissent clearly runs counter to the previous rulings of this Court recognizing PEZA-registered enterprises, which by law are exempt from both direct and indirect taxes, as proper parties to file a claim for refund of excise taxes passed on to them by the sellers of petroleum products.<br><br><b><i>Claim for refund by manufacturers,<br>sellers or importers of petroleum products <br>sold to international carriers, international<br>agencies and other tax-exempt entities</i></b><br><br>It is evident from the dissent that its denial of the claim for refund of excise taxes filed by petitioner under Section 135(c) is essentially anchored on our pronouncement in the 2012 decision in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> which cited tie 1967 case of <i>Philippine Acetylene Co., Inc. v.

Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is a case that involved a claim over refund of excise taxes paid by Pilipinas Shell on its sales and deliveries of petroleum products to various international carriers from October 2001 to June 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In the Decision dated April 25, 2012, this court denied Pilipinas Shell's claim over tax refund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 19, 2014, this court granted Pilipinas Shell's Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In granting Pilipinas Shell's claim over tax refund, this court, through the First Division, gave primary consideration to the country's commitment under the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) and international agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>For purposes of elucidation, I quote the last few paragraphs of the <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> case:<br><br><blockquote>We maintain that Section 135 (a), in fulfillment of international agreement and practice to exempt aviation fuel from excise tax and other impositions, prohibits the passing of the excise tax to international carriers who buys [sic] petroleum products from local manufacturers/sellers such as respondent. However, we agree that there is a need to reexamine the effect of denying the domestic manufacturers/sellers' claim for refund of the excise taxes they already paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers, and its serious implications on our Government's commitment to the goals and objectives of the Chicago Convention.<br><br>The Chicago Convention, which established the legal framework for international civil aviation, did not deal comprehensively with tax matters. Article 24 (a) of the Convention simply provides that fuel and lubricating oils on board an aircraft of a Contracting State, on arrival in the territory of another Contracting State and retained on board on leaving the territory of that State, shall be exempt from customs duty, inspection fees or similar national or local duties and charges. Subsequently, the exemption of airlines from national taxes and customs duties on spare parts and fuel has become a standard element of bilateral air service agreements (ASAs) between individual countries.<br><br>The importance of exemption from aviation fuel tax was underscored in the following observation made by a British author in a paper assessing the debate on using tax to control aviation emissions and the obstacles to introducing excise duty on aviation fuel, thus:<br><blockquote>Without any international agreement on taxing fuel, it is highly likely that moves to impose duty on international flights, either at a domestic or European level, would encourage 'tankering': carriers filling their aircraft as full as possible whenever they landed outside the EU to avoid paying tax. Clearly this would be entirely counterproductive. Aircraft would be travelling further than necessary to fill up in low-tax jurisdictions; in addition they would be burning up more fuel when carrying the extra weight of a full fuel tank.</blockquote>With the prospect of declining sales of aviation jet fuel sales to international carriers on account of major domestic oil companies' unwillingness to shoulder the burden of excise tax, or of petroleum products being sold to said carriers by local manufacturers or sellers at still high prices, the practice of "tankering" would not be discouraged. This scenario does not augur well for the Philippines' growing economy and the booming tourism industry. Worse, our Government would be risking retaliatory action under several bilateral agreements with various countries. Evidently, construction of the tax exemption provision in question should give primary consideration to its broad implications on our commitment under international agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>However, the ruling in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> is not applicable because that case involved the sale of petroleum products to international carriers. Also, the ruling in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> should be abandoned because it provides an interpretation that is not within the text of the law.<br><br>Similar to the <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> case, this case involves a claim over refund of excise taxes paid on petroleum products sold to a tax-exempt entity, Clark Development Corporation. Section 135(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 provides that entities exempt from paying excise taxes include entities that are exempt from paying direct and indirect taxes.<br><br>However, a close reading of <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> reveals that the binding force of its ruling depended on assumed effects—potential violations of our commitment under international air treaty agreements and potential harm to our economy—which may be relevant only to a particular buyer, i.e., an international carrier. The same assumed scenario cannot apply to an entity like Clark Development Corporation, a government-owned and controlled corporation that is exempt by law from direct and indirect taxes.<br><br>In its February 19, 2014 Resolution of the <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> case, this court, through the First Division, maintained its interpretation of Section 1135(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 as an excise tax exemption in favor of international carriers, such that international carriers are allowed to purchase petroleum products from the manufacturers or sellers net of the excise tax. Yet, this court conceded that the same provision could be used as basis for allowing the manufacturers' claim over refund of excise taxes previously paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers in view of the probable pernicious effects of denying their refund claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>I dissent from the majority and vote to deny Chevron's claim over tax refund. It is my opinion that the rule in <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> should be abandoned. <br><br>A denial of Pilipinas Shell's, or any other manufacturer's, claim over refund does not violate any treaty obligations we have with other countries. Section 135(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 effectively satisfies our treaty obligations in our bilateral air service agreements with other countries, as it actually prohibits the local manufacturers from passing on the excise tax to international carriers.<br><br>Further, the obligation of local manufacturers not to shift the burden of the excise tax to international carriers was recognized in Presidential Decree No. 1359, a precursor to the present tax code, which grants foreign international carriers tax exemption on fuel used in international trade and travel:<br><br><blockquote><center>PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1359<br><br>AMENDING SECTION 134 OF THE NATIONAL INTERNAL<br>REVENUE CODE OF 1977.<br></center><br>WHEREAS, under the present law oil products sold to international carriers are subject to the specific tax;<br><br>WHEREAS, some countries allow the sale of petroleum products to Philippine Carriers without payment of taxes thereon;<br><br>WHEREAS, to foster goodwill and better relationship with foreign countries, there is a need to grant similar tax exemption <b><i>in favor of foreign international carriers</i></b>;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>SECTION 1.

There is no international convention or treaty agreement compelling us to grant tax exemptions to local manufacturers.<br><br>In my opinion, the principles pronounced in <i>Philippine Acetylene Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and <i>Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the same cases cited in the precedent <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> are still relevant with regard to the local manufacturers' or importers' claim over excise tax exemption on petroleum products sold to international carriers and exempt entities.<br><br><i>Philippine Acetylene</i> held that the sales tax must be paid by the manufacturer even though the sale is made to tax-exempt entities like the National Power Corporation, an agency of the Philippine government, and the Voice of America, an agency of the United States government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Like the percentage tax on sales, the excise tax on petroleum products is a direct liability of the manufacturer or producer or importer. Applying the same principle in this case, it is my opinion that Chevron cannot claim exemption from the payment of excise taxes using Clark Development Corporation's tax-free privilege to buy petroleum products under Section 135(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.<br><br>In <i>Maceda</i>, petitioner questioned the legality of the tax refund to National Power Corporation by way of tax credit certificates and the use of the said assigned tax credits by oil companies to pay for their tax and duty liabilities to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This court dismissed Maceda's Petition and upheld the tax refunds granted to National Power Corporation, ruling that under the prevailing laws then, the National Power Corporation enjoyed indirect tax and duty exemption on its local purchases of petroleum products.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On Motion for Reconsideration by petitioner, this court maintained its ruling that the tax exemption privilege of the National Power Corporation included both direct and indirect taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This court further held that the oil companies had to absorb all or part of the economic burden of the taxes previously paid on bunker fuel oils they sold to the National Power Corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>This much was conceded in the precedent <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> case when it maintained that "Section 135 (a)... prohibits the passing of the excise tax to international carriers who buys [sic] petroleum products from local manufacturers/sellers[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> However, this court arrived at a different conclusion after taking into consideration the "effect of denying the domestic manufacturers/sellers' claim for refund of the excise taxes they already paid on petroleum products sold to international carriers, and its serious implications on our Government's commitment to the goals and objectives of the Chicago Convention."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>It is premature and purely speculative to say that to deny the domestic manufacturers or sellers their refund claims would result in a cessation in the supply of fuel oils to international carriers or an increase in oil prices and in "tankering."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> These assumed effects may or may not happen, and it was inappropriate for this court then to overturn its first ruling based on these assumptions. Indeed, such argument is a consideration that should be addressed to the legislature and not to the courts that are not authorized to view laws from the standpoint of their results. Since there is no ambiguity or vagueness in the law, its plain provisions should be applied coupled with the principle that tax refunds, as in tax exemptions, must be clearly provided by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Under Section 129<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, excise taxes are imposed on two (2) kinds of goods, namely: (a) goods manufactured or produced in the Philippines for domestic sales or consumption or for any other disposition; and (b) things imported. Section 148<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[25]</sup></font> of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 expressly subjects the petroleum products to an excise tax, which shall attach to the goods as soon as they are in existence as such.<br><br>In <i>La Suerte Cigar &amp; Cigarette Factory v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this court discussed the nature of excise tax:<br><br><blockquote>Excise tax is a tax on the production, sale, or consumption of a specific commodity in a country. . . . "It does not matter to what use the article[s] subject to tax is put; the excise taxes are still due, even though the articles are removed merely for storage in some other place and are not actually sold or consumed." The excise tax based on weight, volume capacity or any other physical unit of measurement is referred to as "specific tax." If based on selling price or other specified value, it is referred to as "ad valorem" tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The excise tax on locally manufactured petroleum products is a liability of the manufacturer or producer and accrues upon removal thereof from the place of production.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, the excise tax on imported petroleum products is a liability of the importer or owner and accrues upon withdrawal of the goods from the customhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The specific provision of law that allows tax credit or tax refund of the excise taxes paid is Section 130(D) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 130. Filing of Return and Payment of Excise Tax on Domestic Products. -<br><br>(D) Credit for Excise Tax on Goods Actually Exported. - When goods locally produced or manufactured are removed and actually exported without returning to the Philippines, whether so exported in their original state or as ingredients or parts of any manufactured goods or products, any excise tax paid thereon shall be credited or refunded upon submission of the proof of actual exportation and upon receipt of the corresponding foreign exchange payment: Provided, That the excise tax on mineral products, except coal and coke, imposed under Section 151 shall not be creditable or refundable even if the mineral products are actually exported.</blockquote><br>Excise taxes on petroleum products are indirect taxes by nature because the tax-paying manufacturer or importer can shift the burden of the tax to the buyer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is in this context that the tax exemption provision in Section 135 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 should be understood. In other words, Section 135(a) and (c) should be interpreted to mean that the excise tax paid by manufacturers or importers cannot be shifted to international carriers and exempt entities as buyers of petroleum products. Had the legislature intended to grant the tax exemption in favor of manufacturers or importers, it should have been expressly declared as in the case of locally manufactured products that were intended for exportation.<br><br>Majority of the members of this court may believe in the wisdom and prudence of granting the tax exemption to the manufacturers or importers of petroleum products on the basis of Sections 135 and 204 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> But such belief, however well-meaning and sincere, cannot bestow upon this court the power to change or amend the law. This court's power and function are limited merely to applying the law objectively. It cannot indulge in expansive construction to suit its sympathies and appreciations. Otherwise, it would be exceeding its role and invading the realm of legislation.<br><br>This court has always applied the principle that exemptions from taxation are strictly construed and are never presumed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> or created by implication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, for a tax exemption to exist, it must be so categorically declared in words that admit of no doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The reason why tax exemptions are strictly construed has been explained as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the State and must therefore not be lightly granted or inferred. When claimed, it must be strictly construed against the taxpayer, who must prove that he comes under the exemption rather than [the] rule that every one [sic] must contribute his just share in the maintenance of the government.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[35]</sup></font><br></blockquote><br>I am aware of a number of cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> involving claims over refund of excise tax paid on petroleum products where the tax was either paid by the international carriers themselves or incorporated into the selling price of the petroleum products sold to them. This court has held that it is the statutory taxpayer who is entitled to claim a tax refund based on Section 135 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 and not the international carrier that merely bears its economic burden. Those cases, however, did not deal squarely with the issue on whether a manufacturer or importer is exempt from the payment of excise tax on petroleum products it sold to international carriers or exempt entities.<br><br>Nevertheless, in <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this court pronounced that:<br><br><blockquote>[W]here the law clearly grants the party to which the economic burden of the tax is shifted an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes[,] the latter must be allowed to claim a tax refund even if it is not considered as the statutory taxpayer under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>The difference between <i>Maceda</i> and <i>Silkair</i> was also discussed in <i>Philippine Airlines</i>, and the doctrines in these cases were synthesized as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Based on these rulings [referring to <i>Maceda</i> and <i>Silkair</i>], it may be observed that the propriety of a tax refund claim is hinged on the kind of exemption which forms its basis. If the law confers an exemption from both direct or indirect taxes, a claimant is entitled to a tax refund even if it only bears the economic burden of the applicable tax. On the other hand, if the exemption conferred only applies to direct taxes, then the statutory taxpayer is regarded as the proper party to file the refund claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>Restating the rule in <i>Philippine Airlines</i>, if Chevron, the statutory taxpayer, passed on the tax burden to Clark Development Corporation, an entity exempt from direct and indirect taxes, then it is clear that Clark Development Corporation is the proper party to claim for tax refund.<br><br>Thus, I dissent from the majority and vote that the claim over tax refund of Chevron should be denied. In this case, tax exemption is granted by law to Clark Development Corporation and not to Chevron. This court should not perpetuate an erroneous construction of the law by blindly adhering to precedent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Our duty to uphold the rule of law requires that we reject what appears as <i>stare decisis</i>.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
