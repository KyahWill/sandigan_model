Celzo as evidenced by a report (Exh. “4”) submitted for the purpose.&nbsp; Moreover, a verification plan (Exh. “7”) approved by the DENR was likewise prepared in connection with the verification survey.&nbsp; He even personally went to the sala of Judge Mangay and verified from the then Deputy Branch Clerk of Court, the authenticity of the transcript that was given to him which the said Branch Clerk of Court confirmed as having been issued by said court.&nbsp; He did not however go over the petition filed by Felisa Bonifacio since what was important was that the title was issued in the land registration proceedings.&nbsp; He knew that Felisa was not in possession of the said property as it was being occupied by business establishments who were all not owners of the lot.&nbsp; As to payments of realty taxes due on the property, he claims that the title would not have been issued in the first place [and] the taxes [would] not [have] been previously paid.&nbsp; Insofar as VSD is concerned, the corporation was up-to-date in its payment of realty taxes over their property.&nbsp; He stresses that there is no other owner of the lot in question except Felisa Bonifacio because there was only one (1) lot with that technical description.&nbsp; The said approved technical description appearing on Felisa’s lot was issued by the DENR which is actually the custodian of the technical descriptions of lands under the Land Registration System, which was confirmed by Mr. Elpidio T. de Lara, complainants’ witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Macaro’s testimony was not included in the foregoing précis of respondents’ evidence by RTC-Branch 126.&nbsp; Macaro affirmed before RTC-Branch 126 the existence of respondent Bonifacio’s TCT No. 265778.&nbsp; Macaro further testified that the standard operating procedure at the Caloocan City Registry of Deeds was to require the presentation of the certification stating that the court order directing issuance of the certificate of title had already become final and executory, before actually issuing said certificate of title; but he was unable to explain how in this case respondent Bonifacio’s TCT No. 265778 was issued on March 29, 1993, before the Certificate of Finality of the Order dated October 8, 1992 in Civil Case No. C-3288 was issued by RTC-Branch 125 on April 6, 1993.<br><br>On January 9, 1998, RTC-Branch 126 rendered its Decision in Civil Case No. C-366, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Dismissing the petition of the petitioners;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Declaring that the technical description described in TCT No. 108530 by the petitioners is not the same as the technical description on [respondent] Bonifacio’s title (TCT No. 265778, now TCT No. 285313);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Declaring that TCT No. 265778 is a valid title and considering that respondent VSD’s title, T-285313, replaced the former title, VSD is hereby declared the owner of the land in question, that is, Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B of PSD 706;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">For petitioners to pay attorney’s fees and the costs of this suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>Comparing the technical descriptions in petitioners’ TCT No. T-108530 and respondents’ TCT Nos. 265778 and 285313, RTC-Branch 126 noted the bare differences in the land areas and lot numbers contained therein, and concluded that said technical descriptions were not one and the same and that petitioners’ TCT No. T-108530 did not pertain to the same parcel of land described in respondent Bonifacio’s TCT No. 265778.&nbsp; RTC-Branch 126 also pointed out that petitioners’ own witness, Engr.

It is when the object of the action or proceeding is to nullify the title, and thus challenge the judgment pursuant to which the title was decreed.&nbsp; <b>The attack is direct when the object of an action or proceeding is to annul or set aside such judgment, or enjoin its enforcement.&nbsp; On the other hand, the attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment is nevertheless made as an incident thereof.</b> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>The instituted action in this case is clearly a direct attack on a certificate of title to real property.<br><br>In their complaint for quieting of title, petitioners specifically pray for the declaration of nullity and/or cancellation of respondents’ TCT Nos. 265778 and 285313 over the subject land.&nbsp; The relief sought by petitioners is certainly feasible since the objective of an action to quiet title, as provided under Article 476 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, is precisely to quiet, remove, invalidate, annul, and/or nullify “a cloud on title to real property or any interest therein by reason of any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or effective but is in truth and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable, and may be prejudicial to said title.”<br><br>The Court also finds bereft of merit the contentions that petitioners’ action to quiet title had already prescribed and/or that the titles of respondents over the subject land have already become incontrovertible and indefeasible based on Section 32 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br>Section 32 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 32. <i>Review of decree of registration; Innocent purchaser for value.</i> - The decree of registration shall not be reopened or revised by reason of absence, minority, or other disability of any person adversely affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments, subject, however, to the right of any person, including the government and the branches thereof, deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein by such adjudication or confirmation of title obtained by actual fraud, to file in the proper Court of First Instance a petition for reopening and review of the decree of registration <b>not later than one year from and after the date of the entry of such decree of registration</b>, but in no case shall such petition be entertained by the court where an innocent purchaser for value has acquired the land or an interest therein, whose rights may be prejudiced.&nbsp; Whenever the phrase “innocent purchaser for value” or an equivalent phrase occurs in this Decree, it shall be deemed to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee, or other encumbrancer for value.<br><br><b>Upon the expiration of said period of one year, the decree of registration and the certificate of title issued shall become incontrovertible.</b>&nbsp; Any person aggrieved by such decree of registration in any case may pursue his remedy by action for damages against the applicant or any other persons responsible for the fraud. (Emphases added.)<br></blockquote><br>The above-quoted rule has well-settled exceptions.<br><br>It is an established doctrine in land ownership disputes that the filing of an action to quiet title is imprescriptible if the disputed real property is in the possession of the plaintiff.&nbsp; One who is in actual possession of a piece of land claiming to be owner thereof may wait until his possession is disturbed or his title is attacked before taking steps to vindicate his right, the reason for the rule being that his undisturbed possession gives him a continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to ascertain and determine the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and its effect on his own title, which right can be claimed only by one who is in possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners have duly established during the trial that they and/or their predecessors-in-interest have been in uninterrupted possession of the subject land since 1926 and that it was only in 1994 when they found out that respondent Bonifacio was able to register the said property in her name in another title.&nbsp; It was also only in 1995 when petitioners learned that respondent Bonifacio was able to sell and transfer her title over the subject land in favor of respondent VSD Realty.<br><br>Moreover, the rule on the incontrovertibility or indefeasibility of title has no application in this case given the fact that the contending parties claim ownership over the subject land based on their respective certificates of title thereon which originated from different sources.&nbsp; Certainly, there cannot be two or even several certificates of title on the same parcel of real property because “a land registration court has no jurisdiction to order the registration of land already decreed in the name of another in an earlier land registration case” and “a second decree for the same land would be null and void, since the principle behind original registration is to register a parcel of land only once.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; The indefeasibility of a title under the Torrens system could be claimed only if a previous valid title to the same parcel of land does not exist.&nbsp; Where the issuance of the title was attended by fraud, the same cannot vest in the titled owner any valid legal title to the land covered by it; and the person in whose name the title was issued cannot transmit the same, for he has no true title thereto.&nbsp; This ruling is a mere affirmation of the recognized principle that a certificate is not conclusive evidence of title if it is shown that the same land had already been registered and that an earlier certificate for the same land is in existence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, petitioners’ filing of an action to quiet title over the subject land is in order.<br><br><b><i>On the propriety of remanding this <br>case for further proceedings before the <br>Court of Appeals.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>In <i>VSD Realty &amp; Development Corporation v.

CLT Realty Development Corporation</i>, in the interest of justice, and to safeguard the correct titling of properties, a remand is proper to determine which of the parties derived valid title from the legitimate OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917.&nbsp; Since this Court is not a trier of facts and not capacitated to appreciate evidence of the first instance, the Court may remand this case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings,</b> as it has been similarly tasked in <i>Manotok Realty, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corporation</i> on these bases:<br><blockquote>Under Section 6 of Rule 46, which is applicable to original cases for <i>certiorari,</i> the Court may, whenever necessary to resolve factual issues, delegate the reception of the evidence on such issues to any of its members or to an appropriate court, agency or office.&nbsp; The delegate need not be the body that rendered the assailed decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals generally has the authority to review findings of fact.&nbsp; Its conclusions as to findings of fact are generally accorded great respect by this Court.&nbsp; It is a body that is fully capacitated and has a surfeit of experience in appreciating factual matters, including documentary evidence.<br><br>In fact, the Court had actually resorted to referring a factual matter pending before it to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In <i>Republic v.

The Court of Appeals therein received the evidence of the parties and rendered a “Commissioner’s Report” shortly thereafter.&nbsp; Thus, resort to the Court of Appeals is not a deviant procedure.<br><br>The provisions of Rule 32 should also be considered as governing the grant of authority to the Court of Appeals to receive evidence in the present case.&nbsp; Under Section 2, Rule 32 of the Rules of Court, a court may, <i>motu proprio</i>, direct a reference to a commissioner when a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, arises upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of a case, or for carrying a judgment or order into effect.&nbsp;

petitioners’ title, which the latter submitted during the trial, shows that it originated from OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917, thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is further certified that said land was originally registered on the <b>3<sup>rd</sup> day of <u>May</u>, in the year nineteen hundred and <u>seventeen</u></b>, in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of <u>Rizal</u>, Volume <u>A-9</u>, page <u>226</u>, as Original Certificate of Title No. <u>994</u>, pursuant to Decree No. <u>36455</u>, issued in L.R.C. ___ Record No. <u>4429</u>.<br><br>This certificate is a transfer from <u>Transfer</u> Certificate of Title No. <u>4856/T-25</u>, which is cancelled by virtue hereof in so far as the above-described land is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis added.)<br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, the title of respondent Bonifacio, the one presented during the trial, shows that it likewise originated from OCT No. 994, but such mother title states only the day and the year of its original registration as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is further certified that said land was originally registered on the <b>19<sup>th</sup> day of ___, in the year nineteen hundred and twelve</b>, in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of <u>Manila</u>, Volume ___, Page ___, as Original Certificate of Title No. 994, pursuant to Decree No. 36455 issued in L.R.C. ___, Record No. <u>4423</u>, in the name of ___.<br><br>This certificate is a transfer from Original Certificate of Title No. <u>994</u>, which is cancelled by virtue hereof in so far as the above-described land is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Curiously, the title of respondent VSD Realty is supposed to be a direct transfer from the title of respondent Bonifacio, yet, the certification as to the original registration of its mother title – OCT No. 994 – provides the registration date of <b>May 3, 1917</b>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>IT IS FURTHER CERTIFIED that said land was originally registered on the <b><u>3<sup>rd</sup></u></b> day of <b><u>May</u></b>, in the year <b>nineteen hundred and <u>seventeen</u></b> in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal, Volume <u>A-9-A</u>, Page <u>226</u>, as Original Certificate of Title No. 994, pursuant to Decree No. <u>36455</u> issued in L.R.C. ___ Record No. <u>4429</u> in the name of ___.<br><br><b>This certificate is a transfer from Transfer Certificate of Title No. <u>265778/T-1325</u> which is cancelled by virtue hereof in so far as the above-described land is concerned.</b><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Entered at <u>the City of Kalookan</u>, Philippines, on the <u>12<sup>th</sup></u> day of <u>September</u> in the year nineteen hundred and <u>ninety-four</u> at <u>1:23 p.m.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphases added.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>Furthermore, a certified true copy of respondent Bonifacio’s title, which petitioners have obtained just prior to the filing of the Petition at bar and attached to their Reply dated December 12, 2001, now shows that the date of the original registration of respondent Bonifacio’s mother title - OCT No. 994 - has changed from the 19th day of an unspecified month<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> in 1912 to May 3, 1917, and the place of registration from Manila to Rizal.&nbsp;

Court of Appeals</i> and <i>Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals</i> had already been rendered <i>functus officio,</i> thus, these cases can no longer be cited as precedents.</b>&nbsp; The Court expounded as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is important to emphasize at this point that in the recent case resolved by this Court <i>En Banc</i> in 2007, entitled <i>Manotok Realty, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corporation</i> (the 2007 <i>Manotok case</i>), as well as the succeeding resolution in the same case dated March 31, 2009 (the 2009 <i>Manotok</i> case), the controversy surrounding the Maysilo Estate and the question of the existence of another OCT No. 994 have been finally laid to rest.&nbsp; All other cases involving said estate and OCT No. 994, such as the case at bar, are bound by the findings and conclusions set forth in said resolutions.<br><br>As stated earlier, petitioner anchors her claim on previous cases decided by this Court which have held that there are two existing OCT No. 994, dated differently, and the one from which she and her co-plaintiffs (in Civil Case No. C-424) derived their rights was dated earlier, hence, was the superior title.&nbsp; Regrettably, petitioner’s claim no longer has a leg to stand on.&nbsp; As we held in the 2007 <i>Manotok</i> case:<br><blockquote>The determinative test to resolve whether the prior decision of this Court should be affirmed or set aside is whether or not the titles invoked by the respondents are valid.&nbsp; If these titles are sourced from the so-called OCT No. 994 dated 17 April 1917, then such titles are void or otherwise should not be recognized by this Court.&nbsp; Since the true basic factual predicate concerning OCT No. 994 which is that there is only one such OCT differs from that expressed in the <i>MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i> decisions, said rulings have become virtually <i>functus officio</i> except on the basis of the “law of the case” doctrine, and can no longer be relied upon as precedents.</blockquote>Specifically, petitioner cannot anymore insist that OCT No. 994 allegedly issued on April 19, 1917 validly and actually exists, given the following conclusions made by this Court in the 2007 <i>Manotok </i>case:<br><blockquote><b>First, there is only one OCT No. 994.&nbsp; As it appears on the record, that mother title was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917, and that should be the date which should be reckoned as the date of registration of the title.&nbsp; It may also be acknowledged, as appears on the title, that OCT No. 994 resulted from the issuance of the decree of registration on [19] April 1917, although such date cannot be considered as the date of the title or the date when the title took effect.<br><br>Second.&nbsp; Any title that traces its source to OCT No. 994 dated [19] April 1917 is void, for such mother title is inexistent.&nbsp; The fact that the Dimson and CLT titles made specific reference to an OCT No. 994 dated [19] April 1917 casts doubt on the validity of such titles since they refer to an inexistent OCT. x x x.<br><br>Third.&nbsp; The decisions of this Court in <i>MWSS v. Court of Appeals</i> and<i> Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals</i> cannot apply to the cases at bar, especially in regard to their recognition of an OCT No. 994 dated 19 April 1917, a title which we now acknowledge as inexistent.&nbsp; Neither could the conclusions in<i> MWSS</i> or<i> Gonzaga </i>with respect to an OCT No. 994 dated 19 April 1917 bind any other case operating under the factual setting the same as or similar to that at bar.</b></blockquote>To be sure, this Court did not merely rely on the DOJ and Senate reports regarding OCT No. 994.&nbsp; In the 2007 <i>Manotok</i> case, this Court constituted a Special Division of the Court of Appeals to hear the cases on remand, declaring as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Since this Court is not a trier of fact[s], we are not prepared to adopt the findings made by the DOJ and the Senate, or even consider whether these are admissible as evidence, though such questions may be considered by the Court of Appeals upon the initiative of the parties. x x x. The reports cannot conclusively supersede or overturn judicial decisions, but if admissible they may be taken into account as evidence on the same level as the other pieces of evidence submitted by the parties.&nbsp; The fact that they were rendered by the DOJ and the Senate should not, in itself, persuade the courts to accept them without inquiry.&nbsp; The facts and arguments presented in the reports must still undergo judicial scrutiny and analysis, and certainly the courts will have the discretion to accept or reject them.<br><br>There are many factual questions looming over the properties that could only be threshed out in the remand to the Court of Appeals. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Special Division is tasked to hear and receive evidence, conclude the proceedings and submit to this Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within three (3) months from finality of this Resolution.</blockquote><br>Thus, in the 2009 <i>Manotok</i> case, this Court evaluated the evidence engaged in by said Special Division, and adopted the latter’s conclusions as to the status of the original title and its subsequent conveyances.&nbsp; <b>This case affirmed the earlier finding that “there is only one OCT No. 994, the registration date of which had already been decisively settled as 3 May 1917 and not 19 April 1917” and categorically concluded that “OCT No. 994 which reflects the date of 19 April 1917 as its registration date is null and void.</b>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphases added.)</blockquote><br>In <i>Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation v. Bonifacio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this Court upheld the validity of the titles to a portion of land which originally formed part of the Maysilo Estate which were sourced from OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917, and declared as null and void a title purportedly overlapping the said land which traced its roots from OCT No. 994 registered on April 19, 1917.&nbsp; The Court found that it was physically impossible for Eleuteria Rivera, the person whom respondent Bonifacio claims to be her predecessor-in-interest, to be an heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal because it would turn out that Eleuteria Rivera was older than her alleged grandmother Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Eventually, on March 31, 2009, the Supreme Court issued a Resolution reversing its Decision of November 29, 2005 and declaring certain titles in the names of Araneta and Manotok valid.&nbsp; In the course of discussing the flaws of Jose Dimson’s title based on his alleged 25% share in the hereditary rights of Bartolome Rivera, Eleuteria Rivera’s co-petitioner in LRC No. 4557, the Court noted:<br><br><blockquote>. . . However, the records of these cases would somehow negate the rights of Rivera to claim from Vidal.&nbsp; The Verification Report of the Land Registration Commission dated 3 August 1981 showed that Rivera was 65 years old on 17 May 1963 (as gathered from the records of Civil Case Nos. 4429 and 4496).&nbsp; It can thus be deduced that, if Rivera was already 65 years old in 1963, then he must have been born around 1898.&nbsp; <b>On the other hand, Vidal was only nine (9) years in 1912; hence, she could have been born only on [1903].</b>&nbsp; This alone creates an unexplained anomalous, if not ridiculous, situation wherein Vidal, Rivera’s alleged Grandmother, was seven (7) years younger than her alleged grandson.&nbsp; Serious doubts existed as to whether Rivera was in fact an heir of Vidal, for him to claim a share in the disputed portions of the Maysilo Estate.<br></blockquote><br>The same is true in this case.&nbsp; <b>The Death Certificate of Eleuteria Rivera reveals that she was 96 years old when she died on February 22, 1997.&nbsp; That means that she must have been born in 1901.&nbsp; That makes Rivera two years older than her alleged grandmother Maria de la Concepcion Vidal who was born in 1903.&nbsp; Hence, it was physically impossible for Eleuteria Rivera to be an heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal.</b> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Considering all of the above matters, especially the fact that respondents claim that their respective titles, TCT Nos. 265778 and 285313, are derivatives of OCT No. 994 registered on <b>April 19, 1917</b>, which this Court had already repeatedly declared to be a non-existent and invalid title, the Court rules in favor of petitioners.&nbsp; <b>As held in<i> Manotok, </i>“[a]ny title that traces its source to OCT No. 994 dated [19] April 1917 is void, for such mother title is inexistent.”</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The Decision dated February 23, 2001, as well as the Resolution dated June 26, 2001 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
