If the development of the Regala property is pursued, the disproportionate heavy pressure pumping induced by our huge deep sea 28" Dredge will cause a dangerous spillage back to the middle of the waterway. The resultant volume equivalent to the containment capacity of the 2-hectare size Regala property will create a dike-like [blockade] transversal to the length of the waterway.

Petitioner should also develop and maintain the designated disposal areas during use. Petitioner, however, failed to comply with the said provision as it opted to side dump 165,576.27 cubic meters of dredge spoils back to the river. To justify its action, petitioner claims that respondent DPWH failed to provide adequate spoil sites.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>It is evident from the records that respondent DPWH provided spoil sites to petitioner. Director Soriquez, in his letters dated August 18, 1997 and October 1, 1997, specifically mentioned Pascual "A," Pascual "B," and the Regala fishpond as designated spoil sites. Engr. Bustos, in his letter dated September 29, 1997, also reminded petitioner of the available spoil sites. These letters clearly show that contrary to the claim of petitioner, respondent DPWH complied with its obligation to provide spoil sites.<br><br>Petitioner, however, contends that these letters contradict Director Soriquez's earlier letter dated June 6, 1997 addressed to the Executive Director of the; Mt. Pinatubo Commission. In the said letter, Director Soriquez was requesting the Mt. Pinatubo Commission to issue a certification to the OSG to confirm the availability of funds for the expropriation of certain properties as "the spoil sites being used have already been utilized to full capacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>At first glance, the letter dated June 6, 1997 issued by Director Soriquez seems to contradict his subsequent letters. But a careful review of the records leads us to believe otherwise. First of all, when Director Soriquez informed petitioner that there were still available spoil sites, he cited the report of Engr. Bustos as basis. Thus, it is possible that at the time Director Soriquez issued the lelter dated June 6, 1997, he was not aware that there were still available spoil sites in some other areas and that it was only after he received the report of Engr. Bustos that he became aware of the availability of said spoil sites. And considering that petitioner's request for side dumping was made on August 13, 1997 or more than two months after Director Soriquez wrote to Executive Director Fernando, it is also possible that during that span of time, respondent DPWH was able to look for other possible spoil sites. In fact, in the Memorandum dated December 17, 1999 addressed to then DPWH Secretary Vigilar, Director Soriquez explained that:<br><br><blockquote>A. The spoil sites referred to in the subject communications of the contractor with a total of 30.2 hectares, such as the 10 hectares of Mrs. Olivia Pascual, 7.7. hectares of P. Santos, et al., and the 12.5 hectares of F. Gutierrez, did not materialize due to funding constraint. However, a written instruction was issued to the contractor to utilize further the existing 5.0 hectares of Mrs. Olivia Pascual adjacent to the 10.0 hectares owned also by Mrs. Pascual, the 2 hectares owned by Mr. Regala and the Mangalindan/Manansala property with an area of 3 hectares. The combined total area of 10 hectares for the 3 spoil sites could accommodate 168,517 cu. m. The total side dumping volume is 165,000 cu. m. The contractor was given ample time to develop these spoil sites to contain the [dredge] volume but unfortunately they insisted on side dumping because they lack sufficient pipelines for distance pumping with an allocation of P20 Million in the Contract Agreement. Such provision was purposely provided in the contract in the event distance pumping would be required but the contractor never availed of this provision and undertook side dumping activities without first obtaining the approval of the DPWH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, we find petitioner's contention untenable as the letter dated June 6, 1997 does not necessarily contradict the subsequent letters issued by Director Soriquez.<br><br>Neither can petitioner justify the breach by merely alleging that the spoil sites provided by respondent DPWH were inadequate, uneconomical, unsafe, and inoperable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> To begin with, no evidence was presented to support these allegations. And even if true, petitioner failed to inform respondent DPWH of these problems. In fact, after receiving Director Soriquez's letter dated August 18, 1997 denying its request to side dump the dredge spoils, petitioner did not ask for a reconsideration nor did it issue any letter questioning the capacity of the designated spoil sites. Instead, it was only after the dredge spoils were side dumped or when petitioner was already following-up its claim for payment that it explained in writing its reasons for side dumping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Respondent DPWH, on the other hand, consistently prohibited side dumping as reiterated in the letters dated September 29, 1997 and October 1, 1997 issued by Engr. Bustos and Director Soriquez, respectively. However, notwithstanding the prohibition, petitioner continued with its side dumping activities without any explanation. Petitioner's blatant defiance of the prohibition on side dumping is a violation of the contract that should not be ignored just because petitioner was able to complete the project.<br><br>It is a basic principle in law that contracts have the force of law between the parties and should be complied with in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In this case, the contract specifically provides the manner of disposing dredge spoils. Thus, petitioner cannot unilaterally change the manner of disposal without first amending the contract or obtaining the express consent or approval of respondent DPWH. Otherwise, petitioner would be guilty of breaching the contract. "[A] breach occurs&nbsp; where the&nbsp; contractor inexcusably&nbsp; fails to perform&nbsp; substantially in accordance with the terms of the contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Without a doubt, petitioner's failure to dump the dredge spoils at the designated spoil sites constitutes a breach.<br><br>As a last-ditch effort, petitioner for the first time claims that the dredge spoils were not side dumped but were "freely" dumped. Petitioner's attempt to split hairs between "side dumping" and "free dumping" is unavailing as both are not allowed under paragraph 11 of the Contract Agreement. It makes no difference whether petitioner performed side dumping or free dumping activities considering that in both instances, dredge spoils are not dumped at spoil sites. What is crucial is the admission of petitioner that it did not dump the dredge spoils at the designated spoil sites but dumped them back into the river.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The act of dumping dredge spoils back into the river clearly violates paragraph 11 of the Contract Agreement. And as aptly explained by respondent COA:<br><br><blockquote>Furthermore, in the engineering point of view, for purposes of improving the discharge capacity of the channel, dredging through side dumping is not a sound engineering practice. <b>The purpose of pre-designated spoil sites is to provide containment of the [dredge] spoils to ensure that the same will not flow back into the channel, otherwise government funds would be wasted because of faulty dredging procedure.</b> (Memorandum dated October 23, 2001 of OIC-Project Director Amando R. Ramirez, MPE-PMO, DPWH)(Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Considering that the dredge spoils were dumped back into the river, we cannot be certain, as pointed out by the OSG, that the government benefited from petitioner's 165,576.27 cubic meters dredging work. And it would be unfair to allow petitioner to benefit from its breach. Besides, petitioner cannot claim that it was not duly compensated for the services it rendered as the amount of P7,354,897.10 is only a part of the P188,698,000.00 contract. In fact, petitioner admits that it was already paid the amount of P180,029,910.15.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus, we agree with respondent COA that petitioner is not entitled to its money claim for the 165,576.27 cubic meters dredging work as it was done in contravention of paragraph 11 of the Contract Agreement.<br><br>All told, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent COA in denying petitioner's money claim as the evidence on record undoubtedly supports the factual findings of respondent COA. We need not belabor that in the absence of grave abuse of discretion, the decisions and resolutions of respondent COA are accorded not only with respect but also with finality, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers, but also of its presumed expertise in the laws it is entrusted to enforce.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[68]</sup></font><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.

For this reason, the funding for the project had been reverted to the National Treasury as stated by the Chief, Cash Division, DPWH-Office of the Secretary (OSEC), in a Certification dated August 8, 2010, that the outstanding balance for the project amounting to P9,380,197.69 under DPWH Account No. 2028-90025-3, as of December 29, 1999, had lapsed on the first working day of FY-2000. A subsequent Certification dated August 19, 2010 was issued by the Cashier, DPWH, OSEC, that the said account was already closed effective November 8,2002.
