Respondents contended that since its Motion for Reconsideration of the Calamba RTC’s July 2, 2010 Order and Motion for Early Resolution of the appeal remained unresolved, the filing of an appellant’s brief by the petitioner would be premature; thus, the appeal proceedings should be suspended until the said motions are resolved.<br><br>In an April 26, 2012 Notice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the CA directed petitioner to file its appellant’s brief within 45 days from receipt of the notice.<br><br>On June 22, 2012, petitioner filed a Motion for Extension<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of time to file its brief.&nbsp;

Thus, on October 9, 2012, the CA issued another Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> denying petitioner’s second motion for extension and dismissing its appeal pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules).&nbsp; It held:<br><br><blockquote>For resolution is oppositor-appellant’s motion for extension of time to file the appellant’s brief, which prays that it be granted an additional period of thirty (30) days or until September 19, 2012 to file the aforesaid brief.<br><br>The records, however, will show the We have already granted oppositor-appellant’s previous motion for extension of time to file its brief.&nbsp; In our Resolution dated June 26, 2012, We granted oppositor-appellant an additional period of sixty (60) days or until August 20, 2012 within which to file its brief.&nbsp; However, oppositor-appellant failed to file its appellant’s brief on or before August 20, 2012.&nbsp; Hence, the instant motion.<br><br>Oppositor-appellant should be reminded that the right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege, and should be exercised only in the manner prescribed by law.&nbsp; The statutory nature of the right to appeal requires the one who avails of it to strictly comply with the statutes or rules that are considered indispensable interdictions against needless delays and for an orderly discharge of judicial business.&nbsp; Since oppositor-appellant has not been able to file its brief within the proper period, We deem it appropriate to dismiss its appeal, pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“SECTION 1. <i>Grounds for dismissal of appeal. –</i> An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) Failure of the appellant to serve and file the required number of copies of his brief or memorandum within the time provided by these Rules;<br><br>x x x x”</blockquote>It should also be noted that the appealed Decision was rendered on December 9, 2005 and the court a quo’s Order letting the entire records of the instant case be forwarded to this Court was issued on April 10, 2006.&nbsp; Thus, We believe that it is high time for the applicants-appellees, as the prevailing party in the court a quo’s Decision, to enjoy the fruits of their victory.<br><br>WHEREFORE, appellant’s motion for extension of time to file its brief, dated August 16, 2012, is hereby DENIED.&nbsp; Accordingly, the instant appeal is DISMISSED, pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>Considering the foregoing, applicants-appellees <i>Manifestation and Motion to Suspend Proceedings,</i> due to Our alleged inaction on its <i>Motion for Early Resolution</i>, is hereby declared MOOT.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>On October 18, 2012, petitioner filed a third Motion for Extension,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> praying for another 20 days from October 19, 2012, or until November 8, 2012, within which to file its appellant’s brief.<br><br>On November 5, 2012, petitioner filed its Appellant’s Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; It likewise filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> seeking a reconsideration of the CA’s October 9, 2012 Resolution and, consequently, the admission of its appellant’s brief.&nbsp; Apologizing profusely for the fiasco, it begged for the appellate court’s leniency, claiming that it cannot be faulted for the delay in the proceedings on appeal; that in fact, the delay was caused by the failure to transmit the records of LRC Case No. 105-95-C to the CA, for which the respondents and Calamba City Office of the Clerk of Court should be faulted; that in the interest of substantial justice, the CA should instead adopt a relaxed interpretation of Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules in order to afford the State an opportunity to present its case fully.<br><br>Respondents filed their Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> arguing that only petitioner should be faulted for its failure to prosecute the appeal; that from its repeated motions for extension, it can be seen that petitioner lacked diligence in pursuing its appeal; and that consequently, the CA committed no error in issuing its October 9, 2012 Resolution.<br><br><b><i>Assailed Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>On January 22, 2013, the CA issued the assailed Resolution, pronouncing thus:<br><br><blockquote>A careful reading of oppositor-appellant’s motion, however, reveals that it does not raise any matter of substance that would justify the reconsideration being sought.&nbsp; We, therefore, find no compelling reason to disturb Our findings and conclusion in Our aforementioned <i>Resolution</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <i>Omnibus Motion</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; Our <i>Resolution</i> dated October 9, 2012 stands.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the instant Petition was filed.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br>In an April 23, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court resolved to give due course to the Petition, which raises the following sole issue:<br><br><blockquote><b>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW WHEN IT ORDERED THE DISMISSAL OF THE APPEAL ALTHOUGH THE DELAY IN THE FILING OF THE APPELLANT’S BRIEF WAS CAUSED BY THE TRIAL COURT AND THE RESPONDENTS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></b></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In its Petition and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> seeking the reversal of the assailed CA Resolution as well as the dismissal of LRC Case No. 105-95-C, petitioner reiterates that it should not be faulted for the delay in the proceedings on appeal, as it resulted from the Calamba City Office of the Clerk of Court’s failure to transmit the records of LRC Case No. 105-95-C to the CA; that it was the ministerial duty of the clerk of court to transmit the records of the case to the CA, and he has no authority to withhold the records on the pretext that certain exhibits were lacking; and that the CA should liberally apply Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules in order to afford the State an opportunity to present its case fully.<br><br>Petitioner further argues, at this stage of the proceedings, that the Calamba RTC’s December 9, 2005 Decision granting respondents’ application for registration is null and void for lack of the required certification from the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) that the land applied for is alienable and disposable land of the public domain.&nbsp; It claims that the mere testimony of a special investigator of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) cannot form the basis for the Calamba RTC’s finding that the land applied for is alienable and disposable, pursuant to the ruling in <i>Republic v. Hanover Worldwide Trading Corporation</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> respondents should have submitted a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.&nbsp; Petitioner justifies the raising of the issue at this late stage, arguing that the State may not be estopped by the mistakes of its officers and agents; and that when the inference made by the CA is based on a misapprehension of facts, or when its findings of fact are manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible, as in this case, its erroneous decision may be reviewed by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In its Reply, petitioner further points out that the Calamba RTC’s December 9, 2005 Decision is void for lack of publication;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> in other words, petitioner suggests that respondents in fact failed to cause the publication and posting of the notice of initial hearing on its application, and that the subsequent submission through its September 21, 2011 Compliance of an Affidavit of Publication and Certificate of Posting of Notice of Initial Hearing was a mere fabrication and fraudulent submission.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> respondents insist that the assailed CA disposition is correct in all respects; that petitioner’s failure to file its brief is not attributable to respondents; that petitioner filed no less than four motions for extension to file its brief, which is indicative of its failure to prosecute its appeal with reasonable diligence and despite having been given by the CA the opportunity to do so; that the CA’s authority to dismiss an appeal for failure of the appellant to file a brief is a matter of judicial discretion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that the CA exercised its discretion soundly; that Section 12<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of Rule 44 of the Rules states that extensions of time for the filing of briefs will not be allowed except for good and sufficient cause; that petitioner should not expect that every motion for extension it files will be granted; and that the rules on appeal are not trivial technicalities that petitioner can simply disregard at will.<br><br>Respondents add that petitioner’s allegations of fraud and fabrication are not substantiated by the evidence; that the affidavit of publication and certificate of posting were already presented during the initial hearing and later submitted as part of their formal offer of evidence; that the Calamba RTC admitted the said exhibits and in fact mentioned the same in its Decision granting the application; and that with the ruling in <i>Republic v. Vega,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> it can be said that despite the absence of a certified true copy of the DENR original land classification, an application for registration could nonetheless be approved when there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements relative to proof that the land applied for is alienable and disposable.<br><br><b><center>Our Ruling</center></b><br>The Court finds for petitioner.<br><br>It is true, as we have held in numerous cases – particularly <i>Beatingo v. Gasis</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> – that the power conferred upon the CA to dismiss an appeal for failure to file an appellant’s brief is discretionary.&nbsp; We likewise agree with the CA’s application of Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules.&nbsp; Indeed, petitioner took its liberties in the prosecution of its appeal, filing at least three motions for extension of time before finally turning in its appellant’s brief, and taking the demeanor consistent with expecting that each motion for extension of time would be granted.<br><br>However, while petitioner, through the Office of the Solicitor General, was admittedly ornery in the prosecution of its case, it is nonetheless true that “[a]s a matter of doctrine, illegal acts of government agents do not bind the State,” and “the Government is never estopped from questioning the acts of its officials, more so if they are erroneous, let alone irregular.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; This principle applies in land registration cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Certainly, the State will not be allowed to abdicate its authority over lands of the public domain just because its agents and officers have been negligent in the performance of their duties.&nbsp; Under the Regalian doctrine, “all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in land and charged with the conservation of such patrimony.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Applicants for registration of title under PD 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> must prove: “(1) that the subject land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain; and (2) that they have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the land under a bona fide claim of ownership since 12 June 1945 or earlier.&nbsp; Section 14(1) of the law requires that the property sought to be registered is already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration is filed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>And, in order to prove that the land subject of the application is alienable and disposable public land, “the general rule remains: all applications for original registration under the Property Registration Decree must include both (1) a CENRO or PENRO<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> certification and (2) a certified true copy of the original classification made by the DENR Secretary.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>A perfunctory appraisal of the records indicates that respondents did not present any documentary evidence in LRC Case No. 105-95-C to prove that the land applied for is alienable and disposable public land.&nbsp; Their Exhibits “A” to “N”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> are bereft of the required documentary proof – particularly, a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records, and a CENRO or PENRO certification – to show that the 293-square meter land applied for registration is alienable and disposable public land.&nbsp; Respondents do not dispute this; in fact, they sought the application of the exceptional ruling in <i>Republic v. Vega</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> precisely to obtain exemption from the requirement on the submission of documentary proof showing that the property applied for constitutes alienable and disposable public land.<br><br>Consequently, the December 9, 2005 Decision of the Calamba RTC is rendered null and void.&nbsp; The trial court had no basis in fact and law to grant respondents’ application for registration as there was no proof of alienability adduced.&nbsp; As such, it “has no legal and binding effect, force or efficacy for any purpose. In contemplation of law, it is non-existent. Such judgment or order may be resisted in any action or proceeding whenever it is involved.&nbsp; It is not even necessary to take any steps to vacate or avoid a void judgment or final order; it may simply be ignored. x x x&nbsp; Accordingly, a void judgment is no judgment at all. It cannot be the source of any right nor of any obligation. All acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>“The well-entrenched rule is that all lands not appearing to be clearly of private dominion presumably belong to the State.&nbsp; The <i>onus</i> to overturn, by incontrovertible evidence, the presumption that the land subject of an application for registration is alienable and disposable rests with the applicant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; “[P]ublic lands remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the State is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; “Unless public land is shown to have been reclassified or alienated to a private person by the State, it remains part of the inalienable public domain. Indeed, occupation thereof in the concept of owner, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership and be registered as a title.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Therefore, even if the Office of the Solicitor General was remiss in the handling of the State’s appeal, we nevertheless cannot allow respondents’ application for registration since they failed to prove that the land applied for is alienable and disposable public land.&nbsp; Respondents cannot invoke <i>Republic v.
