A certification to this effect was issued by Mandaue City Central postal office dated January 29, 2010 certifying that registry letter No. 971 addressed to Atty. Danilo Pilapil of Maguikay, Mandaue City was actually delivered and received by Vergie Pilapil on September 11, 2009. Said certification was attached to Annex "B" as Annex "A" thereof in the Comments to the Petition of herein private respondents dated July 11, 2011.<br><br>This was not refuted then by movant-petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Thus, the issue to be resolved before this court is whether receipt of petitioner's counsel of a copy of the motion for execution amounts to effective official notice of the Regional Trial Court Decision dated April 16, 009 if he was not furnished a copy of the Decision.<br><br>Rule 13, Section 2 of the Rules of Court states in part that "[i]f any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court."<br><br>Notice sent directly to client is not notice in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Nevertheless, this rule admits of exceptions.<br><br>In <i>Santiago,</i> this court considered the filing of a&nbsp; motion for :consideration as actual notice of the assailed Decision:<br><br><blockquote>The petitioners also maintain that they should have first been furnished with a copy of the final decision before a writ of execution could be validly enforced against them. Formal service of the judgment is indeed necessary as a rule but not, as it happens, in the case at bar. The reason is that the petitioners had filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of Judge Guadiz, which would indicate that they were then already informed of such decision. The petitioners cannot now invoke due process on the basis of a feigned ignorance as the lack of formal notice cannot prevail against the fact of actual notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Ramos v. Spouses Lim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this court considered Atty. Estaniel's receipt of Atty. Datukon's Manifestation informing the court that he had been formally substituted by Atty. Estaniel as counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> as "an alerting medium that a final ruling has been issued by the trial court[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Atty. Datukon filed this Manifestation after he was served a copy of the motion for execution.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[68]</sup></font> Thus, this court held that Atty. Estaniel's period to appeal the trial court Decision commenced from his receipt of Atty. Datukon's Manifestation on April 1, 1996, when he was put on effective official notice f the Decision:<br><br><blockquote>The foregoing notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals ruled, and rightly so, that although Atty. Estaniel was not officially sent a copy of the trial court's January 31, 1996 decision, he was however, put on effective official notice thereof on April 1, 1996.&nbsp; He must, therefore, be mad accountable for his failure to seek, within the reglementary period counted from April 1, 1996, a review of said decision. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The foregoing disposition and the premises holding it together commend themselves for concurrence. In particular, we agree with the designation of April 1, 1996 as the controlling date when Atty. Estaniel is considered to have effectively been put on notice of the trial court's decision and whence the period of appeal should accordingly be reckoned.<br><br>There can be no quibbling that Atty. Estaniel received a copy of Atty. Datukon's April 1, 1996 "<i>MANIFESTATION</i>" on the same date. Said manifestation carried all the basic earmarks of a proper pleading or like papers filed in court. It carried the precise case number and title. The exact branch of the handling RTC was particularly identified, the lawyers involved in the litigation were named and the specific subject covered by the manifestation, <i>i.e.</i>, motion for execution of the decision in Civil Case No. 580, was clearly discernible. Atty. Estaniel, therefore, cannot plausibly feign ignorance as to what decision the motion for execution was about. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In a very real sense, Atty. Datukon's "<i>MANIFESTATION</i>" was an alerting medium that a final ruling has been issued by the trial court, which should have thus prodded Atty. Estaniel — and any prudent counsel for that matter — to act accordingly. Canon 18 of the Code cjf Professional Responsibility imposes upon a lawyer the duty to "<i>serve his client with competence and diligence</i>."&nbsp; Subsumed in this imposition, which commences from the time a lawyer is retained until his effective release from the case or final disposition of the whole subject of the litigation, is the duty to safeguard his client's interest with the vigilance and attention of a good father of the family. In line with his duty as defined in Canon 18 of the Code, it behooved Atty. Estaniel, upon receipt of Atty. Datukon's manifestation, to posthaste inquire from the trial court or even from Atty. Datukon himself, about the status of petitioner's case since the manifestation, a copy of which he has thus been furnished, already made specific reference to a motion for execution filed by the counsel of his clients' adversary. Atty. Estaniel must thus be held to task for his failure to exercise due diligence in the discharge of his duties as counsel. Petitioners, too, must suffer the consequence of such failure because a client is bound by the conduct, negligence or mistakes of his counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis m the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Petitioner's counsel was furnished a copy of the motion for execution on September 11, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As discussed by the Court of Appeals, this motion categorically states that the trial court rendered its Decision on April 16, 2009, yet petitioner's counsel filed no opposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> At that time, he did not file any motion asserting that he was not furnished a copy of the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; It was only on January 8, 2010 when his client informed him of the Writ of Execution did petitioner's counsel file an Urgent Motion to Vacate the Writ of Execution on the ground that he did not receive a copy of the Regional Trial Court Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence reiterates that "[l]itigants who are represented by counsel should not expect that all they need to do is sit back, relax and await the outcome of their cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This court has held that "equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and a party should "periodically keep in touch with his counsel, check with the court, and inquire about the status of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The explanation of petitioner's counsel that his client only finished Grade 6 and lives in a remote mountain barangay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> fails to convince. Petitioner immediately informed his counsel about the Notice to Vacate on Execution on the same day he was served a copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> This contradicts counsel's explanation implying difficulty in communicating with his client. This even raises the possibility that his client did immediately inform him about the Regional Trial Court Decision upon receiving a copy.<br><br>Equally unconvincing and disappointing is the submission of petitioner's counsel that even if he received a copy of the motion for execution, "to require undersigned counsel to verify the existence of the decision with the Regional Trial Court is to unfairly burden the undersigned counsel and to unduly exonerate the clerk of court who was remiss in his duty in sending a copy of the Decision to the undersigned counsel,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and that the court in Danao is 30 kilometers away from his office in Mandaue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Counsels have the duty to serve their clients with competence and diligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The distance from counsel's office to the court should not be used as an excuse by counsel from keeping himself updated with the status of the cases he is handling.<br><br>This court has held that "[r]elief will not be granted to a party who seeks avoidance from the effects of the judgment when the loss of the remedy at law was due to his own negligence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner, through his counsel, did not file an answer to the Complaint. After the trial court declared petitioner in default for failure to file an answer, his counsel did not file an opposition to or motion to lift the Order declaring him in default. After petitioner's counsel was furnished a copy of the motion for execution, he did not immediately file an opposition to the motion or raise the ground that he was not furnished a copy of the Decision.<br><br>Petitioner Nestor Bracero, through his counsel Atty. Danilo Pilapil, had several opportunities to argue his position before the courts but failed to take them. Petitioner should now be considered in estoppel from assailing the Regional Trial Court Order dated February 11, 2010 denying petitioner's Urgent Motion to Vacate the Writ of Execution, affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Also, "[t]o frustrate the winning party's right through dilatory schemes is to frustrate all the efforts, time and expenditure of the] courts, which thereby increases the costs of litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Del Castillo, </i>and <i>Mendoza, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated acting member per S. 0.
