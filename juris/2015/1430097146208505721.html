CV No. 91213.&nbsp; Petitioner contended in its Appellant’s Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that respondent may not become a naturalized Filipino citizen because: 1) he does not own real estate in the Philippines; 2) he does not have some known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation; 3) he is not gainfully employed, as he merely worked in the business owned by his family and was merely given allowances by his parents for the daily expenses of his family; 4) in an August 2001 Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> covering a parcel of land in Antipolo City he and his wife supposedly purchased, respondent falsely misrepresented himself as a Filipino citizen, thus exemplifying his lack of good moral character; 5) his income tax returns for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 reveal that his actual monthly income differs from his monthly income as declared in his petition for naturalization, leading to the conclusion that either he is evading taxes or concealing the truth regarding his income; and 6) on cross-examination by petitioner, he could not cite any of the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution which he is supposed to believe in.<br><br>In a short Comment/Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to petitioner’s brief, respondent admitted that while “he was merely made to sign the Deed of Sale” which falsely represented him as a Filipino citizen, he “had nothing to do with the preparation” thereof and was “unaware” that his citizenship was even indicated therein – “he just signed the document as requested by the broker so that the property will be registered in the name of his wife;” that the discrepancy between his income declarations in his tax returns and the declared income in his petition for naturalization came to light and resulted from the fact that “he does not personally file his income tax returns and that he merely received salaries in the range of P15,000.00 per month considering that he is employed in a family corporation;” that “most of his expenses are taken care of by his parents who own the corporation,” and&nbsp; this&nbsp; has&nbsp; been explained&nbsp; during his cross-examination; that while petitioner claimed that he could not cite any underlying principles of the Constitution, he was not confronted by the former about these principles during the proceedings; and that petitioner’s opposition is based merely on conjecture and particular portions of the evidence which do not represent the whole context of the proceedings.<br><br>On November 29, 2011, the CA issued the assailed Decision, pronouncing thus:<br><br><blockquote>First off, an examination of the evidence presented during the proceedings below shows that the petitioner-appellee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> has been engaged in some lucrative trade or lawful occupation.&nbsp; He works as general manager in their family-owned business, Crown Shipper Manufacturer and Trading Corporation, a zipper manufacturing company employing workers mostly coming from the province.<br><br>Prior to his appointment as general manager, petitioner-appellee has also been working in the family’s business before his parents turned over the management of its affairs.&nbsp; This is evidenced by the increase in the declared gross income of the petitioner-appellee in his Income Tax Returns filed for the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; The extent of the operations of the petitioner-appellee’s family business and his involvement in the management thereof are corroborated by the testimonies of Atty. Benjamin Moraleda and Atty. Bella Ramona Antonano, both friends of the Huang family and the petitioner-appellee since 1987 and 1994, respectively.&nbsp; Both witnesses also testified that the petitioner-appellee possessed all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a naturalized citizen of the Philippines.<br><br>Secondly, the Solicitor General also averred that the petitioner-appellee failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire stay or residence in the Philippines.&nbsp; It noted that the petitioner-appellee stated in his petition that he earns an average of P15,000.00 per month but his declared gross income for 2002 and 2003 indicated that he earned P120,000.00 annually while in 2004, his annual gross income was P210,000.00.&nbsp; The Solicitor General contended that because of the petitioner-appellee’s failure to divulge his true income, his moral character has been tainted.<br><br>We hold otherwise.<br><br>Absent a clear and unmistakable showing that the petitioner-appellee knowingly and deliberately filed a fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or that he has concealed the truth in his income tax returns, the presumption that the latter has regularly filed his return prevails.&nbsp; The petitioner-appellee has, in fact, explained before the trial court that his salary is not exactly fixed; sometimes he earns more or sometimes less than his estimated or average monthly earnings which could well be between P15,000.00 to P18,000.00.&nbsp; He even testified that he is not included in the payroll since his parents own the company and his salaries are handed to him by his parents.<br><br>In the case of <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i> and Loh Khuan Fatt, the Supreme Court did not agree with the argument of the Solicitor General that there had been a willful failure on the part of the applicant to disclose the petitioner’s true income, thereby tainting his moral character.&nbsp; The discrepancy between the petitioner’s estimate of his income in his application and that declared by him during his direct testimony should not be taken against him as an indication of intent to evade payment of taxes. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Lastly, the Solicitor General argued that petitioner-appellee is disqualified from becoming a citizen of the Philippines because he could not even cite any of the principles underlying the Constitution during cross-examination x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We agree with the observation of the petitioner-appellee that the oppositor’s representative during the cross-examination was actually asking the petitioner-appellee to recite what these underlying principles of the Constitution are in a manner which a law professor would normally ask his Political Law students.&nbsp; Not being able to enumerate the principles in verbatim does not necessarily mean that one does not believe in the Constitution.&nbsp; What is important is that the petitioner-appellee declared under oath that he believes in the principles underlying the Constitution, and that he had no derogatory or criminal record which would be a clear violation of the law of the land.&nbsp; Apparently, during cross-examination the oppositor-appellant did not confront the petitioner-appellee of the principles which it thought the latter does not believe in.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED and the Decision dated September 24, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 96 in Naturalization Case No. Q-05-55251 is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but in its March 7, 2012 Resolution, the appellate court stood its ground.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Thus, the instant Petition was filed, raising the following issue:<br><br><blockquote>WHETHER X X X RESPONDENT X X X HAS DULY COMPLIED WITH THE RIGID REQUISITES PRESCRIBED BY COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 473, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE REVISED NATURALIZATION LAW, AS TO ENTITLE HIM TO BE ADMITTED AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In its Petition and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> seeking the reversal of the assailed CA dispositions as well as the denial of respondent’s petition for naturalization, petitioner argues that respondent failed to prove that he is engaged in a lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation; that respondent’s admission during trial that he is not even in the payroll of his employer belies his claim that he is the general manager thereof, as well as his claim that he is engaged in a lucrative trade; that respondent’s declared monthly income is not even sufficient for his family, much less could it be considered “lucrative;” that respondent’s admission&nbsp; that he received allowances from his parents to answer for the daily expenses of his family further proves the point that he does not have a lucrative trade; that the monthly income declared in respondent’s petition for naturalization could not be reconciled with the incomes stated in his annual tax returns; that the inconsistencies in respondent’s testimonial and documentary evidence point to the fact the he could either be evading taxes or concealing the truth regarding his income, and indicates that he does not possess the requisite good moral character; that respondent’s act of falsely declaring himself a Filipino citizen in the August 2001 deed of sale proves lack of good moral character and defiance of the constitutional prohibition regarding foreign ownership of land; and that respondent has exhibited lack of knowledge of the underlying principles of the Philippine Constitution.<br><b><i><br>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> respondent reiterates that the inconsistencies in his income tax returns and declarations during the naturalization proceedings are explained by the fact that he does not personally file his income tax returns; that his monthly salary is not fixed; that most of his expenses are taken cared of by his parents who own the zipper manufacturing business which employs him; that the Antipolo property was not titled in his name, but in the name of his wife, and the title thereto merely describes and indicates that the owner – his wife – is married to him; that he was merely made to sign the deed of sale, and he had no hand in its preparation – nor was he aware that his citizenship was indicated therein; and that as he was not a law student, he could not at the trial be expected to recite <i>verbatim</i> and specifically the underlying legal principles of the Constitution, which is what petitioner expected him to do at the time.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court finds for petitioner.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. Hong,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> it was held in essence that an applicant for naturalization must show <b>full and complete compliance</b> with the requirements of the naturalization law; otherwise, his petition for naturalization will be denied.&nbsp; This <i>ponente </i>has likewise held that “[t]he courts must always be mindful that naturalization proceedings are imbued with the highest public interest.&nbsp; Naturalization laws should be rigidly enforced and strictly construed in favor of the government and against the applicant. The burden of proof rests upon the applicant to show full and complete compliance with the requirements of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law or CA 473 requires, among others, that an applicant for naturalization must be of good moral character and must have some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.&nbsp; In regard to the requirement that the applicant must have a known lucrative trade, this <i>ponente</i> declared:<br><br><blockquote>Based on jurisprudence, the qualification of “some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation” means <b>“not only that the person having the employment gets enough for his ordinary necessities in life.&nbsp; It must be shown that the employment gives one an income such that there is an appreciable margin of his income over his expenses as to be able to provide for an adequate support in the event of unemployment, sickness, or disability to work and thus avoid one’s becoming the object of charity or a public charge.” His income should permit “him and the members of his family to live with reasonable comfort, in accordance with the prevailing standard of living, and consistently with the demands of human dignity, at this stage of our civilization</b>.”<br><br>Moreover, it has been held that in determining the existence of a lucrative income, the courts should consider only the applicant’s income; his or her spouse’s income should not be included in the assessment.&nbsp; The spouse’s additional income is immaterial “for under the law the petitioner should be the one to possess ‘some known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation’ to qualify him to become a Filipino citizen.” Lastly, the Court has consistently held that the applicant’s qualifications must be determined as of the time of the filing of his petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>From the above, it may be concluded that there is no basis for the CA finding that respondent is engaged in a lucrative trade.&nbsp; Indeed, his supposed income of P15,000.00 to P18,000.00 per month as found by the CA is not enough for the support of his family.&nbsp; By his own admission, most of his family’s daily expenses are still shouldered by his parents who own the zipper manufacturing business which employs him.&nbsp; This simply means that respondent continues to be a burden to, and a charge upon, his parents; he lives on the charity of his parents.&nbsp; He cannot support his own family on his own.<br><br>Indeed, it is even doubtful that respondent is carrying on a trade at all.&nbsp; He admitted during trial that he was not even listed or included in the payroll of his family’s zipper business.&nbsp; If this is the case, then he may not be considered an employee thereof.&nbsp; One of the most effective pieces of evidence to prove employment – aside from the employment contract itself and other documents such as daily time records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> – is a worker’s inclusion in the payroll.&nbsp; With this admitted fact, one may not be faulted for believing that respondent’s alleged employment in his family’s zipper business was contrived for the sole purpose of complying with the legal requirements prior to obtaining Philippine citizenship.<br><br>On the other hand, even assuming that respondent was indeed employed by his parents, his non-inclusion in the payroll <b>for all the years he has worked in his parents’ business</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> suggests – as correctly argued by petitioner – an intent to evade taxes or to conceal the true nature of his employment and the amount of his salary or income.&nbsp; It is concealment of the truth; an attempt to circumvent with impunity the tax laws, labor laws relative to the employment of aliens, and other laws that would otherwise regulate respondent’s actions during his stay in this country.&nbsp; Indeed, without payroll records, it can never be said that respondent works for his parents’ zipper business.&nbsp; If such is the case, then respondent is not required to state in his income tax return – as is the case – his employer and what he actually receives as salary therefrom; he is free to conveniently declare any amount of income in his tax returns.<br><br><b>Either way</b>, respondent’s deliberate non-inclusion in the payroll of his parents’ business can have only the most unpleasant connotations.&nbsp; And his consent to be part of such scheme reflects negatively on his moral character.&nbsp; It shows a proclivity for untruthfulness and dishonesty, and an unreserved willingness and readiness to violate Philippine laws.<br><br>The appellate court’s reliance upon the case of <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> is misplaced.&nbsp; In that case, there was only a discrepancy between the applicant’s estimate of his income in his application and that declared by him during his direct testimony.&nbsp; In the present case, respondent is not at all listed on the payroll of his parent’s business, where he is supposed to be its general manager.&nbsp; As a result, there is absolutely no basis for the correct determination of his income; instead, he invites Us to conveniently rely on his income tax returns and his unilateral declarations.&nbsp; As We have earlier said, if We are to believe them, then still, they are insufficient to generate a conclusion that respondent is carrying on a lucrative trade; he cannot support his family from his declared income.<br><br>Moreover, respondent’s admitted false declaration under oath contained in the August 2001 deed of sale that he is a Filipino citizen – which he did to secure the seamless registration of the property in the name of his wife – is further proof of respondent’s lack of good moral character.&nbsp; It is also a violation of the constitutional prohibition on ownership of lands by foreign individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> His defense that he unknowingly signed the deed is unacceptable.&nbsp; First of all, as a foreigner living in a foreign land, he should conduct himself accordingly in this country – with care, circumspect, and respect for the laws of the host.&nbsp; Finally, as an educated and experienced businessman, it must be presumed that he acted with due care and signed the deed of sale with full knowledge of its import.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Having decided in the foregoing manner, We must conclude the instant case and disregard the other issues and arguments of the parties; they are deemed irrelevant and will not alter the conclusion arrived at.&nbsp; As far as this Court is concerned, respondent has failed to satisfy the law which renders him completely undeserving of Filipino citizenship.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The November 29, 2011 Decision and March 7, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
