The challenged CA resolution, on the other hand, denied the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b><center><u>The Antecedents</u></center></b><br>Petitioner Karen Go (<i>Go</i>) is engaged in buying and selling motor vehicles and heavy equipment under the business name Kargo Enterprises (<i>Kargo</i>). Nick Carandang (<i>Carandang</i>) is Kargo's Manager at its General Santos City Branch.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On December 20, 1996, Kargo<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Carandang entered into a Contract of Lease with Option to Purchase<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (<i>lease contract</i>) over a Fuso Dropside Truck (<i>truck</i>). The lease contract stipulated that Kargo would execute a Deed of Absolute Sale over the truck upon Carandang's full payment of five equal monthly installments of P78,710.75.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> If he failed to pay any of the installments, Carandang should return the truck and forfeit his payments as rentals. The lease contract also prohibited Carandang from assigning his rights, as lessee-buyer, to third persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Carandang failed to pay the installments<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> prompting Go to demand the return of the truck.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Carandang, instead of returning the truck, sold it to respondent Lamberto Echavez (<i>Echavez</i>) without Go's knowledge. Later, Go learned about the sale but did not know to whom the truck was sold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Hence, on April 30, 1997, Go filed before the RTC a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> for Replevin, docketed as Civil Case No. 97-271, against Carandang and John Doe.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[15]</sup></font><br><br>The RTC issued the Writ of Replevin; and on May 17, 1997, the sheriff seized the truck from Echavez.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On August 5, 1997, Echavez filed his Answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> with Cross-Claim and Counterclaim. Echavez denied knowledge of the lease contract, and claimed that he bought the truck in good faith and for value from Kargo through Carandang.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to Echavez, Go could not deny Carandang's authority to sell Kargo's trucks because she represented to the public that Carandang was Kargo's manager.<br><br>In his counterclaim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Echavez alleged that from the time the truck was seized, he had missed many of his deliveries for his seeds and fertilizer business <b>causing him actual damages in terms of unrealized income amounting to P10,000.00 per week</b>. For his cross-claim, Echavez prayed that Carandang should be held liable if the RTC ruled in Go's favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Carandang, however, failed to answer the Complaint and the Cross-claim despite receipt of summonses. Hence, the RTC declared him in default.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC held Go and Carandang solidarity liable to Echavez for damages. The RTC found that: (i) Echavez purchased the truck from Kargo, through Carandang, in good faith and for value; and (ii) Go is estopped from denying Carandang's authority to sell the truck. The dispositive portion of the <b>February 11, 2000 Judgment</b> reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing and considering the preponderance of evidence in favor of the defendant Lamberto Echavez, the complaint against him is hereby DISMISSED. Upon convincing proof of the counterclaim, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the plaintiff and defendant Nick Carandang to jointly and severally pay or indemnify herein defendant Lamberto Echavez of the following:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li><b><i>P10,000.00 per week as actual damages from the time the subject motor vehicle was seized from defendant Echavez, that is, on May 17, 1997;</i></b><br><br></li><li>P300,000.00 by way of moral damages;<br><br></li><li>P50,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li>P50,000.00 as litigation expenses and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, exclusive of the sum of P3,000.00 as appearance fee for every hearing. The damages and attorney's fees awarded by the Court is pursuant to the ruling by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in National&nbsp; Power Corporation vs. CA, GR#&nbsp; 122195, July 23, 1998; <b><i>and to restitute unto defendant Lamberto Echavez the motor vehicle seized on replevin</i></b> or to refund to the said defendant, the payment made for the said vehicle and to pay the costs. [Emphasis supplied.]</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br>On February 29, 2000, Go moved for reconsideration arguing that the RTC failed to consider the Lease Contract, and that the actual damages awarded to Echavez were not supported by evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On April 17, 2000, the RTC granted in part Go's Motion for Reconsideration holding Carandang liable to Go for the truck's value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> plus damages. The RTC, however, maintained that Echavez is entitled to his counterclaim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, the April 17, 2000 Order preserved the dispositive portion of the February 11, 2000 Judgment but added a new paragraph ordering Carandang to pay Go damages, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On April 25, 2000, Go appealed the Judgment to the CA, docketed as <b>C.A. G.R. No. CV-68814</b>.<br><br>Meanwhile, on Echavez's motion, the RTC allowed partial execution of the Judgment pending appeal. <i>Thus, on May 5, 2000, Go delivered to Echavez another truck as substitute for the truck previously seized.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On June 4, 2002, <i><b>CA. G.R.

G.R. No. CV-68814</u></i>.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[27]</sup></font><br><br>On April 8, 2003, Echavez moved for execution of the RTC's Judgment. Before the RTC could act on the Motion for Execution, Go filed a <b><i>Motion for Clarification</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> alleging that the P10,000.00 per week award: (i) will roughly amount to P1,600,000.00, which is more than double the truck's value; (ii) erroneously assumed that the truck was "continually (sic) hired and running without maintenance for a period of nearly three years"; (iii) "is not an 'actual' damage;" and (iv) is inequitable, highly speculative, and will unjustly enrich Echavez. Pending clarification, Go prayed that the RTC hold the issuance of the writ of execution.<br><br>Echavez opposed Go's motion for being dilatory.<br><br>In her Reply with <b><i>Manifestation</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Go argued that the February 11, 2000 Judgment, as modified by the April 17, 2000 Order, is unenforceable because it contains materially conflicting rulings. Go argues that since the RTC held Carandang liable on the lease contract, it also upheld the provision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> prohibiting Carandang from assigning his rights to third persons. In effect, the RTC invalidated Carandang's transfer of the truck to Echavez and recognized Go's ownership. Thus, the counterclaim should be dismissed because Go, as owner, had the right to recover the truck from Echavez.<br><br>On May 12, 2003, RTC Judge Downey C. Valdevilla denied Go's Motion for Clarification and Manifestation, and issued the Writ of Execution. Go moved for reconsideration, but the RTC denied her motion.<br><br>On June 4, 2003, Go filed with the CA a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction &amp; Temporary Restraining Order alleging that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in executing a Judgment that: (i) contains materially conflicting rulings; and (ii) will result in Echavez's unjust enrichment. Go prayed that the CA stop the RTC from implementing the Writ of Execution.<br><br><center><b><u>The CA's Decision</u></b><br></center><br>In its Decision dated March 30, 2006, the CA denied Go's petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>The CA ruled that the RTC's Judgment does not contain materially conflicting rulings. Go merely failed to grasp the correctness of the ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The CA reminded Go that in the main case, she sued two defendants: (i) Carandang, in his capacity as buyer of the truck; and (ii) Echavez, as possessor and owner of the truck.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> According to the CA, the RTC can give due course to the complaint against Carandang and dismiss it in so far as Echavez is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; This is because, unlike Carandang, Echavez successfully proved his defense and counterclaim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Considering that there is nothing to clarify, the RTC's execution of Judgment did not constitute abuse, much less grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The CA opined that the award of P10,000.00 per week as actual damages is exorbitant. However, it admitted that its opinion no longer matters because the Judgment had already become final.<br><br>Go moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied her motion.<br><br><b><center><u>The Petition for Review on Certiorari</u></center></b><br>Go claims that the RTC decided the case contrary to law, jurisprudence, and regular procedure calling for the exercise of this Court's power of supervision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She argues that:<br><br><ol><li>The February 11, 2000 Judgment, modified by the April 17, 2000 Order, did not finally resolve or dispose of the action because the RTC made two conflicting rulings which, unless clarified, renders the Judgment unenforceable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br></li><li>An execution of the award of actual damages, amounting to P10,000.00 per week from May 17, 1997, will amount to an unjust enrichment of the respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></li></ol><br>Thus, Go prays, among others, that this Court: (i) <b>set aside the RTC's Judgment dated February 11, 2000, and its Order dated April 17, 2000</b>; (ii) nullify all proceedings in respect to the execution in Civil Case No. 97-271; (iii) <b>declare Go not liable on Echavez's counterclaim.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>The Case for the Respondent</u></center></b><br>Echavez claims that the RTC's Judgment does not contain materially conflicting rulings, hence, there is nothing to clarify.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> According to Echavez, the present petition should be dismissed because it seeks the "recalibration" of the RTC's findings of fact and law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Echavez points out that this Court is not a trier of facts, and that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> cannot substitute for a lost appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issues Raised</u></b></center><br>The parties' arguments, properly joined, present to us the following issues:<br><br>1) Whether the February 11, 2000 judgment, as modified by the April 27, 2000 order, contains materially conflicting rulings.<br><br>2) Whether the actual damages awarded to Echavez can still be modified.<br><br><b><center><u>The Court's Ruling </u></center><br><br>We deny the petition for lack of merit.<br><br><u>The Judgment does not <br>contain materially <br>conflicting rulings</u></b><br><br>We are not persuaded by Go's claim that the Judgment, as modified by the April 17, 2000 Order, contains two materially conflicting rulings.<br><br>Go has read too many assumptions in the April 17, 2000 Order. The RTC never invalidated the sale between Carandang and Echavez; it simply recognized Carandang's obligations to Go for breach of contract. The lease contract bound only Go and Carandang because Echavez was found to be a buyer in good faith and for value.<br><br>The flaw in Go's argument springs from her misconception that Echavez's counterclaim is a component part of the main action. The Rules of Court define a counterclaim as any claim which a defending party may have against an opposing party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Sec. 1, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court also states that the term "plaintiff may refer to the counterclaimant or cross-claimant while the term "defendant" may refer to the defendant in the counterclaim, or in the cross-claim. Thus, when Echavez filed his Counterclaim in<i> </i>Civil Case<i> </i>No. 97-271, he became the <i>plaintiff</i> in the counterclaim, while Go became the <i>defendant.</i><br><br>We also note that Go's complaint against Carandang is separate from the complaint against Echavez because they were not sued as alternative defendants. As the CA correctly put it, Carandang was sued based on the lease contract; while Echavez was impleaded as possessor of the truck.<br><br>In effect, there are four causes of action in Civil Case No. 97-271: <b><i>first,</i></b> Go's complaint against Carandang based on the Lease Contract; <b><i>second</i></b>, Go's complaint against Echavez, as possessor of the truck; <b><i>third,</i></b> Echavez's counterclaim against Go; and<b><i> fourth</i></b>, Echavez's cross-claim against Carandang.<br><br>Considering that the four causes of action are independent from each other, the RTC can grant Go's complaint against Carandang but dismiss that against Echavez, and at the same time, grant Echavez's counterclaim and cross-claim against Go and Carandang, respectively. These rulings are not incompatible with one another.<br><br>What would be incompatible is a decision favoring Go's complaint against Echavez, and at the same time awarding the latter's counterclaim. This is because Echavez's counterclaim is compulsory in character, or one that arises as a consequence of the main action. Thus, had Go's case against Echavez been sustained, it would mean that Go was entitled to the possession of the truck and that its seizure could not have injured Echavez. That is not the case here.<br><br><b><u>The February 11, 2000 Judgment <br>had attained finality and had <br>become Immutable</u></b><br><br>To "clarify" is to free the mind of confusion, doubt or uncertainty, or to make something understandable.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[43]</sup></font> Although Go prays for "clarification," We note that her objective is to petition this Court to modify the judgment award and ultimately, to nullify or at least, reopen <i>Civil Case No. 97-271.</i><br><br>We point at the outset that the February 11, 2000 Judgment, as modified by the April 27, 2000 Order, became final and executory on June 19, 2015, or 15 days following the dismissal of C.A. G.R. No. CV-68814.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> At that point, the Judgment had become immutable, and hence could no longer be changed, revised, amended, or reversed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The rule, however, admits exceptions: <i>first</i>, the correction of clerical errors; <i>second</i>, the making of<i> nunc pro tunc</i> entries which causes no prejudice to any party; <i>third,</i> an attack against a void judgment; and. <i>fourth</i> and last, supervening events that render execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Clerical errors cover all errors, mistakes, or omissions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that result in the record's failure to correctly represent the court's decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> However, courts are not authorized to add terms it never adjudged, nor enter orders it never made, <i>although it should have made such additions or entered such orders.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In other words, to be clerical, the error or mistake must be plainly due to inadvertence or negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Examples of clerical errors include the interchange of the words "mortgagor" and "mortgagee,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the correction of the dispositive portion to read "heirs of Joaquin Avendafio" instead of "heirs of Isabela Avendano."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><i>Nunc pro tunc</i> is Latin for "now for then." Its purpose is to put on record an act which the court performed, but omitted from the record through inadvertence or mistake.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is neither intended to render a new judgment nor supply the court's inaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In other words, a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry may be used to make the record speak the truth, but not to make it speak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>A void judgment or order has no legal and binding effect. It does not divest rights and no rights can be obtained under it; all proceedings founded upon a void judgment are equally worthless.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Void judgments, because they are legally nonexistent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> are susceptible to collateral attacks. A collateral attack is an attack, made as an incident in another action, whose purpose is to obtain a different relief. In other words, a party need not file an action to purposely attack a void judgment; he may attack the void judgment as part of some other proceeding. A void judgment or order is a lawless thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its head.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, it can never become final, and could be assailed at any time.<br><br>Nevertheless, this Court has laid down a stiff requirement to collaterally overthrow a judgment. In the case of <i>Reyes, et al. v. Datu</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> We ruled that it is not enough for the party seeking the nullity to show a mistaken or erroneous decision; he must show to the court that the judgment complained of is utterly void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In short, the judgment must be void upon its face.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Supervening events, on the other hand, are circumstances that transpire after the decision's finality rendering the execution of the judgment unjust and inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It includes matters that the parties were not aware of prior to or during the trial because such matters were not yet in existence at the time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In such cases, courts are allowed to suspend execution, admit evidence proving the event or circumstance, and grant relief as the new facts and circumstances warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>To successfully stay or stop the execution of a final judgment, the supervening event: (i) must have altered or modified the parties' situation as to render execution inequitable, impossible, or unfair;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and (ii) must be established by competent evidence; otherwise, it would become all too easy to frustrate the conclusive effects of a fined and immutable judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><b><u>The award can no longer be <br>modified because it is not covered <br>by any of the exceptions</u></b><br><br>The challenged award is not a clerical error because it is exactly what Echavez prayed for.<br><br>In his counterclaim, Echavez alleged that he suffered actual losses "in the amount of not less than P10,000.00 weekly in terms of unrealized income reckoned from the time the truck was seized by the sheriff."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> During trial, Echavez offered documentary exhibits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> to prove such losses; and the RTC, in turn, admitted those pieces of evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> ruling that "it cannot help but agree with defendant Echavez that he has suffered actual loss of income." Obviously, there was no inadvertence, mistake, nor omission here.<br><br>A <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry cannot be recognized in this case.<br><br>Go argues that, in granting the award, the RTC assumed that the vehicle was hired and was continually running for three years, which is contrary to the normal usage and practice in the transport industry. We note that "normal usage and practice in the transport industry" is a not matter adjudged in the original decision. Thus, had Go's motion been granted, the RTC would have required the parties to prove what consists "normal usage and practice in the transport industry." Such modification is not <i>nunc pro tunc</i> because it supplies findings of facts and law not included in the original judgment.<br><br>Moreover, a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry should cause no prejudice to either party. Apparently, the diminution of the award is prejudicial to Echavez because he would be deprived of a right already vested in him by the Judgment.<br><br>Neither does the award render the judgment void.<br><br>Go failed to prove that the judgment is utterly void. On the contrary, the judgment has complied with all the requisites of a valid decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and has fully satisfied the requirements of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Go insists, however, that this Court should take a second look at the propriety of the award because it would result in Echavez's unjust enrichment. This, we cannot do.<br><br>We agree with the CA that some might opine the award to be exorbitant. However, variance in opinion does not render the award wrong, much less void. Considering that the judgment is already final, it may no longer be modified in any respect, <i>even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted by the court that rendered it or by the highest Court of [the] land.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Lastly, Go did not allege in her petition, much less establish by competent evidence, that the parties' situation changed after the judgment became final.<br><br>Nonetheless, we note that during the judgment's partial execution, Go delivered to Echavez another truck as replacement for the one previously seized. To our mind, this event did not change the situation of the parties because: (i) the restitution of the truck is a separate award from the actual damages; and (ii) Echavez's receipt of the replacement truck did not recompense him for the unrealized income he suffered since May 17, 1997.<br><br>We realize, however, that while the Judgment specifies the day Go must begin paying Echavez PI0,000.00 per week, it does not say until when she is obligated to pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>This Court puts on record that Go never alleged that the award is vague for this reason. Instead, her Motion for Clarification argues that "a rough computation of the [award] will amount to more than One Million Six Hundred Thousand Pesos" and that the amount "assumes that the vehicle is continually hired and running without maintenance for a period of three years." These arguments show that even Go understood the meaning of the award— that the PI0,000.00 per week covers only three years, or 156 weeks counted from May 17, 1997, up to May 5, 2000.<br><br>In any case, what is clear to us is that Go never introduced any competent evidence to prove that the RTC executed the judgment unreasonably or to the point of absurdity.<br><br>Considering that there is no issue affecting the Judgment, Echavez is entitled to a writ of execution as a matter of right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Accordingly, the RTC did not commit abuse, much less grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of execution, and in denying Go's Motion for Clarification and Manifestation.<br><br>Finally, we note that Go's petition for certiorari was filed on June 4, 2003. Had it been filed after A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> came into effect, the CA would have been constrained to rule on whether the petition for certiorari was prosecuted manifestly for delay or was too unsubstantial to require consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In these instances, the CA might have ordered Go and his counsel to pay treble costs. As a word of caution, lawyers should study their grounds carefully, lest they waste the precious time of the courts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of these considerations, we hereby <b>DENY</b> the petition and <b>AFFIRM</b> in toto the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 30, 2006, and the Resolution dated August 15, 2006, in CA-G.R.
