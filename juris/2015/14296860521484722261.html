National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> for determining regular employment status:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he test of whether or not an employee is a regular employee has been laid down in <i>De Leon v. NLRC</i>, in which this Court held:<br><blockquote>The primary standard, therefore, of determining regular employment is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual trade or business of the employer.&nbsp; The test is whether the former is usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer.&nbsp; The connection can be determined by considering the nature of the work performed and its relation to the scheme of the particular business or trade in its entirety.&nbsp; Also if the employee has been performing the job for at least a year, even if the performance is not continuous and merely intermittent, the law deems repeated and continuing need for its performance as sufficient evidence of the necessity if not indispensability of that activity to the business.&nbsp; Hence, the employment is considered regular, but only with respect to such activity, and while such activity exists.</blockquote>Thus, the nature of one’s employment does not depend solely on the will or word of the employer.&nbsp; Nor on the procedure for hiring and the manner of designating the employee, but on the nature of the activities to be performed by the employee, considering the employer's nature of business and the duration and scope of work to be done.<br><br><i>In the case at bar, <b>while it may appear that the work of petitioners is seasonal, inasmuch as petitioners have served the company for many years, some for over 20 years, performing services necessary and indispensable to LUTORCO’s business, serve as badges of regular employment.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that petitioners do not work continuously for one whole year but only for the duration of the tobacco season does not detract from considering them in regular employment </b></i>since in a litany of cases this Court has already settled that seasonal workers who are called to work from time to time and are temporarily laid off during off-season are not separated from service in said period, but are merely considered on leave until re-employed.<br><br>Private respondent's reliance on the case of <i>Mercado v. NLRC</i> is misplaced considering that since in said case of <i>Mercado</i>, although the respondent company therein consistently availed of the services of the petitioners therein from year to year, it was clear that petitioners therein were not in respondent company's regular employ.&nbsp; Petitioners therein performed different phases of agricultural work in a given year.&nbsp; However, during that period, they were free to contract their services to work for other farm owners, as in fact they did.&nbsp; Thus, the Court ruled in that case that their employment would naturally end upon the completion of each project or phase of farm work for which they have been contracted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The sugarcane workers in <i>Hacienda Fatima v. National Federation of Sugarcane Workers-Food and General Trade</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> were also considered as regular employees since they performed the same tasks every season for several years:<br><br><blockquote>For respondents to be excluded from those classified as regular employees, it is not enough that they perform work or services that are seasonal in nature.&nbsp; They must have also been employed <i>only for the duration of one season</i>. . . . Evidently, petitioners employed respondents for more than one season.&nbsp; Therefore, the general rule of regular employment is applicable.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The CA did not err when it ruled that <i>Mercado v. NLRC</i> was not applicable to the case at bar.&nbsp; In the earlier case, the workers were required to perform phases of agricultural work for a definite period of time, after which their services would be available to any other farm owner.&nbsp; They were not hired regularly and repeatedly for the same phase/s of agricultural work, but on and off for any single phase thereof.&nbsp; On the other hand, herein respondents, <b><i>having performed the same tasks for petitioners every season for several years, are considered the latter’s regular employees for their respective tasks</i></b>.&nbsp; Petitioners’ eventual refusal to use their services — even if they were ready, able and willing to perform their usual duties whenever these were available — and hiring of other workers to perform the tasks originally assigned to respondents amounted to illegal dismissal of the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Respondent NTRCI engaged the services of petitioner Paz as a seasonal sorter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and had been regularly rehired from 1974,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> until she was informed in 2003 that she was being retired under company policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The services petitioner Paz performed as a sorter were necessary and indispensable to respondent NTRCI’s business of flue-curing and redrying tobacco leaves.&nbsp; She was also regularly rehired as a sorter during the tobacco seasons for 29 years since 1974.&nbsp; These considerations taken together allowed the conclusion that petitioner Paz was a regular seasonal employee, entitled to rights under Article 279<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the Labor Code:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 279. Security of Tenure</b>.&nbsp; In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title.&nbsp; An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.</blockquote><br><b>Illegal dismissal and backwages</b><br><br>Petitioner Paz initially filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal seeking separation pay, but later amended her Complaint into one for payment of retirement pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Despite the amendment, she maintained in her subsequent pleadings that she had been made to retire even before she reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 under Article 287, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Paz alleged that respondent NTRCI required her to report on March 18, 2003 for the 2003 tobacco season, but she suffered a mild stroke sometime in April.&nbsp; Nevertheless, respondent NTRCI extended her employment contract until May 18, 2003 when she was informed that she was retired under company policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Since petitioner Paz was “unlearned and not knowledgeable in law, [she] just accepted such fact and waited to be paid her separation/retirement benefit as promised by . . .

National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> discussed these rules and enumerated the four possible situations considering these rules:<br><br><blockquote>Dismissals based on just causes contemplate acts or omissions attributable to the employee while dismissals based on authorized causes involve grounds under the Labor Code which allow the employer to terminate employees.&nbsp; A termination for an authorized cause requires payment of separation pay.&nbsp; When the termination of employment is declared illegal, reinstatement and full backwages are mandated under Article 279.&nbsp; If reinstatement is no longer possible where the dismissal was unjust, separation pay may be granted.<br><br>Procedurally, (1) if the dismissal is based on a just cause under Article 282, the employer must give the employee two written notices and a hearing or opportunity to be heard if requested by the employee before terminating the employment: a notice specifying the grounds for which dismissal is sought a hearing or an opportunity to be heard and after hearing or opportunity to be heard, a notice of the decision to dismiss; and (2) if the dismissal is based on authorized causes under Articles 283 and 284, the employer must give the employee and the Department of Labor and Employment written notices 30 days prior to the effectivity of his separation.<br><br>From the foregoing rules four possible situations may be derived: (1) the dismissal is for a just cause under Article 282 of the Labor Code, for an authorized cause under Article 283, or for health reasons under Article 284, and due process was observed; (2) the dismissal is without just or authorized cause but due process was observed; (3) the dismissal is without just or authorized cause and there was no due process; and (4) the dismissal is for just or authorized cause but due process was not observed.<br><br>In the first situation, the dismissal is undoubtedly valid and the employer will not suffer any liability.<br><br>In the second and third situations where the dismissals are illegal, Article 279 mandates that the employee is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time the compensation was not paid up to the time of actual reinstatement.<br><br>In the fourth situation, the dismissal should be upheld.&nbsp; While the procedural infirmity cannot be cured, it should not invalidate the dismissal.&nbsp; However, the employer should be held <i>liable for non-compliance with the procedural requirements of due process.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br><i>Agabon</i> focused on the fourth situation when dismissal was for just or authorized cause, but due process was not observed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Agabon </i>involved a dismissal for just cause, and this court awarded P30,000.00 as nominal damages for the employer’s non-compliance with statutory due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Jaka Food Processing Corporation v.

It then considered her as having worked for every tobacco season from 1974 to 2003 or for a total of 29 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission discussed that “[i]t would be a great injustice if [petitioner Paz’s] services which did not last long for six months be disregarded in computing her retirement pay especially so that it is upon the sole discretion of the respondent company on how long her services for a given season was required.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it explained that “Zenaida Paz’s retirement pay should be computed pursuant to RA 7641 and that all the months she was engaged to work for respondent for the last twenty eight (28) years should be added and divide[d] by six (for a fraction of six months is considered as one year) to get the number of years her retirement pay should be computed.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission also discussed that applying the computation of separation pay in <i>Philippine Tobacco</i> to this case “would render nugatory the very purpose of RA 7641, which seeks to reward employees of their long and dedicated service to their employer, as well as its humanitarian purpose to provide for the retiree’s sustenance and hopefully even comfort, when he no longer has the stamina to continue earning his livelihood.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>This court in <i>Philippine Tobacco</i> explained its computation of separation pay as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The amount of separation pay is based on two factors: the amount of monthly salary and the number of years of service.&nbsp; Although the Labor Code provides different definitions as to what constitutes “one year of service,” Book Six does not specifically define “one year of service” for purposes of computing separation pay.&nbsp; However, Articles 283 and 284 both state in connection with separation pay that a fraction of at least six months shall be considered one whole year.&nbsp; Applying this to the case at bar, we hold that the amount of separation pay which respondent members of the Lubat and Luris groups should receive is one-half (1/2) their respective average monthly pay during the last season they worked multiplied by the number of years they actually rendered service, provided that they worked for at least six months during a given year.<br><br>The formula that petitioner proposes, wherein a year of work is equivalent to actual work rendered for 303 days, is both unfair and inapplicable, considering that Articles 283 and 284 provide that in connection with separation pay, a fraction of at least six months shall be considered one whole year.&nbsp; Under these provisions, an employee who worked for only six months in a given year — which is certainly less than 303 days — is considered to have worked for one whole year.<br><br>. . . . Finally, <i>Manila Hotel Company v. CIR </i>did not rule that seasonal workers are considered at work during off-season with regard to the computation of separation pay.&nbsp; Said case merely held that, in regard to seasonal workers, the employer-employee relationship is not severed during off-season but merely suspended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Philippine Tobacco</i> considered Articles 283 and 284 of the Labor Code on separation pay, and these articles include the proviso “a fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.”<br><br>While the present case involves retirement pay and not separation pay, Article 287 of the Labor Code on retirement pay similarly provides that “a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.”<br><br>Thus, this court’s reading of this proviso in the Labor Code in <i>Philippine Tobacco</i> applies in this case.&nbsp; An employee must have rendered at least six months in a year for said year to be considered in the computation.<br><br>Petitions for review pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court can raise only questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>&nbsp; Generally, this court accords great respect for factual findings by quasi-judicial bodies, even according such findings with finality when supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found “no positive proof o[n] the total number of months [petitioner Paz] actually rendered work [for respondent NTRCI].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, both the Labor Arbiter and the Court of Appeals established from the records that she rendered at least six months of service for 1995, 1999, and 2000 only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Based on these factual findings, retirement pay pursuant to Article 287 of the Labor Code was correctly computed at P12,487.50 and was awarded to petitioner Paz.<br><br><b>Financial assistance</b><br><br>In addition, this court agrees with the Court of Appeals’ award of financial assistance in the amount of P60,356.25<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> by applying the following formula: one-half-month pay<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> multiplied by 29 years in service and then divided by 2.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>The amount of P12,487.50 is indeed too meager to support petitioner Paz who has become old, weak, and unable to find employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Republic Act No. 7641 is a social legislation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> with the purpose of “provid[ing] for the retiree’s sustenance and hopefully even comfort, when he [or she] no longer has the stamina to continue earning his [or her] livelihood.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals recognized and emphasized petitioner Paz’s three decades of hard work and service with respondent NTRCI.&nbsp; However, it disagreed with the National Labor Relations Commission’s retirement pay computation for lack of factual basis:<br><br><blockquote>Private respondent Paz rendered almost three decades of dedicated service to petitioner, and to that, she gave away the prime of her life.&nbsp; In those long years of hard work, not a single transgression or malfeasance of any company rule or regulation was ever reported against her.&nbsp; Old age and infirmity now weaken her chances of employment.&nbsp; Veritably, We can call upon the same “social and compassionate justice” allowing financial assistance in special circumstances.&nbsp; These circumstances indubitably merit equitable concessions, via the principle of “compassionate justice” for the working class.<br><br><b><i>In awarding retirement benefits, the NLRC deemed it proper to add all the months of service rendered by private respondent Paz, then divide it by six to arrive at the number of years of service.&nbsp; We cannot, however, subscribe to this computation because there is no positive proof of the total number of months that she actually rendered work</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>At most, the Petition alleges that “[p]etitioner [was] regularly hired every season by respondents, her employment periods ranging from three (3) to seven (7) months.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>&nbsp; None of the lower courts, not even the National Labor Relations Commission that proposed the formula, made a factual determination on the total number of months petitioner Paz rendered actual service.<br><br>In any event, this court has awarded financial assistance “as a measure of social justice [in] exceptional circumstances, and as an equitable concession.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>In <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.
