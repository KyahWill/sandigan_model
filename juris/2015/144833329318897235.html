				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is the May 6, 2015 Evaluation, Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) finding Fredelito R. Baltazar, Clerk of Court II, Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Allacapan-Lasam, Cagayan guilty of dishonesty and misconduct and recommending his suspension for one year.<br><br>A financial audit was conducted by the audit team on the books of account of the MCTC, Allacapan-Lasam, Cagayan for the period covering January 1, 2005 to May 24, 2013. The audit was prompted by the request of the Financial Management Office (FMO) of the OCA due to Baltazar's failure to submit monthly financial reports despite the notices sent to him.<br><br>In its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 22, 2014, the audit team reported that there were cash shortages in the Fiduciary Fund (FF), Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF), Mediation Fund (MF), and General Fund (GF) amounting to P72,376.80. It also noticed discrepancies in the collection and allocation of filing fees, tampering of official receipts, and unexplained withdrawals from the funds. The report stated that in the exit interview, Baltazar admitted that he had tampered with the official receipts. He also admitted that he used court collections for personal consumption with the intent to pay back the total amount misappropriated.<br><br>The auditors noted that Baltazar's acts constitute gross neglect of duty and dishonesty as an accountable officer, in violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 dated June 15, 2000 which requires that collections for all funds must be deposited daily or if not possible at the end of each month to the nearest depository bank. It further noted that Baltazar violated OCA Circular No. 113-2004 which requires the monthly submission of financial reports to the Accounting Division, FMO, OCA. In addition, Baltazar is liable for not complying with OCA Circular No. 22-94 which requires that duplicate and triplicate copies of court receipts be carbon reproductions in all respects of the original.<br><br>The audit team thus recommended the following:<br><blockquote><ol><li>This report be docketed as a regular administrative matter against Mr. Fredelito R. Baltazar, Clerk of Court II, MCTC, Allacapan-Lasam, Cagayan for non-remittance of collections, tampering of court official receipts and non-submission of Monthly Financial Reports in violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000, OCA Circular Nos. 22-94 and 113-2004, respectively;<br><br></li><li> Mr. Fredelito R. Balatazar be DIRECTED within fifteen (15) days from receipt of notice to:<br><br>2.1. EXPLAIN in writing why no administrative sanction shall be imposed against him for non-submission of Monthly Financial Reports, delayed remittances of collections, tampering of the subsequent court official receipts and for incurring cash shortages, as presented below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

He was directed to submit documents pertaining to missing collections, bank confirmations on deposits made to the JDF and withdrawals from the FF. He was also placed on indefinite suspension without pay.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated August 11, 2014, Baltazar stated that poor health hampered his ability to accomplish and submit monthly reports.

Despite the advice, he continued to report for work for short periods of time so that he may be able to get something done. He also stated that he often acted as the Clerk of Court as well as Designated Court Interpreter.<br><br>He wrote that another reason for the delay was the "encashment of checks of my co-employees out of my collections, in order that they will be able to free from rediscounting fees whenever their checks were encashed in private establishments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> These checks of his co-employees were dishonored by Land Bank.<br><br>Baltazar admitted that he violated Supreme Court Circulars with respect to the Guidelines for the Collections and Custody of Legal Fees and Proper Administration of Court Funds.

Baltazar not only failed to remit cash collections immediately, he also failed to explain the tampered official receipts and misappropriated judiciary funds when he accommodated to encash co-employee's checks out of the cash collections. However, considering that Baltazar readily admitted his mistake, apologized for his actions, vowed to concentrate on his job, to improve his performance with competence, honesty and probity and this being his first infraction, the OCA recommended that Baltazar be suspended for a period of one (1) year without pay. Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, it [is] respectfully recommended for the consideration of the Honorable Court that respondent Clerk of Court II Fredelito R. Baltazar, [MCTC], Allacapan-Lasam, Cagayan be found <b>GUILTY</b> of dishonesty and misconduct and be SUSPENDED for one (1) year without pay with a <b>STERN WARNING</b> that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We adopt the findings of the OCA but modify the penalty imposed.<br><br>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Ofilas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> this Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>No less than the Constitution mandates that "public office is a public trust." Service with loyalty, integrity and efficiency is required of all public officers and employees, who must, at all times, be accountable to the people. In a long line of cases, the Court had untiringly reminded employees involved in the administration of justice to faithfully adhere to their mandated duties and responsibilities. Whether committed by the highest judicial official or by the lowest member of the workforce, any act of impropriety can seriously erode the people's confidence in the Judiciary. "Verily, the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct of its personnel. It is their sacred duty to maintain the good name and standing of the court as a true temple of justice." Corollary to this, failure to live up to their avowed duty constitutes a transgression of the trust reposed on them as court officers and inevitably leads to an exercise of disciplinary authority. Thus, the Court "condemns and would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part of all those involved in the administration of justice which would violate the norm of public accountability and would diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary." The Judiciary expects the best from all its employees who must be paradigms in the administration of justice. (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>As a general directive to all court employees, A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC or the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, under Canon I, Sections 1 and 5 provide:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Court personnel shall not use their official position to secure unwarranted benefits, privileges or exemptions for themselves or for others.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 5. Court personnel shall use the resources, property and funds under their official custody in a judicious manner and solely in accordance with the prescribed statutory and regulatory guidelines or procedures.</blockquote><br>Clerks of Court perform an important role in the judicial process.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Similarly, OCA Circular No. 113-2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> requires all clerks of court of lower courts to submit monthly reports of collections and deposits specifically for the JDF, SAJF and FF not later than the 10th day of each month.<br><br>In addition, OCA Circular No. 22-94 provides that the DUPLICATE and TRIPLICATE copies of court receipt must be carbon reproductions in all respects of whatever may have been written in the ORIGINAL.<br><br>Consequently, given the sensitive duties of a clerk of court, this Court considers them as the chief administrative officers of their respective courts and requires them to act with competence, honesty and probity in accordance with their duty of safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[16]</sup></font> They are judicial officers entrusted to perform delicate functions with regard to the collection of legal fees, and as such, are expected to implement regulations correctly and effectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Verily, this Court has often reminded clerks of court that they act as custodians of court funds, and that they are to immediately deposit the funds which they receive in their official capacity to the authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep such funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Here, Baltazar neglected to submit monthly financial reports to the FMO, which prompted the request for the audit. After the audit, it was found that there are unexplained cash shortages in the various funds under Baltazar's control which remain to be unrestituted. While this Court sympathizes with his illness, the Court does not see it sufficient reason for the non-accomplishment of the monthly financial reports. This Court notes that Baltazar merely submitted an X-Ray report without a doctor's certification. In his attempt to justify not being able to perform his duties, he inadvertently admitted to have used cash collections of the court in some check rediscounting scheme with his fellow employees. This despite the clear prohibition imposed by Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 against the use of the fund for encashment of personal checks. Indeed, the use of court funds for purposes other than for what it is expected may constitute malversation.<br><br>Moreover, Baltazar did not satisfactorily address the issue of tampering with official receipts to make it appear that a lower amount had been paid than was actually received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Tampering with official court receipts in violation of OCA Circular No. 22-94 is a serious matter which Baltazar merely glossed over. The report of the audit team reveals that he merely reported a collection of P15.00 or P35.00 when he in fact received a bigger amount. This demonstrates to our mind a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court. Additionally, Baltazar failed to provide any reason for the unexplained withdrawals from the accounts for the period January 2008 to November 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Baltazar provides us with a list of documents which he allegedly had submitted but his letter to this Court only has the X-Ray report as an attachment. Hence, the veracity of such submission cannot be verified.<br><br>All of the acts taken as a whole evince Baltazar's propensity for chicanery and dishonesty which, to our mind render him unfit for the position of clerk of court. Given Baltazar's acts and numerous violations of the Court's administrative circulars, the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Courts and the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, we find him guilty of gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty.<br><br>However, we cannot agree with the OCA in finding that mitigating circumstances are attendant in the present case. Jurisprudence cited by it particularly <i>Re: Administrative Case for Dishonesty Against Elizabeth Ting</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and <i>Re: Failure of Jose Dante E. Guerrero to register His Time In and Out in the Chronolog Time Recorder Machine on Several Dates,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> does not approximate the gravity of the situation herein faced by Baltazar. One, the cited cases do not involve clerks of court of first level court but individuals who work under the Office of the Clerk of Court with this Court. And two, the respondents in the cited cases do not function as accountable officers of the court. We therefore find these cases not analogous to the case at bar.<br><br>When clerks of court are found to have been engaged in seriously dishonest and grave misconduct, this Court has not hesitated to impose the maximum penalty of dismissal at the first infraction from the service as prescribed under Section 46, Rule 10, Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 46. <i>Classification of Offenses</i>.</b> - Administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave or light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service.<br><br>A.
