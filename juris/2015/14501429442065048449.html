				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated August 17, 2006 of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. SP No. 00204-MIN, and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 4, 2007, which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Petitioners, except for Mark Brazil and Nestor Macapayag, are members of the Miarayon, Lapok, Lirongan, Talaandig Tribal Association (<i>MILALITTRA</i>), or Talaandig tribe, who claimed to have been living since birth on the land located at <i>Barangay</i> Miarayon, Talakag, Bukidnon, Mindanao, which they inherited from their forefathers.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents, represented by attorney-in-fact Ramon Aberasturi, claimed to be the lawful owners and possessor of an unregistered parcel of agricultural land (Lot No. 7367 Cad 630-D), with an area of 105.7361 hectares, which appears to be located within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe.<br><br>On March 3, 2004, respondents filed a Petition for <i>Accion Reivindicatoria,</i> with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction with Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<i>original complaint for accion reivindicatoria</i>) against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court of Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon (<i>RTC</i>). Docketed as Civil Case No. 04-03-01, the petition was raffled off to Branch 11.<br><br>On March 20, 2004, petitioners Macapayag and Brazil filed their Answer, alleging that respondents have no cause of action against them.<br><br>On March 23, 2004, the rest of the petitioners filed their Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the case. Petitioners alleged that with the advent of Republic Act No. (<i>RA</i>) 8371, otherwise known as the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act (<i>IPRA</i>), they, together with the rest of the tribe members, assisted the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (<i>NCIP</i>) in the processing, validation, and delineation of their Ancestral Domain claim in May 2003. On July 25, 2003, Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (<i>CADT</i>) No. R-10-TAL-0703-0010 was issued by virtue of NCIP <i>En Banc</i> Resolution No. 08-02003 to the Talaandig tribe over its ancestral domain in Talakag, Bukidnon, containing an area of 11,105.5657 hectares. On October 30, 2003, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo awarded the said CADT to the Talaandig tribe. As awardees of a CADT, petitioners argued that NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case, as the subject matter concerns a dispute and controversy over an ancestral land/domain of Indigenous Cultural Communities (<i>ICCs</i>)/Indigenous Peoples (<i>IPs</i>).<br><br>On July 1, 2004, the NCIP through Atty. Melanie Pimentel, filed a Motion to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office-National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (<i>RHO-NCIP</i>), alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.<br><br>On July 5, 2004, respondents filed a Motion to Amend and Supplement Complaint from Accion Reivindicatoria to one for "Injunction, Damages, and Other Relief," with the attached Amended and Supplemental Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (<i>amended complaint for injunction</i>). On July 30, 2004, petitioners filed an Opposition thereto.<br><br>On August 1, 2004, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended and Supplemental Complaint, alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case and to issue a writ of injunction therein.<br><br>On August 10, 2004, the RTC issued an Order granting the Motion to Amend and Supplement Complaint, and declared petitioners' Motion to Refer the Case to the RHO-NCIP and Motion to Dismiss moot and academic as a consequence of the grant of the said motion to amend and supplement complaint.<br><br>On August 17, 2004, petitioners filed a Manifestation praying for an ocular inspection of the disputed land to determine the last, actual, peaceable, uncontested status of the area.<br><br>On August 25, 2004, petitioners filed another Motion to Refer the Case to the RHO-NCIP and Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint.<br><br>On September 14, 2004, respondents filed their Opposition and Motion for Judgment by Default.<br><br>On February 14, 2005, the RTC issued an Order<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[6]</sup></font> resolving all pending incidents before it, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, defendant's [herein petitioners'] motion to refer the case to the RHO-NCIP and its manifestation for an ocular inspection are hereby denied for being bereft of merit. Further, defendants [petitioners], except Macapayag and Brazil, are hereby declared in default for their failure to file their Answer to the Amended Complaint. Accordingly, let this case, as against defendants Macapayag and Brazil, be called for pre-trial and <i>ex-parte</i> presentation of evidence as against the rest of defendants [petitioners] on <b>May 2, 2005</b> at <b>9:00 o'clock in the morning.</b> Furthermore, the injunctive writ prayed for by the plaintiffs is hereby GRANTED for being meritorious. Accordingly, defendants [petitioners], their agents and privies, or any other or all persons acting for and in their behalves, are hereby ordered to observe, maintain and preserve the <i>status quo</i> subject of the action and/or the relation between the parties in order to protect the rights of the plaintiffs while the case is pending in court and to cease and desist from performing any acts that in one way or another contravene the tenor of this order, while awaiting final determination of the instant suit or until further orders of this court. Furthermore, to answer for whatever damage that defendants [petitioners] may sustain by reason of this injunction order if the court should finally decide that plaintiffs [respondents] are not entitled to the relief it prayed for, plaintiffs [respondents] are hereby directed to put up a bond in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00) executed in favor of the party enjoined.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>On April 12, 2005, petitioners filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and Prohibition with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order.<br><br>On August 17, 2006, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC's February 14, 2005 Order, which in turn denied the referral of the case to the NCIP, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby partly GRANTED. The assailed Order dated February 14, 2005 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the order of default against petitioners, except Macapayag and Brazil, is hereby LIFTED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The CA ruled that the RTC correctly granted the amendment of the complaint and properly refused to refer the case to the RHO-NCIP. Based on the allegations of both original complaint [<i>accion reivindicatoria</i>] and amended complaint [injunction], the CA found that the subject matter of both complaints is well within the jurisdiction of the RTC. The CA noted that the only substantial amendment made was with regard to the nature of the action which originally was one of <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> and then changed to one for damages. And except for some amendments as to petitioners' alleged violent acts and the prayer for declaration of their title to the subject property, the rest of the amended complaint was basically the same as the original one, including the reliefs prayed for by respondents. Anent the writ of preliminary injunction, the CA held that the RTC's assailed February 14, 2005 Order is self-explanatory as to why the issuance of the same was proper considering the circumstances of the case.<br><br>On July 4, 2007, the CA denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration of its August 17, 2006 Decision.<br><br>Hence, this appeal on <i>certiorari </i>raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>I. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> OVER A COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTION INVOLVING AN ANCESTRAL DOMAIN OF THE TALAANDIGS.<br><br>II. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE RESOLUTION OF THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ALLOWING THE AMENDMENT OF THE COMPLAINT, THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO CONFER JURISDICTION ON THE LOWER COURT.<br><br>III. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RESOLVING THAT EVIDENCE MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT WHEN IN THE ORIGINAL ACTION FOR SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> BEFORE IT, THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> HAS ADMITTED THAT A CADT WAS ISSUED IN FAVOR OF PETITIONERS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>On the first issue, petitioners contend that the RTC has no jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 04-03-0 for Injunction, Damages and other Relief, because the 105.7361-hectare land claimed by respondents is undisputedly within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe over which a CADT has already been issued. Petitioners insist that, even granting that the case is purely a personal action, the NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over it as it concerns a claim and dispute involving rights of ICCs/IPs over their ancestral domain.<br><br>On the second issue, petitioners argue that the amendment of the complaint from <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> to injunction with damages was clearly meant to oust the NCIP of its jurisdiction over the case and confer it on the RTC by concealing the real issue in the case, which is the parties' conflicting claims over the 105.7361-hectare land in Miarayon, Talakag Bukidnon. According to petitioners, the cause of action in the complaint for <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> is the claim of ownership and recovery of possession of the said land which is undisputedly found within the Talaandig tribe's ancestral domain covered by CADT No. R10-TAL-0703-0010; hence, a claim within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the NCIP. Petitioners contend that respondents amended the complaint to one for injunction to downplay the real issue which is the dispute over a land that is within the Talaandig tribe's ancestral domain, and mainly capitalized on the acts complained of, such as harassment, threats, acts of terrorism, among others, supposedly committed against respondents.<br><br>On the third issue, petitioners fault the CA in ruling that whether the complaint is one for Injunction or <i>Accion Reivindicatoria,</i> the RTC has jurisdiction because nowhere in respondents' original and amended complaints is it stated that petitioners were members of the ICCs or IPs and that the disputed property was part of their ancestral domain. Petitioners take exception to the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the complaint, as strict adherence thereto would open the floodgates to the unscrupulous practice of litigants divesting the NCIP of jurisdiction by crafting their complaints in such a way as would confer jurisdiction on their court of choice. Petitioners contend that the literal averments of the complaint are not determinative of the jurisdiction over the subject matter where the actual issues are evidenced by subsequent pleadings; in certain cases, the real nature and character of the pleadings and issues are not merely found in the complaint, but also in the subsequent pleadings submitted by both parties. Petitioners stress that although the complaint banners the subject matter as one for injunction, the pleadings of respondents show that the subject matter is the conflicting ownership claims over the land. In fact, petitioners point out that the records of the case show that various pieces of evidence have been presented to prove that the dispute involves conflicting claims over a land covered by a CADT.<br><br>For their part, respondents contend that petitioners do not have legal capacity or standing and <i>locus standi</i> to file this petition, since they failed to make <i>prima facie</i> showing that they are members of IPs/ICCs, or that they were authorized to represent the Talaandig tribe. Respondents insist that based on the allegations in their amended complaint for injunction and damages, the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject matter which is a purely personal action and incapable of pecuniary estimation. Respondents assert that the real issue is whether or not petitioners are guilty of wrongful acts of violence, terrorism, destruction, intimidation, harassment, etc., to justify a permanent injunction and hold the latter liable for damages. Respondents also point out that petitioners cannot invoke protection under the IPRA 8731, because the conflict does not involve an ancestral domain and they (respondents) are not IPs so the condition precedent before bringing a dispute before the NCIP cannot be satisfied, <i>i.e.,</i> exhaustion of remedies under customary laws by the parties.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>On the procedural issue raised by respondents, the Court disagrees with their contention that petitioners do not have legal capacity or standing and <i>locus standi</i> to file the petition, for failure to show that they are members of IPs/ICCs, or that they are authorized to represent the Talaandig tribe.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> is defined as a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question. In private suits, standing is governed by the "real parties in interest" rule found in Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Such concept of real party-in-interest is adapted in Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Rule VI of the 2014 Revised Rules of Procedure before the NCIP. That petitioners are the real parties in interest can be gleaned from the Entry of Appearance with Motion to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office of the NCIP<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[12]</sup></font> filed by the NCIP Special Transition Team-Quick Response Unit (STRAT-QRU). The STRAT-QRU counsels alleged therein that the respondents' complaint for recovery of ownership (<i>accion reinvidicatoria</i>) sought to recover an unregistered real property situated in Miarayon, Bukidnon, from petitioners, all of whom are, with the exception of Nestor Macapayag and Mark Brazil, member-beneficiaries of CADT No. R10-TAL-0703-0010 issued by the NCIP in the name of the Talaandig Indigenous Peoples, located at Talakag, Province of Bukidnon. In support of their allegation, petitioners presented a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that the disputed land is within the area covered by the same CADT, and the NCIP List of Beneficiaries of Talaandig Ancestral Domain of Miarayon, Lirongan, Lapok, San Miguel, Talakag, Bukidnon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In contrast, respondents failed to submit any evidence to dispute petitioners' claim that they are members of the Talaandig Tribe. Hence, respondents' contention that petitioners have no legal standing to file the petition, is without merit.<br><br>In resolving the pivotal issue of which between the RTC and the NCIP has jurisdiction over the respondents' amended complaint, foremost in the Court's mind is the principle in "that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise a concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action. The nature of an action, as well as which court or body has jurisdiction over it, is determined based on the allegations contained in the complaint of the plaintiff, irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein. The averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted. Once vested by the allegations in the complaint, jurisdiction also remains vested irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Under Section 19 of B.P. 129, as amended (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), the RTC shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation, and in all civil actions which involve title to, possession of, real property or any interest therein where the assessed value of the property or interest therein exceeds Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value exceeds Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).<br><br>On the other hand, the NCIP's jurisdiction is defined under Section 66 of the IPRA as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 66. <i>Jurisdiction of the NCIP</i>. - The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over <b>all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs</b>; Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>On the matter of NCIP's jurisdiction and of procedures for enforcement of rights, NCIP Administrative Order No. 1, 1998, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (<i>NCIP-IRR</i>) of the IPRA, Rule IX, Section 1 states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Primacy of Customary Law</i>. - All conflicts related to the ancestral domain and lands, involving ICCs/IPs, such as but not limited to the conflicting claims and boundary disputes, shall be resolved by the concerned parties through the application of customary laws in the area where the disputed ancestral domain or land is located.<br><br><b>All conflicts related to the ancestral domain or lands where one of the parties is non-ICC/IP or where the dispute could not be resolved through customary law shall be heard and adjudicated in accordance with the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure before the NCIP to be adopted hereafter.</b><br><br>All decisions of the NCIP may be brought on Appeal by Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Order or Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>In line with Section 69 of the IPRA on the NCIP's quasi-judicial power to promulgate rules and regulations governing the hearing and disposition of cases filed before it, the NCIP issued Administrative Circular No. 1-03 dated April 9, 2003, known as the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure (<i>NCIP Rules</i>), which reiterates its jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and enumerates the actions that may be brought before it. Section 5, Rule III, of the NCIP Rules provides for the jurisdiction of the NCIP-RHO:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>Jurisdiction of the NCIP</i>. - The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of the IPRA 8371, including but not limited to the following:<br><br>(1) Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer (RHO):<br><blockquote><b>a. Cases involving disputes, controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;</b><br>b. Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICC/IPs;<br>c. Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;<br>d. Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) ofR.A. 8371; and<br>e. Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.</blockquote>(2) Original jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer:<br><blockquote><b>a. Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and</b><br>b. Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371;<br></blockquote>(3) Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:<br><blockquote><b>a. Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371. Provided that such action is filed within one (1) year from the date of registration.</b></blockquote></blockquote><br>Anent the condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA, Sections 13 and 14, Rule IV of the NCIP Rules pertinently provide:<br><br><blockquote>Section 13. <i>Certification to File Action.</i> - Upon the request of the proper party, members of the indigenous dispute settlement group or council of elders shall likewise issue a certification to file action before the NCIP. In giving due regard to customary laws, the certification may be in any form so long as it states in substance the failure of settlement notwithstanding the efforts made under customary law or traditional practices.<br><br>Section 14. <i>Exceptions.</i> - The certification shall not be required in the following cases:<br><br><b>a. Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;<br><br>b. Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;</b><br><br>c. Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and<br><br>d. Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuse to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Having spelled out the jurisdictions conferred by law to the RTC and the NCIP over the subject matters of their respective cases, the Court now examines the allegations in the original and amended complaints to find out which tribunal may properly exercise jurisdiction over this case.<br><br>In their original complaint for <i>accion reivindicatoria,</i> respondents traced the provenance of their title over said land to one Mamerto Decano, a Chieftain of Talaandig tribe, by virtue of a Deed of Sale executed on July 27, 1957. They averred that, together with their predecessor-in-interest, they have religiously paid the real estate taxes thereon since 1957 and that they have been in physical, actual, open, prior, notorious, continuous, public and adverse possession of said land in the concept of owners for more than 50 years, even prior to June 12, 1945. They alleged that said land was declared alienable and disposable since August 3, 1927 per certification of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. They claimed that by means of fraud, stealth and surreptitious means, petitioners entered the said land, without permission and against the consent of the landowners, caused damages therein and harassed respondents by indiscriminately firing upon their farm workers. They added that petitioners continue such harassment by means of armed men frequenting the campsite and firing M-16 rifles at them during nighttime, causing great fear and threat.<br><br>Respondents prayed before the RTC for the following reliefs, among others: (1) to cause the preliminary injunction to be made permanent for the respondents to enjoy possession of their property, free from threats of physical harm, harassment and undue obstruction caused by petitioners; (2) to order petitioners to respect and not to harass, intimidate and cause trouble to the prior possession of respondents as the owners by virtue of right of title; (3) to order petitioners to pay moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, appearance fees and costs of suit; and (4) to declare respondents' title as having become a vested right, and as such entitled to all right and incident of an absolute owner.<br><br>In their amended complaint for injunction and damages, on the other hand, respondents further alleged that sometime in November 2003, petitioners harassed, intimidated, threatened, and fired high-powered rifles upon respondents' farm workers to drive them away from the land, without legal or justifiable reason. They added that, despite having hired private security guards to secure and protect their property, these violent incidents were followed by more acts of violence, lawlessness, harassment, terrorism to drive away respondents from the land which they claim to lawfully own and possess.<br><br>Respondents prayed before the RTC for the following reliefs: (1) to order petitioners and their representatives, to stop and refrain from committing acts of violence, destruction, assault and other forms of lawlessness and terrorism against respondents, and to maintain the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the 105-hectare land by respondents as an attribute of ownership; (2) to declare petitioners to have committed acts of violence, harassment, intimidation, destruction, assault and other forms of lawlessness against respondents, and to permanently order petitioners to stop and refrain from committing similar acts; and (3) to hold petitioners jointly and severally liable to pay respondents actual damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and treble costs.<br><br>After a perusal of the allegations and prayers in both original and amended complaints, the Court notes that respondents neither alleged therein that the parties are members of ICCs/IPs nor that the case involves a dispute or controversy over ancestral lands/domains of ICC/IPs. Rather, the allegations in respondents' original complaint make up for an <i>accion reivindicatoria</i>, a civil action which involves an interest in a real property with an assessed value of P683,760.00, while the allegations in their amended complaint make out a case for injunction, a civil action which is incapable of pecuniary estimation. The Court therefore finds that the CA correctly ruled that the subject matter of the amended complaint based on allegations therein was within the jurisdiction of the RTC.<br><br>Meanwhile, contrary to petitioners' contention, the mere fact that this case involves members of ICCs/IPs and their ancestral land is not enough to for it to fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 66. <i>Jurisdiction of the NCIP</i>. ~ The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs; Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.</blockquote><br>A careful review of Section 66 shows that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. This can be gathered from the qualifying provision that "no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP."<br><br>The qualifying provision requires two conditions before such disputes may be brought before the NCIP, namely: (1) exhaustion of remedies under customary laws of the parties, and (2) compliance with condition precedent through the said certification by the Council of Elders/Leaders. This is in recognition of the rights of ICCs/IPs to use their own commonly accepted justice systems, conflict resolution institutions, peace building processes or mechanisms and other customary laws and practices within their respective communities, as may be compatible with the national legal system and with internationally recognized human rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Section 3 (f) of the IPRA defines customary laws as a body of written and/or unwritten rules, usages, customs and practices traditionally and continually recognized, accepted and observed by respective ICCs/IPs. From this restrictive definition, it can be gleaned that it is only when both parties to a case belong to the same ICC/IP that the abovesaid two conditions can be complied with. If the parties to a case belong to different ICCs/IPs which are recognized to have their own separate and distinct customary laws and Council of Elders/Leaders, they will fail to meet the abovesaid two conditions. The same holds true if one of such parties was a non-ICC/IP member who is neither bound by customary laws as contemplated by the IPRA nor governed by such council. Indeed, it would be violative of the principles of fair play and due process for those parties who do not belong to the same ICC/IP to be subjected to its customary laws and Council of Elders/Leaders.<br><br>Therefore, pursuant to Section 66 of the IPRA, the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. When such claims and disputes arise between or among parties who do not belong to the same ICC/IP,<i> i.e.,</i> parties belonging to different ICC/IPs or where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP, the case shall fall under the jurisdiction of the proper Courts of Justice, instead of the NCIP. In this case, while most of the petitioners belong to Talaandig Tribe, respondents do not belong to the same ICC/IP.

Both original and amended complaints, <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> and injunction, respectively, are incapable of pecuniary estimation; thus falling within the jurisdiction of the RTC. As correctly pointed out by the ponencia, "jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise a concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It cannot be acquired through a waiver or enlarged by the omission of the parties or conferred by the acquiescence of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>However, I would like to submit some points for consideration which run counter to the opinion of my esteemed colleague. It is my position that the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) regardless of whether or not they belong to the same IP/IC Community. This is pursuant to Section 66 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8371,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> otherwise known as "The Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997" (IPRA) as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. — <b>The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs</b>: Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>A careful scrutiny of Section 66 of the IPRA would reveal that it is composed of three parts: (1) the NCIP has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs; (2) the requirement of exhaustion of all remedies provided under the customary laws of the ICCs/IPs; and (3) a certification from the Council of Elders/Leaders as a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with NCIP.<br><br>The first part lays down the basis of jurisdiction of the NCIP. It can be gleaned from this part that the law is silent if the parties should belong to the same IP/IC Community. What the law only provides is that the NCIP has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs.<br><br>The second part contains the <i>proviso</i> that should be followed before the NCIP acquires jurisdiction over the case. Said <i>proviso</i> states: "Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws."<br><br>The third part, on the other hand, refers to the certification from the Council of Elders/Leaders as a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with NCIP. This is in relation to the second part requiring the exhaustion of all remedies.<br><br>The second and third parts of the provision should not be interpreted as limiting the jurisdiction of the NCIP to claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. The <i>proviso</i> only provides for a condition precedent. It is merely procedural and does not divest the NCIP of jurisdiction over parties not belonging to the same IP/IC Community. As provided in Section 14, Rule IV of the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the NCIP (NCIP Rules), a party which does not belong to the same IP/IC Community is exempted from the requirement of certification, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14. Exceptions. The certification shall not be required in the following cases:<br><ol type="a"><li> Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;</b><br><br></li><li>Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and<br><br></li><li>Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuses to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons. (Emphasis supplied.)</li></ol></blockquote><br>Thus, it is my position that the NCIP has jurisdiction over the following:<br><blockquote>a. claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP; and<br><br>b. claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among ICCs/IPs even if one of the parties does not belong to the same IP/IC Community.</blockquote><br>All cases and disputes where both parties are ICCs/IPs fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the NCIP. Consequently, all cases and disputes where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP are covered by the jurisdiction of the regular courts regardless of the subject matter even if it involves ancestral domains or lands of ICCs/IPs. Moreover, the regular courts have jurisdiction over cases and disputes as long as there are parties who are non-ICCs/IPs.<br><br>To limit the jurisdiction of the NCIP to claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP would be contrary to the purpose for which the NCIP was created. It must be pointed out that the NCIP is an administrative body entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under its special knowledge and training. It is charged with the implementation of the law, considering its competence, expertise, experience and informed judgment. As such, the NCIP is vested with quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers. It is the primary government agency "responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It is quasi-judicial because it has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving the rights of the ICCs/IPs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It is quasi-legislative because of its rule-making power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Because of its expertise in the field of ICCs/IPs, it is better equipped than the trial courts in resolving the claims and disputes involving rights where the parties are both ICCs/IPs.<br><br>Anent the issue as to what customary laws apply in cases where the parties involved in the claims and disputes do not belong to the same IP/IC Community, the NCIP may apply the customary law common to both ICCs/IPs or that which can be applied by analogy.<br><br>Furthermore, it must be pointed out that there is no need to declare the following provisions as null and void:<br><br>i. The first and third paragraphs of Rule IX, Section 1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8371 which provide:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1. Primacy of Customary Law</b>. All conflicts related to ancestral domains and lands, involving ICCs/IPs, such as but not limited to conflicting claims and boundary disputes, shall be resolved by the concerned parties through the application of customary laws in the area where the disputed ancestral domain or land is located.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>All decisions of the NCIP may be brought on Appeal by Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Order or Decision.<br><br>ii. Rule III, Section 5 of the NCIP Rules which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section. 5. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of R.A. 8371, including but not limited to the following:<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>(1) Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Office (RHO):<br><ol type="a"><li> Cases involving disputes and controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;<br><br></li><li>Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICCs/IPs;<br><br></li><li>Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;<br><br></li><li>Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) of R.A. 8371; and<br><br></li><li>Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.</li></ol>(2) Original Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer:<br><ol type="a"><li>Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and<br><br></li><li>Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371.</li></ol>(3) Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:<br><ol type="a"><li>Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371.

Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules which provide:<br><br><blockquote>Section 13. Certification to File Action. Upon the request of the proper party, members of the indigenous dispute settlement group or council of elders shall likewise issue a certification to file action before the NCIP. In giving due regard to customary laws, the certification may be in any form so long as it states in substance the failure of settlement notwithstanding the efforts made under customary law or traditional practices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Section 14.

Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;<br><br>b. Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;<br><br>c. Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and<br><br>d. Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuse to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>The abovementioned rules can be interpreted in harmony with the provisions of the IPRA law. Said rules do not expand the jurisdiction of the NCIP but merely enumerate the claims and disputes falling within its jurisdiction. Section 14(b) does not automatically dispense with the certification required by law as the parties may opt to voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders. This is akin to a<i> barangay</i> conciliation proceeding under the Local Government Code wherein the conciliation process is a condition precedent that affects the sufficiency of the cause of action, not the jurisdiction of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>However, the second paragraph of Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR of R.A. No. 8371 is not anchored on legal mooring. Said paragraph reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Primacy of Customary Law. <i>All conflicts related to the ancestral domains or lands where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP</i> or where the dispute could not be resolved through customary law shall be heard and adjudicated in accordance with the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedures Before the NCIP to be adopted hereafter. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As earlier discussed, Section 66 of R.A. No. 8371 is explicit that the NCIP's jurisdiction is confined only to claims and disputes where the parties are both ICCs/IPs. Such being the case, the second paragraph of Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR of R.A. No. 8371 should be declared null and void because it is contrary to the provision of Section 66 of the IPRA. It is well-settled that an administrative rule or regulation must conform, not contradict, the provisions of the enabling law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> A rule or regulation cannot modify, expand, or subtract from the law it is intended to implement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Any rule that is not consistent with the statute itself is null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Since the rule in question is at war with Section 66 of R.A.

But I clarify and emphasize my view that while the NCIP possesses quasi-judicial powers, its jurisdiction is only primary, and not exclusive.<br><br><center><i><b>The RTC's February 14, 2005 order is<br>NOT tainted with grave abuse of discretion.</b></i></center><br>The present petition is an appeal from the CA's dismissal of the petitioner's petition for certiorari. Hence, this Court must determine whether the CA correctly ruled that the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the February 14, 2005 order.<br><br>The petitioners alleged before the CA that the February 14, 2005 order is tainted with grave abuse because it: (i) denied the petitioners' motion to refer the case to the NCIP; (ii) declared the petitioners in default; and (iii) issued the writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> has traditionally defined grave abuse of discretion as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Grave abuse of discretion is defined as capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.<br></blockquote><br>Based on this definition, I share the view that the RTC did not abuse its discretion, much less commit any grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>At the time the respondents amended the complaint, the petitioners had yet to file their answers to the original complaint, hence, the amendment was still a matter of right. The rule on amendments as a matter of right applies to a co-defendant who has yet to file his responsive pleading, even if his co-defendants have already done so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thus, while Macapayag and Brazil have filed their answers, the respondents still have the right to amend the complaint with respect to the rest of the petitioners.<br><br>Likewise, the RTC did not abuse its discretion in declaring the petitioners in default and in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>The RTC declared the petitioners in default only after they failed to file their answers within the period allowed. On the other hand, the writ of preliminary injunction sought to maintain the <i>status quo</i> to prevent both parties from committing further acts of violence; there is no caprice in maintaining the peace.<br><br>Nevertheless, default orders are issued on the presumption that the defendant no longer opposes the allegations and reliefs demanded in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In this case, the petitioners vehemently opposed the RTC's cognizance of the complaint, and refused to file their answers because they believed that jurisdiction belongs to the NCIP.<br><br><i>In the interest of justice, I support the CA in lifting the order of default to allow the parties to try the case on the merits.</i><br><br><center><i><b>Jurisdiction is determined <br>by the allegations of the complaint</b></i></center><br>Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by law and by the material allegations of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Under these standards, the petitioner's argument, i.e., that the NCIP has jurisdiction because the case involves the rights of ICCs/IPs, is without merit.<br><br>As the <i>ponencia </i>pointed out, both the original and the amended complaints do not allege that the respondents were ICCs/IPs, or that the dispute involves an ancestral dominion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Hence, on the face of the respondents' complaint, the RTC has jurisdiction over the injunction case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Neither am I impressed with the petitioners' argument that, where the actual issue is evidenced by the subsequent pleadings, jurisdiction does not depend on the complaint's literal averments. This Court has consistently ruled that jurisdiction never depends on the defenses set up in the answer, in a <i><u>motion to dismiss</u></i> or in a motion for reconsideration.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font><br><br><center><i><b>The NCIP's jurisdiction over <i>disputes</i> is limited<br>where both parties are members of the same ICC/IP.</b></i></center><br>I join the <i>ponencia</i> in ruling that the NCIP does not have jurisdiction over <i>disputes</i> where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP, or where the opposing parties are members of different ICC/IP.<br><br>My concurrence is based on the following: <b>(i) Section 66 contains a proviso that limits the NCIP's jurisdiction; (ii) the RTC, not the NCIP, has jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of ICC/IP rights; (iii) Congress had no intention to apply customary laws to non-ICCs/IPs.</b><br><br>I. <u><b><i>Section 66 contains a proviso that<br>limits the NCIP's jurisdiction.</i></b></u><br><br>The NCIP's jurisdiction is outlined in IPRA's Section 66:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. — The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and <b>disputes</b> involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided, however, That no such <b>dispute</b> shall be brought to the NCIP unless the <b>parties</b> have exhausted all remedies provided under <b>their</b> customary laws. <b>For this purpose</b>, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)</blockquote><br>Section 66 is composed of three parts: the <i><b>first</b></i> states the NCIP's jurisdiction; the <i><b>second</b></i> requires the prior exhaustion of remedies under customary law; and the <i><b>third</b></i> states that a certification from the council of elders/leaders is a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.<br><br>The first part lays down the NCIP's jurisdiction, i.e., over all claims and disputes <i><b>involving the rights of ICCs/IPs.</b></i> The NCIP's jurisdiction is not dependent on who the parties are, but <i><b>on whether the dispute involves the rights of ICCs/IPs.</b></i><br><br>However, the second part contains the proviso "Provided, However, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws." The third part begins with the phrase "for this purpose"; the "purpose" referred to being the exhaustion of remedies under their customary laws.<br><br>Jurisprudence tells us that<i> the office of a proviso is to limit the application of the law</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Taking these considerations into account, while the NCIP's jurisdiction is initially couched in general terms to include any and all disputes involving the rights of ICCs/IPs, the second and third parts limit the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes where both parties have remedies to exhaust under customary laws.<br><br>Consequently, the NCIP does not have jurisdiction over disputes involving non-ICCs/IPs because non-ICCs/IPs have no customary laws to exhaust.<br><br>The limitation likewise applies to disputes where the opposing parties are members of different ICCs/IPs.<br><br>Each ICC/IP has its own set of customary laws and council of elders/leaders. To require members of a particular ICC/IP to appear before the council of elders/leaders of another ICC/IP would be to require the former to observe the customary laws of the latter. This is repugnant to the right of each ICC/IP to use its own commonly accepted justice systems, conflict resolution institutions, and peace building processes or mechanisms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><i><b>II. <u>The RTC not the NCIP, has<br>jurisdiction over violations of ICC/IP rights<br>committed by Non-ICC/IP.</u></b></i><br><br>As I had earlier discussed, <i>the first part of Section 66 shows that jurisdiction is not dependent on who the parties are to the dispute, but on <b>whether the dispute involves the rights of ICCs/IPs.</b></i><br><br>Guided by the rule that provisos should not be construed to limit the main provisions of the statute;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court must not read Section 66 in isolation but must read it together with the related provision. In this case, the Court must identify the rights of ICCs/IPs, and determine whether the NCIP is the proper venue for the enforcement of these rights.<br><br>The IPRA grants ICCs/IPs rights: (i) over ancestral domains/lands;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (ii) to self-governance and employment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (iii) to social justice and human rights;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and (iv) to cultural integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> These rights are spread throughout several chapters, mainly under Chapters III to VI.<br><br>It must be noted, however, that most of these rights are state policies, and only the following are clearly demandable and enforceable: the rights over ancestral domains and lands;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the right against unlawful intrusion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the right to equal protection and to nondiscrimination;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the right against unlawful acts pertaining to employment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the rights to religious, cultural sites and ceremonies, including archaeological artifacts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and the right to withhold access to biological and genetic resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Section 72 of the IPRA provides that <i>any person</i> who violates the rights of ICCs/IPs shall be punished "in accordance with the customary laws of the ICCs/IPs concerned....<i>without prejudice</i> to the right of the ICC/IP concerned to avail of the protection of "<i><u>existing laws</u>...

An express caveat under the customary law option is that the penalty must not be cruel, degrading, or inhuman, nor shall it consist of the death penalty or excessive fines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Since the regular courts, not the NCIP, have jurisdiction over national laws, then the NCIP's jurisdiction is limited to punishment under customary laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><i>The NCIP's power to impose penalties under customary laws presents two important issues: <b>first,</b> whether it is legally possible to punish non-ICCs/IPs with penalties under customary laws; and <b>second</b>, whether a member of a particular ICC/IP could be punished in accordance with the customary laws of another ICC/IP.</i><br><br>Laws that provide for fines, forfeitures, or <i>penalties</i> for their violation or otherwise impose a burden on the people, such as tax and revenue measures, must be published.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Most customary laws are not written, much less published. Hence, it is highly unlikely that the NCIP or even the regular courts have the power to penalize non-ICCs/IPs with these<i> penalties </i>under customary laws. A contrary ruling would be constitutionally infirm for lack of due process.<br><br>Similarly, an ICC/IP cannot be punished under the customary law of another. Otherwise, the former would be forced to observe a non-binding customary law.<br><br><i>Therefore, while the NCIP has jurisdiction over violations of ICC/IP rights, its jurisdiction is limited to those committed by and against members of the same ICC/IP.</i><br><br>This view does not detract from the IPRA's policy to "protect the rights of ICCs/IPs." ICCs/IPs, whose rights are violated by non-ICCs/IPs or by members of a different ICC/IP, can still file criminal charges before the regular courts. In this situation, the NCIP's role is not to adjudicate but to provide ICCs/IPs with "legal assistance in litigation involving community interest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><i><b>III. <u>Congress had no intention to apply<br> customary laws to non-ICCs/IPs.</u></b></i><br><br>Some might conceivably argue that Congress passed the IPRA and created the NCIP precisely to bind non-ICCs/IPs to customary laws.<br><br>I do not agree with this view.<br><br>The records of the Senate and the bicameral committee hearings show that the legislators focused mainly on: (i) the grant of Ancestral Domains/Lands to ICCs/IPs; (ii) the NCIP's organizational transition from its predecessor-agencies; and (iii) budgetary concerns. <i>Section 66 's controversial proviso was not even discussed on the Senate floor or during the bicameral committee hearings.</i><br><br>In the course of the bill's<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> early development, the Senate technical working group<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> realized that it would be difficult for the NCIP to adjudicate rights of non-ICCs/IPs under national laws, on one hand, and the rights of ICCs/IPs under customary laws, on the other. They were likewise concerned with the possible conflict between the customary laws of contending ICCs/IPs.<br><br>As a solution, the Senate technical working group proposed the creation of the Office on Policy, Planning and Research (OPPR) and a Consultative Body that will compile all customary laws, and assist the NCIP in its exercise of quasi-judicial powers:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Mike Mercado<br> (representative of Sen.

So before these are codified, we cannot now mandate that the same must immediately be applicable.

For the petitioners, with a submission that the <i>ponencia</i> already dismissed, the mere fact that this case involves members of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Persons (ICCs/IPs) and their ancestral land, automatically endows the NCIP, under Section 66 of the IPRA, with jurisdiction over petitioners' complaint. Even the NCIP is of the view of its original and exclusive jurisdiction over both the original and amended complaints. Hence, the two (2) Motions to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office-National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (RHO-NCIP) filed by the NCIP Hearing Officer before the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia </i>on the basis of the principle that "jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint, and that the averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted." As clearly delineated in the <i>ponencia,</i> upon a careful review of Section 66 and based on the qualifying proviso, the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. And, as clearly alleged by the petitioners in their complaint, the defendants they impleaded are not indigenous people.<br><br>I submit that the jurisdiction of the NCIP ought to be definitively drawn to settle doubts that still linger due to the implicit affirmation done in <i>The City Government of Baguio City, et al. v.

Such a complaint may be the subject of criminal or administrative proceedings, or both.<br><br><i>For purposes of investigation and prosecution, Ombudsman cases involving criminal offenses may be subdivided into two classes, to wit: (I) those cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, and (2) those falling under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. The difference between the two, aside from the category of the courts wherein they are filed, is on the authority to investigate as distinguished from the authority to prosecute, such cases.<br><br>The power to investigate or conduct a preliminary investigation on any Ombudsman case may be exercised by an investigator or prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman, or by any Provincial or City Prosecutor or their assistance, either in their regular capacities or as deputized Ombudsman prosecutors.<br><br>The prosecution of cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan shall be under the direct exclusive control and supervision of the Office of the Ombudsman. In cases cognizable by the regular Courts, the control and supervision by the Office of the Ombudsman is only in Ombudsman cases in the sense defined above. The law recognizes a concurrence of jurisdiction between the Office of the Ombudsman and other investigative agencies of the government in the prosecution of cases cognizable by regular courts.</i><br><br><b>It is noteworthy that as early as 1990, the Ombudsman had properly differentiated the authority to investigate cases from the authority to prosecute cases. It is on this note that the Court will first dwell on the nature or extent of the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate cases. Whence, focus is directed to the second sentence of paragraph (1), Section 15 of the Ombudsman Act which specifically provides that the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigating agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.<br><br>That the power of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is not exclusive but is concurrent with other similarly authorized agencies of the government such as the provincial, city and state prosecutors has long been settled in several decisions of the Court. </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br><br>In <i>Cojuangco, Jr. vs. Presidential Commission on Good Government,</i> decided in 1990, the Court expressly declared:<br><br>A reading of the foregoing provision of the Constitution does not show that the power of investigation including preliminary investigation vested on the Ombudsman is exclusive.<br><br>Interpreting the primary jurisdiction of the Ombudsman under Section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act, the Court held in said case:<br><br>Under Section 15 (1) of Republic Act No. 6770 aforecited, the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan so that it may take over at any stage from any investigatory agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.<i> The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is not exclusive but is concurrent with other similarly authorized agencies of the government. Such investigatory agencies referred to include the PCGG and the provincial and city prosecutors and their assistants, the state prosecutors and the judges of the municipal trial courts and municipal circuit trial court.<br><br>In other words the provision of the law has opened up the authority to conduct preliminary investigation of offenses cognizable by the Sandiganbayan to all investigatory agencies of the government duly authorized to conduct a preliminary investigation under Section 2, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure with the only qualification that the Ombudsman may take over at any stage of such investigation in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction.</i><br><br>A little over a month later, the Court, in <i>Deloso vs. Domingo</i>, pronounced that the Ombudsman, under the authority of Section 13 (1) of the 1987 Constitution, has jurisdiction to investigate any crime committed by a public official, elucidating thus:<br><br>As protector of the people, the office of the Ombudsman has the power, function and duty to "act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials" (Sec. 12) and to "investigate x x x any act or omission of any public official x x x when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient." (Sec. 13.) The Ombudsman is also empowered to "direct the officer concerned," in this case the Special Prosecutor, "to take appropriate action against a public official xxx and to recommend his prosecution" (Sec. 13).<br><br>The clause "any [illegal] act or omission of any public official" is broad enough to embrace any crime committed by a public official. The law does not qualify the nature of the illegal act or omission of the public official or employee that the Ombudsman may investigate. It does not require that the act or omission be related to or be connected with or arise from, the performance of official duty. Since the law does not distinguish, neither should we.<br><br>The reason for the creation of the Ombudsman in the 1987 Constitution and for the grant to it of broad investigative authority, is to insulate said office from the long tentacles of officialdom that are able to penetrate judges' and fiscals' offices, and others involved in the prosecution of erring public officials, and through the exertion of official pressure and influence, quash, delay, or dismiss investigations into malfeasances and misfeasances committed by public officers. It was deemed necessary, therefore, to create a special office to investigate <i>all</i> criminal complaints against public officers regardless of whether or not the acts or omissions complained of are related to or arise from the performance of the duties of their office. The Ombudsman Act makes perfectly clear that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman encompasses "<i>all kinds of malfeasance, misfeasance, and non-feasance</i> that have been committed by any officer or employee as mentioned in Section 13 hereof, during his tenure of office" (Sec. 16, R.A. 6770).<br><br>Indeed, the labors of the constitutional commission that created the Ombudsman as a special body to investigate erring public officials would be wasted if its jurisdiction were confined to the investigation of minor and less grave offenses arising from, or related to, the duties of public office, but would exclude those grave and terrible crimes that spring from abuses of official powers and prerogatives, for it is the investigation of the latter where the need for an independent, fearless, and honest investigative body, like the Ombudsman, is greatest.<br><br>At first blush, there appears to be conflicting views in the rulings of the Court in the<i> Cojuangco, Jr. </i>case and the <i>Deloso</i> case. However, the contrariety is more apparent than real. In subsequent cases, the Court elucidated on the nature of the powers of the Ombudsman to investigate.<br><br>In 1993, the Court held in <i>Sanchez vs. Demetriou,</i> that while it may be true that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute any illegal act or omission of any public official, the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate is merely a primary and not an exclusive authority, thus:<br><br>The Ombudsman is indeed empowered under Section 15, paragraph (1) of RA 6770 to investigate and prosecute any illegal act or omission of any public official. However as we held only two years ago in the case of <i>Aguinaldo vs. Domagas</i>, this authority "is not an exclusive authority but rather a shared or concurrent authority in respect of the offense charged."<br><br>Petitioners finally assert that the information and amended information filed in this case needed the approval of the Ombudsman. It is not disputed that the information and amended information here did not have the approval of the Ombudsman. However, we do not believe that such approval was necessary at all. In <i>Deloso v. Domingo</i>, 191 SCRA 545 (1990), the Court held that the Ombudsman has authority to investigate charges of illegal acts or omissions on the part of any public official, i.e., any crime imputed to a public official. <i>It must, however, be pointed out that the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate "any [illegal] act or omission of any public official" (191 SCRA 550) is not an exclusive authority but rather a shared or concurrent authority in respect of the offense charged</i>, i.e., the crime of sedition. Thus, the non-involvement of the office of the Ombudsman in the present case does not have any adverse legal consequence upon the authority of the panel of prosecutors to file and prosecute the information or amended information.<br><br><i>In fact, other investigatory agencies of the government such as the Department of Justice in connection with the charge of sedition, and the Presidential Commission on Good Government, in ill gotten wealth cases, may conduct the investigation.</i><br><br>In <i>Natividad vs. Felix</i>, a 1994 case, where the petitioner municipal mayor contended that it is the Ombudsman and not the provincial fiscal who has the authority to conduct a preliminary investigation over his case for alleged Murder, the Court held:<br><br>The <i>Deloso</i> case has already been re-examined in two cases, namely <i>Aguinaldo vs. Domagas</i> and <i>Sanchez vs. Demetriou</i>. However, by way of amplification, we feel the need for tracing the history of the legislation relative to the jurisdiction of Sandiganbayan since the Ombudsman's primary jurisdiction is dependent on the cases cognizable by the former.<br><br>In the process, we shall observe how the policy of the law, with reference to the subject matter, has been in a state of flux.<br><br>These laws, in chronological order, are the following: (a) Pres. Decree No. 1486, — the first law on the Sandiganbayan; (b) Pres. Decree No. 1606 which expressly repealed Pres. Decree No. 1486; (c) Section 20 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129; (d) Pres. Decree No. 1860; and (e) Pres. Decree No. 1861.<br><br>The latest law on the Sandiganbayan, Sec. 1 of Pres. Decree No. 1861 reads as follows:<br><br>"SECTION 1. Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606 is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br>'SEC. 4. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. - The Sandiganbayan shall exercise: '(a) Exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:<br><br>(2) Other offenses or felonies committed by public officers and employees <i>in relation to their office</i>, including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporation, whether simple or complexed with other crimes, where the penalty prescribed by law is higher that prision correccional or imprisonment for six (6) years, or a fme of P6,000: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that offenses or felonies mentioned in this paragraph where the penalty prescribed by law does not exceed prision correccional or imprisonment for six (6) years or a fme of P6,000 shall be tried by the proper Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court and Municipal Circuit Trial Court."<br><br>A perusal of the aforecited law shows that two requirements must concur under Sec. 4 (a) (2) for an offense to fall under the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction, namely: the offense committed by the public officer must be in relation to his office and the penalty prescribed be higher then <i>prision correccional</i> or imprisonment for six (6) years, or a fine of P6,000.00.<br><br>Applying the law to the case at bench, we find that although the second requirement has been met, the first requirement is wanting. A review of these Presidential Decrees, except Batas Pambansa Big. 129, would reveal that the crime committed by public officers or employees must be "in relation to their office" if it is to fall within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. This phrase which is traceable to Pres. Decree No. 1468, has been retained by Pres. Decree No. 1861 as a requirement before the Ombudsman can acquire primary jurisdiction on its power to investigate.<br><br><i>It cannot be denied that Pres. Decree No. 1861 is in pan materia to Article XI, Sections 12 and 13 of the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 because, as earlier mentioned, the Ombudsman's power to investigate is dependent on the cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan. Statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same person or thing or to the same class of persons or things, or object, or cover the same specific or particular subject matter.<br><br>It is axiomatic in statutory construction that a statute must be interpreted, not only to be consistent with itself, but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, "interpretare et concordare legibus est optimus interpretandi, " or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. Thus, in the application and interpretation of Article XI, Sections 12 and 13 of the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989, Pres. Decree No. 1861 must be taken into consideration. It must be assumed that when the 1987 Constitution was written, its framers had in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter. In the absence of any express repeal or amendment, the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 are deemed in accord with existing statute, specifically, Pres. Decree No. 1861.</i><br><br>R.A. No. 8249 which amended Section 4, paragraph (b) of the Sandiganbayan Law (P.D. 1861) likewise provides that for other offenses, aside from those enumerated under paragraphs (a) and (c), to fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, they must have been committed by public officers or employees in relation to their office.<br><br><b>In summation, the Constitution, Section 15 of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 and Section 4 of the Sandiganbayan Law, as amended, do not give to the Ombudsman exclusive jurisdiction to investigate offenses committed by public officers or employees. The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is concurrent with other government investigating agencies such as provincial, city and state prosecutors. However, the Ombudsman, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, may take over, at any stage, from any investigating agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.<br><br>In other words, respondent DOJ Panel is not precluded from conducting any investigation of cases against public officers involving violations of penal laws but if the cases fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, then respondent Ombudsman may, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction take over at any stage</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br><b>To reiterate for emphasis, the power to investigate or conduct preliminary investigation on charges against any public officers or employees may be exercised by an investigator or by any provincial or city prosecutor or their assistants, either in their regular capacities or as deputized Ombudsman prosecutors. The fact that all prosecutors are in effect deputized Ombudsman prosecutors under the OMB-DOJ Circular is a mere superfluity. The DOJ Panel need not be authorized nor deputized by the Ombudsman to conduct the preliminary investigation for complaints filed with it because the DOJ's authority to act as the principal law agency of the government and investigate the commission of crimes under the Revised Penal Code is derived from the Revised Administrative Code which had been held in the <i>Natividad </i>case as not being contrary to the Constitution. Thus, there is not even a need to delegate the conduct of the preliminary investigation to an agency which has the jurisdiction to do so in the first place. However, the Ombudsman may assert its primary jurisdiction at any stage of the investigation.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>I referred to<i> Honasan II </i>to emphasize the point that the NCIP cannot be said to have primary jurisdiction over all the ICC/IP cases comparable to what the Ombudsman has in cases falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. We do not find such specificity in the grant of jurisdiction to the NCIP in Section 66 of the IPRA.<br><br>Neither does the IPRA confer <b>original and exclusive jurisdiction</b> to the NCIP over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs.<br><br>Here, I revert to the point on the investiture of primary and/or original and exclusive jurisdiction to an administrative body which in all instances of such grant was explicitly provided in the Constitution and/or the enabling statute, to wit:<br><br>1.

Even as a practical concern, non-IPs and non-members of ICCs ought to be excepted from the NCIP's competence since it cannot determine the right-duty correlative, and breach thereof, between opposing parties who are ICCs/IPs and non-ICCs/IPs, the controversy necessarily contemplating application of other laws, not only customs and customary law of the ICCs/IPs. In short, the NCIP is only vested with jurisdiction to determine the rights of ICCs/IPs based on customs and customary law in a given controversy against another ICC/IP, but not the applicable law for each and every kind of ICC/IP controversy even against an opposing non-ICC/IP.<br><br>In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court delineated the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, specifically paragraph 3 thereof, as all money claims of workers, limited to "cases arising from employer-employee relations." The same clause was not expressly carried over, in printer's ink, in Article 217 as it exists today, but the Court ruled that such was a limitation on the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission is outlined in Article 217 of the Labor Code xxx:<br><br>"ART. 217. Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission. — (a) The Labor Arbiters shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide within thirty (30) working days after submission of the case by the parties for decision, the following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:<br><br>1. Unfair labor practice cases;<br><br>2. Those that workers may file involving wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;<br><br>3. All money claims of workers, including those based on non-payment or underpayment of-wages, overtime compensation, separation pay and other benefits provided by law or appropriate agreement, except claims for employees' compensation, social security, medicare and maternity benefits;<br><br>4. Cases involving household services; and<br><br>5. Cases arising from any violation of Article 265 of this Code, including questions involving the legality of strikes and lockouts.<br><br>(b) The Commission shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters."<br><br>While paragraph 3 above refers to "all money claims of workers," <b>it is not necessary to suppose that the entire universe of money claims that might be asserted by workers against their employers has been absorbed into the original and exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters</b>. In the first place, paragraph 3 should be read not in isolation from but rather within the context formed by paragraph 1 (relating to unfair labor practices), paragraph 2 (relating to claims concerning terms and conditions of employment), paragraph 4 (claims relating to household services, a particular species of employer-employee relations), and paragraph 5 (relating to certain activities prohibited to employees or to employers). It is evident that there is a unifying element which runs through paragraphs 1 to 5 and that is, that they all refer to cases or disputes arising out of or in connection with an employer-employee relationship. This is, in other words, a situation where the rule of noscitur a sociis may be usefully invoked in clarifying the scope of paragraph 3, and any other paragraph of Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended. We reach the above conclusion from an examination of the terms themselves of Article 217, as last amended by BP Blg. 227, and even though earlier versions of Article 217 of the Labor Code expressly brought within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters and the NLRC "cases arising from employer-employee relations,'" which clause was not expressly carried over, in printer's ink, in Article 217 as it exists today. For it cannot be presumed that money claims of workers which do not arise out of or in connection with their employer-employee relationship, and which would therefore fall within the general jurisdiction of the regular courts of justice, were intended by the legislative authority to be taken away from the jurisdiction of the courts and lodged with Labor Arbiters on an exclusive basis. The Court, therefore, believes and so holds that the "money claims of workers" referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 217 embraces money claims which arise out of or in connection the employer-employee relationship, or some aspect or incident of such relationship. Put a little differently, that money claims of workers which now fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters are those money claims which have some reasonable causal connection with the employer-employee relationship. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Clearly, the phraseology of "<b>all</b> claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs" does not necessarily grant the NCIP all-encompassing jurisdiction whenever the case involves rights of ICCs/IPs without regard to the status of the parties, i.e. whether the opposing parties are both ICCs/IPs.<br><br>In all, for the reason that under the provisions of the IPRA, specifically Section 66 thereof, the jurisdiction of the NCIP is special and limited, confined only to cases involving rights of IPs/ICCs, where both such parties belong to the same ICC/IP, the original and amended complaint herein properly fall within the jurisdiction of the regular courts, specifically the RTC.

Jurisdiction of the NCIP. The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.<br></blockquote><br>Section 66's grant of jurisdiction is <i>ostensibly </i>cast in absolute terms: "over <i><b>all</b></i> claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs."<br><br>However, further into Section 66 are two clauses that qualify the NCIP's jurisdiction. First is the proviso that "<i>no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. " Second is that "a certification . . . issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved . . . shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. "</i><br><br>A cursory reading of these clauses shows that they state a procedural requirement (i.e., exhaustion of remedies under customary law) and a formal requirement (i.e., certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders) that must first be complied with before the NCIP may take cognizance of a case. However, these procedural and formal requirements are not all there is to the qualifying clauses of Section 66.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Attention must be drawn to the proviso's choice of words. To reiterate, the proviso reads: "Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless <b><i>the parties</i></b> have exhausted all remedies provided under <b><i>their</i></b> customary laws."<br><br>The proviso uses the plural term "the parties." It also uses the plural "their," which is a possessive pronoun substituting for the noun phrase "the parties."<br><br>The use of the <i><b>plural </b></i>"the parties" necessarily means that the requirement of exhaustion of remedies provided under customary laws is a requirement that is<i><b> not exclusive </b></i>to a singular party.<br><br>The basic framework of adversarial litigation, as is the case in our a jurisdiction, is one that entails two (2) parties: first, the one initiating or bringing the action (i.e., the plaintiff/complainant/ claimant/petitioner); and the one against whom an action is initiated or brought (i.e., the defendant/respondent).<br><br>Thus, for Section 66 to say that "the parties" must exhaust all remedies is to say that <i><b>both</b></i> plaintiff/complainant/claimant/petitioner, on one hand, and defendant/respondent, on the other, must comply. In a case brought by A against B, both A and B must comply with the requirement.<br><br>Had Section 66 intended that compliance with the requirement by only one party shall suffice, it should have used the singular "<i><b>a party</b></i>," similar language like "<i><b>either party</b></i>" or permissive language like "<i><b>a/the party/ies</b></i>? Had Section 66 intended that the requirement must be complied with by a specific party, it should have used specific language like "<i><b>the petitioner</b></i>."<br><br>One may point out that the plural "the parties" can be taken to mean two or more of several petitioners, or two or more of several respondents where there are multiple petitioners and/or respondents. This interpretation is untenable. Precisely, it would find application <i><b>only</b></i> in situations where there are multiple petitioners and/or respondents. To adopt this interpretation would, therefore, be to unduly restrict and to render inutile under general circumstances the requirement of exhaustion of remedies.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The phrase "their customary laws" is significant in two respects. First, "their" is a plural possessive pronoun substituting for the noun phrase "the parties." Second, "their" is a possessive determiner indicating possession (or otherwise a sense of belonging) of the words that follow it.<br><br>Section 66's use of the phrase "their customary laws" is, therefore, to say that "the parties" have customary laws. Considering what the phrase "the parties" refers to (as explained previously), it follows that both the petitioner(s) and the respondent(s) must have or adhere to customary laws in order that a case between them may fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP.<br><br>Section 3(f) of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act defines "customary laws" as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. Definition of Terms. — For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean:<br>. . . .<br><br>f) Customary Laws — refer to a body of written and/or unwritten rules, usages, customs and practices <i>traditionally and continually recognized, accepted and observed by respective ICCs/IPs</i>[.] (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It is evident that only those belonging to ICCs/IPs have or adhere to customary laws. Since Section 66 refers to parties having customary laws, it follows that the NCIP's jurisdiction, as defined in Section 66 of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act, is limited to parties who belong to ICCs/IPs. It excludes those who do not.<br><br>To hold otherwise is to summarily compel those who do not belong to ICCs/IPs to adhere and subject themselves to customary laws despite their not having "traditionally and continually recognized, accepted[,] and observed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> these laws. This runs afoul of fair play and violates their right to due process.<br><br>Thus, Section 66's qualifiers—as specifically worded—indicate that cases that fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP must be limited to those where both parties belong to ICCs/IPs.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>The requirement that both parties must exhaust all remedies provided under their customary laws necessarily means that both parties must belong to the same ICC/IP.<br><br>The word "respective" denotes "belonging or relating to each one of the people or things that have been mentioned."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[26]</sup></font><br><br>Section 3(f) of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act conceives of "customary laws" as "refer[ring] to a body of ... rules, usages, customs[,] and practices traditionally and continually recognized, accepted[,] and observed by <i><b>respective</b></i> ICCs/IPs." Thus, inherent in the Act's conception of "customary laws" is a recognition that each ICC/IP has a set of continually recognized, accepted, and observed rules, usages, customs, and practices that is <i><b>distinct and separate</b></i> from those of other ICCs/IPs.<br><br>The recognition that ICCs/IPs have distinct customary laws is similarly a recognition that each ICC/IP has a distinct dispute settlement mechanism pursuant to their respective customary laws. To belong to a specific ICC/IP is, therefore, to say that one adheres not only to a specific set of customary laws but also to a specific dispute settlement mechanism applicable to that ICC/IP.<br><br>Thus, much as interpreting Section 66 as encompassing disputes where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP runs afoul of fair play and violates the (non-ICC/IP member's) right to due process, so does interpreting Section 66 as encompassing disputes where the parties belong to different ICCs/IPs. As with the former, to make such a conclusion is to summarily compel a party who adheres to a specific set of customary laws and dispute settlement mechanisms to adhere and be subjected to another set of customary laws.<br><br>Rule IV, Section 14 of NCIP Administrative Circular No. 1-03, the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure Before the NCIP (NCIP Rules) provides for situations "[w]here one of the parties . . . does not belong to the same IP/IC Community" as an exception to the requirement of a certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute. This is a recognition that the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act does not provide a dispute settlement mechanism where the parties belong to different ICCs/IPs. However, even as Rule IV, Section 14 of the NCIP Rules does away with the certification requirement, it cannot serve to extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes involving parties from different ICCs/IPs.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Extending the NCIP's jurisdiction to those who do not belong to an indigenous cultural community or are not indigenous peoples finds no support elsewhere in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act.<br><br>Section 66 is the sole provision of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act that spells out the NCIP's jurisdiction in respect of the <i><b>exercise of its quasi-judicial power</b></i>.<br><br>This court has defined quasi-judicial power as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power on the other hand<i> is the power of the administrative agency to adjudicate the rights of persons before it.</i> It is the power to hear and determine questions of fact to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law. The administrative body exercises its quasi-judicial power when it performs in a judicial manner an act which is essentially of an executive or administrative nature, where the power to act in such manner is incidental to or reasonably necessary for the performance of the executive or administrative duty entrusted to it. In carrying out their quasi-judicial functions the administrative officers or bodies are <i>required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence, and draw conclusions from them as basis for their official action and exercise of discretion in a judicial nature.</i> Since rights of specific persons are affected it is elementary that in the proper exercise of quasi-judicial power due process must be observed in the conduct of the proceedings.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[27]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Judicial power, in turn, has been defined in <i>Macasiano v.

The rules and regulations that administrative agencies promulgate, which are the product of a delegated legislative power to create new and additional legal provisions that have the effect of law, should be within the scope of the statutory authority granted by the legislature to the objects and purposes of the law, and should not be in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law.<br><br>To be valid, an administrative rule or regulation must conform, not contradict, the provisions of the enabling law. An implementing rule or regulation cannot modify, expand, or subtract from the law it is intended to implement. Any rule that is not consistent with the statute itself is null and void.<br><br>While administrative agencies . . . may issue regulations to implement statutes, they are without authority to limit the scope of the statute to less than what it provides, or extend or expand the statute beyond its terms, or in any way modify explicit provisions of the law. Indeed, a quasi-judicial body or an administrative agency for that matter cannot amend an act of Congress. Hence, in case of a discrepancy between the basic law and an interpretative or administrative ruling, the basic law prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act does not extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes involving those who do not belong to ICCs/IPs. The precise wording of Section 66 and the silence of the remainder of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act on extending the NCIP's jurisdiction bear this out.<br><br>Likewise, "[j]urisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> No amount of administrative rule-making can vest jurisdiction where neither Constitution nor statute vests it.<br><br>Thus, Rule IX, Section 1 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act's Implementing Rules and Regulations, Rule III, Section 5, and Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules, insofar as they extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP, must be deemed null and void. They are inconsistent with the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act in that they modify and expand the NCIP's jurisdiction as spelled out in Section 66. In light of this discrepancy between a basic law and administrative rules, the basic law—the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act— must prevail.<br><br><b><center>VII<br></center></b><br>In sum, the requirements for the proper exercise of the NCIP's jurisdiction over a dispute, pursuant to Section 66 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, are as follows:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The claim or dispute must involve the rights of ICCs/IPs;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Both parties must belong to the same ICC/IP;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">These parties must have exhausted all remedies provided under their ICC/IP's customary laws; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Compliance with this requirement of exhausting remedies under customary laws must be evidenced by a certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute, to the effect that the dispute has not been resolved.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>In this case, it is not disputed that respondents do not belong to an ICC/IP. Their sole interest is in their supposed ownership and possession of land which, in turn, "appears to be located within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples may not exercise jurisdiction over the case filed by respondents.<br><br><center><b>VII</b><br></center><br>Customary norms are as varied as there are tribes within ethnolinguistic groups. If we are to animate the spirit of both the Constitution and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, we should not stereotype all cultures as homogenous or incapable of dynamic interfaces with each other. Customary law is a descriptive label which should acknowledge that each tribe lived through its own history and endogenously emerged their own set of norms reflecting their values and lifeways. To say that the customary norms of the Kalinga are the same as those of the Subanen betrays the same colonial mindset that marginalized what our colonizers called as "Non-Christian Tribes" in the distant past.<br><br>Neither should we straightjacket any culture as incapable of dynamic interfaces or accommodation with other cultures. Various groups of indigenous communities are able to work with the entirety of our legal system in appropriate cases. This case, which involves a party not of their tribe, is certainly one such case.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DENY</b> the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
