In the case at bar, the fact that the respondent represented Mariano Turla is no secret.&nbsp; The respondent has in a number of pleadings/motions/documents and even on the witness stand admitted that he drafted Mariano Turla’s <i>Affidavit of Adjudication </i>which expressly states that he was the sole heir of Rufina Turla.<br><br>And then he afterwards agreed to represent Marilu Turla who claimed to be Mariano Turla’s daughter.&nbsp; To substantiate her claim that she is Mariano Turla’s daughter, the respondent admitted that he relied on the birth certificate presented by Marilu Turla[,] which indicates that she is not only the daughter of Mariano Turla but also of Rufina Turla as evidenced by the Birth Certificate presented stating that Rufina Turla is Marilu Turla’s mother.&nbsp; This means that Marilu Turla was also a rightful heir to Rufina Turla’s inheritance and was deprived of the same because of the <i>Affidavit of Adjudication</i> which he drafted for Mariano Turla[,] stating that he is his wife’s sole heir.<br><br>. . . To further explain, the respondent[,] in agreeing to represent Marilu Turla[,] placed himself in a position where he is to refute the claim in Mariano Turla’s Affidavit of Adjudication that he is the only heir of Rufina Turla.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated May 10, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP Board of Governors) adopted and approved the findings and recommendations of the Commission on Bar Discipline.<br><br>Atty. Santos filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> which was denied by the IBP Board of Governors in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated March 22, 2014.<br><br>This administrative case was forwarded to this court through a letter of transmittal dated July 15, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> pursuant to Rule 139-B, Section 12(b) of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 139-B</center><br><div align="center">DISBARMENT AND DISCIPLINE OF ATTORNEYS<br></div><br>SEC. 12. <i>Review and decision by the Board of Governors.</i>—<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(b) If the Board, by the vote of a majority of its total membership, determines that the respondent should be suspended from the practice of law or disbarred, it shall issue a resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations which, together with the whole record of the case, shall forthwith be transmitted to the Supreme Court for final action.</blockquote><br>The issues in this case are: (1) whether respondent Atty. Santos violated the Code of Professional Responsibility; and (2) whether the penalty of suspension of three (3) months from the practice of law is proper.<br><br>This court accepts and adopts the findings of fact of the IBP Board of Governors’ Resolution.&nbsp; However, this court modifies the recommended penalty of suspension from the practice of law from three (3) months to one (1) year.<br><br>Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 15 — A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his client.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rule 15.03 — A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.</blockquote><br>The rule on conflict of interest is based on the fiduciary obligation in a lawyer-client relationship.&nbsp; Lawyers must treat all information received from their clients with utmost confidentiality in order to encourage clients to fully inform their counsels of the facts of their case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Hornilla v. Atty. Salunat,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this court explained what conflict of interest means:<br><br><blockquote>There is conflict of interest when a lawyer represents inconsistent interests of two or more opposing parties.&nbsp; <i>The test is “whether or not in behalf of one client, it is the lawyer’s duty to fight for an issue or claim, but it is his duty to oppose it for the other client.&nbsp; In brief, if he argues for one client, this argument will be opposed by him when he argues for the other client.”</i>&nbsp; This rule covers not only cases in which confidential communications have been confided, but also those in which no confidence has been bestowed or will be used.&nbsp; Also, there is conflict of interests if the acceptance of the new retainer will require the attorney to perform an act which will injuriously affect his first client in any matter in which he represents him and also whether he will be called upon in his new relation to use against his first client any knowledge acquired through their connection.&nbsp; Another test of the inconsistency of interests is whether the acceptance of a new relation will prevent an attorney from the full discharge of his duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to his client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double dealing in the performance thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Applying the test to determine whether conflict of interest exists, respondent would necessarily refute Mariano Turla’s claim that he is Rufina Turla’s sole heir when he agreed to represent Marilu Turla.&nbsp; Worse, he knew that Mariano Turla was not the only heir.&nbsp; As stated in the Report of the Commission on Bar Discipline:<br><br><blockquote>Worse[,] the respondent himself on the witness stand during his April 14, 2009 testimony in the Civil Case for <i>Sum of Money with Prayer of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order docketed as Civil Case No. 09-269</i> filed with the RTC of Makati City admitted as follows: “I called the attention of Mr. Mariano Turla[.]&nbsp; I . . . asked him what about Lulu she is entitled [sic] to a share of properties and he . . . told me, ‘Ako na ang bahala kay Lulu[,] hindi ko pababayaan yan.’&nbsp; So he asked me to proceed with the Affidavit of Adjudication wherein he claimed the whole [sic] properties for himself.”&nbsp; This very admission proves that the respondent was privy to Marilu Turla’s standing as a legal and rightful heir to Rufina Turla’s estate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>However, Rule 15.03 provides for an exception, specifically, “by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent had the duty to inform Mariano Turla and Marilu Turla that there is a conflict of interest and to obtain their written consent.<br><br>Mariano Turla died on February 5, 2009,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> while respondent represented Marilu Turla in March 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; It is understandable why respondent was unable to obtain Mariano Turla’s consent.&nbsp; Still, respondent did not present evidence showing that he disclosed to Marilu Turla that he previously represented Mariano Turla and assisted him in executing the Affidavit of Self-Adjudication.&nbsp; Thus, the allegation of conflict of interest against respondent was sufficiently proven.<br><br>Likewise, we accept and adopt the IBP Board of Governors’ finding that respondent violated Canon 10, Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which states:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 10 — A lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the court.<br><br>Rule 10.01 — A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; nor shall he mislead or allow the court to be mislead by any artifice.</blockquote><br>In the Report, the Commission on Bar Discipline explained:<br><br><blockquote>Corollary to the foregoing, the Commission by virtue of the doctrine <i>res ipsa loquitor</i> [sic] finds that the respondent’s act of failing to thwart his client Mariano Turla from filing the <i>Affidavit of Adjudication</i> despite . . . his knowledge of the existence of Marilu Turla as a possible heir to the estate of Rufina Turla, the respondent failed to uphold his obligation as a member of the bar to be the stewards of justice and protectors of what is just, legal and proper.&nbsp; Thus in failing to do his duty and acting dishonestly[,] not only was he in contravention of the Lawyer’s Oath but was also in violation of <i>Canon 10, Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>As officers of the court, lawyers have the duty to uphold the rule of law. In doing so, lawyers are expected to be honest in all their dealings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; Unfortunately, respondent was far from being honest.&nbsp; With full knowledge that Rufina Turla had another heir, he acceded to Mariano Turla’s request to prepare the Affidavit of Self-Adjudication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>This court notes that the wording of the IBP Board of Governors’ Resolutions dated May 10, 2013 and March 22, 2014 seems to imply that it is the Integrated Bar of the Philippines that has the authority to impose sanctions on lawyers.&nbsp; This is wrong.<br><br>The authority to discipline members of the Bar is vested in this court under the 1987 Constitution:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VIII<br>JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT</center><br>. . . .<br><br>Section 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, <i>the admission to the practice of law</i>, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. . . . (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Zaldivar v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> elucidated on this court’s “plenary disciplinary authority over attorneys”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and discussed:<br><br><blockquote>We begin by referring to the authority of the Supreme Court to discipline officers of the court and members of the court and members of the Bar.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, as regular and guardian of the legal profession, has plenary disciplinary authority over attorneys.&nbsp; The authority to discipline lawyers stems from the Court’s constitutional mandate to regulate admission to the practice of law, which includes as well authority to regulate the practice itself of law.&nbsp; Quite apart from this constitutional mandate, the disciplinary authority of the Supreme Court over members of the Bar is an inherent power incidental to the proper administration of justice and essential to an orderly discharge of judicial functions. . . .<br><br>. . . The disciplinary authority of the Court over members of the Bar is but corollary to the Court’s exclusive power of admission to the Bar.&nbsp; A lawyers [sic] is not merely a professional but also an officer of the court and as such, he is called upon to share in the task and responsibility of dispensing justice and resolving disputes in society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This court’s authority is restated under Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, specifically:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 138<br>Attorneys and Admission to Bar</center><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 27. <i>Disbarment or suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court, grounds therefor.</i>—A member of the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before admission to practice, or for a wilful disobedience appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do.&nbsp; The practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Ramirez v. Buhayang-Margallo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> this court emphasized the authority of this court to impose disciplinary action on those admitted to the practice of law.<br><br><blockquote>Parenthetically, it is this court that has the constitutionally mandated duty to discipline lawyers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; Under the current rules, the duty to assist fact finding can be delegated to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.&nbsp; The findings of the Integrated Bar, however, can only be recommendatory, consistent with the constitutional powers of this court.&nbsp; Its recommended penalties are also, by its nature, recommendatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>The authority given to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines is based on Rule 139-B, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which provides that “[p]roceedings for the disbarment, suspension or discipline of attorneys may be taken by the Supreme Court <i>motu proprio</i>, or by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines . . . upon the verified complaint of any person.”&nbsp; However, this authority is only to assist this court with the investigation of the case, to determine factual findings, and to recommend, at best, the penalty that may be imposed on the erring lawyer.<br><br>We reiterate the discussion in <i>Tenoso v. Atty. Echanez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Time and again, this Court emphasizes that the practice of law is imbued with public interest and that “a lawyer owes substantial duties not only to his client, but also to his brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the nation, and takes part in one of the most important functions of the State—the administration of justice—as an officer of the court.”&nbsp; Accordingly, “[l]awyers are bound to maintain not only a high standard of legal proficiency, but also of morality, honesty, integrity and fair dealing.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Only this court can impose sanctions on members of the Bar.&nbsp; This disciplinary authority is granted by the Constitution and cannot be relinquished by this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; The Resolutions of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines are, at best, recommendatory, and its findings and recommendations should not be equated with Decisions and Resolutions rendered by this court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find respondent Atty.
