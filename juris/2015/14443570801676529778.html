Yutingco) obtained loans from Westmont Bank (Westmont), now United Overseas Bank Phils., in the aggregate amount of P10,000,000.00, secured by several promissory notes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (PNs) with different maturity dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The PNs commonly provide that in case the same are referred to an attorney-at-law or a collection agency, or a suit is instituted in court for collection, Sps.

The RTC further held that Westmont's imputation that the additional defendants acted as dummies, conduits, and alter egos of the original defendants are but mere inferences of fact, and not a narration of specific acts or set of facts or ultimate facts required in a complaint to entitle the plaintiff to a remedy in law.

No. 175733</u></b><br><br>At the outset, it must be stressed that Civil Case No. 98-86853 was submitted for judgment on the pleadings, on Westmont's motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Hence, other than the hearing on the motion to discharge the attached items,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> no full-blown trial was conducted on the case.<br><br>In the case at bar, both the RTC and the CA were one in dismissing Westmont's Amended and Second Amended Complaints as to the additional defendants, but differed on the grounds therefor <i>i.e.</i>, the RTC held that said complaints failed to state a cause of action, while the CA ruled that there was no cause of action, as to the additional defendants.<br><br>"Failure to state a cause of action and lack of cause of action are distinct grounds to dismiss a particular action. The former refers to the insufficiency of the allegations in the pleading, while the latter to the insufficiency of the factual basis for the action. Dismissal for failure to state a cause of action may be raised at the earliest stages of the proceedings through a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, while dismissal for lack of cause of action may be raised any time after the questions of fact have been resolved on the basis of stipulations, admissions or evidence presented by the plaintiff."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Considering that, in this case, no stipulations, admissions, or evidence have yet been presented, it is perceptibly impossible to assess the insufficiency of the factual basis on which Sheriff Cachero asserts his cause of action. Hence, the ground of lack of cause of action could not have been the basis for the dismissal of this action.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Amended and Second Amended Complaints are still dismissible on the ground of failure to state a cause of action, as correctly held by the RTC.<br><br>"A complaint states a cause of action if it <u>sufficiently</u> avers the existence of the three (3) essential elements of a cause of action, namely: (<i>a</i>) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created; (<i>b</i>) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; and (<i>c</i>) an act or omission on the part of the named defendant violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter may maintain an action for recovery of damages. If the allegations of the complaint do not state the <u>concurrence</u> of these elements, the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss on the ground of <u>failure to state a cause of action</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Judicious examinations&nbsp; of Westmont's&nbsp; Amended and Second . Amended Complaints readily show their failure to sufficiently state a cause of action as the allegations therein do not proffer ultimate facts which would warrant an action against the additional defendants for the collection of the amount due on the subject PNs. In imputing liability to the additional defendants, Westmont merely alleged in its Second Amended Complaint:<br><blockquote>"Panamax, Ngo, Alba, Yu, Baesa and Resane are impleaded herein for being mere alter egos, conduits, dummies or nominees of defendants spouses Antonio and Sylvia Yutingco to defraud creditors, including herein plaintiff [Westmont].<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>Maria Ortiz is impleaded herein for being mere alter ego, conduit, dummy or nominee of defendants spouses Antonio and Sylvia Yutingco to defraud creditors, including herein plaintiff</u> [Westmont]." (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote>The aforecited allegations partake of the nature of mere conclusions of law, unsupported by a particular averment of circumstances that will show why or how such inferences or conclusions were arrived at as to bring the controversy within the trial court's jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> There is no explanation or narration of facts that would disclose why the additional defendants are mere alter egos, conduits, dummies or nominees of the original defendants to defraud creditors, contrary to the requirement of Section 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Rule 8 of the Rules of Court that the circumstances constituting fraud must be stated with particularity, thus, rendering the allegation of fraud simply an unfounded conclusion of law. It must be pointed out that, in the absence of specific averments, the complaint presents no basis upon which the court should act, or for the defendant to meet it with an intelligent answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and must, perforce, be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> as what the RTC did.<br><br>It bears to stress that "while the facts alleged in the complaint are hypothetically admitted by the defendant, who moves to dismiss the complaint on the ground of failure to state a cause of action, it must, nevertheless, be remembered that the <b>hypothetical admission extends only to the relevant and material facts well pleaded in the complaint, as well as inferences fairly deductible therefrom</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Verily, the filing of the motion to dismiss assailing the sufficiency of the complaint "does not admit the truth of mere epithets of fraud; nor allegations of legal conclusions; nor an erroneous statement of law; nor mere inferences or conclusions from facts not stated; nor mere conclusions of law; nor allegations of fact the falsity of which is subject to judicial notice; nor matters of evidence; nor surplusage and irrelevant matter; nor scandalous matter inserted merely to insult the opposing party; nor to legally impossible facts; nor to facts which appear unfounded by a record incorporated in the pleading, or by a document referred to; nor to general averments contradicted by more specific averments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Anent the award of attorney's fees, it is relevant to note that the stipulations on attorney's fees contained in the PNs constitute what is known as a penal clause. The award of attorney's fees by the CA, therefore, is not in the nature of an indemnity but rather a penalty in the form of liquidated damages in accordance with the contract between Westmont and the original defendants. "Such a stipulation has been upheld by [the] Court as binding between the parties so long as it does not contravene the law, morals, public order or public policy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Nevertheless, the courts possess the power to reduce the amount of attorney's fees whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, if the same is iniquitous or unconscionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus, in <i>Trade &amp; Investment Dev't. Corp. of the Phils. v. Roblett Industrial Construction Corp.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> the Court equitably reduced the amount of attorney's fees to be paid since interests (and penalties) had ballooned to thrice as much as the principal debt. In the present case, interest alone runs to more than thrice the principal amount of the loan obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> In real terms, therefore, attorney's fees at the stipulated rate of 20% of the total amount due of over P42,000,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> or about P8,400,000.00, is manifestly exorbitant. Hence, the Court concurs with the CA that the amount of attorney's fees should be equitably reduced to five percent (5%) of the principal debt, which the Court finds reasonable under the premises.<br><br>Finally, anent Westmont's claim for exemplary damages, the Court does not find any factual and legal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> bases for the award. A perusal of the original, amended and second amended complaints failed to disclose specific averments that will show the wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent acts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> committed by the original defendants with respect to the loan obligation sought to be enforced.<br><br><b><u>Re: G.R. No. 180162</u></b><br><br>It is well-settled that a sheriff performs a sensitive role in the dispensation of justice. He is duty-bound to know the <u>basic rules</u> in the implementation of a writ of execution and be vigilant in the exercise of that authority. While sheriffs have the ministerial duty to implement writs of execution promptly, they are bound to discharge their duties with prudence, caution, and attention which careful men usually exercise in the management of their affairs. Sheriffs, as officers of the court upon whom the execution of a judgment depends, must be circumspect and proper in their behavior.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Anything less is unacceptable because in serving the court's writs and processes and in implementing the orders of the court, sheriffs cannot afford to err without affecting the efficiency of the process of the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>In the present case, Sheriff Cachero failed to exercise circumspection in the enforcement of the writ of execution, given the information that a TRO had already been issued by the CA enjoining him from implementing the same. This clearly evinces an intention to defy the TRO. As aptly observed by the CA:<br><blockquote>Sheriff Cachero, being an officer of the court, should have exercised prudence by verifying whether there was really a TRO issued so as to avoid committing an act that would result in the thwarting of this Court's order. Assuming that [his] testimony that the loading of the items was completed at 4:00 p.m., and that the process server was fifteen minutes late in serving the TRO, the phone call and the presentation of the fax copy of the TRO sufficiently notified him of the Court's order which enjoined them (the Sheriffs) from carrying out the writ of execution.
