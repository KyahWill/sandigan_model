Each Commission shall decide by a majority vote of all its Members, any case or matter brought before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself. <i>Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Ordinarily, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court has a reglementary period of 60 days from receipt of denial of the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The Constitution, however, specifies that the reglementary period for assailing the decisions, orders, or rulings of the constitutional commissions is thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision, order, or ruling.&nbsp; For this reason, a separate rule was enacted in the Rules of Court.<br><br>Rule 64 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides the guidelines for filing a petition for certiorari under this rule.&nbsp; Section 2 of the rule specifies that “[a] judgment or final order or resolution of the Commission on Elections and the Commission on Audit may be brought by the aggrieved party to the Supreme Court on certiorari under Rule 65, <b><i>except as hereinafter provided.</i></b>”<br><br>The phrase, “except as hereinafter provided,” specifies that any petition for certiorari filed under this rule follows the same requisites as those of Rule 65 except for certain provisions found only in Rule 64.&nbsp; One of these provisions concerns the time given to file the petition.<br><br>Section 3 of Rule 64 of the Rules of Civil Procedure states:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>SEC. 3. Time to file petition</i></b>. — <i>The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days from notice</i> of the judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed. <i>The filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration </i>of said judgment or final order or resolution, if allowed under the procedural rules of the Commission concerned, <i>shall interrupt the period herein fixed. If the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period</i>, but which shall not be less than five (5) days in any event, <i>reckoned from notice of denial</i>.
