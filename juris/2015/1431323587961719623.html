Thus, they do not have the inherent power to tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Their power to tax must be prescribed by law.<br><br>Consistent with the view that the power to tax does not inhere in local government units, this court has held that a reserved temperament must be adhered to in construing the extent of a local government unit’s power to tax.&nbsp; As explained in <i>Icard v. City Council of Baguio</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is settled that a municipal corporation unlike a sovereign state is clothed with no inherent power of taxation.&nbsp; The charter or statute must plainly show an intent to confer that power or the municipality, cannot assume it.&nbsp; And <i>the power when granted is to be construed in strictissimi juris.</i>&nbsp; Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality. Inferences, implications, deductions – all these – have no place in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution is the basis of the taxing power of local government units:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5.&nbsp; Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees and charges <i>subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide,</i> consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.&nbsp; Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The taxing power granted by constitutional fiat to local government units exists in the wider context to “ensure the autonomy of local governments.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; As Article II, Section 25 of the 1987 Constitution unequivocally provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 25.&nbsp; The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments.</blockquote><br>Article II, Section 25 is complemented by Article X, Section 2:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2.&nbsp; The territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy.</blockquote><br>The 1935 Constitution was entirely silent on local autonomy, albeit making a distinction between executive departments, bureaus, and offices on the one hand, and local governments on the other.&nbsp; It provided that the President had control over the former but merely “exercise[d] general supervision”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> over the latter. Article VII, Section 10(1) of the 1935 Constitution provided:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 10.&nbsp; (1) The President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, or offices, exercise general supervision over all local governments as may be provided by law, and take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</blockquote><br>Similarly, the 1935 Constitution was silent on the taxing power of local government units.<br><br>The 1973 Constitution provided for local autonomy. Article II, Section 10 of the 1973 Constitution read:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 10.&nbsp; The State shall guarantee and promote the autonomy of local government units, especially the [barangays], to ensure their fullest development as self-reliant communities.</blockquote><br>Any trend in the 1973 Constitution towards greater autonomy for local government units “was aborted in 1972 when Ferdinand Marcos placed the entire country under martial law [thereby] stunt[ing] the development of local governments by centralizing the government in Manila.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; While local autonomy was provided for in the 1973 Constitution, its existence was confined to principle and theory. Practice neutered all of Article XI of the 1973 Constitution (on local government), including Section 5 which provided for the taxing power of local government units. Article XI, Section 5 reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp; Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.</blockquote><br>Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution is more emphatic in empowering local government units in the matter of taxation compared with Article XI, Section 5 of the 1973 Constitution.&nbsp; In addition to stating that local government units have the power to tax (subject to Congressional guidelines and limitations), Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution adds the phrase “consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.”&nbsp; Further, it is definite with the use of funds generated by local government units through the exercise of their taxing powers, providing that “[s]uch taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Apart from <i>administrative </i>autonomy, an equally vital facet of local governance under the 1987 Constitution is <i>fiscal</i> autonomy. In <i>Pimentel v. Aguirre</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Under existing law, local government units, in addition to having administrative autonomy in the exercise of their functions, enjoy fiscal autonomy as well.&nbsp; Fiscal autonomy means that local governments have the power to create their own sources of revenue in addition to their equitable share in the national taxes released by the national government, as well as the power to allocate their resources in accordance with their own priorities.&nbsp; It extends to the preparation of their budgets, and local officials in turn have to work within the constraints thereof.&nbsp; They are not formulated at the national level and imposed on local governments, whether they are relevant to local needs and resources or not.&nbsp; Hence, the necessity of a balancing of viewpoints and the harmonization of proposals from both local and national officials, who in any case are partners in the attainment of national goals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>IV<br></center><br>The taxing powers of local government units must be read in relation to their power to effect their basic autonomy.<br><br>Consistent with the 1987 Constitution’s declared preference, the taxing powers of local government units must be resolved in favor of their local fiscal autonomy.&nbsp; In <i>City Government of San Pablo v. Reyes</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The power to tax is primarily vested in Congress.&nbsp; However, in our jurisdiction, it may be exercised by local legislative bodies, no longer merely by virtue of a valid delegation as before, but pursuant to direct authority conferred by Section 5, Article X of the Constitution.&nbsp; Thus Article X, Section 5 of the Constitution reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5 — Each Local Government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.&nbsp; Such taxes, fees and charges shall accrue exclusively to the Local Governments.</blockquote>The important legal effect of Section 5 is that <i>henceforth, in interpreting statutory provision on municipal fiscal powers, doubts will have to be resolved in favor of municipal corporations.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Similarly, in <i>San Juan v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this court stated:<br><br><blockquote>We have to obey the clear mandate on local autonomy.&nbsp; Where a law is capable of two interpretations, one in favor of centralized power in Malacañang and the other beneficial to local autonomy, the scales must be weighed in favor of autonomy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>The Local Government Code was enacted pursuant to the specific mandate of Article X, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and its requirements of decentralization.&nbsp; Its provisions, including those on local taxation, must be read in light of the jurisprudentially settled preference for local autonomy.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>The limits on the level of additional levy for the special education fund under Section 235 of the Local Government Code should be read as granting fiscal flexibility to local government units.<br><br>Book II of the Local Government Code governs local taxation and fiscal matters.&nbsp; Title II of Book II governs real property taxation.<br><br>Section 235 of the Local Government Code allows provinces and cities, as well as municipalities in Metro Manila, to collect, on top of the basic annual real property tax, an additional levy which shall exclusively accrue to the special education fund:<br><br><blockquote>Section 235.&nbsp; Additional Levy on Real Property for the Special Education Fund. - A province or city, or a municipality within the Metropolitan Manila Area, <i>may levy and collect an annual tax of one percent (1%) on the assessed value of real property</i> which shall be in addition to the basic real property tax.&nbsp; The proceeds thereof shall exclusively accrue to the Special Education Fund (SEF).&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The special education fund is not an original creation of the Local Government Code.&nbsp; It was initially devised by Republic Act No. 5447.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The rate of 1% is also not a detail that is original to the Local Government Code. As discussed in <i>Commission on Audit v. Province of Cebu</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Special Education Fund was created by virtue of R. A. No. 5447, which is [a]n act creating a special education fund to be constituted from the proceeds of an additional real property tax and a certain portion of the taxes on Virginia-type cigarettes and duties on imported leaf tobacco, defining the activities to be financed, creating school boards for the purpose, and appropriating funds therefrom, which took effect on January 1, 1969.&nbsp; Pursuant thereto, P.D. No. 464, also known as the Real Property Tax Code of the Philippines, imposed an annual tax of 1% on real property which shall accrue to the SEF.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The operative phrase in Section 235’s grant to municipalities in Metro Manila, cities, and provinces of the power to impose an additional levy for the special education fund is prefixed with “<i>may,</i>” thus, “may levy and collect an annual tax of one percent (1%).”<br><br>In <i>Buklod nang Magbubukid sa Lupaing Ramos, Inc. v. E.M. Ramos and Sons, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the meaning of “may” was discussed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Where the provision reads “may,” this word shows that it is not mandatory but discretionary.&nbsp; It is an auxiliary verb indicating liberty, opportunity, permission and possibility.&nbsp; The use of the word “may” in a statute denotes that it is directory in nature and generally permissive only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent concedes that Section 235’s grant to municipalities in Metro Manila, to cities, and to provinces of the power to impose an additional levy for the special education fund makes its collection optional.&nbsp; It is not mandatory that the levy be imposed and collected.&nbsp; The controversy which the Commission on Audit created is not whether these local government units have discretion to collect but whether they have discretion on the <i>rate </i>at which they are to collect.<br><br>It is respondent’s position that the option granted to a local government unit is limited to the matter of whether it shall actually collect, and that the rate at which it shall collect (should it choose to do so) is fixed by Section 235.&nbsp; In contrast, it is petitioner’s contention that the option given to a local government unit extends not only to the matter of whether to collect but also to the rate at which collection is to be made.<br><br>We sustain the position of petitioner.<br><br>Section 235’s permissive language is unqualified.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no limiting qualifier to the articulated rate of 1% which unequivocally indicates that any and all special education fund collections must be at such rate.<br><br>At most, there is a seeming ambiguity in Section 235.&nbsp; Consistent with what has earlier been discussed however, any such ambiguity must be read in favor of local fiscal autonomy.&nbsp; As in <i>San Juan v.

Guingona</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> as a precedent for finding local officials liable for violations that have to do with the special education fund.<br><br>Moreover, in Decision No. 2008-087, respondent asserted that there was “no cogent reason to exclude [petitioner] from liability since her participation as one of the local officials who implemented the collection of the reduced levy rate. . . led to the loss on reduction [sic] of government income.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; It added that, “[c]orollary thereto, the government can also go against the officials who are responsible for the passage of [the Ordinance],”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> i.e., the members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Palawan.<br><br>Respondent’s reliance on <i>Salalima </i>and on petitioner’s having been <i>incidentally</i> the mayor of Narra, Palawan when supposedly deficient collections were undertaken is misguided.<br><br>Per respondent’s own summation of <i>Salalima,</i> in that case, this court:<br><br><blockquote>held that the governor, vice-governor and members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are collectively responsible with other provincial officials in the administration of fiscal and financial transactions of the province pursuant to Sections 304 and 305 of RA 7160 <i><b>for denying the other beneficiaries of their share of the SEF</b></i>.&nbsp; These local officials cannot claim ignorance of the law as to the sharing scheme of the real property tax and the SEF as the same is clearly provided in RA 7160.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Salalima</i> involved several administrative Complaints filed before the Office of the President against the elective officials of the Province of Albay.&nbsp; One of these — OP Case No. 5470 — was a Complaint for malversation, and “consistent [and] habitual violation of pars. (c) and (d) of Section 60 of [the Local Government Code]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which was filed by Tiwi, Albay Mayor Naomi Corral against Albay Governor Romeo Salalima, Vice-Governor Danilo Azaña, and other Sangguniang Panlalawigan members.<br><br>This Complaint was precipitated by the refusal of the provincial officials of Albay to make available to the Municipality of Tiwi, Albay its share in the collections of the special education fund.&nbsp; This was contrary to Section 272 of the Local Government Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which requires equal sharing between provincial and municipal school boards.&nbsp; Specifically, it was found that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan passed Ordinance No. 09-92, which declared as forfeited in favor of the Province of Albay (and to the exclusion of the municipalities in Albay) all payments made by the National Power Corporation to the former pursuant to a memorandum of agreement through which the National Power Corporation settled its real property tax obligations.<br><br>As regards the personal liability of the respondents in that case, the Office of the President was quoted to have anchored on the following disquisition its imposition of the <i>penalty of suspension</i> on the respondent provincial officials:<br><br><blockquote>It cannot be denied that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan has control over the Province’s ‘purse’ as it may approve or not resolutions or ordinances generating revenue or imposing taxes as well as appropriating and authorizing the disbursement of funds to meet operational requirements or for the prosecution of projects.<br><br>Being entrusted with such responsibility, the provincial governor, vice-governor and the members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, must always be guided by the so-called ‘fundamental’ principles enunciated under the Local Government Code[.] . . .<br><br>All the respondents could not claim ignorance of the law especially with respect to the provisions of P.D. No. 464 that lay down the sharing scheme among local government units concerned and the national government, for both the basic real property tax and additional tax pertaining to the Special Education Fund.&nbsp; Nor can they claim that the Province could validly forfeit the P40,724,471.74 paid by NPC considering that the Province is only entitled to a portion thereof and that the balance was merely being held in trust for the other beneficiaries.<br><br>As a public officer, respondent Azaña (and the other respondents as well) has a duty to protect the interests not only of the Province but also of the municipalities of Tiwi and Daraga and even the national government.&nbsp; When the passage of an illegal or unlawful ordinance by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is imminent, the presiding officer has a duty to act accordingly, but actively opposing the same by temporarily relinquishing his chair and participating in the deliberations.&nbsp; If his colleagues insist on its passage, he should make known his opposition thereto by placing the same on record.&nbsp; No evidence of any sort was shown in this regard by respondent Azaña.<br><br>Clearly, all the respondents have, whether by act or omission, denied the other beneficiaries of their rightful shares in the tax delinquency payments made by the NPC and caused the illegal forfeiture, appropriation and disbursement of funds not belonging to the Province, through the passage and approval of Ordinance No. 09-92 and Resolution Nos. 178-92 and 204-92.<br><br>The foregoing factual setting shows a wanton disregard of law on the part of the respondents tantamount to abuse of authority.&nbsp; Moreover, the illegal disbursements made can qualify as technical malversation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>It is evident that the circumstances in <i>Salalima</i> are not analogous to the circumstances pertinent to petitioner.<br><br>While <i>Salalima</i> involved the mishandling of proceeds which was “tantamount to abuse of authority” and which “can qualify as technical malversation,” this case involves the collection of the additional levy for the special education fund at a rate which, at the time of the collection, was pursuant to an ordinance that was yet to be invalidated.<br><br>Likewise, <i>Salalima</i> involved the liability of the provincial officials who were themselves the authors of an invalid ordinance.&nbsp; In this case, the Municipality of Narra — as <i>subordinate</i> to the Province of Palawan — merely enforced a provincial ordinance.&nbsp; Respondent, in its own Memorandum, acknowledged that it was not even petitioner but the municipal treasurer who actually effected the collection at a supposedly erroneous rate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Also, <i>Salalima</i> entailed the imposition of the administrative penalty of suspension.&nbsp; In this case, respondent is not concerned with the imposition of administrative penalties but insists that petitioner must herself (jointly and severally with the other persons named) pay for the deficiency in collections.<br><br>We find it improper to hold petitioner personally liable for the uncollected amount on account of the sheer <i>happenstance</i> that she was the mayor of Narra, Palawan, when the Ordinance was enforced.<br><br><center>VIII<br></center><br>The actions of the officials of the Municipality of Narra are consistent with the rule that ordinances are presumed valid.&nbsp; In finding liability, respondent suggests that officers of the Municipality should not comply with an ordinance duly passed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.<br><br>It is true that petitioner, as the local chief executive, was charged with fidelity to our laws.&nbsp; However, it would be grossly unfair to sustain respondent’s position.&nbsp; It implacably dwells on supposed non-compliance with Section 235 but turns a blind eye on the context which precipitated the collection made by the Municipality of Narra at the reduced rate of 0.5%.<br><br>The mayor’s actions were done pursuant to an ordinance which, at the time of the collection, was yet to be invalidated.<br><br>It is basic that laws and local ordinances are “presumed to be valid unless and until the courts declare the contrary in clear and unequivocal terms.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the concerned officials of the Municipality of Narra, Palawan must be deemed to have conducted themselves in good faith and with regularity when they acted pursuant to Chapter 5, Section 48 of Provincial Ordinance No. 332-A, Series of 1995, and collected the additional levy for the special education fund at the rate of 0.5%.&nbsp; Accordingly, it was improper for respondent to attribute personal liability to petitioner and to require her to personally answer to the deficiency in special education fund collections.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp;
