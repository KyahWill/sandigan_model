On June 29, 2000, Cabero, the plantation's administrator, and several men, including Cipres, went to the plantation to harvest abaca upon Anecita Pacate's instructions. At about 10:00 a.m., Cabero and his men were surprised to find Ligtas harvesting abaca at the plantation. Ligtas was accompanied by three (3) unidentified men. Allegedly, Ligtas threatened that there would be loss of life if they persisted in harvesting the abaca. Cabero reported the incident to Anecita Pacate and the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On July 2, 2000, Cabero and Cipres went back to the plantation and conducted a survey on the condition of the plantation.

This court has ruled in a number of cases that:<br><blockquote>It is indeed a fundamental principle of administrative law that administrative cases are independent from criminal actions for the same act or omission. <i>Thus, an absolution from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative prosecution, or vice versa</i>. One thing is administrative liability; quite another thing is the criminal liability for the same act.<br><br>....<br><br>Thus, considering the difference in the quantum of evidence, as well as the procedure followed and the sanctions imposed in criminal and administrative proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should not necessarily be binding on the other. Notably, the evidence presented in the administrative case may not necessarily be the same evidence to be presented in the criminal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>However, this case does not involve an administrative charge stemming from the same set of facts involved in a criminal proceeding. This is not a case where one act results in both criminal and administrative liability. DARAB Case No. VIII-319-SL-2000 involves a determination of whether there exists a tenancy relationship between petitioner and private complainant, while Criminal Case No. R-225 involves determination of whether petitioner committed theft. However, the tenancy relationship is a factor in determining whether all the elements of theft were proven by the prosecution.<br><br>In its Decision dated January 22, 2002, the DARAB found:<br><blockquote>All the necessary requisites in order to establish tenancy relationship as required in the above-quoted Supreme Court ruling, has been established by the evidence submitted by plaintiff; And these evidences were not controverted by any evidence submitted by the respondent.<br><br>In fine, this board found plaintiff a bonafide tenant of the land in question and as such is entitled to a security of tenure, in which case he shall not be dispossessed of his holdings by the landowner except for any of the causes provided by law and only after the same has been proved before, and the dispossession is authorized by the Court and in the judgment that is final and executory[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the DARAB Decision provides:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises being considered, judgment is hereby rendered, finding Monico Ligtas a bonafide tenant of the land subject in this case and well described in paragraph three (3) in the complaint, and ordering as follows, to wit:<br><ol><li>The respondent and all other persons acting for and in her behalf to maintain plaintiff in the peaceful possession of the land in dispute;<br><br></li><li>The MARO of Sogod, Southern Leyte, and concurrently the cluster Manager of Sogod Bay DAR Cluster to call the parties and assist them in the execution of a leasehold contract covering the land in dispute, and for the parties to respect and obey such call of the said MARO in compliance with the legal mandate.<br><br></li><li>Ordering the respondent to pay plaintiff the amount of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos representing the expenses incurred by plaintiff in vindicating his right and other actual expenses incurred in this litigation.<br></li></ol>Other relief sought are hereby ordered dismissed for lack of evidence.<br><br>No cost. <br><br><b>SO DECIDED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote>Private complainant did not appeal the DARAB's findings.<br><br>Findings of fact of administrative agencies in the exercise of their quasi-judicial powers are entitled to respect if supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> This court is not tasked to weigh again "the evidence submitted before the administrative body and to substitute its own judgment [as to] the sufficiency of evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><center>V<br></center><br>The DARAB is the quasi-judicial tribunal that has the primary jurisdiction to determine whether there is a tenancy relationship between adverse parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> This court has held that "judicial determinations [of the a DARAB] have the same binding effect as judgments and orders of a regular judicial body."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Disputes under the jurisdiction of the DARAB include controversies relating to:<br><blockquote>tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Salazar v. De Leon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> this court upheld the Department of Agrarian Reform's primary jurisdiction over agrarian disputes, which includes the relationship between landowners and tenants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The DARAB Decision is conclusive and binding on courts when supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> This court ruled that administrative <i>res judicata</i> exists in that case:<br><blockquote>Significantly, respondent did not appeal the Decision dated 17 November 1995 of the DARAB in DARAB Case # II-380-ISA'94; consequently, the same has attained finality and constitutes <i>res judicata</i> on the issue of petitioner's status as a tenant of respondent.<br><br>Res judicata is a concept applied in the review of lower court decisions in accordance with the hierarchy of courts. <i>But jurisprudence has also recognized the rule of administrative <i>res judicata</i></i>: "The rule which forbids the reopening of a matter once judicially determined by competent authority applies as well to the judicial and quasi-judicial facts of public, executive or administrative officers and boards acting within their jurisdiction as to the judgments of courts having general judicial powers. It has been declared that whenever final adjudication of persons invested with power to decide on the property and rights of the citizen is examinable by the Supreme Court, upon a writ of error or a certiorari, such final adjudication may be pleaded as <i>res judicata</i>." <i>To be sure, early jurisprudence was already mindful that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> cannot be said to apply exclusively to decisions rendered by what are usually understood as courts without unreasonably circumscribing the scope thereof; and that the more equitable attitude is to allow extension of the defense to decisions of bodies upon whom judicial powers have been conferred</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Encinas v. Agustin, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> this court clarified that <i>res judicata</i> applies only to decisions rendered by agencies in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings and not to purely administrative proceedings:<br><blockquote>The CA was correct in ruling that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applies only to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, and not to the exercise of administrative powers. Administrative powers here refer to those purely administrative in nature, as opposed to administrative proceedings that take on a quasi-judicial character.<br><br>In administrative law, a quasi-judicial proceeding involves (a) taking and evaluating evidence; (b) determining facts based upon the evidence presented; and (c) rendering an order or decision supported by the facts proved. The exercise of quasi-judicial functions involves a determination, with respect to the matter in controversy, of what the law is; what the legal rights and obligations of the contending parties are; and based thereon and the facts obtaining, the adjudication of the respective rights and obligations of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>We find it necessary to clarify the two concepts of <i>res judicata</i>: bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment. In <i>Social Security Commission v. Rizal Poultry and Livestock Association, Inc., et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> this court discussed and differentiated the two concepts of <i>res judicata</i>:<br><blockquote><i>Res judicata</i> embraces two concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment as enunciated in Rule 39, Section 47(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure; and (2) conclusiveness of judgment in Rule 39, Section 47(c).<br><br>There is "bar by prior judgment" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action.<br><br>But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of <i>res judicata</i> known as "conclusiveness of judgment." Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.<br><br><i>Thus, if a particular point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of that particular point or question, a former judgment between the same parties or their privies will be final and conclusive in the second if that same point or question was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit. Identity of cause of action is not required but merely identity of issue.</i><br><br>The elements of <i>res judicata</i> are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. <i>Should identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action be shown in the two cases, then <i>res judicata</i> in its aspect as a "bar by prior judgment" would apply. If as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as "conclusiveness of judgment" applies.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Martillano v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> the DARAB Decision finding for the existence of a tenancy relationship between the parties was declared by this court as conclusive on the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> As in this case, the DARAB Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> in Martillano attained finality when the landowner did not appeal the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> This court ruled that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applies:<br><blockquote>Under the afore-cited sections of RA 6657, the Department of Agrarian Reform is empowered, through its adjudicating arm the regional and provincial adjudication boards, to resolve agrarian disputes and controversies on all matters pertaining to the implementation of the agrarian law. Section 51 thereof provides that the decision of the DARAB attains finality after the lapse of fifteen (15) days and no appeal was interposed therefrom by any of the parties.<br><br><i>In the instant case, the determination of the DARAB in DARAB Case No. 062-Bul '89, there being no appeal interposed therefrom, attained finality. Accordingly, the matter regarding the status of Martillano as a tenant farmer and the validity of the CLT and Emancipation Patents issued in his favor are settled and no longer open to doubt and controversy.</i><br><br>....<br><br>We recall that DARAB Case 062-Bul '89 was for the cancellation of petitioner's CLT and Emancipation patents. The same effect is sought with the institution of DARAB Case No. 512-Bul '94, which is an action to withdraw and/or cancel administratively the CLT and Emancipation Patents issued to petitioner. Considering that DARAB Case 062-Bul '89 has attained finality prior to the filing of DARAB Case No. 512-Bul '94, no strenuous legal interpretation is necessary to understand that the issues raised in the prior case, i.e., DARAB Case No. 062-Bul '89, which have been resolved with finality, may not be litigated anew.<br><br>The instant case is complicated by the failure of the complainant to include Martillano as party-defendant in the case before the adjudication board and the DARAB, although he was finally impleaded on appeal before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The belated inclusion of Martillano as respondent in the petition will not affect the applicability of the doctrine of bar by prior judgment. <i>What is decisive is that the issues which have already been litigated in a final and executory judgment precludes, by the principle of bar by prior judgment, an aspect of the doctrine of res judicata, and even under the doctrine of "law of the case," the re-litigation of the same issue in another action. It is well established that when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as it remains unreversed, it should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them. The dictum therein laid down became the law of the case and what was once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision, continues to be binding between the same parties as long as the facts on which the decision was predicated, continue to be the facts of the case before the court.</i> Hence, the binding effect and enforceability of that dictum can no longer be resurrected anew since said issue had already been resolved and finally laid to rest, if not by the principle of <i>res judicata</i>, at least by conclusiveness of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Co v.

It is allowable to reason back from a judgment to the basis on which it stands, upon the obvious principle that where a conclusion is indisputable, and could have been drawn only from certain premises, the premises are equally indisputable with the conclusion. When a fact has been once determined in the course of a judicial proceeding, and a final judgment has been rendered in accordance therewith, it cannot be again litigated between the same parties without virtually impeaching the correctness of the former decision, which, from motives of public policy, the law does not permit to be done.<br><br>Res judicata has two concepts. The first is bar by prior judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (b), and the second is conclusiveness of judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (c). Both concepts are founded on the principle of estoppel, and are based on the salutary public policy against unnecessary multiplicity of suits. Like the splitting of causes of action, <i>res judicata</i> is in pursuance of such policy. Matters settled by a Court's final judgment should not be litigated upon or invoked again. Relitigation of issues already settled merely burdens the Courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>VHJ Construction and Development Corporation v.

While it appears that there was personal cultivation by petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest of the subject landholding, what was established was that petitioners' claim of tenancy was founded on the self-serving testimony of petitioner Rodolfo <i>Rollo</i> that his predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the landholding for more than 30 years and had engaged in a "50-50" sharing scheme with JOSEFINA and JOSEFINA's grandmother, the previous owner thereof. Self-serving statements in pleadings are inadequate; proof must be adduced. Such claims do not suffice absent concrete evidence to support them. The burden rests on the shoulders of petitioners to prove their affirmative allegation of tenancy, which burden they failed to discharge with substantial evidence. Such a juridical tie must be aptly shown. Simply put, he who alleges the affirmative of the issue has the burden of proof, and from the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts. The same rule applies to administrative cases. In fact, if the complainant, upon whom rests the burden of proving his cause of action, fails to show in a satisfactory manner the facts upon which he bases his claim, the respondent is under no obligation to prove his exception or defense....<br><br>Neither was it shown to the satisfaction of this Court that there existed a sharing of harvests in the context of a tenancy relationship between petitioners and/or their predecessors-in-interest and JOSEFINA. Jurisprudence is illuminating to the effect that to prove such sharing of harvests, a receipt or any other evidence must be presented. None was shown. No receipts were presented as testaments to the claimed sharing of harvests. The only evidence submitted to establish the purported sharing of harvests was the testimony of petitioner Rodolfo <i>Rollo</i>. The sharing arrangement cannot be deemed to have existed on the basis alone of petitioner Rodolfo <i>Rollo</i>'s claim. It is self-serving and is without evidentiary value. Self-serving statements are deemed inadequate; competent proof must be adduced. If at all, the fact alone of sharing is not sufficient to establish a tenancy relationship.<br><br><i>We also sustain the conclusion reached by the Provincial Adjudicator and the Court of Appeals that the testimony of Araceli Pascua, an employee of the DAR in Victoria, Tarlac, that the subject landholding was tenanted cannot overcome substantial evidence to the contrary. To prove the alleged tenancy no reliance may be made upon the said public officer's testimony. What cannot be ignored is the precedent ruling of this Court that the findings of or certifications issued by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, or his authorized representative, in a given locality concerning the presence or absence of a tenancy relationship between the contending parties, are merely preliminary or provisional and are not binding upon the courts.</i> This ruling holds with greater effect in the instant case in light of the fact that petitioners, as herein shown, were not able to prove the presence of all the indispensable elements of tenancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i><i>Rollo</i></i>, this court did not categorically hold that the DARAB's findings were merely provisional and, thus, not binding on courts.

Further, the tribunals had conflicting findings on whether petitioners were bona fide tenants.<br><br>In this case, records are bereft as to whether private complainant appealed the DARAB Decision.

In fact, it was even improper for Anecita Pacate to stop or prevent petitioner from harvesting the produce of the landholding because as tenant, petitioner is entitled to security of tenure.

In acquitting an appellant, we are not saying that he is lily-white, or pure as driven snow. Rather, we are declaring his innocence because the prosecution's evidence failed to show his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. For that is what the basic law requires.
