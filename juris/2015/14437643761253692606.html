It ruled thus:<br><br><blockquote>xxx the Court finds merit in the petitioners' contention <b>that indeed the joint circular runs afoul of the provisions of RA 8291.</b> xxx<br><br>Under this circular, the contractual personnel shall in effect be paying the government's share of the contributions inasmuch as no additional funds shall be appropriated for the purpose. This is a clear contravention of the very law it seeks to implement.<br><br>GSIS as an administrative agency vested with quasiÂ­ legislative powers shall exercise such delegated legislative power with no discretion as to what the law shall be, but merely the authority to fix the details in the execution of enforcement of a policy set out in the law itself.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Clearly, the joint circular had been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction for being violative of the letter of the law it seeks to implement. "Indeed, administrative regulations must not override, but must remain consistent with the law they seek to apply and implement. They are intended to carry out, not to supplant nor to modify the law." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals, 240 SCRA 149)<br><br>Finally, respondents assail the jurisdiction of this Court citing Sec. 30 of RA 8291 and Sec. 14.1 and 14.3 of the Implementing Rules. <b>Granting <i>arguendo</i> tbat the GSIS has primary jurisdiction over the instant case as it appears that petitioners did not avail nor exhaust the administrative remedies by not moving for the reconsideration of their coverage under RA 8291, <u>the Court, however, deemed it just and equitable under the circumstances to give due course to the instant petition because the petitioners bad no other speedy and adequate remedy available to them in view of the impending implementation of the questioned circular</u>.</b><br><br>Moreover, the Court's act to take cognizance of the instant case finds justification in the provisions of the (sic) par. 2, Sec. 1, Article II of the 1987 Constitution which provides:<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the GSIS-DBM Joint Circular No. 99-3 is hereby annulled for being contrary to law.

Despite this knowledge, the GSIS filed G.R. No. 153810;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> more, contrary to its undertaking in its certification against forum-shopping, the GSIS did not inform this Honorable Court of the pending case before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The GSIS vehemently denied that there is forum shopping. It argued that while the GSIS has already decided that it will be filing a Petition for Review before the Supreme Court as early as June 20, 2002,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> its counsel only received a copy of the DBM's Notice of Appeal on June 21, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>This argument fails to persuade.<br><br>Applying the logic and analysis used in <i>Chemphil v. CA,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> it is clear that the GSIS committed forum shopping in this case. In Chemphil, a bank consortium (which includes PCIB) on the one hand, and CEIC on the other, vied for the ownership of the disputed shares of stock of the Chemical Industries of the Philippines. The Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of the bank consortium, but dismissed their counter-claims against CEIC. Thus, the bank consortium, with the exception of PCIB, appealed, via a Notice of Appeal, the dismissal before the Court of Appeals. PCIB separately filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The two separate actions assailed the very same orders of the Regional Trial Court. In holding PCIB guilty of forum-shopping, we held:<br><br><blockquote>We uphold the decision of the Court of Appeals finding PCIB guilty of forum-shopping.<br><blockquote>The Court of Appeals opined:<br><blockquote>True it is, that petitioner PCIB was not a party to the appeal made by the four other banks belonging to the consortium, but equally true is the rule that <b><u>where the rights</u></b> equally true is the rule that <b><u>where the rights and liabilities of the parties appealing are so interwoven and dependent on each other as to be inseparable, a reversal of the appealed decision as to those who appealed, operates as a reversal to all and will inure to the benefit of those who did not join the appeal. Such principal, premised upon communality of interest of the parties, is recognized in this jurisdiction</u></b>. The four other banks which were part of the consortium, filed their notice of appeal under date of March 16, 1990, furnishing a copy thereof upon the lawyers of petitioner. <b><u>The petition for certiorari in the present case was tiled on April 10, 1990, long after the other members of the consortium had appealed from the assailed order of December 19, 1989.</u></b><br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>PCIB cannot hide behind the subterfuge that Supreme Court Circular 28-91 was not yet m force when it filed the certiorari proceedings in the Court of Appeals. The rule against forum-shopping has long been established. Supreme Court Circular 28-91 merely formalized the prohibition and provided the appropriate penalties against transgressors.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Forum-shopping or the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, of seeking another (and possibly favorable) opinion in another forum (other than by appeal or the special civil action of certiorari), or the institution of two (2) or more actions or proceedings grounded on the san1e cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition, has been characterized as an act of malpractice that is prohibited and condemned as trifling with the Courts and abusing their processes. It constitutes improper conduct which tends to degrade the administration of justice. It has also been aptly described as deplorable because it adds to the congestion of the already heavily burdened dockets of the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><div align="center">(Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></div></blockquote><br>Here, the commonality of interests among the DBM, the GSIS and the DENR cannot be denied. The pleadings filed from the inception of the case will show that they have essentially the same arguments and defenses and seek the same reliefs. More, in terms of the issuance of JC No. 99-3, these agencies have equal stakes should the challenged circular be declared invalid. Without a doubt, the different modes of appeal taken by the GSIS and the DBM will, in the process, create the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by different <i>fora</i> upon the same issue. Indeed, a final decision in one would constitute <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> For this reason, we dismiss the petition in GR. No. 153810,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> with a warning to the GSIS that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><i>The trial court has no jurisdiction to <br>resolve Tolentino et al.'s petition </i><br><br>Citing Section 30 of RA 8291,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's finding of jurisdiction, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>xxx<br></center><br>Basic is the rule in statutory construction that <b>where the law is clear and categorical, there is no room for construction, only application</b>. xxx<br><br>Thus, [the concerned government agencies] are correct in their contention that <b>the GSIS has the original and exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising from the implementation of R.A. No. 8291.</b><br><br>Indeed, <b>the doctrine of primary jurisdiction or prior resort and, its corollary doctrine, exhaustion of administrative remedies, are applicable in the instant case.</b><br><br><center>xxx</center><br>[Tolentino <i>et al</i>], therefore, should have first ventilated their complaint or grievance before the GSIS as R.A. No. 8291 expressly provides that it is the agency which has the primary jurisdiction to rule on any dispute arising from the implementation of the said law and other laws administered by the GSIS. The jurisdiction includes the determination of the employees covered by the GSIS, which the law itself delimited under Section 3 thereof.<br><br><center>xxx</center><br>Be it noted that [Tolentino <i>et al</i>] did not at the first instance bring their grievance to the proper government agency, which is the GSIS. They did not even bother to have the matter resolved within their department (DENR). Thus, their failure to resort to administrative remedies available to them belies the pronouncement of the court a quo that there was no other speedy and adequate remedy available to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center>(Emphasis supplied.)</center></blockquote><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Jurisdiction over subject matter is determined by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <i>Bank of Commerce v. Planters Development Bank</i>, we stated:<br><br><blockquote>In the exercise of its plenary legislative power, Congress may create administrative agencies endowed with quasiÂ­ legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Necessarily, Congress likewise defines the limits of an agency's jurisdiction in the same manner as it defines the jurisdiction of courts. <b>As a result, it may happen that either a court or an administrative agency has exclusive jurisdiction over a specific matter</b> or both have concurrent jurisdiction on the same. xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><center>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></center></blockquote><br>A statute may vest exclusive original jurisdiction in an administrative agency over certain disputes and controversies falling within the agency's special expertise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In this case, the law vested exclusive and original jurisdiction over disputes arising from RA 8291 or related laws with the GSIS. Section 30 of RA 8291 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 30. <i>Settlement of Disputes.</i> - The GSIS shall have <b>original and exclusive jurisdiction</b> to settle any dispute arising under this Act and any other laws administered by the GSIS. xxx<br><br>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Sections 14.1 and 14.3 of the 1997 Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 8291 also read:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14.1 <i>Quasi-Judicial Functions of the GSIS.</i> -The settle any dispute arising under Republic Act No. 8291, Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended, and other laws administered by the GSIS with respect to:<br><ol><li>Coverage of employers and employees;<br></li><li>Entitlement of members to the following benefits under these rules:<br><center>xxx<br></center><br></li><li>Collection and payment of contributions;<br></li><li>xxx;<br></li><li>Any other matter related to any or all of the foregoing which is necessary for their determination.<br></li></ol><div align="center">xxx<br></div><br>Section 14.3 <i>Body vested with quasi-judicial functions.</i> The quasi-judicial function of the GSIS shall be vested in its Board of Trustees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><center>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></center></blockquote><br>In case a party feels aggrieved by an order, ruling or decision of the GSIS Board, he may file a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The main issue raised by Tolentino <i>et al. </i>in their petition before the trial court was the validity of JC No. 99-3 insofar as it provided for the deduction of the government's share on GSIS contributions from the 20% premium given to contractual employees, in lieu of leave benefits. Such issue, pertaining as it does to the coverage, collection and payment of GSIS contributions, is a dispute over which the GSIS exercises exclusive and original jurisdiction. This jurisdiction of the GSIS was also recognized by this Court in <i>Government Service Insurance System v. Commission on Audit</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It was therefore error for the trial court, though it is a court of general jurisdiction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> to assume jurisdiction over the same.<br><br>Tolentino <i>et al</i>. nevertheless claim that, in view of Section 21 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 ("BP 129"), the trial court correctly exercised jurisdiction over their petition (which is, admittedly, one for certiorari and prohibition) based on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Section 21 of BP 129 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 21. <i>Original jurisdiction in other cases</i>. - <b>Regional Trial Courts shall exercise original jurisdiction:</b><br><br>(1) In the issuance of writs of <b><i>certiorari, prohibition,</i></b><i> mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</i> and injunction which may be enforced in any part of their respective regions; xxx<br><br><center>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></center></blockquote><br>Tolentino's <i>et al.</i>'s reliance on Section 21 of BP 129 and the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is misplaced.<br><br><i>First.</i> Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, a remedy within the administrative machinery must be resorted to give the administrative officer every opportunity to decide a matter that comes within his jurisdiction. Such remedy must be exhausted first before the court's power of judicial review can be sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, under this doctrine, Tolentino <i>et al</i>. should have <i>first</i> brought the dispute regarding the validity of a circular implementing the GSIS Law to the GSIS Board (and not the courts) for resolution as required by law. Contrary to what Tolentino <i>et al</i>. assert, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction precludes the courts from resolving a controversy over which jurisdiction has initially been lodged with an administrative body of special competence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>. While it is true that the trial court had jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by Tolentino <i>et al</i>., the issue in the case was <b>not</b> whether the trial court had jurisdiction over such class of actions. The issue, rather, was whether the government's share in the GSIS contributions for contractual employees can be validly sourced from the 20% premium pay given to such employees, in lieu of leave benefits. The validity of JC No. 99-3, which directed such deduction, is a dispute arising under (or at the very least, related to) the GSIS Law. Resolution of this issue comes within the ambit of the quasi-judicial powers of the GSIS as provided under Section 30 of RA 8291 and its implementing rules.<br><br><i>Ruling on the substantive legal issue</i><br><br>The primary substantive issue in this case calls for a determination of whether the deduction of the government share in the GSIS contributions, as provided under JC No. 99-3, is repugnant to RA 8291. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction would ordinarily preclude this Court from resolving a matter which calls for a ruling to first be made by the GSIS Board.<br><br>We note, however, our ruling in <i>China Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> where we held:<br><br><blockquote>At the outset, the Court's attention is drawn to the fact that since the filing ofthis suit before the trial court, none of the substantial issues have been resolved. To avoid and gloss over the issues raised by the parties, as what the trial court and respondent Court of Appeals did, would unduly prolong this litigation involving a rather simple case of foreclosure of mortgage. Undoubtedly, this will run counter to the avowed purpose of the rules, i.e., to assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding.

Tolentino <i>et al</i>. argue that (1) the government, being the employer, must pay for its share of the contribution and not charge this to the 20% premium on the monthly compensation of contractual employees; (2) Section 4.2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in JC No. 99-3 is in direct contravention of Section 5(b) of RA 8291; and (3) the deduction is prohibited under Section 3.3.2 of the 1997 IRR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> of RA 8291.<br><br><i>Premium pay was granted in lieu<br>of leave benefits</i><br><br>The OSG, in its <i>Manifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Comment)</i>, argued for the validity of JC No. 99-3, stating:<br><br><blockquote>Before dealing on the issue of whether payment of the government share corresponding to the GSIS contributions of [Tolentino <i>et al</i>.] can be validly sourced from the twenty percent (20%) of their premium pay, it is imperative to revisit the origin of the twenty percent (20%) premium pay and the rationale for the grant thereof.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>xxx the rationale behind the grant of the twenty percent (20%) premium pay to contractual employees was that they were not then entitled as a matter of right to vacation, sick and other special leave privileges like the regular government personnel. xxx<br><br>Subsequently, however, or on August 23, 1999, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) issued Memorandum Circular No. 14, Series of 1999, granting contractual employees the same special and privilege leave benefits being granted to regular personnel in the government service. xxx<br><br>Of necessity, therefore, <b>the rationale for the grant of the twenty percent (20%) premium pay to contractual employees ceased to exist with the issuance of the aforesaid resolution.</b><br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>There is no dimunition of benefits to speak of in this case because effective August 23, 1999, all contractual employees were already entitled to leave benefits in lieu of the twenty percent (20%) premium pay. In fact, pursuant to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, Series of 1999, the DENR granted its contractual employees leave benefits starting September 1999. <b>Thus, the government share on the GSIS contributions could be validly sourced from the twenty percent (20%) premium pay effective September of 1999</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><center>(Emphasis supplied.)</center></blockquote><br>We agree.<br><br>Due to the nature of their employment, contractual employees (unlike their counterparts in the regular government service) were previously not entitled to leave credits as a matter of right. To balance this seemingly inequitable situation, contractual employees, under CSC Resolution No. 983142 (otherwise known as the Omnibus Rules on Leave) were allowed to receive compensation twenty percent (20%) higher than the salaries of regular employees occupying equivalent positions. The grant of one benefit, however, appears to preclude entitlement to the other:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Contractual employees are not entitled to leave credits as a matter of right.</i>â In view of the nature of their employment, employees hired on contractual basis are not entitled to vacation, sick, and other special leave privileges. To offset their non-entitlement to leave benefits, contractual employees may be paid compensation twenty percent (20%) higher than the salaries of regular employees occupying equivalent positions. <b>If contractual employees are not given the 20% premium, they should be entitled to vacation and sick leave</b>.<br><br>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, and consistent with the grant of premium pay to contractual employees, Section 44 of the 1999 GAA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> provided that such personnel <b>may</b> be paid compensation, inclusive of fees, honoraria, per diems and allowances <i>not exceeding 120% of the minimum salary of a regular employee in an equivalent position</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 44. <i>Employment of Contractual Personnel.</i> Heads of departments, bureaus, offices or agencies, when authorized in their respective appropriations provided in this Act, may hire contractual personnel as part of the organization to perform regular Agency functions and specific vital activities or services which cannot be provided by the regular or permanent staff of the hiring agency.<br><br>The contractual personnel employed pursuant to this Section shall be considered as an employee of the hiring agency, limited to such period when their services are reasonably required. <b>Such contractual personnel <u>may</u> be paid compensation, inclusive of fees, honoraria, per diems and allowances not exceeding 120% of the minimum salary of an equivalent position</b> in the Position Classification and Compensation System, but not to exceed the salary of his immediate superior, chargeable against the Personal Services funds of the Agency in accordance with the National Government Chart of Accounts.<br><br><center>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</center></blockquote><br>Similar provisions can also be found in the GAA for the previous years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On August 23, 1999, the Omnibus Rules on Leave were amended, which included the grant of leave privileges not previously given to contractual personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Perforce, contractual employees who are now granted leave benefits are no longer entitled as a matter of right to the twenty percent (20%) premium pay.

This is supported by Section 34 of the 1999 GAA which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 34</b>. <i>Funding of Personnel Benefits. </i>-<b> The personnel benefits costs of government officials and employees shall be charged <u>against the respective funds from which their compensations are paid</u></b>.

There is thus nothing on the available record by which this Court can validate their alleged contractual entitlement to premium pay.

What is disturbing is, respondent GSIS required petitioners to pay their contributions, including penalties and surcharges to the GSIS retroactive to the year 1997 even when petitioners were exempted by the GSIS from the coverage of RA 8291 xxx Individually, petitioners were being denied by the GSIS to avail of benefits unless they would pay for their contributions retroactive to year 1997.

Assuming without admitting that the said exemption had been revoked, the GSIS-DBM failed to inform the DENR administrative services of the alleged revocation. In fact, the DENR was officially informed about the GSIS-DBM circular sometime in September 1999.

Section 3 of RA 8291 is clear that, save for specified officials of the Government, membership in the GSIS shall be compulsory for all employees, regardless of employment status. Neither can they claim exemption based on the letter dated January 8, 1998 sent by then GSIS SVP Patag advising them of their non-coverage. We agree with the OSG's argument thus:<br><br><blockquote>[Tolentino <i>et al</i>.] cannot invoke the letter dated January 12, 1998 of Atty. Quilatan citing the letter-opinion of Senior Vice President Lourdes G.

CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, which granted leave benefits to contractual personnel, was issued only on August 23, 1999 or <i>nearly four months after the JC No. 99-3 was issued.</i><br><br>At the time of the issuance of JC No. 99-3, Tolentino <i>et al</i>. did not as yet have leave credits and were still entitled to the twenty percent (20%) premium pay.

Section 5 of RA 8291 shows a clear intent to divide responsibility forÂ· payment of the required GSIS premiums between the government employer and the covered employee. The pertinent CSC rules, on the other hand, show a clear policy to equitably balance the benefits given to regular and contractual personnel of the government. This was evident, first, in the provision of premium pay to contractual employees in lieu of leave benefits and, ultimately, in the eventual grant of leave benefits to such personnel.<br><br>In light of the above policies, JC No. 99-3 should be understood to have meant to apply prospectively, that is, payment of the government share out of the twenty percent (20%) premium pay should start <i>only after the contractual employees entitlement to said pay was considered withdrawn with the grant of leave benefits.</i> Thus, payment of the government share in GSIS contributions from the premium pay of contractual employees cannot be made earlier than the effectivity of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, s. 1999.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition in <b>G.R.
