The plan culminated in a stand-off on February 26, 2006 inside the PMC's headquarters in Fort Bonifacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Petitioners were among the thirty (30) military officers who joined the stand-off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As a result of the stand-off, an <i>Ad Hoc</i> Investigating Committee (AHIC) was created to conduct an inquiry on the facts and circumstances that led to the February 24-26, 2006 aborted plan. In an Investigation Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated July 7, 2006, the AHIC recommended that the petitioners, together with other officers and enlisted personnel, be charged before a General Court Martial for violations of the applicable Articles of War.

Pedro G. Herrera-Davila, Staff Judge Advocate for the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (CSAFP). In his Pre-Trial Advice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated November 7, 2006, Col. Davila disapproved the PTI Report and recommended the referral to trial by a General Court Martial of the 37 AFP Officers, including the petitioners, for violations of Articles 96 (for all of the petitioners) and 97 (only for Segumalian). He also recommended that they be tried for violations of other offenses considering that the available evidence established a <i>prima facie</i> case against them. The offenses allegedly committed by the petitioners, as found by Col. Davila, are as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;" width="50%">NAME</td><td width="50%"><div align="center">Articles of War</div></td></tr><tr><td>COL ORLANDO E DE LEON</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>COL ARMANDO V BAÑEZ</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>LTC ACHILLES S SEGUMALIAN</td><td><div align="center">67, 96 &amp; 97</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAJ JASON LAUREANO Y AQUINO</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAJ JOSE LEOMAR M DOCTOLERO</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>CPT JOEY T FONTIVEROS</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>CPT WILLIAM F UPANO</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96</div></td></tr><tr><td>1LT ERVIN C DIVINAGRACIA</td><td><div align="center">67 &amp; 96<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Thereafter, in a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated November 17, 2006, Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. created and convened a Special General Court Martial to try petitioners' cases and other high-ranking military officers. In Letter Order No. 758<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated November 24, 2006, Commodore Paterno E. Labiano, the Adjutant General, designated the officers, to be detailed as the President and members of the Special General Court-Martial No. 2, who will try petitioners' cases.<br><br>Hence, these petitions.<br><br>In seeking to nullify the Memorandum dated November 17, 2006 and Letter Order No. 758, petitioners allege that the creation of Special General Court Martial No. 2 violates their right to due process under the Constitution and the Articles of War. For one, a Special General Court Martial is not among those allowed by the Articles of War to be created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A special court martial is different from a general court martial. They have different powers and functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Further, citing Articles 8,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 9,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> 45,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the Articles of War, the petitioners pointed out that Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. cannot be the accuser, appointing authority, witness, prosecutor and reviewer of the findings of the Special General Court Martial No. 2 all at the same time.<br><br>They also claim that Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. already displayed manifest partiality when he openly declared even before the start of the pre-trial investigation that all the accused should be prosecuted before a court martial for their attempt to overthrow the government. He also executed an affidavit against some of the accused officers and expressed his willingness and determination to testify against them. Moreover, despite the PTI Report and the Pre-Trial Advice absolving the accused officers of the charge of attempted mutiny, Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. overruled the findings and proceeded to indict them for mutiny. He then immediately ordered the creation of the court martial without even stating the factual and legal bases of the charges. Petitioners argue that Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. should have afforded more weight to the PTI Report as the basis for issuing the said Memorandum, the Panel being considered as a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the PTI Report, the Panel already declared that petitioners cannot be prosecuted for Attempting to Create or Begin a Mutiny under Article 67, but only for Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and Gentleman under Article 96 of the Articles of War, because of clear absence of overt acts which proximately tended to create an intended or actual collective insubordination.<br><br>Thus, petitioners argue that their continuing confinement in a maximum security detention facility at Camp General Mateo Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal violates Article 70<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the Articles of War because they were never charged with any crime or serious offense defined in the Articles of War when they were placed in confinement in July 2006. Further, they were not restricted to the barracks, quarters or tent as Article 70 mandates, but were placed in confinement in a maximum security detention facility.<br><br>Respondents counter, among other things, that Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. correctly referred petitioners' charges to Special General Court Martial No. 2 for trial. The ruling of the Panel which recommended the dismissal of the charge for violation of Article 67 of the Articles of War against petitioners was merely recommendatory and thus, not binding on Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. Notably, both the AHIC in its Investigation Report and the Staff Advocate General in his Pre-Trial Advice recommended the referral of the charges against petitioners to court martial. Thus, there was a prima facie case against petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Respondents also maintain that Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr.'s affidavit and alleged statements that petitioners should be tried before court martial does not make the Memorandum creating Special General Court Martial No. 2 illegal. Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. is expressly authorized to convene a court-martial to try the charges against all petitioners. He is not the judge of the charges against petitioners. Even if he approves the findings and sentence imposed by the court-martial, this is still subject to confirmation by the President in certain cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. is not the accuser, prosecutor and the judge of the charges against the petitioners. He did not swear to the charges against the petitioners and he was not among the designated prosecutors. There is even no impediment for Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. to act as an accuser or prosecutor on the basis of No. 5, paragraph 3, Chapter III, of Executive Order No. 178 (A Manual for Courts-Martial, Armed Forces of the Philippines), which provides in part that: (1) whether the commander who convened the court is the accuser or the prosecutor is mainly to be determined by his personal feeling or interest in the matter; and (2) an action by a commander which is merely official and in the strict line of his duty cannot be regarded as sufficient to disqualify him.<br><br>Respondents also argue that the remedies of writs of prohibition and <i>habeas corpus</i> are unavailing. Under Article 8 of the Articles of War and No. 5, paragraph 5, Chapter III, of Executive Order No. 178,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Lt. Gen. Esperon, Jr. is authorized to create or appoint a court-martial and to determine the cases to be referred to the court martial for trial. Thus, the Special General Court Martial No. 2 has jurisdiction over the cases filed against petitioners. Petitioners were likewise lawfully arrested and confined as a result of the charges against them for violations of the Articles of War pursuant to Article 70 thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br><b>We dismiss the petitions on the ground of mootness.</b><br><br>Pending the resolution of this case, Special General Court Martial No. 2 rendered the following various resolutions finding the petitioners not guilty of the charges against them:<br><ol><li>Partial Ruling or Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated October 16, 2009, cited in the After Trial Report rendered on the same date, adjudging Divinagracia not guilty;<br><br></li><li>Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated March 2, 2010 adjudging Bañez not guilty;<br><br></li><li>Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated September 28, 2010 adjudging De Leon, Segumalian, Doctolero, and Upano not guilty;<br><br></li><li>Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated February 14, 2011 adjudging Aquino and Fontiveros not guilty.<br></li></ol>Thus, this case has been rendered moot and academic by these various resolutions.<br><br>In <i>David v.
