SP Nos. 04598, 04607, and 04608 which set aside the Writ of Possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated June 19, 2009 and the Writ of Demolition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated August 28, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Roxas City, Capiz, Branch 15 (RTC Br. 15) in Special Civil Action No. V-7075 (SCA No. V-7075), involving Lot 145-A and Lot No. 1839-pt, with areas of 7,652 and 8,381 square meters, respectively, both located in Barangay IX, Roxas City, Capiz (subject lots), issued in favor of petitioner Edmund Sia (petitioner).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Due to the real property tax delinquencies of Panay Railways, Incorporated (PRI) over the subject lots covering the years 1992 to 1996, the City Treasurer of Roxas City (City Treasurer) auctioned the subject lots, with petitioner as the highest bidder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Consequently, on December 20, 1996, a Certificate of Sale was issued in petitioner’s favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This notwithstanding, petitioner was not able to take possession thereof in view of the refusal of the City Treasurer to issue a Final Bill of Sale despite the lapse of the one-year redemption period. Worse, then-Mayor Juliano Alba (Mayor Alba) of Roxas City issued Executive Order No. (EO) 08-97, nullifying the auction sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Hence, petitioner was constrained to file a Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for the annulment of EO 08-97, <i>mandamus</i>, and damages on February 4, 1998 against the City Treasurer, Mayor Alba, the members of the City Council of Roxas City, the Roxas City Government, and the PRI before the RTC of Roxas City, Branch 17 (RTC Br. 17), docketed as SCA No. V-7075, ultimately seeking that a Final Bill of Sale over the subject lots be issued to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated March 21, 2001, the RTC Br. 17 ruled in petitioner’s favor, and accordingly ordered the City Treasurer to issue the Final Bill of Sale as prayed for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> PRI appealed to the CA, which affirmed the RTC Br. 17’s ruling<i> in toto</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Dissatisfied, PRI appealed to the Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was denied outright for having been filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period and for failure to pay the docket and other fees on time. On October 23, 2007, the Court’s ruling became final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for execution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> before the RTC Br. 15 and was granted the corresponding writ on February 28, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>This notwithstanding, the City Treasurer refused to issue the Final Bill of Sale, positing that petitioner still had to settle the delinquent real property taxes over the subject lots in the amount of P2,394,526.44 which accrued during the pendency of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Instead of paying said delinquent taxes, petitioner filed a Motion for Order Divesting Panay Railway, [Inc. of] Title and Vesting Title to Plaintiff Edmund Sia<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated March 31, 2008. Finding the motion to be meritorious, the RTC Br. 15 issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated June 10, 2008 granting petitioner’s motion, and likewise holding that petitioner cannot be held liable for any real property tax prior to the issuance of a Final Bill of Sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, petitioner moved for the delivery of the possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the subject lots as they were already being occupied by third parties, including herein respondents Wilfredo Arcenas, Fernando Lopez, and Pablo Rafanan (respondents). Thus, a Writ of Possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated June 19, 2009, and eventually, a Writ of Demolition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated August 28, 2009 were issued in petitioner’s favor.<br><br>Respondents, who, at that time, were occupying the subject lots as lessees of PRI, moved for the quashal of the abovementioned writs,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> essentially contending that the March 21, 2001 Decision in SCA No. V-7075 sought to be executed arose from a mandamus petition where a writ of possession is proscribed. They posited that the execution of a final judgment in a <i>mandamus</i> case is similar to the execution of special judgments as provided in Section 11, Rule 39 in relation to Section 9, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In his Opposition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> petitioner argued that the ruling in SCA No. V-7075, as well as the orders directing the issuance of the Final Bill of Sale and the divesting of PRI’s title over the subject lots entitles him to their possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b><center>The RTC Br. 15 Ruling<br></center></b><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated September 18, 2009, the RTC Br. 15 denied respondents’ motion to quash. It held that the proceedings for tax delinquency sale at a public auction takes the nature of, or is akin to, an extrajudicial foreclosure, thus necessitating the issuance of the corresponding writs of possession and demolition. In this relation, it agreed with petitioner’s posture that his entitlement to the aforesaid writs arose from the ruling in SCA No. V-7075, as well as the orders directing the issuance of the Final Bill of Sale, thereby vesting unto petitioner title over the subject lots.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Respondents moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated October 15, 2009. Aggrieved, respondents elevated the matter to the CA through three (3) separate petitions for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated January 31, 2013, the CA set aside RTC Br. 15’s June 19, 2009 Writ of Possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and August 28, 2009 Writ of Demolition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and directed the said court to enforce with dispatch the Writ of Execution dated February 28, 2008 in accordance with Section 11, Rule 39 in relation to Section 9, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>It held that the writs of possession and demolition issued by the RTC Br. 15 are null and void as they were issued beyond the ambit of the March 21, 2001 Decision in SCA No. V-7075.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In this regard, the CA ruled that since SCA No. V-7075 is one for <i>mandamus</i>, the RTC Br. 15’s power in executing the judgment therein is limited to directing compliance with the judgment (<i>i.e.</i>, ordering the City Treasurer to issue a Final Bill of Sale in petitioner’s favor) and, in case of refusal, punish with contempt the person required by law to obey the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated March 1, 2013, which was, eventually, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated August 29, 2013, hence, this petition.<br><br><b><center>The Issue Before the Court<br></center></b><br>The primordial issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA correctly declared the writs of possession and demolition null and void, and accordingly directed the RTC Br. 15 to enforce the Writ of Execution dated February 28, 2008 in accordance with Section 11, Rule 39 in relation to Section 9, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b><center>The Court’s Ruling<br></center></b><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>At the outset, it is essential to note that the petition in SCA No. V-7075 before the RTC Br. 17 is primarily that of <i>mandamus</i>, seeking that the court, through the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i>, compel the City Treasurer to issue a Final Bill of Sale covering the subject lots in petitioner’s favor pursuant to its mandate under Section 262<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of Republic Act No. 7160,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> otherwise known as the “Local Government Code of 1991” (LGC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In fact, the RTC Br. 17 granted such petition when it declared valid the auction sale where petitioner purchased the subject lots in supersession of EO 08-97, and accordingly ordered the City Treasurer to issue the sought for Final Bill of Sale, viz.:<br><br><blockquote>Judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1. Declaring Panay Railways Inc. and/or the subject [lots] as not exempt from real property Taxes and declaring the auction sale of December 20, 1996 as valid and binding;<br><br>2. Ordering the City Treasurer of Roxas City to issue in favor of the petitioner the Final Bill of Sale over [the subject lots] described in the petition.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>As case law defines, a writ of <i>mandamus</i> is a “command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to an inferior court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person, requiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty results from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from operation of law. It is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, which, as opposed to a discretionary one, is that which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his or its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, the judgment in SCA No. V-7075 primarily compels the City Treasurer to issue the Final Bill of Sale covering the subject lots in favor of petitioner pursuant to Section 262 of the LGC, a ministerial duty, which said officer unduly refused to perform. Thus, it may be properly deemed as a judgment ordering the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus </i>against the City Treasurer.<br><br>Given that the judgment in SCA No. V-7075 ordered the issuance of a writ of<i> mandamus</i> compelling the performance of a ministerial duty, and not the payment of money or the sale or delivery of real or personal property, the same is in the nature of a special judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> – that is which a judgment directs the performance of a specific act requiring the party or person to personally do because of his personal qualifications and circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As such, execution of the said judgment should be governed by Section 11, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11.<i> Execution of special judgments.</i> – When a judgment requires the performance of any act other than those mentioned in [Sections 9 and 10, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court], a certified copy of the judgment shall be attached to the writ of execution and shall be served by the officer upon the party against whom the same is rendered, or upon any other person required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and such party or person may be punished for contempt if he disobeys such judgment.<br></blockquote><br>This is in consonance with the rule on service and enforcement of orders or judgments concerning, among others, the special civil action of <i>mandamus</i> under Section 9, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 9. <i>Service and enforcement of order or judgment. </i>– A certified copy of the judgment rendered in accordance with the last preceding section shall be served upon the court, quasi-judicial agency, tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person concerned in such manner as the court may direct, and disobedience thereto shall be punished as contempt. An execution may issue for any damages or costs awarded in accordance with Section 1 of Rule 39.</blockquote><br>The rule therefore is that the service and execution of a special judgment, such as a favorable judgment in <i>mandamus </i>– as in this case – should be deemed to be limited to directing compliance with the judgment, and in case of disobedience, to have the disobedient person required by law to obey such judgment punished with contempt.<br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that the City Treasurer obstinately refused to issue the Final Bill of Sale in petitioner’s favor, despite the finality of the judgment in SCA No. V-7075, as well as the issuance and service of the Writ of Execution dated February 28, 2008 commanding him to do so. In view of such refusal, the RTC Br. 15 should have cited the City Treasurer in contempt in order to enforce obedience to the said judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> However, instead of simply doing so, it granted petitioner’s numerous motions, resulting in, among others, the issuance of a writ of possession.<br><br>A writ of possession is defined as a “writ of execution employed to enforce a judgment to recover the possession of land. It commands the sheriff to enter the land and give its possession to the person entitled under the judgment.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It may be issued under the following instances: (a) land registration proceedings under Section 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of Act No. 496,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> otherwise known as “The Land Registration Act;” (b) judicial foreclosure, provided the debtor is in possession of the mortgaged realty and no third person, not a party to the foreclosure suit, had intervened; (c) extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage under Section 7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of Act No. 3135,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> as amended by Act No. 4118;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and (d) in execution sales.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Proceeding therefrom, the issuance of a writ of possession is only proper in order to execute judgments ordering the delivery of specific properties to a litigant, in accordance with Section 10, Rule 39,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<br><br>As already discussed, the judgment in SCA No. V-7075 sought to be enforced in the case at bar only declared valid the auction sale where petitioner bought the subject lots, and accordingly ordered the City Treasurer to issue a Final Bill of Sale to petitioner. Since the said judgment did not order that the possession of the subject lots be vested unto petitioner, the RTC Br. 15 substantially varied the terms of the aforesaid judgment – and thus, exceeded its authority in enforcing the same – when it issued the corresponding writs of possession and demolition to vest unto petitioner the possession of the subject lots. It is well-settled that orders pertaining to execution of judgments must substantially conform to the dispositive portion of the decision sought to be executed. As such, it may not vary, or go beyond, the terms of the judgment it seeks to enforce.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Where the execution is not in harmony with the judgment which gives it life and exceeds it, it has no validity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Had the petitioner pursued an action for ejectment or reconveyance, the issuance of writs of possession and demolition would have been proper; but not in a special civil action for mandamus, as in this case.<br><br>Perforce, the CA correctly ruled that the Writ of Possession dated June 19, 2009 and the Writ of Demolition dated August 28, 2009 issued in this case are null and void for having been rendered beyond the authority of RTC Br. 15 in enforcing the judgment in SCA No. V-7075.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED.</b> Accordingly, the Decision dated January 31, 2013 and the Resolution dated August 29, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
