Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution recognizes as an exception to the ban on midnight appointments only “temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety.” None of the petitioners claim that their appointments fall under this exception.<br><br><b><i>Appointments</i></b><br><br><i>G.R.

Aquino III (President Aquino) took his oath of office as President of the Republic of the Philippines. On 30 July 2010, President Aquino issued EO 2 recalling, withdrawing, and revoking appointments issued by President Macapagal-Arroyo which violated the constitutional ban on midnight appointments.<br><br>The entirety of EO 2 reads:<br><blockquote><center>EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2<br><br>RECALLING, WITHDRAWING, AND REVOKING APPOINTMENTS ISSUED BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON MIDNIGHT APPOINTMENTS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.<br></center><br>WHEREAS, Sec. 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution provides that “Two months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the end of his term, a President or Acting President shall not make appointments, except temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety.”;<br><br>WHEREAS, in the case of “<i>In re: Appointments dated March 30, 1998 of Hon. Mateo Valenzuela and Hon. Vallarta as Judges of the Regional Trial Court of Branch 62 of Bago City and Branch 24 of Cabanatuan City, respectively</i>” (A.M. No. 98-5-01-SC Nov. 9, 1998), the Supreme Court interpreted this provision to mean that the President is neither required to make appointments nor allowed to do so during the two months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the end of her term. The only known exceptions to this prohibition are (1) temporary appointments in the executive positions when continued vacancies will prejudice public service or endanger public safety and in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the case of De Castro, et al. vs. JBC and PGMA, G.R. No. 191002, 17 March 2010, (2) appointments to the Judiciary;<br><br>WHEREAS, Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code provides that:<br><br>“Section 261. <i>Prohibited Acts</i>.– The following shall be guilty of an election offense:<br><br>(g) Appointments of new employees, creation of new position, promotion, or giving salary increases. – During the period of forty-five days before a regular election and thirty days before a special election.<br><br>(1) Any head, official or appointing officer of a government office, agency or instrumentality, whether national or local, including government-owned or controlled corporations, who appoints or hires any new employee, whether provisional, temporary or casual, or creates and fills any new position, except upon prior authority to the Commission. The Commission shall not grant the authority sought unless it is satisfied that the position to be filled is essential to the proper functioning of the office or agency concerned, and that the position shall not be filled in a manner that may influence the election.<br><br>As an exception to the foregoing provisions, a new employee may be appointed in the case of urgent need:<br><br>Provided, however, that notice of the appointment shall be given to the Commission within three days from the date of the appointment. Any appointment or hiring in violation of this provision shall be null and void.<br><br>(2) Any government official who promotes or gives any increase of salary or remuneration or privilege to any government official or employee, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations.”;<br><br>WHEREAS, it appears on record that a number of appointments were made on or about 10 March 2010 in complete disregard of the intent and spirit of the constitutional ban on midnight appointment and which deprives the new administration of the power to make its own appointment;<br><br>WHEREAS, based on established jurisprudence, an appointment is deemed complete only upon acceptance of the appointee;<br><br>WHEREAS, in order to strengthen the civil service system, it is necessary to uphold the principle that appointments to the civil service must be made on the basis of merit and fitness, it is imperative to recall, withdraw, and revoke all appointments made in violation of the letter and spirit of the law;<br><br><i>NOW, THEREFORE</i>, I, BENIGNO S. AQUINO III, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution as President of the Philippines, do hereby order and direct that:<br><br>SECTION 1. Midnight Appointments Defined. – The following appointments made by the former President and other appointing authorities in departments, agencies, offices, and instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered as midnight appointments:<br><br>(a) Those <b>made on or after March 11, 2010</b>, including <u>all appointments bearing dates prior to March 11, 2010 where the appointee has accepted, or taken his oath, or assumed public office on or after March 11, 2010</u>, except temporary appointments in the executive positions when continued vacancies will prejudice public service or endanger public safety as may be determined by the appointing authority.<br><br>(b) Those made prior to March 11, 2010, but to take effect after said date or appointments to office that would be vacant only after March 11, 2010.<br><br>(c) Appointments and promotions made during the period of 45 days prior to the May 10, 2010 elections in violation of Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code.<br><br>SECTION 2. Recall, Withdraw, and Revocation of Midnight Appointments. Midnight appointments, as defined under Section 1, are hereby recalled, withdrawn, and revoked. The positions covered or otherwise affected are hereby declared vacant.<br><br>SECTION 3. Temporary designations. – When necessary to maintain efficiency in public service and ensure the continuity of government operations, the Executive Secretary may designate an officer-in-charge (OIC) to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of any of those whose appointment has been recalled, until the replacement of the OIC has been appointed and qualified.<br><br>SECTION 4. Repealing Clause. – All executive issuances, orders, rules and regulations or part thereof inconsistent with the provisions of this Executive Order are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.<br><br>SECTION 5.

Cadiz instructed a Senior Assistant Solicitor General to inform the officers and employees affected by EO 2 that they were terminated from service effective the next day.<br><br>Atty. Velicaria-Garafil reported for work on 9 August 2010 without any knowledge of her termination. She was made to return the office-issued laptop and cellphone, and was told that her salary ceased as of 7 August 2010. On 12 August 2010, Atty. Velicaria-Garafil was informed that her former secretary at the OSG received a copy of a memorandum on her behalf. The memorandum, dated 9 August 2010, bore the subject “Implementation of Executive Order No. 2 dated 30 July 2010” and was addressed to the OSG’s Director of Finance and Management Service.<br><br>Atty. Velicaria-Garafil filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. 193327) before this Court on 1 September 2010.

De Lima), designated Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Anthony D. Fadullon (Pros. Fadullon) as Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In a letter to Sec. De Lima dated 15 September 2010, Atty. Venturanza asked for clarification of his status, duties, and functions since DOJ Order No. 556 did not address the same. Atty. Venturanza also asked for a status quo ante order to prevent Pros. Fadullon from usurping the position and functions of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City. Atty. Venturanza also wrote a letter to President Aquino on the same day, and sought reaffirmation of his promotion as City Prosecutor of Quezon City.<br><br>On 6 October 2010, Atty. Venturanza received a letter dated 25 August 2010 from Sec. De Lima which directed him to relinquish the office to which he was appointed, and to cease from performing its functions.<br><br>Atty. Venturanza filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, Mandamus with Urgent Prayer for Status Quo Ante Order, Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Mandatory Injunction (G.R.

He filed a petition for prohibition, declaratory relief and preliminary injunction with prayer for temporary restraining order (G.R. No. 192987) before this Court on 9 August 2010.

Whether all midnight appointments, including those of petitioners and intervenors, were invalid;<br><br>3. Whether the appointments of the petitioners and intervenors were made with undue haste, hurried maneuvers, for partisan reasons, and not in accordance with good faith; and<br><br>4.

The CA consistently ruled that EO 2 is constitutional. The CA, however, issued different rulings as to the evaluation of the circumstances of petitioners’ appointments. In the cases of Attys. Velicaria-Garafil and Venturanza, the CA stated that the OP should consider the circumstances of their appointments. In the cases of Villanueva, Rosquita, and Atty. Tamondong, the CA explicitly stated that the revocation of their appointments was proper because they were midnight appointees.<br><br><i>G.R. No. 203372 (CA-G.R.

Any valid appointment, including one made under the exception provided in Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, must consist of the President signing an appointee’s appointment paper to a vacant office, the official transmittal of the appointment paper (preferably through the MRO), receipt of the appointment paper by the appointee, and acceptance of the appointment by the appointee evidenced by his or her oath of office or his or her assumption to office.<br><br><i>Aytona v. Castillo</i> (Aytona)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> is the basis for Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. <i>Aytona</i> defined “midnight or last minute” appointments for Philippine jurisprudence. President Carlos P. Garcia submitted on 29 December 1961, his last day in office, 350 appointments, including that of Dominador R. Aytona for Central Bank Governor. President Diosdado P. Macapagal assumed office on 30 December 1961, and issued on 31 December 1961 Administrative Order No. 2 recalling, withdrawing, and cancelling all appointments made by President Garcia after 13 December 1961 (President Macapagal’s proclamation date). President Macapagal appointed Andres V. Castillo as Central Bank Governor on 1 January 1962. This Court dismissed Aytona’s <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding against Castillo, and upheld Administrative Order No. 2’s cancellation of the “midnight or last minute” appointments. We wrote:<br><blockquote>x x x But the issuance of 350 appointments in one night and the planned induction of almost all of them a few hours before the inauguration of the new President may, with some reason, be regarded by the latter as an abuse of Presidential prerogatives, the steps taken being apparently a mere partisan effort to fill all vacant positions irrespective of fitness and other conditions, and thereby to deprive the new administration of an opportunity to make the corresponding appointments.<br><br>x x x Now it is hard to believe that in signing 350 appointments in one night, President Garcia exercised such “double care” which was required and expected of him; and therefore, there seems to be force to the contention that these appointments fall beyond the intent and spirit of the constitutional provision granting to the Executive authority to issue <i>ad interim</i> appointments.<br><br>Under the circumstances above described, what with the separation of powers, this Court resolves that it must decline to disregard the Presidential Administrative Order No. 2, cancelling such “midnight” or “last-minute” appointments.<br><br>Of course the Court is aware of many precedents to the effect that once an appointment has been issued, it cannot be reconsidered, specially where the appointee has qualified. But none of them refer to mass <i>ad interim</i> appointments (three hundred and fifty), issued in the last hours of an outgoing Chief Executive, in a setting similar to that outlined herein. On the other hand, the authorities admit of exceptional circumstances justifying revocation and if any circumstances justify revocation, those described herein should fit the exception.<br><br>Incidentally, it should be stated that the underlying reason for denying the power to revoke after the appointee has qualified is the latter’s equitable rights. Yet it is doubtful if such equity might be successfully set up in the present situation, considering the rush conditional appointments, hurried maneuvers and other happenings detracting from that degree of good faith, morality and propriety which form the basic foundation of claims to equitable relief. The appointees, it might be argued, wittingly or unwittingly cooperated with the stratagem to beat the deadline, whatever the resultant consequences to the dignity and efficiency of the public service. Needless to say, there are instances wherein not only strict legality, but also fairness, justice and righteousness should be taken into account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>During the deliberations for the 1987 Constitution, then Constitutional Commissioner (now retired Supreme Court Chief Justice) Hilario G. Davide, Jr. referred to this Court’s ruling in <i>Aytona</i> and stated that his proposal seeks to prevent a President, whose term is about to end, from preempting his successor by appointing his own people to sensitive positions.<br><blockquote>MR. DAVIDE: The idea of the proposal is that about the end of the term of the President, he may prolong his rule indirectly by appointing people to these sensitive positions, like the commissions, the Ombudsman, the judiciary, so he could perpetuate himself in power even beyond his term of office; therefore foreclosing the right of his successor to make appointments to these positions. We should realize that the term of the President is six years and under what we had voted on, there is no reelection for him. Yet he can continue to rule the country through appointments made about the end of his term to these sensitive positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The 1986 Constitutional Commission put a definite period, or an empirical value, on <i>Aytona</i>’s intangible “stratagem to beat the deadline,” and also on the act of “preempting the President’s successor,” which shows a lack of “good faith, morality and propriety.” Subject to only one exception, appointments made during this period are thus automatically prohibited under the Constitution, regardless of the appointee’s qualifications or even of the President’s motives. The period for prohibited appointments covers two months before the elections until the end of the President’s term. The Constitution, with a specific exception, ended the President’s power to appoint “two months immediately before the next presidential elections.” For an appointment to be valid, it must be made outside of the prohibited period or, failing that, fall under the specified exception.<br><br>The dissent insists that, during the prohibited period, an appointment should be viewed in its “narrow sense.” In its narrow sense, an appointment is not a process, but is only an “executive act that the President unequivocally exercises pursuant to his discretion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The dissent makes acceptance of the appointment inconsequential. The dissent holds that an appointment is void if the appointment is made before the ban but the transmittal and acceptance are made after the ban. However, the dissent holds that an appointment is valid, or “efficacious,” if the appointment and transmittal are made before the ban even if the acceptance is made after the ban. In short, the dissent allows an appointment to take effect during the ban, as long as the President signed and transmitted the appointment before the ban, even if the appointee never received the appointment paper before the ban and accepted the appointment only during the ban.<br><br>The dissent’s view will lead to glaring absurdities. Allowing the dissent’s proposal that an appointment is complete merely upon the signing of an appointment paper and its transmittal, excluding the appointee’s acceptance from the appointment process, will lead to the absurdity that, in case of non-acceptance, the position is considered occupied and nobody else may be appointed to it. Moreover, an incumbent public official, appointed to another public office by the President, will automatically be deemed to occupy the new public office and to have automatically resigned from his first office upon transmittal of his appointment paper, even if he refuses to accept the new appointment. This will result in chaos in public service.<br><br>Even worse, a President who is unhappy with an incumbent public official can simply appoint him to another public office, effectively removing him from his first office without due process. The mere transmittal of his appointment paper will remove the public official from office without due process and even without cause, in violation of the Constitution.<br><br>The dissent’s proferred excuse (that the appointee is not alluded to in Section 15, Article VII) for its rejection of “acceptance by the appointee” as an integral part of the appointment process ignores the reason for the limitation of the President’s power to appoint, which is to prevent the outgoing President from continuing to rule the country indirectly after the end of his term. The 1986 Constitutional Commission installed a definite cut-off date as an objective and unbiased marker against which this once-in-every-six-years prohibition should be measured.<br><br>The dissent’s assertion that appointment should be viewed in its narrow sense (and is not a process) <b><i><u>only</u></i></b> during the prohibited period is selective and time-based, and ignores well-settled jurisprudence. For purposes of complying with the time limit imposed by the appointment ban, the dissent’s position cuts short the appointment process to the signing of the appointment paper and its transmittal, excluding the receipt of the appointment paper and acceptance of the appointment by the appointee.<br><br>The President exercises only <b><i>one</i></b> kind of appointing power. There is no need to differentiate the exercise of the President’s appointing power outside, just before, or during the appointment ban. The Constitution allows the President to exercise the power of appointment during the period not covered by the appointment ban, and disallows (subject to an exception) the President from exercising the power of appointment during the period covered by the appointment ban. The concurrence of all steps in the appointment process is admittedly required for appointments outside the appointment ban. There is no justification whatsoever to remove acceptance as a requirement in the appointment process for appointments just before the start of the appointment ban, or during the appointment ban in appointments falling within the exception. The existence of the appointment ban makes no difference in the power of the President to appoint; it is still the same power to appoint. In fact, considering the purpose of the appointment ban, the concurrence of all steps in the appointment process must be strictly applied on appointments made just before or during the appointment ban.<br><br>In attempting to extricate itself from the obvious consequences of its selective application, the dissent glaringly contradicts itself:<br><blockquote><b>Thus, an acceptance is still necessary in order for the appointee to validly assume his post and discharge the functions of his new office, and thus make the appointment effective.</b> There can never be an instance where the appointment of an incumbent will automatically result in his resignation from his present post and his subsequent assumption of his new position; or where the President can simply remove an incumbent from his current office by appointing him to another one. I stress that acceptance through oath or any positive act is still indispensable before any assumption of office may occur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote>The dissent proposes that this Court ignore well-settled jurisprudence during the appointment ban, but apply the same jurisprudence outside of the appointment ban.<br><blockquote>[T]he well-settled rule in our jurisprudence, that an appointment is a process that begins with the selection by the appointing power and ends with acceptance of the appointment by the appointee, <i>stands</i>. As early as the 1949 case of <i>Lacson v. Romero</i>, this Court laid down the rule that acceptance by the appointee is the last act needed to make an appointment complete. The Court reiterated this rule in the 1989 case of <i>Javier v. Reyes</i>. In the 1996 case of <i>Garces v. Court of Appeals</i>, this Court emphasized that acceptance by the appointee is indispensable to complete an appointment. The 1999 case of <i>Bermudez v. Executive Secretary</i>, cited in the <i>ponencia</i>, affirms this standing rule in our jurisdiction, to wit:<br><blockquote>“The appointment is deemed complete once the last act required of the appointing authority has been complied with and its acceptance thereafter by the appointee in order to render it effective.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The dissent’s assertion creates a <i>singular exception</i> to the well-settled doctrine that appointment is a process that begins with the signing of the appointment paper, followed by the transmittal and receipt of the appointment paper, and becomes complete with the acceptance of the appointment. The dissent makes the singular exception that during the constitutionally mandated ban on appointments, acceptance is not necessary to complete the appointment. The dissent gives no reason why this Court should make such singular exception, which is contrary to the express provision of the Constitution prohibiting the President from making appointments during the ban. The dissent’s singular exception will allow the President, during the ban on appointments, to remove from office incumbents without cause by simply appointing them to another office and transmitting the appointment papers the day before the ban begins, appointments that the incumbents cannot refuse because their acceptance is not required during the ban. Adoption by this Court of the dissent’s singular exception will certainly wreak havoc on the civil service.<br><br>The following elements should <b><i>always</i></b> concur in the making of a valid (which should be understood as both complete and effective) appointment: (1) authority to appoint and evidence of the exercise of the authority; (2) transmittal of the appointment paper and evidence of the transmittal; (3) a vacant position at the time of appointment; and (4) receipt of the appointment paper and acceptance of the appointment by the appointee who possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications. The concurrence of <b><i>all</i></b> these elements should <b><i>always</i></b> apply, regardless of when the appointment is made, whether outside, just before, or during the appointment ban. These steps in the appointment process should always concur and operate as a single process. There is no valid appointment if the process lacks even one step. And, unlike the dissent’s proposal, there is no need to further distinguish between an effective and an ineffective appointment when an appointment is valid.<br><br><i>Appointing Authority</i><br><br>The President’s exercise of his power to appoint officials is provided for in the Constitution and laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Discretion is an integral part in the exercise of the power of appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote>Considering that appointment calls for a selection, the appointing power necessarily exercises a discretion. According to Woodbury, J., “the choice of a person to fill an office constitutes the essence of his appointment,” and Mr. Justice Malcolm adds that an “[a]ppointment to office is intrinsically an executive act involving the exercise of discretion.” <i>In Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i> we held:<br><blockquote>The power to appoint is, in essence, discretionary. The appointing power has the right of choice which he may exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself who is best qualified among those who have the necessary qualifications and eligibilities. It is a prerogative of the appointing power x x x x<br></blockquote>Indeed, the power of choice is the heart of the power to appoint. Appointment involves an exercise of discretion of whom to appoint; it is not a ministerial act of issuing appointment papers to the appointee. In other words, the choice of the appointee is a fundamental component of the appointing power.<br><br>Hence, when Congress clothes the President with the power to appoint an officer, it (Congress) cannot at the same time limit the choice of the President to only one candidate. Once the power of appointment is conferred on the President, such conferment necessarily carries the discretion of whom to appoint. Even on the pretext of prescribing the qualifications of the officer, Congress may not abuse such power as to divest the appointing authority, directly or indirectly, of his discretion to pick his own choice. Consequently, when the qualifications prescribed by Congress can only be met by one individual, such enactment effectively eliminates the discretion of the appointing power to choose and constitutes an irregular restriction on the power of appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Transmittal</i><br><br>It is not enough that the President signs the appointment paper. There should be evidence that the President intended the appointment paper to be issued. It could happen that an appointment paper may be dated and signed by the President months before the appointment ban, but never left his locked drawer for the entirety of his term. Release of the appointment paper through the MRO is an unequivocal act that signifies the President’s intent of its issuance.<br><br>The MRO was created by Memorandum Order No. 1, Series of 1958, Governing the Organization and Functions of the Executive Office and General Matters of Procedure Therein.

Is the MRO required to follow a specific procedure in dispatching outgoing documents?<br><br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Is this procedure observed for the release of an appointment paper signed by the President?<br><br>A: Yes. It is observed for the release of the original copy of the appointment paper signed by the President.<br><br>Q: Can you briefly illustrate the procedure for the release of the original copy of the appointment paper signed by the President?<br><br>A: After an appointment paper is signed by the President, the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) forwards the appointment paper bearing the stamp mark, barcode, and hologram of the Office of the President, together with a transmittal letter, to the MRO for official release. Within the same day, the MRO sends the original copy of the appointment paper together with the transmittal letter and a delivery receipt which contains appropriate spaces for the name of the addressee, the date released, and the date received by the addressee. Only a photocopy of the appointment is retained for the MRO’s official file.<br><br>Q: What is the basis for the process you just discussed?<br><br>A: The Service Guide of the MRO.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: What is the legal basis for the issuance of the MRO Service Guide, if any?<br><br>A: The MRO Service Guide was issued pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 35, Series of 2003 and Memorandum Circular No. 133, Series of 2007.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: Do you exercise any discretion in the release of documents forwarded to the MRO for transmittal to various offices?<br><br>A: No. We are mandated to immediately release all documents and correspondence forwarded to us for transmittal.<br><br>Q: If a document is forwarded by the OES to the MRO today, when is it officially released by the MRO to the department or agency concerned?<br><br>A: The document is released within the day by the MRO if the addressee is within Metro Manila. For example, in the case of the appointment paper of Dindo Venturanza, the OES forwarded to the MRO on March 12, 2010 his original appointment paper dated February 23, 2010 and the transmittal letter dated March 9, 2010 prepared by the OES. The MRO released his appointment paper on the same day or on March 12, 2010, and was also received by the DOJ on March 12, 2010 as shown by the delivery receipt.<br><br>Q: What is the effect if a document is released by an office or department within Malacañan without going through the MRO?<br><br>A: If a document does not pass through the MRO contrary to established procedure, the MRO cannot issue a certified true copy of the same because as far as the MRO is concerned, it does not exist in our official records, hence, not an official document from the Malacañang. There is no way of verifying the document’s existence and authenticity unless the document is on file with the MRO even if the person who claims to have in his possession a genuine document furnished to him personally by the President. As a matter of fact, it is only the MRO which is authorized to issue certified true copies of documents emanating from Malacañan being the official custodian and central repository of said documents. Not even the OES can issue a certified true copy of documents prepared by them.<br><br>Q: Why do you say that, Mr. Witness?<br><br>A: Because the MRO is the so-called “gatekeeper” of the Malacañang Palace. All incoming and outgoing documents and correspondence must pass through the MRO. As the official custodian, the MRO is in charge of the official release of documents.<br><br>Q: What if an appointment paper was faxed by the Office of the Executive Secretary to the appointee, is that considered an official release by the MRO?<br><br>A: No. It is still the MRO which will furnish the original copy of the appointment paper to the appointee. That appointment paper is, at best, only an “advanced copy.”<br><br>Q: Assuming the MRO has already received the original appointment paper signed by the President together with the transmittal letter prepared by the OES, you said that the MRO is bound to transmit these documents immediately, that is, on the same day?<br><br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Were there instances when the President, after the original appointment paper has already been forwarded to the MRO, recalls the appointment and directs the MRO not to transmit the documents?<br><br>A: Yes, there were such instances.<br><br>Q: How about if the document was already transmitted by the MRO, was there any instance when it was directed to recall the appointment and retrieve the documents already transmitted?<br><br>A: Yes, but only in a few instances. Sometimes, when the MRO messenger is already in transit or while he is already in the agency or office concerned, we get a call to hold the delivery.<br><br>Q: You previously outlined the procedure governing the transmittal of original copies of appointment papers to the agency or office concerned. Would you know if this procedure was followed by previous administrations?<br><br>A: Yes. Since I started working in the MRO in 1976, the procedure has been followed. However, it was unusually disregarded when the appointments numbering more than 800 were made by then President Arroyo in March 2010. The MRO did not even know about some of these appointments and we were surprised when we learned about them in the newspapers.<br><br>Q: You mentioned that then President Arroyo appointed more than 800 persons in the month of March alone. How were you able to determine this number?<br><br>A: My staff counted all the appointments made by then President Arroyo within the period starting January 2009 until June 2010.<br><br>Q: What did you notice, if any, about these appointments?<br><br>A: There was a steep rise in the number of appointments made by then President Arroyo in the month of March 2010 compared to the other months.<br><br>Q: Do you have any evidence to show this steep rise?<br><br>A: Yes. I prepared a Certification showing these statistics and the graphical representation thereof.<br><br>Q: If those documents will be shown to you, will you be able to recognize them?<br><br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: I am showing you a Certification containing the number of presidential appointees per month since January 2009 until June 2010, and a graphical representation thereof. Can you go over these documents and tell us the relation of these documents to the ones you previously mentioned?<br><br>A: These are [sic] the Certification with the table of statistics I prepared after we counted the appointments, as well as the graph thereof.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: Out of the more than 800 appointees made in March 2010, how many appointment papers and transmittal letters were released through the MRO?<br><br>A: Only 133 appointment papers were released through the MRO.<br><br>Q: In some of these transmittal letters and appointment papers which were not released through the MRO but apparently through the OES, there were portions on the stamp of the OES which supposedly indicated the date and time it was actually received by the agency or office concerned but were curiously left blank, is this regular or irregular?<br><br>A: It is highly irregular.<br><br>Q: Why do you say so?<br><br>A: Usually, if the document released by the MRO, the delivery receipt attached to the transmittal letter is filled out completely because the dates when the original appointment papers were actually received are very material. It is a standard operating procedure for the MRO personnel to ask the person receiving the documents to write his/her name, his signature, and the date and time when he/she received it.<br><br>Q: So, insofar as these transmittal letters and appointment papers apparently released by the OES are concerned, what is the actual date when the agency or the appointee concerned received it?<br>A: I cannot answer. There is no way of knowing when they were actually received because the date and time were deliberately or inadvertently left blank.<br><br>Q: Can we say that the date appearing on the face of the transmittal letters or the appointment papers is the actual date when it was released by the OES?<br>A: We cannot say that for sure. That is why it is very unusual that the person who received these documents did not indicate the date and time when it was received because these details are very important.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>The MRO’s exercise of its mandate does not prohibit the President or the Executive Secretary from giving the appointment paper directly to the appointee.

If it were indispensable, then a loss of the original appointment paper, which could be brought about by negligence, accident, fraud, fire or theft, corresponds to a loss of the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> However, in case of loss of the original appointment paper, the appointment must be evidenced by a certified true copy issued by the proper office, in this case the MRO.<br><br><i>Vacant Position</i><br><br>An appointment can be made only to a vacant office. An appointment cannot be made to an occupied office. The incumbent must first be legally removed, or his appointment validly terminated, before one could be validly installed to succeed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>To illustrate: in <i>Lacson v. Romero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Antonio Lacson (Lacson) occupied the post of provincial fiscal of Negros Oriental. He was later nominated and confirmed as provincial fiscal of Tarlac. The President nominated and the Commission on Appointments confirmed Honorio Romero (Romero) as provincial fiscal of Negros Oriental as Lacson’s replacement. Romero took his oath of office, but Lacson neither accepted the appointment nor assumed office as provincial fiscal of Tarlac. This Court ruled that Lacson remained as provincial fiscal of Negros Oriental, having declined the appointment as provincial fiscal of Tarlac. There was no vacancy to which Romero could be legally appointed; hence, Romero’s appointment as provincial fiscal of Negros Oriental vice Lacson was invalid.<br><blockquote>The appointment to a government post like that of provincial fiscal to be complete involves several steps. First, comes the nomination by the President. Then to make that nomination valid and permanent, the Commission on Appointments of the Legislature has to confirm said nomination. The last step is the acceptance thereof by the appointee by his assumption of office. The first two steps, nomination and confirmation, constitute a mere offer of a post. They are acts of the Executive and Legislative departments of the Government. But the last necessary step to make the appointment complete and effective rests solely with the appointee himself. He may or he may not accept the appointment or nomination. As held in the case of <i>Borromeo vs. Mariano</i>, 41 Phil. 327, “there is no power in this country which can compel a man to accept an office.” Consequently, since Lacson has declined to accept his appointment as provincial fiscal of Tarlac and no one can compel him to do so, then he continues as provincial fiscal of Negros Oriental and no vacancy in said office was created, unless Lacson had been lawfully removed as such fiscal of Negros Oriental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Paragraph (b), Section 1 of EO 2 considered as midnight appointments those appointments to offices that will only be vacant on or after 11 March 2010 even though the appointments are made prior to 11 March 2010. EO 2 remained faithful to the intent of Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution: the outgoing President is prevented from continuing to rule the country indirectly after the end of his term.<br><br><i>Acceptance by the Qualified Appointee</i><br><br>Acceptance is indispensable to complete an appointment. Assuming office and taking the oath amount to acceptance of the appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> An oath of office is a qualifying requirement for a public office, a prerequisite to the full investiture of the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><i>Javier v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> is instructive in showing how acceptance is indispensable to complete an appointment. On 7 November 1967, petitioner Isidro M. Javier (Javier) was appointed by then Mayor Victorino B. Aldaba as the Chief of Police of Malolos, Bulacan. The Municipal Council confirmed and approved Javier’s appointment on the same date. Javier took his oath of office on 8 November 1967, and subsequently discharged the rights, prerogatives, and duties of the office. On 3 January 1968, while the approval of Javier’s appointment was pending with the CSC, respondent Purificacion C. Reyes (Reyes), as the new mayor of Malolos, sent to the CSC a letter to recall Javier’s appointment. Reyes also designated Police Lt. Romualdo F. Clemente as Officer-in-Charge of the police department. The CSC approved Javier’s appointment as permanent on 2 May 1968, and even directed Reyes to reinstate Javier. Reyes, on the other hand, pointed to the appointment of Bayani Bernardo as Chief of Police of Malolos, Bulacan on 4 September 1967. This Court ruled that Javier’s appointment prevailed over that of Bernardo. It cannot be said that Bernardo accepted his appointment because he never assumed office or took his oath.<br><br>Excluding the act of acceptance from the appointment process leads us to the very evil which we seek to avoid (i.e., antedating of appointments). Excluding the act of acceptance will only provide more occasions to honor the Constitutional provision in the breach. The inclusion of acceptance by the appointee as an integral part of the entire appointment process prevents the abuse of the Presidential power to appoint. It is relatively easy to antedate appointment papers and make it appear that they were issued prior to the appointment ban, but it is more difficult to simulate the entire appointment process up until acceptance by the appointee.<br><br>Petitioners have failed to show compliance with all four elements of a valid appointment. They cannot prove with certainty that their appointment papers were transmitted before the appointment ban took effect. On the other hand, petitioners admit that they took their oaths of office during the appointment ban.<br><br>Petitioners have failed to raise any valid ground for the Court to declare EO 2, or any part of it, unconstitutional. Consequently, EO 2 remains valid and constitutional.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petitions in G.R. Nos. 203372, 206290,&nbsp; and 212030 are <b>DENIED</b>, and the petition in G.R.

Aquino, III.<br><br>Directly at issue, as framed and presented by the petitioners and as counter-argued by the respondents, is the validity of Section 1(a) of EO No. 2 in relation with the constitutional ban on midnight appointments under Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution.<br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i>’s findings that the petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> should be denied and the petition for <i>certiorari</i> should be dismissed as I will discuss below.<br><br>I object, however, to the <i>ponencia</i>’s arguments and conclusions to support the conclusion that the phrase, “<i>including all appointments bearing dates prior to March 11, 2010 where the appointee has <b>accepted</b>, or <b>taken his oath</b>, or <b>assumed public office on or after March 11, 2010</b></i>” in Section 1(a) of E.O. No. 2, is valid. In my view, Executive Order No. 2, by incorporating this phrase, should be <b>declared partially unconstitutional for unduly expanding the scope of the prohibition on presidential appointments under Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution</b>.<br><br>This constitutional provision provides that: “<i>[t]wo months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the end of his term, a President or Acting President shall not make <b>appointments</b>, except temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety</i>.”<br><br>According to the <i>ponencia</i>, the term “appointments” contemplated in Section 15, Article VII pertains to <b>appointment as a process</b> – <i>i.e.</i>, from the signing of the appointment, to its issuance and to the appointee’s acceptance – rather than being <b>confined solely to the President’s exercise of his appointing power or to the acts that are under the President’s control in the totality of the appointment process</b>.<br><br>Under this latter view, only the signing of the appointment and its issuance should be covered by the constitutional ban; when these presidential actions are completed before the ban sets in, then the appointee can take his oath and assume office even after the ban has set in.<br><br>The plain textual language of Section 15, Article VII is clear and requires no interpretation of the term “appointments.” The prohibition under this constitutional provision pertains to <u><b><i>the President’s discretionary executive act</i></b></u> of determining who should occupy a given vacant position; it does not cover other actions in the appointment process, specifically, the discretionary determination of whether or not to accept the position which belongs to the appointee.<br><br>In fact, <b><i><u>Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is directed only against an outgoing President and against no other</u></i></b>. By providing that the President shall not make appointments within the specified period, the Constitution could not have barred the President from doing acts that are not within his power to accomplish as appointing authority, such as the acts required or expected of the appointee. Notably, the appointee’s acts are not even alluded to or mentioned at all in this constitutional provision.<br><br>By interpreting the term “appointments” as a process, the <i>ponencia</i> effectively undertook judicial legislation by expanding the limitation on the President’s appointment power under Section 15, Article VII; it applied the concept of appointment as a process despite the otherwise clear and unambiguous reference of this constitutional provision to appointment as an executive act.<br><br>For these reasons, I maintain my position that for an appointment to be valid under Section 15, Article VII, the appointment papers must have already been <b>signed, issued or released prior to the constitutional ban</b>, addressed to the head of the office concerned or the appointee himself. Once this is accomplished, the appointee’s acceptance through an oath, assumption of office, or any positive act need not be done before the constitutional ban.<br><br>Thus, the phrase in Section 1(a) of E.O. No. 2 that states “<i>including all appointments bearing dates prior to March 11, 2010 where the appointee has accepted, or taken his oath, or assumed public office on or after March 11, 2010</i>” <b>should be held unconstitutional as it unduly expands the scope of the prohibition on presidential appointments under Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution</b>.<br><br>I elaborate on all these arguments in the following discussions.<br><br><center><b><u>THE CASES</u></b><br></center><br>Before the Court are three petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and one petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> that have been consolidated because they raise a common question of law, <i>i.e.</i>, the validity of the President’s issuance of E.O.

No. 2, ruling that the E.O. is consistent with the rationale of Section 15, Article VII of preventing the outgoing President from abusing his appointment prerogative and allowing the incoming President to appoint the people who will execute his policies. To give meaning to this intent, the CA departed from the literal wording of the provision <b>by construing the term “appointment” as a process that includes the appointee’s acceptance of the appointment</b>.<br><br>The CA likewise found no violation of the petitioners’ right to due process since no one has a vested right to public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Although the CA upheld the constitutionality of E.O.

No. 2 that defined the “midnight appointments” contemplated under Article VII, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution; and if so, whether E.O. No. 2’s definition of midnight appointment is constitutional.<br><br>A finding that E.O. No. 2’s definition of midnight appointment is constitutional (thus rendering the petitioners’ appointments invalid) would render any ruling on the petitioners’ security of tenure argument completely unnecessary.

No. 2 and the reversal of the assailed CA rulings; <b><u><i>second</i></u></b>, the declaration of the validity of their respective appointments and their reinstatement to the positions they held prior to the issuance of E.O. No. 2; and, <b><i><u>third</u></i></b> (as prayed for by petitioners Villanueva and Rosquita) if the term of their appointments had already expired, the grant of back wages with interest.<br><br>I vote to only partially grant the petitions as I find that only <b><u>a part of E.O. No. 2</u></b> is <b><u>unconstitutional</u></b>, <i>i.e.</i>, <b>insofar as it unduly expands the scope of midnight appointments under Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution</b>.<br><br>I find the rest of the provisions of E.O. No. 2, particularly, Sections 1 (b) and (c) in relation to Section 2, to be valid; the presumption of constitutionality remains since the petitioners did not squarely question the constitutionality of these provisions before the Court. In fact, even if the issue had been raised, none of the petitioners showed that they have the legal standing to question their validity since the petitioners are admittedly appointees of the previous President and not mere appointees of a local chief executive. The constitutionality of these provisions would have to await its resolution in a proper case.<br><br>Despite the partial invalidity of E.O. No. 2, I also find that the petitioners’ claims for the validity of their appointments are unmeritorious, measured under the terms of Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution and the valid portions of E.O. No. 2. Specifically, while I vote to <b><u>grant part of the first relief</u></b> the petitioners prayed for, <b><u>I vote to deny their second and third requested reliefs</u></b>.<br><br><b><i>A. Preliminary consideration</i></b><br><br>At the outset, I note that petitioners <b><u>Villanueva and Rosquita</u></b> did not appeal the CA’s ruling under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, but instead filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of these Rules. <b>This procedural error warrants an outright dismissal of their petition.</b><br><br>For the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 to lie, an appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy should not be available to the aggrieved party. If appeal is available, <i>certiorari</i> will not prosper even if the cited ground is grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the remedy of appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court was clearly available to petitioners Villanueva and Rosquita since the CA decision was a final order that completely disposed of the proceeding before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The CA, in other words, fully complied with this Court’s January 31, 2012 Resolution to “<i>resolve all</i> pending matters and applications, and to <i>decide the issues</i> as if these [present] cases have been originally commenced [in the CA].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Even if I were to consider the Rosquita/Villanueva petition to be a Rule 45 petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, I would still maintain its denial because it was filed out of time. Under Section 2, Rule 45, the aggrieved party has a period of only fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from within which to appeal.

The scope of the President’s power of executive interpretation is at its <b><u>broadest</u></b> <i>when exercised clearly within its own sphere of power</i> and <b><u>diminishes</u></b> <i>when it involves the power of the other branches of the government</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The degrees of presidential legal interpretation thus fluctuates from the very broad to the very narrow.<br><br>To place my discussion in proper context and in simpler terms, when the President interprets a constitutional provision that grants him full discretionary authority to act on a matter, the Court generally defers to the President’s judgment on how the constitutional provision is to be interpreted and applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> This is true in ordinary legal situations where a government agency in the executive, tasked to implement a particular law, is given the first opportunity to interpret and apply it even before a controversy as regards its implementation reaches the courts.<br><br>In fact, the Executive branch is constantly engaged in legal interpretation in performing its multifarious duties. In instances when the executive interpretation finally reaches the judiciary, the courts may adopt a deferential attitude towards the construction placed on the statute by the executive officials charged with its execution.

On <b>December 29, 1961</b>, outgoing President Carlos Garcia appointed Dominador <i>Aytona</i> as <i>ad interim</i> Governor of the Central Bank. On the same day, <i>Aytona</i> took his oath of office.<br><br>On December 30, 1961, President-elect Diosdado Macapagal assumed office. On the following day, he issued <u><b>Administrative Order (<i>A.O.</i>) No. 2</b> cancelling all <i>ad interim</i> appointments made by President Garcia after December 13, 1961</u>. On January 1, 1962, President Macapagal appointed Andres Castillo as <i>ad interim</i> Governor of the Central Bank. Castillo assumed and qualified for his post immediately.<br><br>Because of A.O. No. 2, <i>Aytona</i> instituted a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding against Castillo before this Court. He questioned the validity of the appointments made by outgoing President Garcia and raised the question of whether A.O. No. 2 was valid.<br><br>Even without the equivalent of the present Section 15, Article VII (of the 1987 Constitution) in the then 1935 Constitution, the Court refused to recognize the validity of <i>Aytona</i>’s appointment. The Court regarded the issuance of 350 appointments in one night and the planned induction of almost all of them a few hours before the inauguration of the new President as an abuse by the outgoing President of his presidential prerogatives.<br><blockquote><b><u>The filling of vacancies in important positions, if few, and so spaced to afford some assurance of deliberate action and careful consideration of the need for the appointment and the appointee's qualifications may undoubtedly be permitted.</u></b> But the issuance of 350 appointments in one night and planned induction of almost all of them a few hours before the inauguration of the new President may, with some reason, be regarded by the latter as an <b><u>abuse of Presidential prerogatives</u></b>, the steps taken being apparently a mere partisan effort to fill all vacant positions irrespective of fitness and other conditions, and thereby deprive the new administration of an opportunity to make the corresponding appointments.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Of course, the Court is aware of many precedents to the effect that once an appointment has been issued, it cannot be reconsidered, especially where the appointee has qualified. <b>But none of them refer to mass <i>ad interim</i> appointments (three-hundred and fifty), <u>issued</u> in the last hours of an outgoing Chief Executive</b>, in a setting similar to that outlined herein.

Needless to say, there are instances wherein not only strict legality, but also fairness, justice and righteousness should be taken into account.<br></blockquote>In effect, the Court upheld the incoming President’s order revoking the <i>en masse</i> appointments made by the outgoing President. The Court accomplished this, not on the basis of any express constitutional or statutory prohibition against those appointments, but because the outgoing President “abused” the presidential power of appointment. The presence of “abuse” was found based on the circumstances attendant to <i>Aytona</i>’s appointment.<br><br>After the <i><i>Aytona</i></i> ruling, cases on “midnight” or “last minute” appointments were ruled to be valid or invalid depending on the attendant circumstances.<br><br>In <i>Rodriguez, Jr. v.

The Court stressed that its action, either upholding or nullifying the appointments made, was “more influenced by the <b><i>doubtful character of the appointments</i></b> themselves and not by the contention that the President had validly recalled them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>The appointments in <i>Merrera, Morales</i> and <i>Tajanglangit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> were not considered “midnight” appointments although the appointees took their oath or assumed office near the end of the outgoing President’s term (or within the period covered by the presidential issuance). In these cases, the Court considered several factors — the need to fill the vacancies, the qualifications of the appointees, and the date of the appointments — in determining whether the appointment was an abuse of the appointing power of the outgoing President and must thus be struck down in deference to the newly elected President.<br><br><b>In sum, before the 1987 Constitution when no <i>express</i> legal prohibition</b> existed against appointments made by an outgoing President and out of respect for the separation of powers principle, the Court considered the validity of alleged “midnight” appointments on a <b><i>case-to-case basis</i></b>.<br><br><b><i>b. The 1987 Constitution and the earlier laws on appointment ban after <i>Aytona</i></i></b><br><br>While the midnight appointments contemplated in <i>Aytona</i> were, by nature, strictly last-minute appointments, or were made after an outgoing President had lost his bid for reelection, statutory law after <i>Aytona</i> expanded the concept of a midnight appointment by extending the period when appointments could not be made within the period prior to the elections.<br><br>Republic Act (<i>RA</i>) No. 6388,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> as a rule, prohibited national and local appointing authorities “from appointing or hiring new employees” “during the period of forty-five days <b><i>before</i></b> a regular election and thirty days before a special election.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The statutory prohibition was reproduced in Section 178 (f) and (g) of Presidential Decree (<i>PD</i>) No. 1296.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Eventually, these prohibitions were substantially carried over into <i>Batas Pambansa Blg</i>. 881.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Thus, even prior to the 1987 Constitution, statutory law had already <i>generally prohibited</i> the appointment or hiring of a new employee <b><u>within specific time frames broader than the midnight appointment period understood in <i>Aytona</i></u></b>.<br><br>This broader statutory law concept of midnight appointments was carried over into the <b><u>1987 Constitution</u></b> where the ban was a special one specifically directed <b><u>only against the outgoing President</u></b>. The prohibition covers appointments without any distinction on whether the appointee is a new hire or not, or whether the appointment would involve a transfer, a detail or other kinds of personnel movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution also provides its own period of effectivity of two months prior to the coming Presidential elections all the way to the end of the outgoing President’s term. While the prohibition contains an exception that is left for the outgoing President’s determination, his power of appointment under the exception is very much curtailed; the permitted appointment is limited only to <i>temporary</i> appointments in the executive branch.<br><br><b>Thus, as worded, Section 15, Article VII (both its rule and exception) is a clear limitation on the appointing power of the outgoing President.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br><b><i>c. The status of Presidential midnight appointments under the 1987 Constitution and the CA’s defective treatment of midnight appointments</i></b><br><br>By providing for a specific provision especially applicable only to the outgoing President (a provision entirely absent in the 1935 Constitution when the <i>Aytona</i> ruling took place and in the 1973 Constitution) under terms uniquely directed at his office, the Constitution apparently sought to limit any judicial fact-finding determination of the validity of the appointment <i>in the manner done in Aytona</i>. <b>Had the intent been otherwise, there would have been no need to provide for a specific period for the operation of the ban; the framers of the Constitution would have left things as they had been.</b><br><br>In other words, by the express terms of Section 15, Article VII, the Constitution fixed the period covered by the appointment ban precisely to avoid the necessity of making further inquiries on whether the appointments were made with “undue haste, hurried maneuvers, [or] for partisan reasons, [or otherwise] not in accordance with good faith” – issues that are largely factual in nature.<br><br><b>The fixed period too inevitably established the presumption that “appointments” made outside this two-month period have been made in the regular discharge of duties and hence should enjoy the presumption of regularity or validity.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> In this sense, the issue of –<br><blockquote>Whether the appointments of the petitioners and intervenors were made with undue haste, hurried maneuvers, for partisan reasons, and not in accordance with good faith,<br></blockquote>in our January 31, 2012 Resolution largely becomes a non-issue. The CA’s failure to resolve these matters is consequently not fatal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>Thus, based on these considerations of presidential power and its limits, <b>I find it completely unnecessary for the CA to qualify its ruling upholding E.O.

On the other hand, if they were issued outside the prohibited period, then they fall outside the ambit of Section 15, Article VII.<br><br>Notably, <b>the CA used wrong considerations and cited inapplicable cases that led it to erroneously qualify its ruling</b>. The CA cited cases involving appointments <b>made <i>after</i> the elections by an outgoing local chief executive</b>, not by the President.<br><br>In particular, in the CA’s cited <i>Nazareno v. City of Dumaguete</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> the Court upheld the Civil Service Commission’s (CSC’s) issuance that generally prohibited outgoing <i>local chief executives</i> from exercising their appointing power unless certain requirements, evidencing regularity of the appointment, are observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> In <i>Sales v. Carreon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> the Court supported the CSC’s nullification of the appointments made by the <i>outgoing local chief executive</i> because it was made in disregard of civil service laws and rules, not because of an express prohibition against appointment <i>per se</i>.<br><br>In reading these cited cases, it should be noted that their reference to the prohibition under Section 15, Article VII was tangential and pertained merely to the provision’s underlying rationale. Thus, while noting that this provision applies only to presidential appointments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> the Court nevertheless cited the prohibition because of the rationale behind it, <i>i.e.</i>, to discourage losing candidates from issuing appointments merely for partisan purposes, as these losers thereby deprive the incoming administration of the opportunity to make their own appointments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>The CSC–issued prohibition applicable to local chief executives is jurisprudentially significant since <b>the Constitution does not expressly prohibit an outgoing local chief executive from exercising its power to appoint or hire new employees <i>after</i> the elections</b> (in the manner that an outgoing President is prohibited under Section 15, Article VII). Thus, the validity of an appointment by a local chief executive in the cited cases was, in effect, determined by applying the CSC’s regulations to the facts surrounding each contested appointment. This is the import of <i>Sales</i> and <i>Nazareno</i>. These cases, of course, are obviously inapplicable to the present case, given the existence of a clear constitutional prohibition applicable to an outgoing President.<br><br>In this light, I also do not see any need to refer anything to the Office of the President with respect to the nature, character, and merits of the petitioners’ appointment. As previously stated, if an “appointment” is made within the prohibited period, it is illegal (as the CA itself found, although for the wrong reason as will be discussed later) for being contrary to the fundamental law. No amount of evaluation by the President can <i>validate</i> this kind of appointment.<br><br><b><i>D. The meaning of appointment under Section 15, Article VII</i></b><br><br><b><i>a. Considerations under Section 15, Article VII</i></b><br><br><b><i>i. The Dichotomy of an Appointment – it is both an executive act and a process</i></b><br><br>Appointments by the President may be construed both in its broad and narrow senses. In its broad sense, an <b>appointment is a process</b> that must comply with the requirements set by law and by jurisprudence in order to be complete. Narrowly speaking, an <b>appointment is an executive act</b> that the President unequivocally exercises pursuant to his discretion.<br><br>This dichotomy arises because of the two participants in the appointing process — the appointing power (which, in this case, is the President), and the appointee. While the concurrence of the actions of these two participants is necessary in order for an appointment to be <b>fully effective</b>, it is also important to note that <b>the appointing power and the appointee act independently of each other</b>. An examination and understanding of this relationship is the key to the proper appreciation and interpretation of the “appointment” that Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution speaks of.<br><br><b><i>i. a. Appointment in its broad sense ? as a process</i></b><br><br>As a process, appointments made by the President<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> undergo three stages: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, the making of the commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> which includes the signing of the appointment papers by the President and its sealing if necessary; <b><i><u>second</u></i></b>, the issuance of the commission and the release of the transmittal letter, if any; and <b><i><u>third</u></i></b>, the appointee’s receipt and acceptance of the appointment, which could either be express or implied.<br><br>In this <b><i>broad sense</i></b>, an appointment is <b><u>a process</u></b> that is <i>initiated by the acts of the President and culminates with the positive acts of the appointee.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>This <b>broad interpretation of an appointment is necessary and appropriate in cases where there is no issue as to the validity of the first two stages of appointment,</b> <i>i.e.</i>, <b>the signing of the appointment papers, and the issuance of the commission</b>. The main question to be resolved in considering an appointment as a process, is whether or not there was a valid assumption of public office, based on the appointee’s valid acceptance of the appointment through an oath or any positive act.<br><br>In <i>Javier v. Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> the Court upheld the appointment of petitioner Isidro Javier as Chief of Police of Malolos on the finding that no question existed on the regularity of his appointment by the then mayor of Malolos. Compared to his fellow claimant over the position, he was the one who accepted the appointment by taking an oath and subsequently discharging the functions of his office. Although this case does not concern a Presidential appointment, it shows <b>that in cases where there was already a valid act of appointment, the only remaining act to be done is for the appointee to exercise his part in the process so that the appointment will be effective</b>.<br><br>Consequently, an acceptance merely results from the valid exercise of the appointing authority of his power to appoint. It is an act of the appointee that lies outside the control of the appointing authority and totally depends on the appointee’s discretion.<br><br><b><i>i. b. Appointment in its narrow sense - as an executive act</i></b><br><br>Appointment, as an executive act, is an <b><u><i>exercise of power</i> or authority</u></b>. It is the <i>unequivocal</i> act of designating or selecting an individual to discharge and perform the duties and functions of an office or trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> The appointment is deemed complete once the <i>last act</i> required of the appointing authority has been complied with and acceptance is thereafter made by the appointee in order to render it <b>fully effective</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>In this <b><i>narrow sense</i></b>, <i>appointment is simply an executive act;</i> <b><i>that the full effectiveness of an appointment requires a positive act from the appointee is not a denial of the existence of the power and the full exercise of the act by the executive himself</i></b>.<br><br>Appointment as an executive act, as opposed to a process, is well-established under our laws and jurisprudence. This is referred to as the President’s appointing power. Specifically, this executive power is embodied in the Constitution under Article VII, Sections 14, 15, and 16 and is vested on the President as provided under Section 1, Article VII.<br><br>A plain reading of the Constitution alone shows that the term “<i>appointment</i>” may pertain to the President’s act of appointment as the President, <b>on his own</b>, has the power to appoint officials as authorized under the Constitution and the pertinent laws. <b>This presidential appointment power should be distinguished from the appointment process that requires the act of the appointee for its efficacy.</b> If these two concepts would be confused with one another, the result could be havoc and absurdities in our jurisprudence every time we resolve a case before us.<br><br>The President’s power of appointment is <i>sui generis</i>. It is intrinsically an executive act because the filling of an office created by law is an implementation of that law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> The power to appoint is the exclusive prerogative of the President involving the exercise of his discretion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> the wide latitude given to the President to appoint is further demonstrated by the constitutional recognition that the President is granted the power to appoint even those officials <b><i>whose appointments are not provided for by law</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>In other words, where there are offices that have to be filled, but the law does not provide the process for filling them, the Constitution recognizes the power of the President to fill the office by appointment. <b>Any limitation on or qualification to the exercise of the President’s appointment power should be <u>strictly construed and must be clearly stated</u> in order to be recognized.</b><br><br>In <i>Osea v. Malaya</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and in other several cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> the Court held that an appointment <b>may be defined</b> as the selection, by the authority vested with the power, of an individual who is to exercise the functions of a given office. The constitutionally mandated power of the President’s appointing power was statutorily recognized under Section 16, Chapter V, Book III, Title I of the Administrative Code. Book III of the Code pertains to the Office of the President, and Title I relates to the “<b>Powers of the President</b>.” Chapter V, on the other hand, focuses on the President’s “<b><i>Power of Appointment</i></b>” and its Section 16 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 16.</b> <i>Power of Appointment</i>. - The President shall exercise the power to appoint such officials as provided for in the Constitution and laws.<br></blockquote>Under these terms and structure, the term “appointment” apparently does not automatically equate to a process and pertain to the President’s act or exercise of his power of appointment. Thus, when interpreting the word “appointment” in cases before the Court, we must consider which of the two should be applied considering the factual and legal settings of each case.<br><br>In the present case, I submit that what is applicable is not the concept of “appointment as a process” but the executive act or the President’s power of appointment. The interpretation of “appointment” in Section 15, Article VII as an <i>executive act</i> rather than as a process finds support in the language of the provision itself. Section 15, Article VII reads:<br><blockquote>Section 15. Two months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the end of his term, a <b>President or Acting President shall not make appointments</b>, except temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety. (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This express wording leads us away from an interpretation of the provision as a process that would involve the appointee and his or her acts within the scope of the appointment ban. For one, Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is directed only against an outgoing President and against no other. By providing that the President shall not <i>make appointments</i> within the specified period, the Constitution could not have barred the President from doing things that are not within his power to accomplish as appointing authority, such as the acts required or expected of the appointee.<br><br><b>Note that the appointee who is at the receiving end of the appointment – if indeed the term “appointment” is meant as a process - is not even mentioned or even alluded to in Section 15, Article VII.</b> Had the original intent of the framers been to include him, they would have simply “<b>prohibited an appointee from accepting a Presidential appointment commencing two months before the next Presidential Election,</b>” which already presupposes a previous valid appointment by the President.<br><br>From this perspective, the objective of the provision is to <b>limit the President’s appointing power alone</b>, by prohibiting him <i>from making appointments</i> within a certain period; the intent is not to curtail the entire appointment process. <b>As a limitation solely applicable <i>to the President’s power of appointment</i></b>, appointment under this provision largely assumes the character of an <b><i>executive act</i></b> that does not concern the appointee at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>In their interpretation, the respondents insist that the acceptance and assumption of office by the appointee must also be accomplished before the ban sets in. They reason out that these acts are necessary for the completion and effectivity of an appointment; otherwise, “it would be useless to prohibit an incomplete and ineffective appointment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Notably, the <i>ponencia</i> supports this interpretation.<br><br>With due respect, I believe that the <i>ponencia</i>’s and the respondents’ interpretation merely highlights the word “appointment” in Section 15 but ignores the totality of the provision and the language it is couched in. There is simply nothing in the language of Section 15, Article VII that supports the respondents’ plea for the Court to view “appointment” as a process. As will be discussed in detail below, even the supposed “uselessness” of prohibiting an “ineffective appointment” has no legal basis.<br><br>I especially note in examining and construing Section 15, Article VII that what the petitioners in the present case challenge is the very authority of an outgoing President to exercise his appointing power based on a specific constitutional provision that makes the date of the <i>making of appointment</i> the focal point of the prohibition. These unique factual and legal aspects of the case suffice to reject the respondents’ reliance on cases whose factual and legal settings are completely at odds with the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>For the same reason, the petitioners, too, cannot simply rely on <i>In Re: Seniority Among the Four (4) Most Recent Appointments to the Position of Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> in interpreting Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>In that cited case, the Court was tasked to resolve the correct basis in determining the seniority in the Court of Appeals of the newly appointed justices: whether it should be based on (i) the date the commission was signed by the President, <i>i.e.</i>, the date appearing on the face of the document or (ii) the order of appointments as contained in the transmittal letter to the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> In applying the first option, the Court simply applied the clear letter of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> that seniority should be based on “the dates of their respective appointments.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> In closing, the Court said:<br><blockquote>For purposes of completion of the appointment process, the appointment is complete when the commission is signed by the executive, and sealed if necessary, and is ready to be delivered or transmitted to the appointee. Thus, transmittal of the commission is an act which is done after the appointment has already been completed. It is not required to complete the appointment but only to facilitate the effectivity of the appointment by the appointee’s receipt and acceptance thereof.<br><br><b><i>For purposes of appointments to the judiciary</i></b>, therefore, the date the commission has been signed by the President (which is the date appearing on the face of such document) is the date of the appointment. Such date will determine the seniority of the members of the Court of Appeals in connection with Section 3, Chapter I of BP 129, as amended by RA 8246. [Italics and emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>The issue before us, however, is not as simple as the issue of seniority of the justices of the CA – a matter that is largely internal to its members. Far more important than this, the issue before us directly relates to <b>the constitutional limitation on the President’s exercise of his appointing power</b>. The applicable law in <i>In Re: Seniority</i> is clearly worded on the proper basis of seniority in the CA, <i>i.e.</i>, the date of appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> This is significantly very much unlike the Constitution’s language that commands the President not to “make appointments.”<br><br>Thus, the question should be: when do we consider the President to have already made an appointment or exercised his appointing power under Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. Otherwise phrased, we ask: what stage in the <i>appointment process</i> must have been completed before the ban takes effect in order that an appointment may not be considered under the broad category of “midnight appointment” under Section 15, Article VII.<br><br><b><i>ii. Purpose of Section 15, Article VII; in relation with Section 4, Article VII</i></b><br><br>A factor I cannot disregard in our interpretative exercise is the presence of <b><i>pragmatic considerations</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> <i>underlying Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution that uniquely warrant a deeper and more critical understanding of the whole provision</i> - instead of only a word therein - and of the purpose behind it.<br><br>These considerations militate not only against a literal interpretation of the phrase “shall not make appointments,” as the CA appear to have shortsightedly ruled, but also <b>against an unduly expansive interpretation of the word “appointments” based on jurisprudential definitions that were decided under completely different sets of facts and law</b>.<br><br>Again, this latter broad-sense definition of appointment – in its largely administrative law concept – cannot be controlling in our interpretation of Section 15, Article VII. <b>For emphasis, Section 15, Article VII is unique in the factual situation it contemplates and in restricting the President’s otherwise broad appointing power.</b><br><br>Under E.O.

This pronouncement should not be lost to us in the present case because an outgoing President is ineligible for reelection under the 1987 Constitution. Under this situation, the objective of any prohibition against appointment, as in <i>Aytona</i>, is aimed at preventing the incumbent from adversely affecting his successor through partisan action. During an incumbent’s last days in office, his sole mandate should be to ensure the orderly transfer of government administration to the next President.<br><br>Thus, aside from the limitations on the president’s appointing power under Section 15,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> we need to add the constitutional disfavor that appointments made by the outgoing President carry when the elections are drawing near (and more so after the electorate has spoken), as this can be presumed to be for partisan considerations, or in furtherance or maintenance of political interest or influence, or as reward for partisan loyalties, or even for the purpose of shackling the hands of the new administration.<br><br>In elevating the <i>Aytona</i> ruling and its resulting prohibition against midnight appointments to the level of a constitutional provision, the thrust of Section 15, Article VII must be <b><i>the <u>broadening</u> of the <u>general rule against</u> the exercise of the midnight appointing power and the narrowing of the exception in its favor</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> A constitutional provision specifically directed only against an outgoing President’s exercise of his appointing power is also an express recognition of the unique and vast powers and responsibilities inherent in the Office of the President<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> that an outgoing President should most judiciously consider. Again, I quote <i>Aytona</i>:<br><blockquote>Of course, nobody will assert that President Garcia ceased to be such earlier than at noon of December 30, 1961. But it is common sense to believe that after the proclamation of the election of President Macapagal, his was no more than a “caretaker” administration. He was duty bound to prepare for the orderly transfer of authority the incoming President, and he should not do acts which he ought to know, would embarrass or obstruct the policies of his successor. The time for debate had passed; the electorate had spoken. It was not for him to use powers as incumbent President to continue the political warfare that had ended or to avail himself of presidential prerogatives to serve partisan purposes.<br></blockquote>To be sure, the broad discretion given the appointing power may be limited by the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> and by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Nonetheless, any limitation of the exercise of this broad power is generally strictly construed. Correspondingly, any undue expansion of a <b>textually evident limitation</b> under Section 15, Article VI, would<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> amount to judicial legislation.<br><br><b><i>iii. Nature of the power of appointment</i></b><br><br>Appointment is intrinsically an executive act; it is a <i>discretionary</i> power that must be exercised by the Chief Executive according to his best lights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> It involves a question of policy that only the appointing authority can decide. At the presidential level, his or her choice of an appointee involves a very highly political and administrative act of decision making that calls for considerations of wisdom, convenience, utility, and national interests; it is a power that the Constitution or the law has vested in him in his various roles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>From the prism of Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, I find it clear that the framers of the Constitution presumed the appointments made before the fixed two-month period preceding the elections to be generally characterized by good faith on the President’s part. The good faith (or lack of it) of the President and his appointee, are matters that do not fall under the specific concern of Section 15, Article VII.<br><br><b><i>b. Combined reading of these considerations</i></b><br><br>In sum, I find the following basic considerations to be relevant in the resolution of the issues before us: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, the definition of appointment in jurisprudence as an executive act (characterizing it as an “<u>unequivocal</u> act” of the appointing power and considering it “complete xxx once the <u>last act</u> required of the appointing authority has been complied with”), as opposed to the broad view of the term as a process that involves acts of the appointee; <b><i><u>second</u></i></b>, the purpose of Section 15, in relation to Section 4 of Article VII of the Constitution, in the light of the <i>Aytona</i> ruling and; <b><i><u>third</u></i></b>, the nature of the power of appointment and the considerations that underlie it.<br><br>Based on these considerations, I conclude that <b><u>for an appointment to be valid under Section 15, Article VII, the appointment papers must have already been signed, issued or released prior to the constitutional ban, addressed to the head of the office concerned or the appointee himself</u></b>. The appointee’s acceptance through an oath, assumption of office or any positive act does not find any reference in Section 15, Article VII as this part of the appointment process is already outside the President’s power of control and is wholly within the appointee’s discretion. <b>The Constitution could not have envisioned a prohibition on the President that is already beyond the sphere of his executive powers.</b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> disagrees with this view and asserts that an appointment will only be valid if all the elements for the completion of its total process are present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> It further avers that my argument (that acceptance even after the ban will not affect the appointment’s validity as long as the designation and transmittal of the appointment papers were made before the ban sets in), will lead to glaring absurdities, <i>i.e.</i>, that in case of the appointee’s non-acceptance, the position will be considered occupied and nobody else may be appointed to it; that an incumbent public official, appointed to another public office by the President, will automatically be deemed to occupy the new public office and to have resigned from his first office; and that, if the President is unhappy with an incumbent public official, the President can simply appoint him to another public office, thus remove him from his current post without due process.<br><br>I disagree with these contentions.<br><br>The act of issuing or releasing the appointment paper (together with the transmittal letter, if any) is the only reliable<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> and unequivocal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> act that must be completed to show the intent of the appointing power to select the appointee. In other words, the President cannot be considered to have performed the “last act” required of him to complete the exercise of his power of appointment if the signing of the appointment is not coupled with its issuance.<br><br>Along the same line of thought, because the appointing authority considers both the formal and informal qualifications of the prospective appointee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> in exercising the power of appointment, the issuance of the appointment is the act that signifies the certainty of his choice. Prior to the issuance of an appointment, the President can choose to issue an appointment to another, or decide not to issue any appointment at all.<br><br>After the issuance and <i>before the appointment is accepted by the appointee</i>, the <b>appointment process</b> still lies within the President’s control although the appointment can already be accepted by the appointee. <b>The President <i>finally</i> loses control over the appointment process when the appointee accepts it.</b> Prior to its acceptance, the President can still recall the appointment he issued and exercise his appointing power anew or completely desist from exercising it.<br><br>The appointment ban, however, limits the President’s control over the appointment process. When the appointment ban sets in, the President can no longer exercise his appointment power, although the President may recall a previously unaccepted appointment, or revoke an unaccepted one. The President may likewise exercise his appointing power under the exception in Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>These conclusions draw strength from the reality that these acts are the only options that are left to the <b>sole President’s discretion and full control</b>, and that are inherent and consistent with the President’s prerogative as the appointing power.<br><br>The full extent of the presidential control over the appointment prior to its acceptance, however, does not and should not materially alter the fact of the issuance as the reckoning point under Section 15, Article VII. Any period prior to the appointee’s acceptance is simply a period when the act of appointment, including its issuance, can be said to be complete although the appointment is not yet effective.<br><br>These conclusions are consistent with both the tenor and nature of Section 15, Article VII as a limitation against the President’s exercise of his power to appoint. <b>Since the acts pertaining to the appointee himself are beyond the President’s control, these same acts should not be covered by a provision that only essentially limits the executive power of appointment.</b> This too, is consistent, with the constitutional objective of preventing the outgoing president from tying the hands of the incoming president through a belated <i>exercise</i> of the appointing power.<br><br>Moreover, these conclusions will not lead to the glaring absurdities that the <i>ponencia</i> illustrates. Contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>’s arguments, we do not totally do away with or disregard the fact that <b>an appointment is also a process</b>. The Court should only make a clear and careful delineation that, for purposes of the prohibition against the President’s midnight appointments under Section 15, Article VII, the interpretation should be limited to the notion of an appointment as an executive act or the President’s exercise of his appointing power. The prohibition could not have included acts (such as the appointee’s acceptance) that are outside the President’s scope of executive powers.<br><br>In other words, what is applicable in the present case is the term “appointment” in the context of the President’s appointing power, a concept which, as discussed above, is constitutionally, statutorily, and jurisprudentially acknowledged in our jurisdiction vis-à-vis appointment as a process. The focus in the present case is the limitation on the President’s appointing power, an executive act, where the acts of third persons, such as the appointee, is not material in the resolution of the case.<br><br>Thus, an acceptance is still necessary in order for the appointee to validly assume his post and discharge the functions of his new office, and thus make the appointment effective. There can never be an instance where the appointment of an incumbent will automatically result in his resignation from his present post and his subsequent assumption of his new position; or where the President can simply remove an incumbent from his current office by appointing him to another one. I stress that acceptance through oath or any positive act is still indispensable before any assumption of office may occur.<br><br>Moreover, contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>’s assertion, the appointee’s non-acceptance cannot in any way translate to a situation where the position will be considered occupied and nobody else may be appointed to it. As already discussed, before the appointee’s acceptance of his appointment, the power of appointment still subsists and is within the President’s control. Hence, the appointee’s non-acceptance cannot hold the President hostage and prevent him from exercising his power to appoint someone else who is also eligible and qualified for the position.<br><br>In addition, such cumbersome interpretation would undermine the broad appointing power of the President and place it at the mercy of bureaucratic processes. It would practically reduce the President and the OES to a virtual housekeeper several months before the appointment ban, to monitor the acceptance of appointments and prevent any prejudice to public service.<br><br><b><i>i. Section 15 cannot be limited to the mechanical act of “making” the appointment</i></b><br><br>We cannot also distinguish, as the petitioners did,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> between the mechanical acts of making an appointment paper, on one hand, and its issuance or release, on the other hand, without ignoring the basic principle of a single Executive. The issuance of an appointment paper and the release of the transmittal letter, if any, necessarily form part of the exercise of the appointing power. Without the issuance that subsequently follows the signing of the appointment papers, it cannot seriously be asserted that the President had indeed completely exercised his appointing authority. This conclusion remains valid even if the act of issuance is not personally accomplished by the President since the President, by necessity, must act through agents and cannot likewise be allowed to circumvent the prohibition against him by allowing officials under his control to do what he himself cannot do directly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>Even Rule IV of the 1998 Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Personnel Actions, which petitioners Venturanza, Villanueva and Rosquita ironically cited, provides that “an appointment <b>issued in accordance with pertinent laws</b> and rules shall take effect immediately, <b>upon its issuance</b> by the appointing authority.” The term “laws” mentioned in the Rule necessarily includes the Constitution as the fundamental law. Thus, immediately after issuance, the appointee can already manifest his acceptance by qualifying for the position and assuming office; before them, it is the President who has the full and complete control, and loses this control only upon the appointee’s acceptance.<br><br><b><i>i. a. The role of the MRO</i></b><br><br>In accomplishing this second stage of the appointment process, the appointment paper and transmittal letter, if any, may be coursed through the MRO. Prudence suggests this course of action not only for the appointee’s convenience but for record-keeping purposes. The undisputed testimony of Director Dimaandal of the MRO on this score is as follows:<br><blockquote>Q: What is the effect if a document is released by an office or department within Malacañan without going through the MRO?<br><br>A: If a document does not pass through the MRO contrary to established procedure, <b>the MRO cannot issue a certified true copy of the same</b> because as far as the MRO is concerned, it does not exist in our official records, hence, not an official document from the Malacañan. There <b>is no way of verifying the document’s existence and authenticity</b> unless the document is on file with the MRO even if the person who claims to have in his possession a genuine document furnished to him personally by the President. As a matter of fact, it is only the MRO which is authorized to issue certified true copies of documents emanating from Malacañan being the official custodian and central repository of said documents. Not even the OES can issue a certified true copy of documents prepared by them (boldfacing supplied).<br><br>Q: Why do you say that?<br><br>A: Because the MRO is the so-called “gate-keeper” of the Malacañan Palace. All incoming and outgoing documents and correspondence must pass through the MRO. As the official custodian, the MRO is in charge of the official release of documents.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Q: Assuming the MRO has already received the original appointment paper signed by the President together with the transmittal letter prepared by the OES, you said that the MRO is bound to transmit these documents immediately, that is, on the same day?<br><br>A: Yes.<br></blockquote>However, contrary to the respondents’ claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> <b>failure to course an appointment through the MRO for official release is not fatal</b>.

The CA upheld the extension of the scope of the prohibition to the acts of the appointee on the reasoning that these acts “give effect or allow the furtherance of the President’s prohibited act of making appointments within the same prohibited period.” The CA ruling obviously failed to consider the situation where the making and issuance of the appointments were made <i>outside</i> of the prohibited period.<br><br>To be sure, limiting the term “appointment” to the mechanical act of <i>making</i> the appointment, <i>i.e.</i>, the date appearing on the appointment paper, will severely encroach on the constitutional prerogatives of the incoming president. An appointment whose validity stands solely on the date appearing on the appointment paper will practically leave the operation of the appointment ban at the sole determination of the outgoing President since he can simply antedate the appointment to avoid the prohibition. This situation would bring us back to the days of <i>Aytona</i> when the validity of the appointment would have no reference to specific time frames but would be resolved on a case-to-case basis, rendering practically useless the elevation and modification of the <i>Aytona</i> ruling into a constitutional provision.<br><br>With the date of actual issuance or release as the reckoning point under the Constitution, however, the feared “encroachment” on the prerogative of the incoming President loses ground: if the appointee rejects the appointment at a time when the ban has already set in, then the President’s exercise of his appointing power simply failed to produce the desired outcome. If the appointee accepts the appointment (which was actually issued before the ban) during the ban, then the acceptance simply renders the <i>timely exercise</i> of the power of appointment <b><i>efficacious</i></b>. The fact remains that before or after the ban sets in, the President remains to be the Chief Executive until his successor legally assumes the Presidency; and before the ban sets in, the Constitution allows him to exercise his power of appointment, subject only to constitutional limitations. <b>Regardless of the appointee’s action, the prohibition is maintained since the third stage in the appointment process is no longer within the outgoing President’s control.

This is an obvious fact that the framers of the Constitution could not have ignored in crafting Section 15, Article VII.<br><br>Consequently, assumption of office or taking of oath of office may take some time after their appointment papers have been issued.

His letter of appointment was only released to him on March 25, 2010, already 14 days beyond the March 11, 2010 reckoning period. Also, <i><u>it was only on May 6, 2010 that the MRO actually received his appointment papers</u></i>.<br><br>I am not unaware that the interpretation above of Section 15, Article VII does not totally foreclose any circumvention of the prohibition against midnight appointment since the President can still “fix” the date of the issuance of the appointment paper. That may be a possibility – a possibility with legal repercussions that the Court is wholly unprepared to indulge in for the moment, for it involves a presumption on factual issues that were never raised nor are even evident in the circumstances of the present case. Nonetheless, the possibility of abuse of power does not argue against its existence nor destroy, diminish, or remove the power; much less does this authorize the Court to depart from its constitutional role of interpreting a textually evident Constitutional provision according to its letter and the spirit that animates it.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I vote that the Court RESOLVES to:<br><ol><li><b>DISMISS</b> the <b><i>petition for certiorari</i></b> in G.R.

There is only one Chief Executive who directs and controls the entire executive branch all other executive officials must implement in good faith his directives and orders. This is necessary to provide order, efficiency and coherence in carrying out the plans, policies and programs of the executive branch.<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Bermudez v.

This implication obviously finds no support both in the language and intent of Section 15, Article VII.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> However, while the appointee’s acts may be made even after the appointment ban, the constitution presupposes that the appointment made will take effect or the office involved will be vacant prior to the effectivity of the constitutional ban. This is clearly deduced from E.O. No. 2 itself. E.O. No. 2 Section 1b reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Midnight Appointments Defined. – The following appointments shall be considered as midnight appointments:<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>(b) Those made prior to March 11, 2010, but to take effect after said date or appointments to office that would be vacant only after March 11, 2010.<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> This is where the advisability of coursing the appointment through the MRO comes in.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> In this regard, we cannot totally discount Director Dimaandal’s testimony that the presidential appointments made in March 2010 alone reached more than 800 and that out of this number, only 133 were appointment papers were released through the MRO (<i>Rollo</i>, pp. 468-470, G.R.
