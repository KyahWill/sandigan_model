				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Unlike an appeal, a pending petition for certiorari shall not stay the judgment or order that it assails. Unless a restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction is issued, the assailed decision lapses into finality. Thereafter, it can no longer be disturbed, altered, or modified, and execution may ensue.<br><br>This Petition for Review on Certiorari, filed under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, prays that the assailed March 5, 2010 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and July 8, 2010 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

In the Motion, De Ocampo sought the increase of the monetary award given her.

Any contrary posturing renders justice inutile and reduces to futility the winning party's capacity to benefit from a resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>This rule, however, does admit of exceptions. As this court explained in <i>Sacdalan v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote>The only exceptions to the general rule are the correction of clerical errors, the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, void judgments, and whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Consistent with the principle of finality of judgments, it follows that no appeal may be taken from orders of execution of judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center>II<br></center><br>As basic as the principle of finality of judgments is the rule that filing a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure "shall not interrupt the course of the principal case unless a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction has been issued against the public respondent from further proceeding in the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Unlike an appeal, a pending petition for certiorari shall not stay the judgment or order that it assails.<br><br>The 2005 Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission, which were in effect when the material incidents of this case occurred, explicitly and specifically makes this principle applicable to decisions of labor arbiters and of the National Labor Relations Commission. Rule XI, Section 10 of the 2005 Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 10. <i>Effect of Petition for Certiorari on Execution</i>. — A petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court shall not stay the execution of the assailed decision unless a restraining order is issued by said courts.<br></blockquote>In contrast, Rule XI, Section 9 states the following with respect to appeals:<br><blockquote>SECTION 9. <i>Effect of Perfection of Appeal on Execution</i>. — The perfection of an appeal shall stay the execution of the decision of the Labor Arbiter on appeal, except execution for reinstatement pending appeal.<br></blockquote>Accordingly, where no restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction is issued, the assailed decision lapses into finality. Thereafter, execution may ensue. As Rule XI, Section 1 of the 2005 Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Execution Upon Finality of Decision or Order</i>. — a) A writ of execution may be issued <i>motu proprio</i> or on motion, upon a decision or order that finally disposes of the action or proceedings after the parties and their counsels or authorized representatives are furnished with copies of the decision or order in accordance with these Rules, but only after the expiration of the period to appeal if no appeal has been filed, as shown by the certificate of finality. If an appeal has been filed, a writ of execution may be issued when there is an entry of judgment as provided for in Section 14 of Rule VII.<br><br>b) No motion for execution shall be entertained nor a writ of execution be issued unless the Labor Arbiter or the Commission is in possession of the records of the case which shall include an entry of judgment if the case was appealed; except that, as provided for in Section 14 of Rule V and Section 6 of this Rule, and in those cases where partial execution is allowed by law, the Labor Arbiter shall retain duplicate original copies of the decision to be implemented and proof of service thereof for the purpose of immediate enforcement.<br></blockquote>The pivotal facts of this case are also settled. After the filing before the Court of Appeals of RPN-9's Petition for Certiorari, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order preventing, for a period of 60 days, the National Labor Relations Commission from enforcing its ruling. However, the sixty-day period lapsed without a writ of preliminary injunction being subsequently issued by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, on May 27, 2006, the ruling of Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala, as affirmed by the National Labor Relations Commission, became final and executory on May 27, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Conformably, Entry of Judgment was made on July 19, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>None of the four exceptions mentioned in <i>Sacdalan v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that warrant a modification of judgments that have attained finality is availing in this case.<br><br>What petitioner seeks is not a mere clerical correction. Rather, she seeks an overhaul of Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision in order that it may award her a total additional sum of P571,888.83 representing backwages, separation pay, 13th month pay, and accrued interest. Petitioner does not merely seek an entry into the records of acts done but not entered (i.e., <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries). Petitioner does not claim that Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision is void, only that its computation of monetary awards is inadequate. Neither does petitioner allege that certain events transpired after May 27, 2006 rendering Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision unjust or inequitable.<br><br>The Decision having attained finality, and as this case does not fall under any of the recognized exceptional circumstances, there remains no opening for revisiting, amending, or modifying Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's judgment.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>Not only is Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision binding and conclusive as a matter of procedural law; it is as binding and conclusive on petitioner because of both her inaction and her own actions. She is estopped from seeking a modification of Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision.<br><br>Following the rendition of Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision on May 12, 2004, petitioner did not file a motion for reconsideration, pursue an appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission, file a petition for certiorari before any court, or otherwise assail the whole or any part of the Decision. This judgment, as well as its execution, was stayed not by petitioner's actions but by those of respondent RPN-9. RPN-9 filed an appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission and, following the denial of this appeal, filed a Rule 65 Petition before the Court of Appeals, where it sought preliminary injunctive relief.<br><br>By her inaction, petitioner made it appear that as far as she was concerned, Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision should have stood as it did. Her inaction revealed that she saw no reason for the same Decision to be revisited or reconsidered by Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala himself, by the National Labor Relations Commission, or by any court. She failed to act in a timely manner—that is, by pursuing the appropriate remedy within the duration permitted by the rules. She failed "to assert a right within a reasonable time, [and this] warrant[ed] a presumption that the party entitled to assert it [i.e., petitioner] either has abandoned it or declined to assert it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Stated otherwise, to petitioner may be imputed estoppel by laches.<br><br>Moreover, as soon as Entry of Judgment was made, petitioner filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> After the Writ of Execution was satisfied and the check representing payment of the monetary award was deposited with the Cashier's Office of the National Labor Relations Commission, petitioner lost no time in seeking to have the monetary award in her hands: just a day after deposit was made, petitioner was quick to file a Motion to Release the amount of P410,826.85.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, petitioner's willful acceptance of the judgment rendered by Executive Labor Manansala is not only something that may be implied from her omission or inaction. Rather, it is something explicitly affirmed by her own motions and submissions. Whatever doubt there was, if any, as to her concession to the monetary award given her was dispelled by the positive assertions and pleas for relief that petitioner herself made.<br><br>No recourse, whether in law or equity, leaves room for petitioner to avail herself of the modifications she seeks. The most basic legal principles dictate that Executive Labor Arbiter Manansala's Decision—in all its aspects—has long attained finality and may no longer be revisited. Principles of equity require that petitioner be bound by her own omissions and declarations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED</b>.
