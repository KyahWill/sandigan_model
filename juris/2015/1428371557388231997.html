				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In a potential sale transaction, the prior payment of earnest money even before the property owner can agree to sell his property is irregular, and cannot be used to bind the owner to the obligations of a seller under an otherwise perfected contract of sale; to cite a well-worn cliché, the carriage cannot be placed before the horse.&nbsp; The property owner-prospective seller may not be legally obliged to enter into a sale with a prospective buyer through the latter’s employment of questionable practices which prevent the owner from freely giving his consent to the transaction; this constitutes a palpable transgression of the prospective seller’s rights of ownership over his property, an anomaly which the Court will certainly not condone.<br><br>This Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeks to set aside: 1) the September 30, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

CV No. 93715, the appeal made out a case that no earnest money can be considered to have been paid to petitioner as the supposed payment was received by a mere receiving clerk, who was not authorized to accept the same; that the required board of directors resolution authorizing the sale of corporate assets cannot be dispensed with in the case of petitioner; that whatever negotiations were held between the parties only concerned the possible sale, not the sale itself, of the subject property; that without the written authority of petitioner’s board of directors, Young cannot enter into a sale of its corporate property; and finally, that there was no meeting of the minds between the parties in the first place.<br><br>On September 30, 2011, the CA issued the assailed Decision affirming the trial court’s February 16, 2009 Decision, pronouncing thus:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1318 of the Civil Code declares that no contract exists unless the following requisites concur: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation established.<br><br>A careful perusal of the records of the case show[s] that there was indeed a negotiation between the parties as regards the sale of the subject property, their disagreement lies on whether they have arrived on an agreement regarding said sale.&nbsp; Plaintiff-appellee avers that the parties have already agreed on the sale and the price for it and the payment of earnest money and the remaining balance upon clearing of the property of unwanted tenants.&nbsp; Defendant-appellant on the other hand disputes the same and insists that there was no concrete agreement between the parties.<br><br>Upon a careful consideration of the arguments of the parties and the records of the case, we are more inclined to sustain the arguments of the plaintiff-appellee and affirm the findings of the trial court that there was indeed a perfected contract of sale between the parties. The following instances militate against the claim of the defendant-appellant: First. The letter of the plaintiff-appellee dated February 4, 2005 reiterating their agreement as to the sale of the realty for the consideration of Php 1,536,000.00 was not disputed nor replied to by the defendant-appellant, the said letter also provides for the payment of the earnest money of Php 100,000.00 and the full payment upon the clearing of the property of unwanted tenants, if the defendant-appellant did not really agree on the sale of the property it could have easily replied to the said letter informing the plaintiff-appellee that it is not selling the property or that the matter will be decided first by the board of directors, defendant-appellant’s silence or inaction on said letter shows its conformity or consent thereto; Second.&nbsp; In addition to the aforementioned letter, defendant-appellant’s acceptance of the earnest money and the issuance of a provisional receipt clearly shows that there was indeed an agreement between the parties and we do not subscribe to the argument of the defendant-appellant that the check was merely forced upon its employee and the contents of the receipt was just dictated by the plaintiff-appellee’s employee because common sense dictates that a person would not issue a receipt for a check with a huge amount if she does not know what that is for and similarly would not issue [a] receipt which would bind her employer if she does not have prior instructions to do [so] from her superiors;&nbsp; Third. The said check for earnest money was deposited in the bank by defendant-appellant and not until after one year did it offer to return the same.&nbsp; Defendant-appellant cannot claim lack of knowledge of the payment of the check since there was a letter for it, and it is just incredible that a big amount of money was deposited in [its] account [without knowing] about it [or] investigat[ing] what [it was] for.&nbsp; We are more inclined to believe that their inaction for more than one year on the earnest money paid was due to the fact that after the payment of earnest money the place should be cleared of unwanted tenants before the full amount of the purchase price will be paid as agreed upon as shown in the letter sent by the plaintiff-appellee.<br><br>As stated above the presence of defendant-appellant’s consent and, corollarily, the existence of a perfected contract between the parties are evidenced by the payment and receipt of Php 100,000.00 as earnest money by the contracting parties’ x x x.&nbsp; Under the law on sales, specifically Article 1482 of the Civil Code, it provides that whenever earnest money is given in a contract of sale, it shall be considered as part of the price and proof of the perfection of the contract.&nbsp; Although the presumption is not conclusive, as the parties may treat the earnest money differently, there is nothing alleged in the present case that would give rise to a contrary presumption.<br><br>We also do not find merit in the contention of the defendant-appellant that there is a need for a board resolution for them to sell the subject property since it is a corporation, a juridical entity which acts only thru the board of directors.&nbsp; While we agree that said rule is correct, we must also point out that said rule is the general rule for all corporations [but] a corporation [whose main business is buying and selling real estate] like herein defendant-appellant, is not required to have a board resolution for the sale of the realty in the ordinary course of business, thus defendant-appellant’s claim deserves scant consideration.<br><br>Furthermore, the High Court has held that “a corporate officer or agent may represent and bind the corporation in transactions with third persons to the extent that the authority to do so has been conferred upon him, and this includes powers which have been intentionally conferred, and also such powers as, in the usual course of the particular business, are incidental to, or may be implied from, the powers intentionally conferred, powers added by custom and usage, as usually pertaining to the particular officer or agent, and such apparent powers as the corporation has caused persons dealing with the officer or agent to believe that it was conferred.”<br><br>In the case at bench, it is not disputed and in fact was admitted by the defendant-appellant that Ms. Young, the Executive Vice-President was authorized to negotiate for the possible sale of the subject parcel of land.&nbsp; Therefore, Ms. Young can represent and bind defendant-appellant in the transaction.<br><br>Moreover, plaintiff-appellee can assume that Ms. Young, by virtue of her position, was authorized to sell the property of the corporation.&nbsp; Selling of realty is not foreign to [an] executive vice[-]president’s function, and the real estate sale was shown to be a normal business activity of defendant-appellant since its primary business is the buy and sell of real estate.&nbsp; Unmistakably, its Executive Vice-President is cloaked with actual or apparent authority to buy or sell real property, an activity which falls within the scope of her general authority.<br><br>Furthermore, assuming arguendo that a board resolution was indeed needed for the sale of the subject property, the defendant-appellant is estopped from raising it now since, [it] did not inform the plaintiff-appellee of the same, and the latter deal (sic) with them in good faith.&nbsp; Also it must be stressed that the plaintiff-appellee negotiated with one of the top officer (sic) of the company thus, any requirement on the said sale must have been known to Ms. Young and she should have informed the plaintiff-appellee of the same.<br><br>In view of the foregoing we do not find any reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court, the parties entered into the contract freely, thus they must perform their obligation faithfully. Defendant-appellant’s unjustified refusal to perform its part of the agreement constitutes bad faith and the court will not tolerate the same.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City Branch 115, in Civil Case No. 06-0492 CFM is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> but in a December 9, 2011 Resolution, the CA held its ground.&nbsp; Hence, the present Petition.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>In an October 9, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court resolved to give due course to the Petition, which raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW WHEN IT RULED THAT THE MONEY RESPONDENT DELIVERED TO PETITIONER WAS EARNEST MONEY THEREBY PROVIDING A PERFECTED CONTRACT OF SALE.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW WHEN IT RULED THAT THE TIME THAT LAPSED IN RETURNING THE MONEY AND IN REPLYING TO THE LETTER IS PROOF OF ACCEPTANCE OF EARNEST MONEY.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS AND GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT IGNORED THE RESERVATION IN THE PROVISIONAL RECEIPT – “Note:&nbsp; This is issued to transactions not yet cleared but subsequently an Official Receipt will be issued.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In its Petition and Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> seeking to reverse and set aside the assailed CA dispositions and in effect to dismiss Civil Case No. 06-0492 CFM, petitioner argues that respondent failed to prove its case that a contract of sale was perfected between the parties.&nbsp; It particularly notes that, contrary to the CA’s ruling, respondent’s delivery of the February 4, 2005 letter and check; petitioner’s failure to respond to said letter; petitioner’s supposed acceptance of the check by depositing the same in its account; and its failure to return the same after more than one year from its tender – these circumstances do not at all prove that a contract of sale was perfected between the parties.&nbsp; It claims that there was never an agreement in the first place between them concerning the sale of the subject property, much less the payment of earnest money therefor; that during trial, Eleazar himself admitted that the check was merely a “deposit”;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that the February 4, 2005 letter and check were delivered not to Young, but to a mere receiving clerk of petitioner who knew nothing about the supposed transaction and was simply obliged to accept the same without the prerogative to reject them; that the acceptance of respondent’s supposed payment was not cleared and was subject to approval and issuance of the corresponding official receipt as noted in Provisional Receipt No. 33430; that respondent intentionally delivered the letter and check in the manner that it did in order to bind petitioner to the supposed sale with or without the latter’s consent; that petitioner could not be faulted for receiving the check and for depositing the same as a matter of operational procedure with respect to checks received in the course of its day-to-day business.<br><br>Petitioner argues that ultimately, it cannot be said that it gave its consent to any transaction with respondent or to the payment made by the latter.&nbsp; Respondent’s letter and check constitute merely an offer which required petitioner’s acceptance in order to give rise to a perfected sale; “[o]therwise, a buyer can easily bind any unsuspecting seller to a contract of sale by merely devising a way that prevents the latter from acting on the communicated offer.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Petitioner thus theorizes that since it had no perfected agreement with the respondent, the latter’s check should be treated not as earnest money, but as mere guarantee, deposit or option money to prevent the prospective seller from backing out from the sale,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> since the payment of any consideration acquires the character of earnest money only after a perfected sale between the parties has been arrived at.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> respondent counters that petitioner’s case typifies a situation where the seller has had an undue change of mind and desires to escape the legal consequences attendant to a perfected contract of sale.&nbsp; It reiterates the appellate court’s pronouncements that petitioner’s failure to reply to respondent’s February 4, 2005 letter indicates its consent to the sale; that its acceptance of the check as earnest money and the issuance of the provisional receipt prove that there is a prior agreement between the parties; that the deposit of the check in petitioner’s account and failure to timely return the money to respondent militates against petitioner’s claim of lack of knowledge and consent. Rather they indicate petitioner’s decision to sell subject property as agreed.&nbsp; Respondent adds that contrary to petitioner’s claim, negotiations were in fact held between the parties after it sent its December 9, 2004 letter-offer, which negotiations precisely culminated in the preparation and issuance of the February 4, 2005 letter; that petitioner’s failure to reply to its February 4, 2005 letter meant that it was amenable to respondent’s terms; that the issuance of a provisional receipt does not prevent the perfection of the agreement between the parties, since earnest money was already paid; and that petitioner cannot pretend to be ignorant of respondent’s check payment, as it involved a large sum of money that was deposited in the former’s bank account.<br><br><b><center>Our Ruling</center></b><br>The Court grants the Petition.&nbsp; The trial and appellate courts erred materially in deciding the case; they overlooked important facts that should change the complexion and outcome of the case.<br><br>It cannot be denied that there were negotiations between the parties conducted after the respondent’s December 9, 2004 letter-offer and prior to the February 4, 2005 letter.&nbsp; These negotiations culminated in a meeting between Eleazar and Young whereby the latter declined to enter into an agreement and accept cash payment then being tendered by the former.&nbsp; Instead, Young informed Eleazar during said meeting that she still had to confer with her sister and petitioner’s board of directors; in turn, Eleazar told Young that respondent shall await the necessary approval.<br><br>Thus, the trial and appellate courts failed to appreciate that respondent’s offer to purchase the subject property was never accepted by the petitioner at any instance, even after negotiations were held between them.&nbsp; Thus, as between them, there is no sale to speak of.&nbsp; “When there is merely an offer by one party without acceptance of the other, there is no contract.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; To borrow a pronouncement in a previously decided case,<br><br><blockquote>The stages of a contract of sale are: (1) negotiation, starting from the time the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract to the time the contract is perfected; (2) perfection, which takes place upon the concurrence of the essential elements of the sale; and (3) consummation, which commences when the parties perform their respective undertakings under the contract of sale, culminating in the extinguishment of the contract.<br><br>In the present case, the parties never got past the negotiation stage. Nothing shows that the parties had agreed on any final arrangement containing the essential elements of a contract of sale, namely, (1) consent or the meeting of the minds of the parties; (2) object or subject matter of the contract; and (3) price or consideration of the sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent’s subsequent sending of the February 4, 2005 letter and check to petitioner – without awaiting the approval of petitioner’s board of directors and Young’s decision, or without making a new offer – constitutes a mere reiteration of its original offer which was already rejected previously; thus, petitioner was under no obligation to reply to the February 4, 2005 letter.&nbsp; It would be absurd to require a party to reject the very same offer each and every time it is made; otherwise, a perfected contract of sale could simply arise from the failure to reject the same offer made for the hundredth time.&nbsp; Thus, said letter cannot be considered as evidence of a perfected sale, which does not exist in the first place; no binding obligation on the part of the petitioner to sell its property arose as a consequence.&nbsp; The letter made no new offer replacing the first which was rejected.<br><br>Since there is no perfected sale between the parties, respondent had no obligation to make payment through the check; nor did it possess the right to deliver earnest money to petitioner in order to bind the latter to a sale.&nbsp; As contemplated under Art. 1482 of the Civil Code, “there must first be a perfected contract of sale before we can speak of earnest money.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; “Where the parties merely exchanged offers and counter-offers, no contract is perfected since they did not yet give their consent to such offers.&nbsp; Earnest money applies to a perfected sale.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>This Court is inclined to accept petitioner’s explanation that since the check was mixed up with all other checks and correspondence sent to and received by the corporation during the course of its daily operations, Young could not have timely discovered respondent’s check payment; petitioner’s failure to return the purported earnest money cannot mean that it agreed to respondent’s offer.&nbsp; Besides, respondent’s payment of supposed earnest money was made under dubious circumstances and in disregard of sound business practice and common sense.&nbsp; Indeed, respondent must be faulted for taking such a course of action that is irregular and extraordinary: common sense and logic dictate that if any payment is made under the supposed sale transaction, it should have been made directly to Young or coursed directly through her office, since she is the officer directly responsible for negotiating the sale, as far as respondent is concerned and considering the amount of money involved; no other ranking officer of petitioner can be expected to know of the ongoing talks covering the subject property.&nbsp; Respondent already knew, from Eleazar’s previous meeting with Young, that it could only effectively deal with her; more than that, it should know that corporations work only through the proper channels.&nbsp; By acting the way it did – coursing the February 4, 2005 letter and check through petitioner’s mere receiving clerk or receptionist instead of directly with Young’s office, respondent placed itself under grave suspicion of putting into effect a premeditated plan to unduly bind petitioner to its rejected offer, in a manner which it could not achieve through negotiation and employing normal business practices.&nbsp; It impresses the Court that respondent attempted to secure the consent needed for the sale by depositing part of the purchase price and under the false pretense that an agreement was already arrived at, even though there was none.&nbsp; Respondent achieved the desired effect up to this point, but the Court will not be fooled.<br><br>Thus, as between respondent’s irregular and improper actions and petitioner’s failure to timely return the P100,000.00 purported earnest money, this Court sides with petitioner.&nbsp; In a manner of speaking, respondent cannot fault petitioner for not making a refund since it is equally to blame for making such payment under false pretenses and irregular circumstances, and with improper motives.&nbsp; Parties must come to court with clean hands, as it were.<br><br>In a potential sale transaction, the prior payment of earnest money even before the property owner can agree to sell his property is irregular, and cannot be used to bind the owner to the obligations of a seller under an otherwise perfected contract of sale; to cite a well-worn cliché, the carriage cannot be placed before the horse.&nbsp; The property owner-prospective seller may not be legally obliged to enter into a sale with a prospective buyer through the latter’s employment of questionable practices which prevent the owner from freely giving his consent to the transaction; this constitutes a palpable transgression of the prospective seller’s rights of ownership over his property, an anomaly which the Court will certainly not condone.&nbsp; An agreement where the prior free consent of one party thereto is withheld or suppressed will be struck down, and the Court shall always endeavor to protect a property owner’s rights against devious practices that put his property in danger of being lost or unduly disposed without his prior knowledge or consent.&nbsp; As this <i>ponente</i> has held before, “[t]his Court cannot presume the existence of a sale of land, absent any direct proof of it.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Nor will respondent’s supposed payment be treated as a deposit or guarantee; its actions will not be dignified and must be called for what they are: they were done irregularly and with a view to acquiring the subject property against petitioner’s consent.<br><br>Finally, since there is nothing in legal contemplation which petitioner must perform particularly for the respondent, it should follow that Civil Case No. 06-0492 CFM for specific performance with damages is left with no leg to stand on; it must be dismissed.<br><br>With the foregoing view, there is no need to resolve the other specific issues and arguments raised by the petitioner, as they do not materially affect the rights and obligations of the parties – the Court having declared that no agreement exists between them;
