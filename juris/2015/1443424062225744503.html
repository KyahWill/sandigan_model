During the lifetime of Manuela, the latter, by mere accommodation, permitted Rosario to temporarily occupy a portion of Lot 1519 (which would tum out to be Lot 1519-A after the mother lot's subdivision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>) covering approximately 80 square meters, as well as to construct a house thereon, with the understanding that she would vacate the premises upon demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Rosario took possession of the property, who was later succeeded by Susana and Sixto.

When there is no identity of causes of action, but only an identity of issues, there exists <i>res judicata</i> in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment. Although it does not have the same effect as <i>res judicata</i> in the form of bar by former judgment which prohibits the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand, or cause of action, the rule on conclusiveness of judgment bars the relitigation of particular facts or issues in another litigation between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Material to this discourse is the doctrine's second element, which evokes that the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine applies only when a judgment on the merits is finally rendered on the first complaint. The term "merits" has been defined as a matter of substance in law, as distinguished from matter of form; it refers to the real or substantial grounds of action or defense as contrasted with some technical or collateral matter raised in the course of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Thus, a judgment on the merits presupposes that trial has been conducted, evidence presented, and issues sufficiently heard and passed upon. It is a judgment rendered after a determination of which party is right, as distinguished from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or formal technical point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Stated differently, a judgment is "on the merits" when it amounts to a legal declaration of the respective rights and duties of the parties, based upon the disclosed facts and upon which the right of recovery depends, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objectives or contentions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>As applied herein, the Court finds that the RTC-Branch 26's dismissal of the <b>Reconveyance Case</b> did not constitute a bar to the filing of the complaint in the Annulment Case. As correctly ruled by the CA, the RTC­ Branch 26's said dismissal was merely based on the finding of forum shopping and the pendency of a similar action before the CA. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the dismissal was constitutive of a judgment "on the merits" of the case where the rights and liabilities of the parties are determined based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In fact, no trial has been held in the Reconveyance case. For all of these reasons, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> would not obtain to bar the Annulment Case.<br><br>Neither would <i>res judicata</i> apply with respect to the final judgment in the <b>Recovery Case</b> as it likewise cannot be considered as one rendered on the merits. Records show that the CA set aside the March 30, 1990 Decision in the Recovery Case based on the ruling that Roberto's certificate of title, <i>i.e.</i>, OCT No. 511, cannot be assailed by Rosario through intervention as the same amounted to a mere collateral attack prohibited under the Property Registration Decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> It further laid down the proper action that Rosario may take in the light of her allegations. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that the RTC-Branch 24's disposition was essentially based on the impropriety of Rosario's recourse of assailing Roberto's title in a proceeding not directly meant for that purpose. In such regard, there was no adjudication of the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the causes of action and the subject matter of the case, <i>i.e.</i>, the ownership of Lot 1519-A. Hence, the dismissal of Rosario's intervention was effectively a dismissal without prejudice that left the parties free to litigate the matter in a subsequent action as though the dismissed action had not been commenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> That said, the judgment in the Recovery Case did not bar the Annulment Case under the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><center><b><u>II. Forum Shopping and the Exception to the Rule.</u></b><br></center><br>Forum shopping is the act of a litigant who repetitively availed of several judicial remedies in different courts, <i>simultaneously</i> or <i>successively</i>, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues, either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court, to increase his chances of obtaining a favorable decision if not in one court, then in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>To determine whether a party violated the rule against forum shopping, the most important factor to ask is whether the element of <i>litis pendentia</i> is present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in another. Otherwise stated, the test for determining forum shopping is whether in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action, and reliefs sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> If a situation of <i>litis pendentia</i> or <i>res judicata</i> arises by virtue of a party's commencement of a judicial remedy identical to one which already exists (either pending or already resolved), then a forum shopping infraction is committed.<br><br>As opposed to <i>res judicata</i> which was already hereinabove explained, <i>litis pendentia</i> refers to a situation where two actions are pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, so that one of them becomes unnecessary and vexatious. It is based on the policy against multiplicity of suits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The requirements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are: (<i>a</i>) the <i>identity of parties</i>, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (<i>b</i>) the <i>identity of rights</i> asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (<i>c</i>) the <i>identity of the two cases</i> such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court agrees with petitioners that Rosario violated the rule on forum shopping when she filed the Annulment Case on September 4, 1998 during the pendency of the Reconveyance Case before the same branch of the RTC, <i>i.e.</i>, Branch 26.<br><br>To begin with, there exists an <i>identity of parties</i> in both the Reconveyance and Annulment cases; this, despite the fact that Chloe and the Dy children were not impleaded in the former case as contrarily claimed. It is well-settled that only substantial, and not absolute, identity of parties is required for <i>litis pendentia</i> to lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Thus, in <i>Chu v. Cunanan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> it was ruled that:<br><blockquote>There is <i>identity of parties</i> when the parties in both actions are the same, or there is privity between them, or <b>they are successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Dy children fall under the third classification. To recount, the property subject of both the Annulment and Reconveyance Cases is Lot 1519-A, which is the disputed portion of Lot 1519 registered in the name of Roberto. Chloe was impleaded in the Annulment Case as Roberto's wife, while the Dy children were impleaded as <b>transferees</b> of the subject lot through a Deed of Donation executed by Roberto and Chloe. It is clear that the interest held by the Dy children in the subject property was only passed on to them by Roberto and Chloe. This interest over Lot 1519-A, being a part of Lot 1519, is the same as that of which Roberto claimed in the Reconveyance Case in his own capacity. Therefore, although Chloe and the Dy children were not parties to the Reconveyance Case, they have now assumed interest over Lot 1519-A as Roberto's successor. Hence, the first element of <i>litis pendentia</i> - <i>identity of parties</i> - exists in this case.<br><br>Also, there exists an <i>identity of rights</i> asserted and reliefs prayed for in the two cases since the reliefs sought for are founded on the same facts. It bears emphasizing that the true test to determine the identity of causes of action is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> As aptly pointed out in the case of <i>Benedicta v. Lacson</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><blockquote>The test to determine identity of causes of action is to ascertain <b>whether the same evidence necessary to sustain the second cause of action is sufficient to authorize a recovery in the first, even if the forms or the nature of the two (2) actions are different from each other</b>. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two (2) actions are considered the same within the rule that the judgment in the former is a bar to the subsequent action; otherwise, it is not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A reading of the complaints for the Reconveyance and Annulment Cases readily shows that the prayers for relief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> in both are based on the same attendant facts. While it cannot be denied that the two cases differ in form and nature, their resolutions both hinge on the question of ownership of a portion of Lot 1519, <i>i.e.</i>, Lot 1519-A. The determination of the rightful ownership of the disputed lot will decide whether reconveyance of the same to Rosario's successors-in-interest is in order. At the same time, it will also determine whether the Deed of Donation executed by Roberto and Chloe in favor of their children should be annulled. It follows that the same facts and evidence are necessary for the resolution of both causes of action and consequently, a decision in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other. Therefore, the second and third elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> - <i>identity of rights</i> and <i>identity of the two cases</i> - are present in this case.<br><br>With the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> attendant hereto as caused by Rosario's institution of the Annulment Case while the Reconveyance Case was pending, the conclusion is that forum shopping was committed.<br><br>Under the last sentence of Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, "[i]f the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt as well as a cause for administrative sanctions."<br><br>In <i>Catayas v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> the Court elucidated on the consequences of forum shopping, to wit:<br><blockquote>[W]here a litigant sues the same party against whom another action or actions for the alleged violation of the same right and the enforcement of the same relief is/are pending, the defense of <i>litis pendencia</i> in one case is a bar to the others; and, a final judgment in one would constitute <i>res judicata</i> and thus would cause the dismissal of the rest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>While the Court is fully aware of the consequences of forum shopping, as well as its animating policy, which is to stamp out the abominable practice of trifling with the administration of justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> the circumstances obtaining in the instant case nevertheless distinctly call for a deviation from the general rule in order to further the ends of substantial justice.<br><br>Instructive on this score is the recent case of <i>Ching v. Cheng</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (<i>Ching</i>) where the Court, in the interest of substantial justice and in view of the numerous procedural entanglements surrounding the resolution on the merits of the original controversy, resolved not to strictly apply the rule on forum shopping when it can be shown that: (1) the original case has been dismissed upon request of the plaintiff for valid procedural reasons; (2) <b>the only pending matter is a motion for reconsideration</b>; and (3) <b>there are valid procedural reasons that serve the goal of substantial justice for the fresh new case to proceed</b>.<br><br>A resort to the <b>third exception</b> is warranted for it cannot be denied that the resolution of the controversy involving the ownership of Lot 1519-A has long been mired in numerous technical quandaries, despite the clarity of Rosario's ownership over said lot which she had already acquired through acquisitive prescription, and now transferred to her heirs, <i>i.e.</i>, respondents, as will be heretofore explained.<br><br>As culled from the records, the first case, <i>i.e.</i>, the <b>Recovery Case</b>, was decided in Roberto's favor only because Rosario's claim over Lot 1519-A was coursed through a mere intervention and, hence, constituted an impermissible collateral attack on Roberto's certificate of title. Although said disposition did not prevent Rosario from filing the appropriate action against Roberto involving the same facts and cause of action arising therefrom, her subsequent <b>Reconveyance Case</b> was nonetheless dismissed due to the pendency of her motion for reconsideration in the Recovery Case, which again was a dismissal based on a procedural technicality and, in fact, may have been excused under <i>Ching</i>'s <b>second exception</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, "the only pending matter is a motion for reconsideration."<br><br>Contrastingly, the <b>Annulment Case</b> - which was filed before the dismissal of the Reconveyance Case - was the only proceeding that underwent a full blown trial and a judgment on the merits rendered by the RTC-Branch 26 and affirmed by the CA. Affirming the RTC's ruling, which completely litigated and resolved the core issue of Lot 1519-A's ownership, the CA found that actual fraud was committed by Roberto in his application for land registration, thereby warranting the annulment of the property's donation to his children, Jose and Alteza. TheCA also expressed no qualms regarding the RTC-Branch 24's finding that Rosario ad Susana have been in open, actual, exclusive, and notorious possession of the land since 1938, thus agreeing that they already acquired ownership over the same. In fact, after a judicious review of this case, the Court has itself reached the same conclusions, albeit qualify that the nullity of the donation to the Dy children should only be limited to Lot 1519-A, and not to Lot 1519's entirety. The Court elaborates.<br><br>While there is no gainsaying that the first deed of donation executed by Dy Chiao in Rosario's favor is void for failure to comply with the formalities under the old and new Civil Code, it has not been disputed that Rosario was in actual, open, public, and continuous possession of Lot 1519-A under a claim of ownership <b>since 1938</b>. Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> provides for the applicable prescriptive period to vest ownership over the subject portion, considering that Article 1116 of the New Civil Code provides that "[p]rescription already running before the effectivity of this Code [(August 30, 1950)] shall governed by laws previously in force x x x." Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 41. <i>Title to land by prescription</i>. - <b>Ten years</b> actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for that time of any land or interest in land, uninterruptedly continued for ten years by occupancy, descent, grants, or otherwise, in whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and complete title, saving to the persons under disabilities the rights secured by the next section. In order to constitute such title by prescription or adverse possession, the possession by the claimant or by the person under or through whom he claims must have been actual, open, public, continuous, under a claim of title exclusive of any other right and adverse to all other claimants. x x x.<br></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, it is then clear that Rosario's possession of Lot 1519-A, in the character above-cited, and which ran for more than the above-stated number of years, had already ripened into ownership at the time Roberto filed his complaint in the Recovery Case in <b>May 22, 1989</b>, as well as at the time the Decision ordering the issuance of OCT No. 511 was rendered in <b>October 14, 1986</b>, and necessarily the issuance of the OCT itself in <b>October 6, 1987</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Note that even under the New Civil Code, Rosario's possession of the said portion still ripened into ownership since she has been in uninterrupted possession thereof for more than thirty (30) years, even in the absence of good faith and just title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Hence, there is no denying that Rosario and now, her heirs, <i>i.e.</i>, herein respondents, are the rightful owners of Lot 1519-A by virtue of acquisitive prescription.<br><br>That the issue on acqmsttlve prescription was not raised in these proceedings as petitioners would like this Court to believe is actually belied by the pleadings on record. To back track, acquisitive prescription was the basis behind the RTC-Branch 24's very first ruling in the Recovery Case declaring Rosario to be the lawful owner of Lot 1519-A. This same ruling was then explicitly incorporated as an integral part of Rosario's Complaint in the Annulment Case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> for which she had claimed to be the absolute owner of the same property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> At this stage, Roberto had already been apprised of the issue of prescription, as it related to Rosario's averment of her continued possession of Lot 1519-A, which was already a previously litigated issue between the same parties. To add, Rosario similarly stated in her pre-trial brief in the Annulment case that from the time the property was donated to her by Dy Chiao in 1938, she took actual physical possession over the same in the concept of an owner and, even constructed a residential house thereon where she was residing until her death on October 10, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The Pre-Trial Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> dated June 17, 2003 of the Annulment Case, in fact, reflected Rosario's reliance on the RTC-Branch 24's ruling in Civil Case No. RTC '89-1782,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> which, in turn, related to the stipulated issue of whether or not plaintiffs, <i>i.e.</i>, Rosario, <i>et al.</i>, are the lawful and absolute owners of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Jurisdiction over the issues of the case is determined and conferred by the pleadings filed in the case by the parties, or by their agreement in a pre-trial order or stipulation, or, at times by their implied consent as by the failure of a party to object to evidence on an issue not covered by the pleadings, as provided in Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Here, there is no dispute that the issue of possession as it relates to acquisitive prescription was raised through the facts above-stated, which then allowed the RTC-Branch 26 to acquire jurisdiction over said issue in the Annulment Case now before this Court on appeal. More so, the rule proscribing the Court from ruling on issues not raised hinges on considerations of due process and fairness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> But again, having been well­ aware that Rosario was relying on the RTC-Branch 24's ruling in the Recovery Case as basis for her alleged ownership over the property, and considering too her repetitive statements that she had been in actual possession of Lot 1519-A since 1938 in the concept of an owner, petitioners cannot pretend that their due process rights have been violated by the RTC­ Branch 26 as upheld by the CA and now, by this Court - in taking cognizance of the issue of acquisitive prescription.<br><br>Besides, even if one were to discount the foregoing, it also appears that Roberto's failure to disclose Rosario's possession of the disputed lot in his application for registration of Lot 1519 as required under Section 15 of PD 1529,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> amounted to actual fraud in the procurement of his title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> that warranted reconveyance of the subject portion back to Rosario and her successors-in-interest, the herein respondents. Indeed, this Court has ruled that:<br><blockquote>[C]oncealment and misrepresentation in the application that no other persons had any claim or interest in the said land, constitute specific allegations of extrinsic fraud supported by competent proof. Failure and intentional omission of the applicants to disclose the fact of actual physical possession by another person constitutes an allegation of actual fraud. Likewise, it is fraud to knowingly omit or conceal a fact, upon which benefit is obtained to the prejudice of a third person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote>It is well to point out that an action for reconveyance - as in Roberto's Recovery Case is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful land owner whose land was wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another, to compel the registered owner to transfer or reconvey the land to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> By fraudulently including in his application for the registration of title over Lot 1519 the disputed portion, <i>i.e.</i>, Lot 1519-A, in his name, Roberto holds the title to said portion in trust for the benefit of Rosario as the true owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Indeed, registration does not vest title but merely confirms or records title already existing and vested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Thus, not being the owner of the subject portion, Roberto could not have transferred ownership thereof to his children, petitioners Jose and Alteza. As succinctly held in <i>Spouses Lopez v. Spouses Lopez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><blockquote>As a logical consequence, petitioners did not become owners of the subject property even after a TCT had been issued in their names. After all, registration does not vest title. Certificates of title m rely confirm or record title already existing and vested. They cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner, nor can they be used as a shield for the commission of fraud, or to permit one to enrich oneself at the expense of others. Hence, reconveyance of the subject property is warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br></blockquote>Since Rosario's claim of ownership was limited only to Lot 1519-A and not the entire Lot 1519, the donation remains to be valid insofar as it involves that portion rightfully belonging to the Dy children. Verily, it is a well-settled rule that a donor cannot lawfully convey what is not his property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> as Lot 1519-A in this case.<br><br>With all these considerations in mind, the Court has come to the conclusion that it cannot precipitately order the summary dismissal of the Annulment Case and set aside the judgments therein rendered in view of a mere forum shopping infraction as afore-discussed. To act otherwise would be tantamount to a blatant disregard of substantial justice in the name of unwarranted technical adherence. Case law dictates that technicalities should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of the other party. Every party­ litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> As aptly pointed out in <i>Barcelona v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> the rule on forum shopping should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective or the goal of all rules of procedure - which is to achieve substantial justice as expeditiously as possible. After all, the dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the partial nullification of the June 28, 1994 Deed of Donation between spouses-petitioners Roberto and Chloe and petitioners Jose and Alteza insofar as it concerns Lot 1519-A owned by Rosario and, now respondents, as her heirs, is in order.<br><br><center><b><u>III. Attorney's Fees</u></b><br></center><br>On a final point, the Court, prompted as it is by petitioners' insinuation, finds it apt to delete the attorney's fees awarded in favor of respondents given that the trial court failed to explain its findings of facts and law to justify the award.<br><br>It bears to stress that power of the court to award attorney's fees demands factual, legal, and equitable justification, without which the award is a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> In fact, such failure or oversight of the trial court cannot even be supplanted by the CA. As elucidated in the case of <i>S.C. Megaworld Construction and Development Corporation v. Parada</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><blockquote>Article 2208 of the New Civil Code enumerates the instances where such may be awarded and, in all cases, it must be reasonable, just and equitable if the same were to be granted. Attorney's fees as part of damages are not meant to enrich the winning party at the expense of the losing litigant. They are not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. The award of attorney's fees is the exception. rather than the general rule. As such, it is necessary for the trial court to make findings of facts and law that would bring the case within the exception and justify the grant of such award. The matter of attorney's fees cannot be mentioned only in the dispositive portion of the decision. They must be clearly explained and justified by the trial court in the body of its decision. On appeal, the CA is precluded from supplementing the bases for awarding attorney's fees when the trial court failed to discuss in its Decision the reasons for awarding the same. Consequently, the award of attorney's fees should be deleted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
