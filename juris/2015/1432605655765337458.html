				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the three (3) consolidated petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> involving medical negligence, commonly assailing the October 29, 2004 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the January 12, 2006 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. CV No. 56400. This CA decision affirmed <i>en toto</i> the ruling of the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 134, Makati City.<br><br>The RTC awarded Nelson Cortejo (<i>respondent</i>) damages in the total amount of P595,000.00, for the wrongful death of his son allegedly due to the medical negligence of the petitioning doctors and the hospital.<br><br><center><b><u>Factual Antecedents</u></b><br></center><br>The common factual antecedents are briefly summarized below.<br><br>On April 22, 1988, at about 11:30 in the morning, Mrs. Jesusa Cortejo brought her 11-year old son, Edmer Cortejo (<i>Edmer</i>), to the Emergency Room of the San Juan de Dios Hospital (<i>SJDH</i>) because of difficulty in breathing, chest pain, stomach pain, and fever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Dr. Ramoncito Livelo (<i>Dr. Livelo</i>) initially attended to and examined Edmer. In her testimony, Mrs. Cortejo narrated that in the morning of April 20, 1988, Edmer had developed a slight fever that lasted for one day; a few hours upon discovery, she brought Edmer to their family doctor; and two hours after administering medications, Edmer's fever had subsided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After taking Edmer's medical history, Dr. Livelo took his vital signs, body temperature, and blood pressure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Based on these initial examinations and the chest x-ray test that followed, Dr. Livelo diagnosed Edmer with "bronchopneumonia."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Edmer's blood was also taken for testing, typing, and for purposes of administering antibiotics. Afterwards, Dr. Livelo gave Edmer an antibiotic medication to lessen his fever and to loosen his phlegm.<br><br>Mrs. Cortejo did not know any doctor at SJDH. She used her Fortune Care card and was referred to an accredited Fortune Care coordinator, who was then out of town. She was thereafter assigned to Dr. Noel Casumpang (<i>Dr. Casumpang</i>), a pediatrician also accredited with Fortune Care.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At 5:30 in the afternoon of the same day, Dr. Casumpang for the first time examined Edmer in his room. Using only a stethoscope, he confirmed the initial diagnosis of "<i>Bronchopneumonia.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At that moment, Mrs. Cortejo recalled entertaining doubts on the doctor's diagnosis. She immediately advised Dr. Casumpang that Edmer had a high fever, and had no colds or cough<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> but Dr. Casumpang merely told her that her son's "<i>bloodpressure is just being active</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and remarked that "<i>that's the usual bronchopneumonia, no colds, no phlegm</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Dr. Casumpang next visited and examined Edmer at 9:00 in the morning the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Still suspicious about his son's illness, Mrs. Cortejo again called Dr. Casumpang's attention and stated that Edmer had a fever, throat irritation, as well as chest and stomach pain. Mrs. Cortejo also alerted Dr. Casumpang about the traces of blood in Edmer's sputum. Despite these pieces of information, however, Dr. Casumpang simply nodded, inquired if Edmer has an asthma, and reassured Mrs. Cortejo that Edmer's illness is bronchopneumonia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>At around 11:30 in the morning of April 23, 1988, Edmer vomited "phlegm with blood streak"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> prompting the respondent (<i>Edmer's father</i>) to request for a doctor at the nurses' station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Forty-five minutes later, Dr. Ruby Sanga-Miranda (<i>Dr. Miranda</i>), one of the resident physicians of SJDH, arrived. She claimed that although aware that Edmer had vomited "phlegm with blood streak," she failed to examine the blood specimen because the respondent washed it away. She then advised the respondent to preserve the specimen for examination.<br><br>Thereafter, Dr. Miranda conducted a physical check-up covering Edmer's head, eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin and abdomen; and found that Edmer had a low-grade non-continuing fever, and rashes that were not typical of dengue fever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Her medical findings state:<br><blockquote>the patient's rapid breathing and then the lung showed sibilant and the patient's nose is flaring which is a sign that the patient is in respiratory distress; the abdomen has negative finding; the patient has low grade fever and not continuing; and the rashes in the patient's skin were not "Herman's Rash" and not typical of dengue fever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>At 3:00 in the afternoon, Edmer once again vomited blood. Upon seeing Dr. Miranda, the respondent showed her Edmer's blood specimen, and reported that Edmer had complained of severe stomach pain and difficulty in moving his right leg.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Dr. Miranda then examined Edmer's "<i>sputum with blood</i>" and noted that he was bleeding. Suspecting that he could be afflicted with dengue, she inserted a plastic tube in his nose, drained the liquid from his stomach with ice cold normal saline solution, and gave an instruction not to pull out the tube, or give the patient any oral medication.<br><br>Dr. Miranda thereafter conducted a tourniquet test, which turned out to be negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> She likewise ordered the monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and some blood tests. Edmer's blood pressure was later found to be normal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>At 4:40 in the afternoon, Dr. Miranda called up Dr. Casumpang at his clinic and told him about Edmer's condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Upon being informed, Dr. Casumpang ordered several procedures done including: <i>hematocrit, hemoglobin, blood typing, blood transfusion and tourniquet tests</i>.<br><br>The blood test results came at about 6:00 in the evening.<br><br>Dr. Miranda advised Edmer's parents that the blood test results showed that Edmer was suffering from "Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever." One hour later, Dr. Casumpang arrived at Edmer's room and he recommended his transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (<i>ICU</i>), to which the respondent consented. Since the ICU was then full, Dr. Casumpang suggested to the respondent that they hire a private nurse. The respondent, however, insisted on transferring his son to Makati Medical Center.<br><br>After the respondent had signed the waiver, Dr. Casumpang, for the last time, checked Edmer's condition, found that his blood pressure was stable, and noted that he was "comfortable." The respondent requested for an ambulance but he was informed that the driver was nowhere to be found. This prompted him to hire a private ambulance that cost him P600.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>At 12:00 midnight, Edmer, accompanied by his parents and by Dr. Casumpang, was transferred to Makati Medical Center.<br><br>Dr. Casumpang immediately gave the attending physician the patient's clinical history and laboratory exam results. Upon examination, the attending physician diagnosed "Dengue Fever Stage IV" that was already in its irreversible stage.<br><br>Edmer died at 4:00 in the morning of April 24, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> His Death Certificate indicated the cause of death as "Hypovolemic Shock/hemorrhagic shock;" "Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Stage IV."<br><br>Believing that Edmer's death was caused by the negligent and erroneous diagnosis of his doctors, the respondent instituted an action for damages against SJDH, and its attending physicians: Dr. Casumpang and Dr. Miranda (<i>collectively referred to as the "petitioners"</i>) before the RTC of Makati City.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated May 30, 1997, the RTC ruled in favor of the respondent, and awarded actual and moral damages, plus attorney's fees and costs.<br><br>In ruling that the petitioning doctors were negligent, the RTC found untenable the petitioning doctors' contention that Edmer's initial symptoms did not indicate dengue fever. It faulted them for heavily relying on the chest x-ray result and for not considering the other manifestations that Edmer's parents had relayed. It held that in diagnosing and treating an illness, the physician's conduct should be judged not only by what he/she saw and knew, but also by what he/she could have reasonably seen and known. It also observed that based on Edmer's signs and symptoms, his medical history and physical examination, and also <i>the information that the petitioning doctors gathered from his family members</i>, dengue fever was a reasonably foreseeable illness; yet, the petitioning doctors failed to take a second look, much less, consider these indicators of dengue.<br><br>The trial court also found that aside from their self-serving testimonies, the petitioning doctors did not present other evidence to prove that they exercised the proper medical attention in diagnosing and treating the patient, leading it to conclude that they were guilty of negligence.<br><br>The RTC also held SJDH solidarity liable with the petitioning doctors for damages based on the following findings of facts: <i>first</i>, Dr. Casumpang, as consultant, is an <b>ostensible agent of SJDH</b> because before the hospital engaged his medical services, it scrutinized and determined his fitness, qualifications, and competence as a medical practitioner; and <i>second</i>, Dr. Miranda, as resident physician, is an <b>employee of SJDH</b> because like Dr. Casumpang, the hospital, through its screening committee, scrutinized and determined her qualifications, fitness, and competence before engaging her services; the hospital also exercised control over her work.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, ordering the latter to pay solidarity and severally plaintiff the following:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Moral damages in the amount of P500,000.00;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Costs of burial and funeral in the amount of P45,000.00;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Attorney's fees of P50,000.00; and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) Cost of this suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>The petitioners appealed the decision to the CA.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>In its decision dated October 29, 2004, the CA affirmed <i>en toto</i> the RTC's ruling, finding that SJDH and its attending physicians failed to exercise the minimum medical care, attention, and treatment expected of an ordinary doctor under like circumstances.<br><br>The CA found the petitioning doctors' failure to read even the most basic signs of "<i>dengue fever</i>" expected of an ordinary doctor as medical negligence. The CA also considered the petitioning doctors' testimonies as self-serving, noting that they presented no other evidence to prove that they exercised due diligence in diagnosing Edmer's illness.<br><br>The CA likewise found Dr. Rodolfo Jaudian's (<i>Dr. Jaudian</i>) testimony admissible. It gave credence to his opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that: <i>(1) given the exhibited symptoms of the patient, dengue fever should definitely be considered, and bronchopneumonia could be reasonably ruled out; and (2) dengue fever could have been detected earlier than 7:30 in the evening of April 23, 1988 because the symptoms were already evident</i>; and agreed with the RTC that the petitioning doctors should not have solely relied on the chest-x-ray result, as it was not conclusive.<br><br>On SJDH's solidary liability, the CA ruled that the hospital's liability is based on Article 2180 of the Civil Code. The CA opined that the control which the hospital exercises over its consultants, the hospital's power to hire and terminate their services, all fulfill the employer-employee relationship requirement under Article 2180.<br><br>Lastly, the CA held that SJDH failed to adduce evidence showing that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the hiring and the supervision of its physicians.<br><br>The petitioners separately moved to reconsider the CA decision, but the CA denied their motion in its resolution of January 12, 2006; hence, the present consolidated petitions pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petitions</u></b><br></center><br><b><i>I. Dr. Casumpang's Position (G.R. No. 171127)</i></b><br><br>Dr. Casumpang contends that he gave his patient medical treatment and care to the best of his abilities, and within the proper standard of care required from physicians under similar circumstances. He claims that his initial diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was supported by the chest x-ray result.<br><br>Dr. Casumpang also contends that dengue fever occurs only after several days of confinement. He alleged that when he had suspected that Edmer might be suffering from dengue fever, he immediately attended and treated him.<br><br>Dr. Casumpang likewise raised serious doubjs on Dr. Jaudian's credibility, arguing that the CA erred in appreciating his testimony as an expert witness since he lacked the necessary training, skills, and experience as a specialist in dengue fever cases.<br><br><b><i>II. Dr. Miranda's Position (G.R. No. 171217)</i></b><br><br>In her petition, Dr. Miranda faults the CA for holding her responsible for Edmer's wrong diagnosis, stressing that the function of making the diagnosis and undertaking the medical treatment devolved upon Dr. Casumpang, the doctor assigned to Edmer, and who confirmed "bronchopneumonia."<br><br>Dr. Miranda also alleged that she exercised prudence in performing her duties as a physician, underscoring that it was her professional intervention that led to the correct diagnosis of "<i>Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever</i>." Furthermore, Edmer's Complete Blood Count (<i>CBC</i>) showed leukopenia and an increase in balance as shown by the differential count, demonstrating that Edmer's infection, more or less, is of bacterial and not viral in nature.<br><br>Dr. Miranda as well argued that there is no causal relation between the alleged erroneous diagnosis and medication for "<i>Bronchopneumonia</i>," and Edmer's death due to "<i>Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever</i>."<br><br>Lastly, she claimed that Dr. Jaudian is not a qualified expert witness since he never presented any evidence of formal residency training and fellowship status in Pediatrics.<br><br><b><i>III. SJDH's Position (G.R. No. 171228)</i></b><br><br>SJDH, on the other hand, disclaims liability by asserting that Dr. Casumpang and Dr. Miranda are mere independent contractors and "consultants" (not employees) of the hospital. SJDH alleges that since it did not exercise control or supervision over the consultants' exercise of medical profession, there is no employer-employee relationship between them, and consequently, Article 2180 of the Civil Code does not apply.<br><br>SJDH likewise anchored the absence of, employer-employee relationship on the following circumstances: (1) SJDH does not hire consultants; it only grants them privileges to admit patients in the hospital through accreditation; (2) SJDH does not pay the consultants wages similar to an ordinary employee; (3) the consultants earn their own professional fees directly from their patients; SJDH does not fire or terminate their services; and (4) SJDH does not control or interfere with the manner and the means the consultants use in the treatment of their patients. It merely provides them with adequate space in exchange for rental payment.<br><br>Furthermore, SJDH claims that the CA erroneously applied the control test when it treated the hospital's practice of accrediting consultants as an exercise of control. It explained that the control contemplated by law is that which the employer exercises over the: <i>(i) end result</i>; and the <i>(ii) manner and means to be used to reach this end</i>, and not any kind of control, however significant, in accrediting the consultants.<br><br>SJDH moreover contends that even if the petitioning doctors are considered employees and not merely consultants of the hospital, SJDH cannot still be held solidarity liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code because it observed the diligence of a good father of a family in their selection and supervision as shown by the following: (1) the adequate measures that the hospital undertakes to ascertain the petitioning doctors' qualifications and medical competence; and (2) the documentary evidence that the petitioning doctors presented to prove their competence in the field of pediatrics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>SJDH likewise faults the CA for ruling that the petitioning doctors are its agents, claiming that this theory, aside from being inconsistent with the CA's finding of employment relationship, is unfounded because: <i>first</i>, the petitioning doctors are independent contractors, not agents of SJDH; and <i>second</i>, as a medical institution, SJDH cannot practice medicine, much more, extend its personality to physicians to practice medicine on its behalf.<br><br>Lastly, SJDH maintains that the petitioning doctors arrived at an intelligently deduced and correct diagnosis. It claimed that based on Edmer's signs and symptoms at the time of admission (<i>i.e., one day fever</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>bacterial infection,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and <i>lack of hemorrhagic manifestations</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>), there was no reasonable indication yet that he was suffering from dengue fever, and accordingly, their failure to diagnose dengue fever, does not constitute negligence on their part.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case for the Respondent</u></b><br></center><br>In his comment, the respondent submits that the issues the petitioners raised are mainly factual in nature, which a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court does not allow.<br><br>In any case, he contends that the petitioning doctors were negligent in conducting their medical examination and diagnosis based on the following: (1) the petitioning doctors failed to timely diagnose Edmer's correct illness due to their non-observance of the proper and acceptable standard of medical examination; (2) the petitioning doctors' medical examination was not comprehensive, as they were always in a rush; and (3) the petitioning doctors employed a guessing game in diagnosing bronchopneumonia.<br><br>The respondent also alleges that there is a causal connection between the petitioning doctors' negligence and Edmer's untimely death, warranting the claim for damages.<br><br>The respondent, too, asserted that SJDH is also negligent because it was not equipped with proper paging system, has no bronchoscope, and its doctors are not proportionate to the number of its patients. He also pointed out that out of the seven resident physicians in the hospital, only two resident physicians were doing rounds at the time of his son's confinement.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The case presents to us the following issues:<br><ol><li>Whether or not the petitioning doctors had committed "inexcusable lack of precaution" in diagnosing and in treating the patient;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the petitioner hospital is solidarity liable with the petitioning doctors;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not there is a causal connection between the petitioners' negligent act/omission and the patient's resulting death; and<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the lower courts erred in considering Dr. Rodolfo Tabangcora Jaudian as an expert witness.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Our Ruling </u></b><br></div><br><b>We find the petition partly meritorious.</b><br><br><b><i>A Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is Limited to Questions of Law.</i></b><br><br>The settled rule is that the Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited only to the review of pure questions of law. It is not the Court's function to inquire on the veracity of the appellate court's factual findings and conclusions; this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>These consolidated petitions before us involve <b>mixed questions of fact and law</b>. As a rule, we do not resolve questions of fact. However, in determining the legal question of whether the respondent is entitled to claim damages under Article 2176 of the Civil Code for the petitioners' alleged medical malpractice, the determination of the factual issues - <i>i.e., whether the petitioning doctors were grossly negligent in diagnosing the patient's illness, whether there is causal relation between the petitioners' act/omission and the patient's resulting death, and whether Dr. Jaudian is qualified as an expert witness</i> - must necessarily be resolved. We resolve these factual questions solely for the purpose of determining the legal issues raised.<br><br><b><i>Medical Malpractice Suit as a Specialized Area of Tort Law</i></b><br><br>The claim for damages is based on the petitioning doctors' negligence in diagnosing and treating the deceased Edmer, the child of the respondent. It is a <b><i>medical malpractice suit</i></b>, an action available to victims to redress a wrong committed by medical professionals who caused bodily harm to, or the death of, a patient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> As the term is used, the suit is brought whenever a medical practitioner or health care provider fails to meet the standards demanded by his profession, or deviates from this standard, and causes injury to the patient.<br><br>To successfully pursue a medical malpractice suit, the plaintiff (<i>in this case, the deceased patient's heir</i>) must prove that the doctor either failed to do what a reasonably prudent doctor would have done, or did what a reasonably prudent doctor would not have done; and the act or omission had caused injury to the patient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The patient's heir/s bears the burden of proving his/her cause of action.<br><br><b><i>The Elements of a Medical Malpractice Suit</i></b><br><br>The elements of medical negligence are: <b>(1) duty; (2) breach; (3) injury; and (4) proximate causation</b>.<br><br>Duty refers to the standard of behavior that imposes restrictions on one's conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It requires proof of professional relationship between the physician and the patient. Without the professional relationship, a physician owes no duty to the patient, and cannot therefore incur any liability.<br><br>A physician-patient relationship is created when a patient engages the services of a physician,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and the latter accepts or agrees to provide care to the patient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The establishment of this relationship is consensual,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and the acceptance by the physician essential. The mere fact that an individual approaches a physician and seeks diagnosis, advice or treatment does not create the duty of care unless the physician agrees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The consent needed to create the relationship does not always need to be express.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the absence of an express agreement, a physician-patient relationship may be implied from the physician's affirmative action to diagnose and/or treat a patient, or in his participation in such diagnosis and/or treatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The usual illustration would be the case of a patient who goes to a hospital or a clinic, and is examined and treated by the doctor. In this case, we can infer, based on the established and customary practice in the medical community that a patient-physician relationship exists.<br><br>Once a physician-patient relationship is established, the legal duty of care follows. The doctor accordingly becomes duty-bound to use at least the same standard of care that a reasonably competent doctor would use to treat a medical condition under similar circumstances.<br><br>Breach of duty occurs when the doctor fails to comply with, or improperly performs his duties under professional standards. This determination is both factual and legal, and is specific to each individual case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>If the patient, as a result of the breach of duty, is injured in body or in health, actionable malpractice is committed, entitling the patient to damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>To successfully claim damages, the patient must lastly prove the causal relation between the negligence and the injury. This connection must be direct, natural, and should be unbroken by any intervening efficient causes. In other words, <b>the negligence must be the proximate cause of the injury</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The injury or damage is proximately caused by the physician's negligence when it appears, based on the evidence and the expert testimony, that the negligence played an integral part in causing the injury or damage, and that the injury or damage was either a direct result, or a reasonably probable consequence of the physician's negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>a. The Relationship Between Dr. Casumpang and Edmer</i></b><br><br>In the present case, the physician-patient relationship between Dr. Casumpang and Edmer was created when the latter's parents sought the medical services of Dr. Casumpang, and the latter knowingly accepted Edmer as a patient. Dr. Casumpang's acceptance is implied from his affirmative examination, diagnosis and treatment of Edmer. On the other hand, Edmer's parents, on their son's behalf, manifested their consent by availing of the benefits of their health care plan, and by accepting the hospital's assigned doctor without objections.<br><br><b><i>b. The Relationship Between Dr. Miranda and Edmer</i></b><br><br>With respect to Dr. Miranda, her professional relationship with Edmer arose when she assumed the obligation to provide resident supervision over the latter. As second year resident doctor tasked to do rounds and assist other physicians, Dr. Miranda is deemed to have agreed to the creation of physician-patient relationship with the hospital's patients when she participated in the diagnosis and prescribed a course of treatment for Edmer.<br><br>The undisputed evidence shows that Dr. Miranda examined Edmer twice (<i>at around 12:00 and 3:30 in the afternoon of April 23, 1988</i>), and in both instances, she prescribed treatment and participated in the diagnosis of Edmer's medical condition. Her affirmative acts amounted to her acceptance of the physician-patient relationship, and incidentally, the legal duty of care that went with it.<br><br>In <i>Jarcia, Jr. v. People of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court found the doctors who merely passed by and were requested to attend to the patient, liable for medical malpractice. It held that a physician-patient relationship was established when they examined the patient, and later assured the mother that everything was fine.<br><br>In the <i>US case of Mead v.

In addition, considering the diagnosis previously made by two doctors, and the uncontroverted fact that the burden of final diagnosis pertains to the attending physician (<i>in this case, Dr. Casumpang</i>), we believe that Dr. Miranda's error was merely an honest mistake of judgment influenced in no small measure by her status in the hospital hierarchy; hence, she should not be held liable for medical negligence.<br><br><b><i>Dr. Jaudian 's Professional Competence and Credibility</i></b><br><br>One of the critical issues the petitioners raised in the proceedings before the lower court and before this Court was Dr. Jaudian's competence and credibility as an expert witness. The petitioners tried to discredit his expert testimony on the ground that he lacked the proper training and fellowship status in pediatrics.<br><br><i>Criteria in Qualifying as an Expert Witness</i><br><br>The competence of an expert witness is a matter for the trial court to decide upon in the exercise of its discretion. The test of qualification is necessarily a relative one, depending upon the subject matter of the investigation, and the fitness of the expert witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> In our jurisdiction, the criterion remains to be the expert witness' <b>special knowledge experience and practical training that qualify him/her to explain highly technical medical matters to the Court</b>.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Ramos v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the Court found the expert witness, who is a pulmonologist, not qualified to testify on the field of anesthesiology. Similarly, in <i>Cereno v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> a 2012 case involving medical negligence, the Court excluded the testimony of an expert witness whose specialty was anesthesiology, and concluded that an anesthesiologist cannot be considered an expert in the field of surgery or even in surgical practices and diagnosis.<br><br>Interestingly in this case, Dr. Jaudian, the expert witness was admittedly not a pediatrician but a practicing physician who specializes in pathology.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> He likewise does not possess any formal residency training in pediatrics. Nonetheless, both the lower courts found his knowledge acquired through study and practical experience sufficient to advance an expert opinion on dengue-related cases.<br><br><b>We agree with the lower courts.</b><br><br>A close scrutiny of <i>Ramos</i> and <i>Cereno</i> reveals that the Court primarily based the witnesses' disqualification to testify as an expert on their <i>incapacity to shed light on the standard of care that must be observed by the defendant-physicians</i>. That the expert witnesses' specialties do not match the physicians' practice area only constituted, at most, one of the considerations that should not be taken out of context. After all, the sole function of a medical expert witness, regardless of his/her specialty, is to afford assistance to the courts on medical matters, and to explain the medical facts in issue.<br><br>Furthermore, there was no reasonable indication in <i>Ramos</i> and <i>Cereno</i> that the expert witnesses possess a sufficient familiarity with the standard of care applicable to the physicians' specialties.<br><br>US jurisprudence on medical malpractice demonstrated the trial courts' wide latitude of discretion in allowing a specialist from another field to testify against a defendant specialist.<br><br>In <i>Brown v. Sims</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> a neurosurgeon was found competent to give expert testimony regarding a gynecologist's standard of pre-surgical care. In that case, the court held that since negligence was not predicated on the gynecologist's negligent performance of the operation, but primarily on the claim that the pre-operative histories and physicals were inadequate, the neurosurgeon was competent to testify as an expert.<br><br><i>Frost v. Mayo Clinic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> also allowed an orthopedic surgeon to testify against a neurologist in a medical malpractice action. The court considered that the orthopedic surgeon's opinion on the "immediate need for decompression" need not come from a specialist in neurosurgery. The court held that:<br><blockquote>It is well established that "the testimony of a qualified medical doctor cannot be excluded simply because he is not a specialist x x x."

Mladineo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> adhered to the principle that the witness' familiarity, and not the classification by title or specialty, which should control issues regarding the expert witness' qualifications: <br><blockquote>The general rule as to expert testimony in medical malpractice actions is that "a specialist in a particular branch within a profession will not be required." Most courts allow a doctor to testify if they are satisfied of his familiarity with the standards of a specialty, though he may not practice the specialty himself. One court explained that "it is the scope of the witness' knowledge and not the artificial classification by title that should govern the threshold question of admissibility.

In that case, the Illinois Supreme Court held that under the doctrine of apparent authority, hospitals could be found vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor:<br><blockquote>Therefore, we hold that, under the doctrine of apparent authority, a hospital can be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a physician providing care at the hospital, regardless of whether the physician is an independent contractor, unless the patient knows, or should have known, that the physician is an independent contractor. The elements of the action have been set out as follows:<br><blockquote>For a hospital to be liable under the doctrine of apparent authority, a plaintiff must show that: <b>(1) the hospital, or its agent, acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital; (2) where the acts of the agent create the appearance of authority, the plaintiff must also prove that the hospital had knowledge of and acquiesced in them; and (3) the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent, consistent with ordinary care and prudence.

Hospital's manifestations</i><br><br>It involves an inquiry on whether the hospital acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual alleged to be negligent was an employee or agent of the hospital.

In ruling that the hospital's manifestations can be proven without the express representation by the hospital, the court relied on several cases from other jurisdictions, and held that:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">the hospital, by providing emergency room care and by failing to advise patients that they were being treated by the hospital's agent and not its employee, has created the appearance of agency; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">patients entering the hospital through the emergency room, could properly assume that the treating doctors and staff of the hospital were acting on its behalf.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In this case, the court considered the act of the hospital of holding itself out as provider of complete medical care, and considered the hospital to have impliedly created the appearance of authority.<br><br><i>b.

His testimony during trial showed that he and his wife did not know any doctors at SJDH; <b>they also did not know that Dr. Casumpang was an independent contractor</b>. They brought their son to SJDH for diagnosis because of their family doctor's referral. The referral did not specifically point to Dr. Casumpang or even to Dr. Miranda, but to SJDH.<br><br>Significantly, the respondent had relied on SJDH's representation of Dr. Casumpang's authority. To recall, when Mrs. Cortejo presented her Fortune Care card, she was initially referred to the Fortune Care coordinator, who was then out of town. She was thereafter referred to Dr. Casumpang, who is also accredited with Fortune Care. In both instances, SJDH through its agent failed to advise Mrs. Cortejo that Dr. Casumpang is an independent contractor.<br><br>Mrs. Cortejo accepted Dr. Casumpang's services on the reasonable belief that such were being provided by SJDH or its employees, agents, or servants. <b>By referring Dr. Casumpang to care and treat for Edmer, SJDH impliedly held out Dr. Casumpang, not only as an accredited member of Fortune Care, but also as a member of its medical staff</b>. SJDH cannot now disclaim liability since there is no showing that Mrs. Cortejo or the respondent knew, or should have known, that Dr. Casumpang is only an independent contractor of the hospital. In this case, estoppel has already set in.<br><br>We also stress that Mrs. Cortejo's use of health care plan (<i>Fortune Care</i>) did not affect SJDH's liability. The only effect of the availment of her Fortune Care card benefits is that her choice of physician is limited only to physicians who are accredited with Fortune Care. Thus, her use of health care plan in this case only limited the choice of doctors (<i>or coverage of services, amount etc.</i>) and not the liability of doctors or the hospital.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, this Court <b>PARTLY GRANTS</b> the consolidated petitions.
