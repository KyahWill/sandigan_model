Preponderance of evidence leans in favor of plaintiff that it is entitled to the issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment. Plaintiff’s evidence establishes the facts that it is engaged in the airline business in Taiwan, was approached by defendant, through its Chairman William Gatchalian, and was invited by the latter to invest in an airline business in the Philippines, Air Philippines Corporation (APC); that plaintiff became interested in the invitation of defendant; that during the negotiations between plaintiff and defendant, defendant induced plaintiff to buy shares in Air Philippines International Corporation (APIC) since it owns majority of the shares of APC; that defendant also induced plaintiff to buy shares of APIC in Philippine Estates Corporation (PEC); that the negotiations between plaintiff and defendant culminated into the parties executing a MOA (Exhs. “C” to “C-3”, also Exh. “1”); that in the second “Whereas” clause of the MOA, defendant represented that it has a current airline operation through its majority-owned subsidiary APIC, that under the MOA, the parties were supposed to enter into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) within forty (40) days from May 16, 1998, the date the MOA in order to effect the transfer of APIC and PEC shares of defendant to plaintiff; that plaintiff learned from defendant that APIC does not actually own a single share in APC; that plaintiff verified with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), by obtaining a General Information Sheet therefrom (Exh. “C-Attachment”); that APIC does not in fact own APC; that defendant induced plaintiff to still remit its investment to defendant, which plaintiff did as admitted by defendant per its Confirmation Letter (Exh. “D”) in order that APC shares could be transferred to APIC; that plaintiff remitted a total of US$7,499,945.00 to defendant; and that during the forty-day period stipulated in the MOA and even after the lapse of the said period, defendant has not entered into the SPA, nor has defendant caused the transfer of APC shares to APIC.<br><br>In the second “Whereas” clause of the MOA (Exh. “C”), defendant’s misrepresentation that APIC owns APC is made clear, as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREAS, WELLEX, on the other hand, has current airline operation in the Philippines through its majority-owned subsidiary Air Philippines International Corporation (Exh. “C”) and the latter’s subsidiary, Air Philippines Corporation, and in like manner also desires to expand its operation in the Asian regional markets; x x x” (Second Whereas of Exh. “C”)</blockquote>On the other hand, defendant’s evidence failed to disprove plaintiff’s evidence. The testimony of defendant’s sole witness Elvira Ting, that plaintiff knew at the time of the signing of the MOA that APIC does not own a majority of the shares of APC because another Memorandum of Agreement was attached to the MOA (Exh “1”) pertaining to the purchase of APC shares by APIC is unavailing. The second “Whereas” clause of the MOA leaves no room for interpretation. . . . The second MOA purportedly attached as Annex “A” of this MOA merely enlightens the parties on the manner by which APIC acquired the shares of APC. Besides, . . . the second MOA was not a certified copy and did not contain a marking that it is an Annex “A” when it was supposed to be an Annex “A” and a certified copy per the MOA between plaintiff and defendant. As can be also gathered from her testimony, Ms. Ting does not have personal knowledge that plaintiff was not informed that APIC did not own shares of APC during the negotiations as she was not present during the negotiations between plaintiff and defendant’s William Gatchalian. Her participation in the agreement between the parties [was] merely limited to the preparation of the documents to be signed. Ms. Ting testified, as follows:<br><blockquote>“Q&nbsp; During the negotiation, you did not know anything about that?”<br><br>A&nbsp; I was not involved in the negotiation, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp; And you are just making your statement that U-Land knew about the intended transfer of shares from APC to APIC because of this WHEREAS CLAUSE and the Annex to this Memorandum of Agreement?<br><br>A&nbsp; Yes, it was part of the contract.”<br>(TSN, Elvira Ting, June 6, 2000, pp. 8-10)</blockquote>Defendant’s fraud in the performance of its obligation under the MOA is further revealed when Ms. Ting testified on cross-examination that notwithstanding the remittances made by plaintiff in the total amountn [sic] of US$7,499, 945.00 to partially defray the cost of transferring APC shares to APIC even as of the year 2000, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>“Q Ms. Ting, can you please tell the Court if you know who owns shares of Air Philippines Corporation at this time?<br><br>A&nbsp; Air Philippines Corporation right now is own [sic] by Wellex Group and certain individual.<br><br>Q&nbsp; How much shares of Air Philippines Corporation is owned by Wellex Group?<br><br>A&nbsp; Around twenty...at this moment around twenty five percent (25%).<br><br>Q&nbsp; Can you tell us if you know who are the other owners of the shares of Air Philippines?<br><br>A&nbsp; There are several individual owners, I cannot recall the names.<br><br>Q&nbsp; Could [sic] you know if Air Philippines Int’l.

The said remittances are admitted by defendant.<br><br><i>Notwithstanding the said remittances, APIC does not own a single share of APC. On the other hand, defendant could not even satisfactorily substantiate its claim that at least it had the intention to cause the transfer of APC shares to APIC</i>. [D]efendant obviously did not enter into the stipulated SPA because it did not have the shares of APC transferred to APIC despite its representations. Under the circumstances, it is clear that defendant fraudulently violated the provisions of the MOA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the Regional Trial Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> In its July 30, 2004 Decision, the Court of Appeals held that the Regional Trial Court did not err in granting the rescission:<br><br><blockquote>Records show that in the answer filed by defendant-appellant, the latter itself asked for the rescission of the MOA. Thus, in effect, it prays for the return of what has been given or paid under the MOA, as the law creates said obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, and the same could be carried out only when he who demands rescission can return whatever he may be obliged to restore. The law says:<br><blockquote>“Rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interest; consequently, it can be carried out only when he who demands rescission can return whatever he may be obliged to restore.”</blockquote>Appellant, therefore, cannot ask for rescission of the MOA and yet refuse to return what has been paid to it. Further, appellant’s claim that the lower court erred in ruling for the rescission of the MOA is absurd and ridiculous because rescission thereof is prayed for by the former. . . .<br><br>This Court agrees with the lower court that appellee is the injured party in this case, and therefore is entitled to rescission, because the rescission referred to here is predicated on the breach of faith by the appellant which breach is violative of the reciprocity between the parties. It is noted that appellee has partly complied with its own obligation, while the appellant has not. It is, therefore, the right of the injured party to ask for rescission because the guilty party cannot ask for rescission.<br><br>The lower court . . . correctly ruled that:<br><blockquote>“. . . This Court agrees with plaintiff that defendant’s misrepresentations regarding APIC’s not owning shares in APC vitiates its consent to the MOA. Defendant’s continued misrepresentation that it will cause the transfer of APC shares in APIC inducing plaintiff to remit money despite the lapse of the stipulated forty day period, further establishes plaintiff’s right to have the MOA rescinded.<br><br>Section 9 of the MOA itself provides that in the event of the non-execution of an SPA within the 40 day period, or within the extensions thereof, the payments made by plaintiff shall be returned to it, to wit:<br><br>“9 Validity.- In the event that the parties are unable to agree on the terms of the SHPA and/or JDA within forty (40) days from the date hereof (or such period as the parties shall mutually agree), this Memorandum of Agreement shall cease to be effective and the parties released from their respective undertakings herein, except that WELLEX shall refund the US$3.0 million under Section 4 within three (3) days therefrom, otherwise U-LAND shall have the right to recover the 57,000,000 PEC shares delivered to U-LAND under Section 4.”<br></blockquote><br>Clearly, the parties were not able to agree on the terms of the SPA within and even after the lapse of the stipulated 40 day period. There being no SPA entered into by and between the plaintiff and defendant, defendant’s return of the remittances [of] plaintiff in the total amount of US$7,499,945 is only proper, in the same vein, plaintiff should return to defendant the titles and certificates of stock given to it by defendant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Hence, this Petition was filed.<br><br><center><b>Petitioner’s Arguments</b></center><br>Petitioner Wellex argues that contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeals, respondent U-Land was not entitled to rescission because the latter itself violated the First Memorandum of Agreement.

A court's purpose in examining a contract is to interpret the intent of the contracting parties, as objectively manifested by them. The process of interpreting a contract requires the court to make a preliminary inquiry as to whether the contract before it is ambiguous.

This argument has no merit.<br><br>Article 1373 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 1373.

It would be absurd for petitioner Wellex to expect payment when respondent U-Land did not yet agree to the final amount to be paid for the totality of an indeterminate number of shares of stock.<br><br>The third paragraph of Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> provides that the “transfer of the Subject Shares” shall take place upon the fulfillment of certain conditions, such as full payment of the purchase price “as reflected in the [share purchase agreement].” The <i>transfer </i>of the shares of stock is different from the execution of the share purchase agreement. The <i>transfer</i> of the shares of stock requires full payment of the final purchase price. However, that final purchase price must be <i>reflected in the share purchase agreement.</i> The execution of the share purchase agreement will require the existence of a <i>final</i> agreement.<br><br>In its Answer with counterclaim before the trial court, petitioner Wellex argued that the payment of the shares of stock was to begin within the 40-day period. Petitioner Wellex’s claim is not in any of the stipulations of the contract. Its subsequent claim that respondent U-Land was actually required to remit a total of US$20.5 million is likewise bereft of basis <i>since there was no final purchase price of the shares of stock that was agreed upon</i>, due to the failure of the parties to execute a share purchase agreement. In addition, the parties had yet to agree on the final number of APIC shares and PEC shares that respondent U-Land would acquire from petitioner Wellex.<br><br>Therefore, the understanding of the parties captured in the First Memorandum of Agreement was to continue their negotiation to determine the price and number of the shares to be purchased. Had it been otherwise, the specific number or percentage of shares and its price should already have been provided clearly and unambiguously. Thus, they agreed to a 40-day period of negotiation.<br><br>Section 9 of the First Memorandum of Agreement explicitly provides that:<br><br><blockquote>In the event the parties are unable to agree on the terms of the SHPA and/or the JDA within forty (40) days from date hereof (or such period as the parties shall mutually agree), this Memorandum of Agreement shall cease to be effective and the parties released from their respective undertakings herein . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup></blockquote><br>The First Memorandum of Agreement was, thus, an agreement to enter into a share purchase agreement. The share purchase agreement should have been executed by the parties within 40 days from May 16, 1998, the date of the signing of the First Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>When the 40-day period provided for in Section 9 lapsed, the efficacy of the First Memorandum of Agreement ceased. The parties were “<i>released from their respective undertakings</i>.” Thus, from June 25, 1998, the date when the 40-day period lapsed, the parties were no longer obliged to negotiate with each other in order to enter into a share purchase agreement.<br><br>However, Section 9 provides for another period within which the parties could still be required to negotiate. The clause “or such period as the parties shall mutually agree” means that the parties should agree on a period within which to continue negotiations for the execution of an agreement. This means that after the 40-day period, the parties were still allowed to negotiate, <i>provided that they could mutually agree on a new period of negotiation.</i><br><br>Based on the records and the findings of the lower courts, the parties were never able to arrive at a specific period within which they would bind themselves to enter into an agreement. There being no other period specified, the parties were no longer under any obligation to negotiate and enter into a share purchase agreement. Section 9 clearly freed them from this undertaking.<br><br><b><center>II</center><br>There was no express or implied<br>novation of the First Memorandum<br>of Agreement</b><br><br>The subsequent acts of the parties after the 40-day period were, therefore, independent of the First Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>In its Appellant’s Brief before the Court of Appeals, petitioner Wellex mentioned that there was an “implied partial objective or real novation”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> of the First Memorandum of Agreement.

In order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitute the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other.</blockquote><br>In <i>Arco Pulp and Paper Co. v. Lim,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> this court discussed the concept of novation:<br><br><blockquote>Novation extinguishes an obligation between two parties when there is a substitution of objects or debtors or when there is subrogation of the creditor. It occurs only when the new contract declares so “in unequivocal terms” or that “the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other.”<br><blockquote>. . . .<br><br>For novation to take place, the following requisites must concur:<br><br>1) There must be a previous valid obligation.<br><br>2) The parties concerned must agree to a new contract.<br><br>3) The old contract must be extinguished.<br><br>4) There must be a valid new contract.<br><br>Novation may also be express or implied. It is express when the new obligation declares in unequivocal terms that the old obligation is extinguished. It is implied when the new obligation is incompatible with the old one on every point. The test of incompatibility is whether the two obligations can stand together, each one with its own independent existence. (Emphasis from the original omitted)</blockquote>Because novation requires that it be clear and unequivocal, it is never presumed, thus:<br><br><div align="center">I</div><blockquote>n the civil law setting, <i>novatio</i> is literally construed as to make new. So it is deeply rooted in the Roman Law jurisprudence, the principle — <i>novatio non praesumitur</i> — that novation is never presumed. At bottom, for novation to be a jural reality, its <i>animus</i> must be ever present, <i>debitum pro debito</i> — basically extinguishing the old obligation for the new one.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> (Emphasis from the original omitted, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Applying <i>Arco</i>, it is clear that there was no novation of the original obligation.<br><br>After the 40-day period, the parties did not enter into any subsequent written agreement that was couched in unequivocal terms. The transaction of the First Memorandum of Agreement involved large amounts of money from both parties. The parties sought to participate in the air travel industry, which has always been highly regulated and subject to the strictest commercial scrutiny. Both parties admitted that their counsels participated in the crafting and execution of the First Memorandum of Agreement as well as in the efforts to enter into the share purchase agreement. Any subsequent agreement would be expected to be clearly agreed upon with their counsels’ assistance and in writing, as well.<br><br>Given these circumstances, there was no express novation.<br><br>There was also no implied novation of the original obligation. In<i> Quinto v.

The test of incompatibility is whether or not the two obligations can stand together, each one having its independent existence. If they cannot, they are incompatible and the latter obligation novates the first. Corollarily, changes that breed incompatibility must be essential in nature and not merely accidental. The incompatibility must take place in any of the essential elements of the obligation, such as its object, cause or principal conditions thereof; otherwise, the change would be merely modificatory in nature and insufficient to extinguish the original obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>There was no incompatibility between the original terms of the First Memorandum of Agreement and the remittances made by respondent U-Land for the shares of stock.

Fajardo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> categorically stated that Article 1385 is applicable to Article 1191:<br><br><blockquote>At this juncture, it is noteworthy to point out that rescission does not merely terminate the contract and release the parties from further obligations to each other, but abrogates the contract from its inception and restores the parties to their original positions as if no contract has been made. Consequently, mutual restitution, which entails the return of the benefits that each party may have received as a result of the contract, is thus required. To be sure, it has been settled that the effects of rescission as provided for in Article 1385 of the Code are equally applicable to cases under Article 1191, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Mutual restitution is required in cases involving rescission under Article 1191.</b> This means bringing the parties back to their original status prior to the inception of the contract. Article 1385 of the Civil Code provides, thus:<br><blockquote>ART. 1385. <b>Rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interest; consequently, it can be carried out only when he who demands rescission can return whatever he may be obligated to restore.</b><br><br>Neither shall rescission take place when the things which are the object of the contract are legally in the possession of third persons who did not act in bad faith.<br><br>In this case, indemnity for damages may be demanded from the person causing the loss.<br></blockquote><br><b>This Court has consistently ruled that this provision applies to rescission under Article 1191:</b><br><br><blockquote>[S]ince Article 1385 of the Civil Code expressly and clearly states that “rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interest,” the Court finds no justification to sustain petitioners’ position that said Article 1385 does not apply to rescission under Article 1191. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> (Emphasis from the original, citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Rescission, as defined by Article 1385, mandates that the parties must return to each other everything that they may have received as a result of the contract. This pertains to rescission or resolution under Article 1191, as well as the provisions governing all forms of rescissible contracts.<br><br>For Article 1191 to be applicable, however, there must be <i>reciprocal </i>prestations as distinguished from <i>mutual </i>obligations between or among the parties. A prestation is the object of an obligation, and it is the conduct required by the parties to do or not to do, or to give.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> Parties may be mutually obligated to each other, but the prestations of these obligations are not necessarily reciprocal. The reciprocal prestations must necessarily emanate from the <i>same</i> cause that gave rise to the existence of the contract. This distinction is best illustrated by an established authority in civil law, the late Arturo Tolentino:<br><br><blockquote>This article applies only to reciprocal obligations. It has no application to every case where two persons are mutually debtor and creditor of each other. There must be reciprocity between them. Both relations must arise from the same cause, such that one obligation is correlative to the other. Thus, a person may be the debtor of another by reason of an agency, and his creditor by reason of a loan. They are mutually obligated, but the obligations are not reciprocal. Reciprocity arises from identity of cause, and necessarily the two obligations are created at the same time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Ang Yu Asuncion v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> provides a clear necessity of the cause in perfecting the existence of an obligation:<br><br>An obligation is a juridical necessity to give, to do or not to do (<i>Art. 1156, Civil Code</i>). The obligation is constituted upon the concurrence of the essential elements thereof, <i>viz</i>: (a) The <i>vinculum juris</i> or <i>juridical tie</i> which is the efficient cause established by the various sources of obligations (law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts and quasi-delicts); (b) the <i>object</i> which is the prestation or conduct, required to be observed (to give, to do or not to do); and (c) the <i>subject-persons</i> who, viewed from the demandability of the obligation, are the active (obligee) and the passive (obligor) subjects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup><br><br>The cause is the <i>vinculum juris</i> or juridical tie that essentially binds the parties to the obligation. This linkage between the parties is a binding relation that is the result of their bilateral actions, which gave rise to the existence of the contract.<br><br>The failure of one of the parties to comply with its reciprocal prestation allows the wronged party to seek the remedy of Article 1191. The wronged party is entitled to rescission or resolution under Article 1191, and even the payment of damages. It is a principal action precisely because it is a violation of the original reciprocal prestation.<br><br>Article 1381 and Article 1383, on the other hand, pertain to rescission where creditors or even third persons not privy to the contract can file an action due to <i>lesion</i> or damage as a result of the contract. In <i>Ong v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> this court defined rescission:<br><br><blockquote>Rescission, as contemplated in Articles 1380, <i>et seq</i>., of the New Civil Code, is a remedy granted by law to the contracting parties and even to third persons, to secure the reparation of damages caused to them by a contract, even if this should be valid, by restoration of things to their condition at the moment prior to the celebration of the contract. It implies a contract, which even if initially valid, produces a lesion or a pecuniary damage to someone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Ong</i> elaborated on the confusion between “rescission” or resolution under Article 1191 and rescission under Article 1381:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, Article 1191 of the New Civil Code refers to rescission applicable to reciprocal obligations. Reciprocal obligations are those which arise from the same cause, and in which each party is a debtor and a creditor of the other, such that the obligation of one is dependent upon the obligation of the other. They are to be performed simultaneously such that the performance of one is conditioned upon the simultaneous fulfillment of the other. Rescission of reciprocal obligations under Article 1191 of the New Civil Code should be distinguished from rescission of contracts under Article 1383. Although both presuppose contracts validly entered into and subsisting and both require mutual restitution when proper, they are not entirely identical.<br><br>While Article 1191 uses the term “rescission,” the original term which was used in the old Civil Code, from which the article was based, was “resolution.” Resolution is a principal action which is based on breach of a party, while rescission under Article 1383 is a subsidiary action limited to cases of rescission for lesion under Article 1381 of the New Civil Code, which expressly enumerates the following rescissible contracts:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Those which are entered into by guardians whenever the wards whom they represent suffer lesion by more than one fourth of the value of the things which are the object thereof;<br><br></li><li>Those agreed upon in representation of absentees, if the latter suffer the lesion stated in the preceding number;<br><br></li><li>Those undertaken in fraud of creditors when the latter cannot in any manner collect the claims due them;<br><br></li><li>Those which refer to things under litigation if they have been entered into by the defendant without the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of competent judicial authority; [and]<br><br></li><li> All other contracts specially declared by law to be subject to rescission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> (Citations omitted)</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br>When a party seeks the relief of rescission as provided in Article 1381, there is no need for reciprocal prestations to exist between or among the parties. All that is required is that the contract should be among those enumerated in Article 1381 for the contract to be considered rescissible. Unlike Article 1191, rescission under Article 1381 must be a subsidiary action because of Article 1383.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner Wellex’s argument, this is not rescission under Article 1381 of the Civil Code. This case does not involve prejudicial transactions affecting guardians, absentees, or fraud of creditors. Article 1381(3) pertains in particular to a series of <i>fraudulent</i> actions on the part of the debtor who is in the process of transferring or alienating property that can be used to satisfy the obligation of the debtor to the creditor. There is no allegation of fraud for purposes of evading obligations to other creditors. The actions of the parties involving the terms of the First Memorandum of Agreement do not fall under any of the enumerated contracts that may be subject of rescission.<br><br>Further, respondent U-Land is pursuing rescission or resolution under Article 1191, which is a principal action. Justice J.B.L. Reyes’ concurring opinion in the landmark case of <i>Universal Food Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> gave a definitive explanation on the principal character of resolution under Article 1191 and the subsidiary nature of actions under Article 1381:<br><br><blockquote>The rescission on account of breach of stipulations is not predicated on injury to economic interests of the party plaintiff but on the breach of faith by the defendant, that violates the reciprocity between the parties. It is not a subsidiary action, and Article 1191 may be scanned without disclosing anywhere that the action for rescission thereunder is subordinated to anything other than the culpable breach of his obligations by the defendant. This rescission is a principal action retaliatory in character, it being unjust that a party be held bound to fulfill his promises when the other violates his. As expressed in the old Latin aphorism: <i>“Non servanti fidem, non est fides servanda.</i>” Hence, the reparation of damages for the breach is purely secondary.<br><br>On the contrary, in the rescission by reason of <i>lesion</i> or economic prejudice, the cause of action is subordinated to the existence of that prejudice, because it is the <i>raison detre </i>as well as the measure of the right to rescind. Hence, where the defendant makes good the damages caused, the action cannot be maintained or continued, as expressly provided in Articles 1383 and 1384. But the operation of these two articles is limited to the cases of rescission for <i>lesión</i> enumerated in Article 1381 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, and does not apply to cases under Article 1191.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup></blockquote><br>Rescission or resolution under Article 1191, therefore, is a principal action that is immediately available to the party at the time that the reciprocal prestation was breached. Article 1383 mandating that rescission be deemed a subsidiary action cannot be applicable to rescission or resolution under Article 1191.<br><br>Thus, respondent U-Land correctly sought the principal relief of rescission or resolution under Article 1191. The obligations of the parties gave rise to reciprocal prestations, which arose from the same cause: the desire of both parties to enter into a share purchase agreement that would allow both parties to expand their respective airline operations in the Philippines and other neighboring countries.<br><br><b><center>V</center><br>The jurisprudence relied upon by <br>petitioner Wellex is not applicable</b><br><br>The cases that petitioner Wellex cited to advance its arguments against respondent U-Land’s right to rescission are not in point.<br><br><i>Suria v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i> is not applicable. In that case, this court specifically stated that the parties entered into a contract of sale, and their reciprocal obligations had already been fulfilled:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup><br><br><blockquote>There is no dispute that the parties entered into a contract of sale as distinguished from a contract to sell.<br><br>By the contract of sale, the vendor obligates himself to transfer the ownership of and to deliver a determinate thing to the buyer, who in turn, is obligated to pay a price certain in money or its equivalent (Art. 1458, Civil Code). <b>From the respondents’ own arguments, we note that they have fully complied with their part of the reciprocal obligation. As a matter of fact, they have already parted with the title as evidenced by the transfer certificate of title in the petitioners’ name as of June 27, 1975.</b><br><br>The buyer, in turn, fulfilled his end of the bargain when he executed the deed of mortgage. The payments on an installment basis secured by the execution of a mortgage took the place of a cash payment. In other words, the relationship between the parties is no longer one of buyer and seller because the contract of sale has been perfected and consummated. It is already one of a mortgagor and a mortgagee. In consideration of the petitioners’ promise to pay on installment basis the sum they owe the respondents, the latter have accepted the mortgage as security for the obligation.<br><br>The situation in this case is, therefore, different from that envisioned in the cited opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes. The petitioners’ breach of obligations is not with respect to the perfected contract of sale but in the obligations created by the mortgage contract. <i>The remedy of rescission is not a principal action retaliatory in character but becomes a subsidiary one which by law is available only in the absence of any other legal remedy. (Art. 1384, Civil Code)</i>.</blockquote><br>Foreclosure here is not only a remedy accorded by law but, as earlier stated, is a specific provision found in the contract between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>In <i>Suria</i>, this court clearly applied rescission under Article 1384 and <i>not </i>rescission or resolution under Article 1191. In addition, the First Memorandum of Agreement is not a contract to sell shares of stock. It is an agreement to negotiate with the view of entering into a share purchase agreement.<br><br><i>Villaflor v. Court of Appeals</i> is not applicable either. In <i>Villaflor</i>, this court held that non-payment of consideration of contracts only gave rise to the right to sue for collection, but this non-payment cannot serve as proof of a simulated contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> The case did not rule that the vendor has no obligation to deliver the thing sold if the buyer fails to fully pay the price required by the contract. In <i>Villaflor</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner insists that nonpayment of the consideration in the contracts proves their simulation. We disagree. Nonpayment, at most, gives him only the right to sue for collection. Generally, in a contract of sale, payment of the price is a resolutory condition and the remedy of the seller is to exact fulfillment or, in case of a substantial breach, to rescind the contract under Article 1191 of the Civil Code. However, failure to pay is not even a breach, but merely an event which prevents the vendor’s obligation to convey title from acquiring binding force.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This court’s statement in <i>Villaflor</i> regarding rescission under Article 1191 was a mere obiter dictum. In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Suntay,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> this court discussed the nature of an <i>obiter dictum</i>:<br><br><blockquote>An <i>obiter dictum</i> has been defined as an opinion expressed by a court upon some question of law that is not necessary in the determination of the case before the court. It is a remark made, or opinion expressed, by a judge, in his decision upon a cause by the way, that is, incidentally or collaterally, and not directly upon the question before him, or upon a point not necessarily involved in the determination of the cause, or introduced by way of illustration, or analogy or argument. It does not embody the resolution or determination of the court, and is made without argument, or full consideration of the point. It lacks the force of an adjudication, being a mere expression of an opinion with no binding force for purposes of <i>res judicata.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Petitioner Wellex’s reliance on <i>Padilla v. Spouses Paredes</i> and <i>Spouses Agustin v. Court of Appeals</i> is also misplaced. In these cases, this court held that there can be no rescission for an obligation that is non-existent, considering that the suspensive condition that will give rise to the obligation has not yet happened. This is based on an allegation that the contract involved is a contract to sell. In a contract to sell, the failure of the buyer to pay renders the contract without effect. A suspensive condition is one whose non-fulfillment prevents the existence of the obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> Payment of the purchase price, therefore, constitutes a suspensive condition in a contract to sell. Thus, this court held that non-remittance of the full price allowed the seller to withhold the transfer of the thing to be sold.<br><br>In this case, the First Memorandum of Agreement is not a contract to sell. Entering into the share purchase agreement or the joint development agreement remained a stipulation that the parties themselves agreed to pursue in the First Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>Based on the First Memorandum of Agreement, the execution of the share purchase agreement was necessary to put into effect respondent U-Land’s purchase of the shares of stock. This is the stipulation indicated in this memorandum of agreement. There was no suspensive condition of full payment of the purchase price needed to execute either the share purchase agreement or the joint development agreement. Upon the execution of the share purchase, the obligation of petitioner Wellex to transfer the shares of stock and of respondent U-Land to pay the price of these shares would have arisen.<br><br>Enforcement of Section 9 of the First Memorandum of Agreement has the same effect as rescission or resolution under Article 1191 of the Civil Code. The parties are obligated to return to each other all that they may have received as a result of the breach by petitioner Wellex of the reciprocal obligation. Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the rescission granted by the trial court.<br><br><b><center>VI</center><br>Petitioner Wellex was not guilty of <br>fraud but of violating Article 1159 <br>of the Civil Code</b><br><br>In the issuance of the Writ of Preliminary Attachment, the lower court found that petitioner Wellex committed fraud by inducing respondent U-Land to purchase APIC shares and PEC shares and by leading the latter to believe that APC was a subsidiary of APIC.<br><br>Determining the existence of fraud is not necessary in an action for rescission or resolution under Article 1191. The existence of fraud must be established if the rescission prayed for is the rescission under Article 1381.<br><br>However, the existence of fraud is a question that the parties have raised before this court. To settle this question with finality, this court will examine the established facts and determine whether petitioner Wellex indeed defrauded respondent U-Land.<br><br>In <i>Tankeh v. Development Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> this court enumerated the relevant provisions of the Civil Code on fraud:<br><br><blockquote>Fraud is defined in Article 1338 of the Civil Code as:<br><blockquote>x x x fraud when, through insidious words or machinations of one of the contracting parties, the other is induced to enter into a contract which, without them, he would not have agreed to.</blockquote>This is followed by the articles which provide legal examples and illustrations of fraud.<br><blockquote>. . . .<br><br>Art. 1340. The usual exaggerations in trade, when the other party had an opportunity to know the facts, are not in themselves fraudulent. (n)<br><br>Art. 1341.

Misrepresentation made in good faith is not fraudulent but may constitute error. (n)<br></blockquote><br>The distinction between fraud as a ground for rendering a contract voidable or as basis for an award of damages is provided in Article 1344:<br><br><blockquote>In order that fraud may make a contract voidable, it should be serious and should not have been employed by both contracting parties.<br><br>Incidental fraud only obliges the person employing it to pay damages. (1270)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><i>Tankeh</i> further discussed the degree of evidence needed to prove the existence of fraud:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he standard of proof required is clear and convincing evidence. This standard of proof is derived from American common law. It is less than proof beyond reasonable doubt (for criminal cases) but greater than preponderance of evidence (for civil cases). The degree of believability is higher than that of an ordinary civil case. Civil cases only require a preponderance of evidence to meet the required burden of proof. However, when fraud is alleged in an ordinary civil case involving contractual relations, an entirely different standard of proof needs to be satisfied. The imputation of fraud in a civil case requires the presentation of clear and convincing evidence. Mere allegations will not suffice to sustain the existence of fraud. The burden of evidence rests on the part of the plaintiff or the party alleging fraud. The quantum of evidence is such that fraud must be clearly and convincingly shown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To support its allegation of fraud, Mr. Tseng, respondent U-Land’s witness before the trial court, testified that Mr. Gatchalian approached respondent U-Land on two (2) separate meetings to propose entering into an agreement for joint airline operations in the Philippines. Thus, the parties entered into the First Memorandum of Agreement. Respondent U-Land primarily anchors its allegation of fraud against petitioner Wellex on the existence of the second preambular clause of the First Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>In its Appellant’s Brief before the Court of Appeals, petitioner Wellex admitted that “[t]he amount of US$7,499,945.00 was remitted for the purchase of APIC and PEC shares.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> In that brief, it argued that the parties were already in the process of partially executing the First Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>As held in <i>Tankeh,</i> there must be clear and convincing evidence of fraud. Based on the established facts, respondent U-Land was unable to clearly convince this court of the existence of fraud.<br><br>Respondent U-Land had every reasonable opportunity to ascertain whether APC was indeed a subsidiary of APIC. This is a multimillion dollar transaction, and both parties admitted that the share purchase agreement underwent several draft creations. Both parties admitted the participation of their respective counsels in the drafting of the First Memorandum of Agreement. Respondent U-Land had every opportunity to ascertain the ownership of the shares of stock.<br><br>Respondent U-Land itself admitted that it was not contesting petitioner Wellex’s ownership of the APIC shares or APC shares; hence, it was not contesting the existence of the Second Memorandum of Agreement. Upon becoming aware of petitioner Wellex’s representations concerning APIC’s ownership or control of APC as a subsidiary, respondent U-Land continued to make remittances totalling the amount sought to be rescinded. It had the option to opt out of negotiations after the lapse of the 40-day period. However, it proceeded to make the remittances to petitioner Wellex and proceed with negotiations.<br><br>Respondent U-Land was not defrauded by petitioner Wellex to agree to the First Memorandum of Agreement. To constitute fraud under Article 1338, the words and machinations must have been so insidious or deceptive that the party induced to enter into the contract would not have agreed to be bound by its terms if that party had an opportunity to be aware of the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup><br><br>Respondent U-Land was already aware that APC was not a subsidiary of APIC after the 40-day period. Still, it agreed to be bound by the First Memorandum of Agreement by making the remittances from June 30 to September 25, 1998.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> Thus, petitioner Wellex’s failure to inform respondent U-Land that APC was not a subsidiary of APIC when the First Memorandum of Agreement was being executed did not constitute fraud.<br><br>However, the absence of fraud does not mean that petitioner Wellex is free of culpability. By failing to inform respondent U-Land that APC was not yet a subsidiary of APIC at the time of the execution of the First Memorandum of Agreement, petitioner Wellex violated Article 1159 of the Civil Code. Article 1159 reads:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 1159. Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.</blockquote><br>In<i> Ochoa v. Apeta,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> this court defined good faith:<br><br><blockquote>Good faith is an intangible and abstract quality with no technical meaning or statutory definition, and it encompasses, among other things, an honest belief, the absence of malice and the absence of design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage. It implies honesty of intention, and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry. The essence of good faith lies in an honest belief in the validity of one’s right, ignorance of a superior claim and absence of intention to overreach another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>It was incumbent upon petitioner Wellex to negotiate the terms of the pending share purchase agreement in good faith. This duty included providing a full disclosure of the nature of the ownership of APIC in APC. Unilaterally compelling respondent U-Land to remit money to finalize the transactions indicated in the Second Memorandum of Agreement cannot constitute good faith.<br><br>The absence of fraud in a transaction does not mean that rescission under Article 1191 is not proper. This case is not an action to declare the First Memorandum of Agreement null and void due to fraud at the inception of the contract or <i>dolo causante</i>. This case is not an action for fraud based on Article 1381 of the Civil Code. Rescission or resolution under Article 1191 is predicated on the failure of one of the parties in a reciprocal obligation to fulfill the prestation as required by that obligation. It is not based on vitiation of consent through fraudulent misrepresentations.<br><br><b><center>VII</center><br>Respondent U-Land was not bound <br>to pay the US$3 million under the<br>joint development agreement</b><br><br>The alleged failure of respondent U-Land to pay the amount of US$3 million to petitioner Wellex does not justify the actions of the latter in refusing to return the US$7,499,945.00.<br><br>Article 1374 of the Civil Code provides that:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 1374. The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.</blockquote><br>The execution of the joint development agreement was contingent on the execution of the share purchase agreement. This is provided for in Section 4 of the First Memorandum of Agreement, which stated that the execution of the two agreements is “[s]imultaneous.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> Thus, the failure of the share purchase agreement’s execution would necessarily mean the failure of the joint development agreement’s execution.<br><br>Section 9 of the First Memorandum of Agreement provides that should the parties fail to execute the agreement, they would be released from their mutual obligations. Had respondent U-Land paid the US$3 million and petitioner Wellex delivered the 57,000,000 PEC shares for the purpose of the joint development agreement, they would have been obligated to return these to each other.<br><br>Section 4 and Section 9 of the First Memorandum of Agreement must be interpreted together. Since the parties were unable to agree on a final share purchase agreement and there was no exchange of money or shares of stock due to the continuing negotiations, respondent U-Land was no longer obliged to provide the money for the real estate development projects. The payment of the US$3 million was for pursuing the real estate development projects under the joint development agreement. There being no joint development agreement, the obligation to deliver the US$3 million and the delivery of the PEC shares for that purpose were no longer incumbent upon the parties.<br><br><b><center>VIII</center><br>Respondent U-Land was not <br>obligated to exhaust the “securities”<br>given by petitioner Wellex</b><br><br>Contrary to petitioner Wellex’s assertion, there is no obligation on the part of respondent U-Land to exhaust the “securities” given by petitioner Wellex. No such meeting of the minds to create a guarantee or surety or any other form of security exists. The principal obligation is not a loan or an obligation subject to the conditions of sureties or guarantors under the Civil Code. Thus, there is no need to exhaust the securities given to respondent U-Land, and there is no need for a legal condition where respondent U-Land should pursue other remedies.<br><br>Neither petitioner Wellex nor respondent U-Land stated that there was already a transfer of ownership of the shares of stock or the land titles.
