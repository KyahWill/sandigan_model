Case No. 6464 merely focused on the compliance with the substantiation requirements, which particularly ruled that the evidence submitted by petitioner to prove its zero-rated sales were insufficient so as to entitle it to the issuance of a TCC.&nbsp; The same findings were adopted and affirmed <i>in toto</i> by the CTA <i>En Banc </i>in the assailed 20 August 2008 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>While it is true that the substantiation requirements in establishing a refund claim is a valid issue, the Court finds it imperative to first and foremost determine whether or not the CTA properly acquired jurisdiction over petitioner’s claim covering taxable year 2000, taking into consideration the timeliness of the filing of its judicial claim pursuant to Section 112 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and consistent with the pronouncements made in the <i>San Roque </i>case.&nbsp; Clearly, the claim of petitioner for the TCC can proceed only upon compliance with the aforesaid jurisdictional requirement.<br><br>Relevant to the foregoing, Section 7 of R.A.
