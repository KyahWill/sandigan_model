They justify the separate filing of the Motion as a right granted by Article 2, paragraph (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> independent of "the power of the Public Prosecutors to prosecute [a] criminal case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>Article 2, paragraph (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: &nbsp;<br><br><blockquote>3. Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity;<br><br>(b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy;<br><br>(c) To ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br></blockquote><br>There is no need to discuss whether this provision has attained customary status, since under treaty law, the Philippines, as a State Party,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> is obligated to comply with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> However, petitioners went too far in their interpretation, ignoring completely the nature of the obligation contemplated by the provision in an attempt to justify their failure to comply with a domestic procedural rule aimed to protect a human right in a proceeding, albeit that of the adverse party.<br><br>On March 29, 2004, the United Nations Human Rights Committee issued General Comment No. 31,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> which pertained to the nature of the general legal obligations imposed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on State Parties. On Article 2, paragraph (3), the General Comment states:<br><br><blockquote>15. <i><b>Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights[,] States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights</b></i>. Such remedies should be appropriately adapted so as to take account of the special vulnerability of certain categories of person, including in particular children. The Committee attaches importance to States Parties' <i><b>establishing appropriate judicial and administrative mechanisms for addressing claims of rights violations under domestic law.</b></i> The Committee notes that the enjoyment of the rights recognized under the Covenant can be effectively assured by the judiciary in many different ways, including direct applicability of the Covenant, application of comparable constitutional or other provisions of law, or the interpretive effect of the Covenant in the application of national law. Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end. A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.<br><br>16. Article 2, paragraph 3, <i><b>requires that States Parties make reparation to individuals whose Covenant rights have been violated</b></i>. Without reparation to individuals whose Covenant rights have been violated, the obligation to provide an effective remedy, which is central to the efficacy of article 2, paragraph 3, is not discharged. In addition to the explicit reparation required by articles 9, paragraph 5, and 14, paragraph 6, the Committee considers that the Covenant generally entails appropriate compensation. The Committee notes that, where appropriate, reparation can involve restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public memorials, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices, as well as bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The obligation contemplated by Article 2, paragraph (3) is for the State Party to establish a system of accessible and effective remedies through judicial and administrative mechanisms. The present trial of Pemberton, to which petitioner, Marilou S. Laude, is included as a private complainant, indicates that there is a legal system of redress for violated rights. That petitioners chose to act on their own, in total disregard of the mechanism for criminal proceedings established by this court, should not be tolerated under the guise of a claim to justice. This is especially in light of petitioners' decision to furnish the accused in the case a copy of her Motion only during the hearing. Upholding human rights pertaining to access to justice cannot be eschewed to rectify an important procedural deficiency that was not difficult to comply with. Human rights are not a monopoly of petitioners. The accused also enjoys the protection of these rights.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>The conformity of the Public Prosecutor to the Urgent Motion to Compel the Armed Forces of the Philippines to Surrender Custody of Accused to the Olongapo City Jail is not a mere "superfluity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> In <i>Jimenez v. Sorongon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> this court held that in criminal cases, the People is the real party in interest, which means allowing a private complainant to pursue a criminal action on his own is a rare exception:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i><b>Procedural law basically mandates that "[ajll criminal actions commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of a public prosecutor.</b></i>" In appeals of criminal cases before the CA and before this Court, the OSG is the appellate counsel of the People. . . .<br>. . . .<br><br><i><b>The People is the real party in interest in a criminal case and only the OSG can represent the People in criminal proceedings pending in the CA or in this Court. This ruling has been repeatedly stressed in several cases and continues to be the controlling doctrine.<br><br>While there may be rare occasions when the offended party may be allowed to pursue the criminal action on his own behalf (as when there is a denial of due process), this exceptional circumstance does not apply in the present case.</b></i><br><br>In this case, the petitioner has no legal personality to assail the dismissal of the criminal case since the main issue raised by the petitioner involved the criminal aspect of the case, i.e., the existence of probable cause. The petitioner did not appeal to protect his alleged pecuniary interest as an offended party of the crime, but to cause the reinstatement of the criminal action against the respondents. This involves the right to prosecute which pertains exclusively to the People, as represented by the OSG.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In this case, petitioners have not shown why the Motion may be allowed to fall under the exception. The alleged grave abuse of discretion of the Public Prosecutor was neither clearly pleaded nor argued. The duty and authority to prosecute the criminal aspects of this case, including the custody issue, are duly lodged in the Public Prosecutor. Her refusal to give her conforme to the Motion is an act well within the bounds of her position. That petitioners used as bases newspaper articles for claiming that the Public Prosecutor acted contrary to the position of Secretary De Lima cannot be given weight. Public respondents are correct in asserting that the proper remedy would have been for petitioners to have the act reversed by Secretary De Lima through proper legal venues.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Finally, petitioners argue that the Visiting Forces Agreement should be declared "unconstitutional insofar as it impairs the . . . power of the Supreme Court[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> They advance this argument in the context of their Motion to place Pemberton under the custody of Philippine authorities while the case is being tried,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> with their prayer in this Petition phrased thus:<br><br><blockquote>(b) Declare the VFA unconstitutional insofar as it impairs the constitutional power of the Supreme Court to promulgate rules for practice before it, including the Rules of Criminal Procedure[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></blockquote><br>The constitutionality of an official act may be the subject of judicial review, provided the matter is not raised collaterally. In <i>Planters Products, Inc. v. Fertiphil Corporation</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Judicial review of official acts on the ground of unconstitutionality may be sought or availed of through any of the actions cognizable by courts of justice, not necessarily in a suit for declaratory relief. . . <i><b>The constitutional issue, however, (a) must be properly raised and presented in the case, and (b) its resolution is necessary to a determination of the case, i.e., the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota presented.</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The constitutionality of the Visiting Forces Agreement is not the lis mota of this Petition. Petitioners started their Petition with a claim that their right to access to justice was violated, but ended it with a prayer for a declaration of the Visiting Forces Agreement's unconstitutionality. They attempt to create the connection between the two by asserting that the Visiting Forces Agreement prevents the transfer of Pemberton to Olongapo City Jail, which allegedly is tantamount to the impairment of this court's authority.<br><br>First, this Petition is not the proper venue to rule on the issue of whether the Visiting Forces Agreement transgresses the judicial authority of this court to promulgate rules pertaining to criminal cases. Second, the issues of criminal jurisdiction and custody during trial as contained in the Visiting Forces Agreement were discussed in <i>Nicolas v. Secretary Romulo, et al:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The VFA being a valid and binding agreement, the parties are required as a matter of international law to abide by its terms and provisions.<br><br>The VFA provides that in cases of offenses committed by the members of the US Armed Forces in the Philippines, the following rules apply:<br><blockquote><center>Article V <br>Criminal Jurisdiction<br>xxx&nbsp; xxx&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>6. The custody of any United States personnel over whom the Philippines is to exercise jurisdiction shall immediately reside with United States military authorities, if they so request, from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings. United States military authorities shall, upon formal notification by the Philippine authorities and without delay, make such personnel available to those authorities in time for any investigative or judicial proceedings relating to the offense with which the person has been charged. In extraordinary cases, the Philippine Government shall present its position to the United States Government regarding custody, which the United States Government shall take into full account. In the event Philippine judicial proceedings are not completed within one year, the United States shall be relieved of any obligations under this paragraph. The one year period will not include the time necessary to appeal. Also, the one year period will not include any time during which scheduled trial procedures are delayed because United States authorities, after timely notification by Philippine authorities to arrange for the presence of the accused, fail to do so.<br></blockquote>Petitioners contend that these undertakings violate another provision of the Constitution, namely, that providing for the exclusive power of this Court to adopt rules of procedure for all courts in the Philippines (Art. VIII, Sec. 5[5]). They argue that to allow the transfer of custody of an accused to a foreign power is to provide for a different rule of procedure for that accused, which also violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution (Art. Ill, Sec. 1. [sic]).<br><br>Again, this Court finds no violation of the Constitution.<br><br><i><b>The equal protection clause is not violated, because there is a substantial basis for a different treatment of a member of a foreign military armed forces allowed to enter our territory and all other accused.</b></i><br><br>The rule in international law is that a foreign armed forces allowed to enter one's territory is immune from local jurisdiction, except to the extent agreed upon. The Status of Forces Agreements involving foreign military units around the world vary in terms and conditions, according to the situation of the parties involved, and reflect their bargaining power. But the principle remains, <i>i.e.</i>, the receiving State can exercise jurisdiction over the forces of the sending State only to the extent agreed upon by the parties.<br><br><i><b>As a result, the situation involved is not one in which the power of this Court to adopt rules of procedure is curtailed or violated, but rather one in which, as is normally encountered around the world, the laws (including rules of procedure) of one State do not extend or apply — except to the extent agreed upon — to subjects of another State due to the recognition of extraterritorial immunity given to such bodies as visiting foreign armed forces.<br><br>Nothing in the Constitution prohibits such agreements recognizing immunity from jurisdiction or some aspects of jurisdiction (such as custody), in relation to long-recognized subjects of such immunity like Heads of State, diplomats and members of the armed forces contingents of a foreign State allowed to enter another State's territory. On the contrary, the Constitution states that the Philippines adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land. (Art. II, Sec. 2).<br><br>Applying, however, the provisions of VFA, the Court finds that there is a different treatment when it comes to detention as against custody.</b></i> The moment the accused has to be detained, <i>e.g.</i>, after conviction, the rule that governs is the following provision of the VFA:<br><blockquote><center>Article V <br>Criminal Jurisdiction<br>xxx&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>Sec. 10. The confinement or detention by Philippine authorities of United States personnel shall be carried out in facilities agreed on by appropriate Philippines and United States authorities. United States personnel serving sentences in the Philippines shall have the right to visits and material assistance.</blockquote><i><b>It is clear that the parties to the VFA recognized the difference between custody during the trial and detention after conviction, because they provided for a specific arrangement to cover detention. And this specific arrangement clearly states not only that the detention shall be carried out in facilities agreed on by authorities of both parties, but also that the detention shall be "by Philippine authorities."</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br><i>In any case, Pemberton is confined, while undergoing trial, in Camp Aguinaldo, which by petitioners' own description is the "General Head Quarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines</i>[.] "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> <i>Their claim that the detention facility is under the "control, supervisionfj and jurisdiction of American military authorities</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> <i>is not substantiated.</i><br><br>Petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a writ of mandatory injunction to compel public respondents to turn over the custody of Pemberton "from American military authorities to the OLONGAPO CITY JAIL"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> is likewise denied for lack of merit.
