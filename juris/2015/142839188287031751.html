A petition under Rule 64 may prosper only after a finding that the administrative agency committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Not all errors of the Commission on Audit is reviewable by this court. Thus,<br><br><blockquote>A Rule 65 petition is a unique and special rule because it commands limited review of the question raised. As an <i>extraordinary remedy</i>, its purpose is simply to keep the public respondent within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to relieve the petitioner from the public respondent’s arbitrary acts. In this review, the Court is confined <i>solely</i> to questions of jurisdiction whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. . . .<br><br>The limitation of the Court’s power of review over COA rulings merely complements its nature as an <b><i>independent constitutional body</i></b> that is tasked to safeguard the proper use of the government and, ultimately, the people’s property by vesting it with power to (i) determine whether the government entities comply with the law and the rules in disbursing public funds; and (ii) disallow legal disbursements of these funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>Reviewing the rationale for this standard of judicial review:<br><br><blockquote>[t]his court has consistently held that findings of administrative agencies are generally respected, unless found to have been tainted with unfairness that amounted to grave abuse of discretion:<br><blockquote>It is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws that they are entrusted to enforce. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. It is only when the COA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings. There is grave abuse of discretion when there is an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim and despotism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>We find that no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction may be attributed to the Commission on Audit in this case.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br><b>Position of the parties</b><br><br>Petitioner Maritime Industry Authority argues that the allowances and incentives granted to its officers and employees are not integrated in the standardized salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It relies on the last clause of the first sentence of Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>Section 12.<i> Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation.</i></b> - All allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and <i>such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM</i>, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed. Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.<br><br>Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioner Maritime Industry Authority understands the clause as requiring a subsequent issuance by the Department of Budget and Management so that other allowances or benefits not specifically enumerated in the provision will be excluded. It insists that a circular must be issued by the Department of Budget and Management for a specific allowance to be deemed integrated in the standardized salary pursuant to Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758.<br><br>Since the National Compensation Circular No. 59, the circular issued by the Department of Budget and Management implementing Section 12, was not published, there can be no allowance deemed integrated in the standardized salary rates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It relies on <i>Philippine Ports Authority hired after July 1, 1989 v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> where this court held the following:<br><br><blockquote>However, because of its lack of publication in either the <i>Official Gazette </i>or in a newspaper of general circulation, DBM-CCC No. 10 was declared <i>ineffective </i>on August 12, 1998, in <i>De Jesus v. COA</i>, which we quote:<br><blockquote>In the present case under scrutiny, it is decisively clear that D[B]M-CCC No. 10, which completely disallows payment of allowances and other additional compensation to government officials and employees, starting November 1, 1989, is not a mere interpretative or internal regulation. It is something more than that. And why not, when it tends to deprive government workers of their allowances and additional compensation sorely needed to keep body and soul together. At the very least, before the said circular under attack may be permitted to substantially reduce their income, the government officials and employees concerned should be apprised and alerted by the publication of the subject circular in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines – to the end that they be given amplest opportunity to voice out whatever opposition they may have, and to ventilate their stance on the subject matter. This approach is more in keeping with democratic precepts and rudiments of fairness and transparency.<br></blockquote>In other words, during the period that DBM-CCC No. 10 was in legal limbo, the COLA and the amelioration allowance were not effectively integrated into the standardized salaries.<br><br>Hence, it would be incorrect to contend that because those allowances were not effectively integrated under the first sentence, then they were “non-integrated benefits” falling under the second sentence of Section 12 of RA 6758. Their characterization must be deemed to have also been in legal limbo, pending the effectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10. Consequently, contrary to the ruling of the COA, the second sentence does not apply to the present case. By the same token, the policy embodied in the provision — the non-diminution of benefits in favour of incumbents as of July 1, 1989 — is also inapplicable.<br><br>The parties fail to cite any law barring the continuation of the grant of the COLA and the amelioration allowance during the period when DBM-CCC No. 10 was in legal limbo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>On the other hand, respondent Commission on Audit interprets Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 differently. It considers all allowances as deemed included in the standardized salary except those specifically enumerated in Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The issuance of a circular by the Department of Budget and Management is necessary only for the grant of allowance other than those enumerated under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 in addition to the standardized salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Respondent Commission on Audit relies on <i>PPA Employees Hired After 01 July 1989 v.

National Power Corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In <i>PPA Employees Hired After 01 July 1989 v. COA, et al.,</i> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> this court held that the Department of Budget and Management’s issuance is only for the purpose of identifying additional non-integrated benefits, over and above the standardized salary rates.<br><br>Then in <i>NAPOCOR Employees Consolidated Union v. National Power Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this court stated:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 6758 lays down the general rule that all allowances of state workers are to be included in their standardized salary rates. Exempted from integration to the standardized salary rates, as specified in the aforequoted provision of Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 6758, are only the following allowances:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">representation and transportation allowances (RATA);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">clothing and laundry allowances;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">subsistence allowances of marine officers and crew on board government vessels;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">subsistence allowance of hospital personnel;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">hazard pay;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(6) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">allowance of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(7) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Otherwise stated, the foregoing are the only allowances which government employees can continue to receive in addition to their standardized salary rates. The employee welfare allowance of NPC personnel is clearly not among the allowances listed above which State workers can continue to receive under Rep. Act No. 6758 over and above their standardized salary rates. We must emphasize that Rep. Act No. 6758 does not require that DBM should first define those allowances that are to be integrated with the standardized salary rates of government employees before NPC could integrate the employee welfare allowance into its employees’ salaries. Thus, despite our ruling in De Jesus which thwarted the attempt of DBM in DBM-CCC No. 10 to complete the list of allowances exempted from integration, NPC is allowed under Rep. Act No. 6758 to integrate employee welfare allowance into the employees’ standardized salary rates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent Commission on Audit argues that the alleged lack of publication of National Compensation Circular No. 59 does not affect the integration of allowances into the standardized salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 is in itself executory in that allowances and benefits are deemed integrated in the standardized salary except those specifically exempted.<br><br>Further, the nature of the allowances and incentives in this case is not similar to that of the enumerated exceptions in Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> As held in <i>Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Employees Union v.

It is a cardinal rule in statutory construction that statutory provisions control the rules and regulations which may be issued pursuant thereto.

In <i>Philippine Ports Authority Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 v. Commission on Audit,</i> the Court has ruled that while Section 12 could be considered self-executing in regard to items (1) to (6), it was not so in regard to item (7). The DBM still needed to amplify item (7) since one cannot simply assume what other allowances were excluded from the standardized salary rates. It was only upon the issuance and effectivity of the corresponding implementing rules and regulations that item (7) could be deemed legally completed.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In this case, the DBM promulgated NCC 59 [and CCC 10]. But, instead of identifying some of the additional exclusions that Section 12 of R.A. 6758 permits it to make, the DBM made a list of what allowances and benefits are deemed integrated into the standardized salary rates. More specifically, NCC 59 identified the following allowances/additional compensation that are deemed integrated:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The drawing up of the above list is consistent with Section 12 above. R.A. 6758 did not prohibit the DBM from identifying for the purpose of implementation what fell into the class of “all allowances.” With respect to what employees’ benefits fell outside the term apart from those that the law specified, the DBM, said this Court in a case, needed to promulgate rules and regulations identifying those excluded benefits. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that until and unless the DBM issues such rules and regulations, the enumerated exclusions in items (1) to (6) remain exclusive. Thus so, not being an enumerated exclusion, COLA is deemed already incorporated in the standardized salary rates of government employees under the general rule of integration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner Maritime Industry Authority’s reliance on <i>Philippine Ports Authority Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 v.

Thus:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he Court has, to be sure, taken stock of its recent ruling in <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 vs. Commission on Audit</i>. Sadly, however, our pronouncement therein is not on all fours applicable owing to the differing factual milieu. There, the Commission on Audit allowed the payment of back cost of living allowance (COLA) and amelioration allowance previously withheld from PPA employees pursuant to the heretofore ineffective DBM – CCC No. 10, but limited the back payment only to incumbents as of July 1, 1989 who were already then receiving both allowances. COA considered the COLA and amelioration allowance of PPA employees as “<i>not integrated”</i> within the purview of the second sentence of Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 6758, which, according to COA confines the payment of “not integrated” benefits only to July 1, 1989 incumbents already enjoying the allowances.<br><br>In setting aside COA’s ruling, we held in <i>PPA Employees</i> that there was no basis to use the elements of incumbency and prior receipt as standards to discriminate against the petitioners therein. For, DBM-CCC No. 10, upon which the incumbency and prior receipt requirements are contextually predicated, was in legal limbo from July 1, 1989 (effective date of the unpublished DBM-CCC No. 10) to March 16, 1999 (date of effectivity of the heretofore unpublished DBM circular). And being in legal limbo, the benefits otherwise covered by the circular, if properly published, were likewise in legal limbo as they cannot be classified either as effectively integrated or not integrated benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br>Similar to what was stated in <i>Napocor Employees Consolidated Union</i>, the “element of discrimination between incumbents as of July 1, 1989 and those joining the force thereafter is not obtaining in this case.” The second sentence of the first paragraph of Section 12, Republic Act No. 6758 is not in issue.<br><br><center>V</center><br><b>Additional allowances that<br>may be identified and granted <br>to government employees </b><br><br>Other than those specifically enumerated in Section 12, non-integrated allowances, incentives, or benefits, may still be identified and granted to government employees.

This is also in line with the President’s power of control over executive departments, bureaus, and offices.<br><br>These allowances, however, cannot be granted indiscriminately. Otherwise, the purpose and mandate of Republic Act No. 6758 will be defeated.<br><br>Republic Act No. 6758 was enacted to promote “the policy of the State to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The law lists down the factors that should guide the Department of Budget and Management in preparing the index of occupational services, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>1. the education and excellence required to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position;<br>2. the nature and complexity of the work to be performed;<br>3. the kind of supervision received;<br>4. mental and/or physical strain required in the completion of the work;<br>5. nature and extent of internal and external relationships;<br>6. kind of supervision exercised;<br>7. decision-making responsibility;<br>8. responsibility for accuracy of records and reports;<br>9. accountability for funds, properties, and equipment; and<br>10. hardship, hazard, and personal risk involved in the job.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup></blockquote><br>The factors to determine the salary grades corresponding to each position of a government employee do not take into consideration the peculiar characteristics of each government office where performance of the same work may entail different necessary expenses for the employee. For instance, some employees in the Bureau of Customs may require expenses pertaining to security to properly execute their duties as compared to employees in the Department of Trade and Industry. Republic Act No. 6758 recognizes this when it allowed certain allowances in addition to the standardized salary due to the nature of the office.

In other words, subject benefit is in the nature of financial <i>assistance</i> and not of an <i>allowance</i>. For the former, <i>reimbursement</i> is not necessary while for the latter, reimbursement is required. Not only that, the former is basically an <i>incentive wage</i> which is defined as “a <i>bonus</i> or other payment made to employees in addition to guaranteed hourly wages” while the latter cannot be reckoned with as a <i>bonus or additional income</i>, strictly speaking.<br><br>It is indeed decisively clear that the benefits mentioned in the first sentence of Section 12 and sub-paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 of CCC No. 10 are entirely different from the benefit in dispute, denominated as Educational Assistance. The distinction elucidated upon is material in arriving at the correct interpretation of the two seemingly contradictory provisions of Section 12.<br><br>Cardinal is the rule in statutory construction “that the particular words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the <i>whole</i> and <i>every part</i> of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole. A statute must so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible.” And the rule - that statute must be construed as a whole - requires that apparently conflicting provisions should be reconciled and harmonized, if at all possible. It is likewise a basic precept in statutory construction that the <i>intent</i> of the legislature is the <i>controlling factor</i> in the interpretation of the subject statute. With these rules and the foregoing distinction elaborated upon, it is evident that the two seemingly irreconcilable propositions are susceptible to perfect harmony. Accordingly, the Court concludes that under the aforesaid <i>“catch-all proviso,</i>” the legislative intent is just to include the fringe benefits which are in the nature of <i>allowances </i>and since the benefit under controversy is not in the same category, it is safe to hold that subject educational assistance is not one of the fringe benefits within the contemplation of the first sentence of Section 12 but rather, of the second sentence of Section 12, in relation to Section 17 of R.A. No. 6758, considering that <i>(1)</i> the recipients were incumbents when R.A. No. 6758 took effect on July 1, 1989, <i>(2)</i> were, in fact, receiving the same, at the time, and <i>(3)</i> such additional compensation is distinct and separate from the specific allowances above-listed, as the former is not integrated into the standardized salary rate. Simply stated, the challenged benefit is covered by the second sentence of Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758, the application of sub-paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 of CCC No. 10 being only confined to the first sentence of Section 12, particularly the last clause thereof which amplifies the “<i>catch-all proviso.</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Employees Union v.

In consonance with its general audit power, respondent Commission on Audit is not merely legally permitted, but is also duty-bound to make its own assessment of the merits of the disallowed disbursement and not simply restrict itself to reviewing the validity of the ground relied upon by the auditor of the government agency concerned. To hold otherwise would render COA's vital constitutional power unduly limited and thereby useless and ineffective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup></blockquote><br>The disallowance of the grant of benefits and allowances by respondent Commission on Audit is proper.

The liability of public officers and other persons for audit disallowances shall be determined on the basis of: (a) the nature of the disallowance; (b) the duties, responsibilities or obligations of the officers/persons concerned; (c) the extent of their participation or involvement in the disallowed transaction; and (d) the amount of losses or damages suffered by the government thereby. The following are illustrative examples:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>19.1.3. Public officers who approve or authorize transactions involving the expenditure of government funds and uses of government properties shall be liable for all losses arising out of their negligence or failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family.</blockquote><br>Generally, the public officer’s good faith does not excuse his or her personal liability over the unauthorized disbursement. This court said:<br><br><blockquote>Section 103 of P.D. 1445 declares that expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor. The public official’s personal liability arises only if the expenditure of government funds was made in violation of law. In this case, petitioner’s act of entering into a contract on behalf of the local government unit without the requisite authority therefor was in violation of the Local Government Code. While petitioner may have relied on the opinion of the City Legal Officer, such reliance only serves to buttress his good faith.

the reason why Erlinda Baltazar, petitioner Maritime Industry Authority’s cashier, received high amounts for the allowances as shown in the notices of disallowance.<br><br>The amount given to Erlinda Baltazar is exorbitant especially when contrasted with the other officers and employees of petitioner Maritime Industry Authority receiving the same allowance. The disparity in the amounts given to Erlinda Baltazar compared to the other officers and employees is too substantial to consider her and the approving officers to be in good faith when Erlinda Baltazar received the amounts. Thus, Erlinda Baltazar and the approving officers are solidarily liable to refund all amounts received by Erlinda Baltazar based on what was disallowed by respondent Commission on Audit. This solidary liability is in accordance with Book VI, Chapter V, Section 43 of the Administrative Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Liability for Illegal Expenditures. – Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the general and special provisions contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be void. Every payment made in violation of said provisions shall be illegal and every official or employee authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein, and every person receiving such payment shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the full amount so paid or received.</blockquote><br>The amount Erlinda Baltazar received as allowance for one month should have alerted her and the approving officers on the validity and legality of the grant of the allowance. Good faith dictates that the approving officers deny the grant and Erlinda Baltazar refrain from receiving the amount that is clearly and on its face invalid. Erlinda Baltazar and the approving officers’ positions dictate that they are familiar and knowledgeable of the usual amounts allowed for allowances and benefits.<br><br>As to the directors, officers, and other employees of petitioner Maritime Industry Authority who received the disallowed benefits, they are presumed to have acted in good faith when they allowed and/or received them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>Respondent Commission on Audit failed to show bad faith on the part of the approving officers in disbursing the disallowed benefits and allowances. Further, the officers of petitioner Maritime Industry Authority relied on the alleged approval of the President of the Philippines in granting the benefits and allowances.<br><br>Respondent Commission on Audit said that there were “exchanges of communications between the auditor and Atty. Oscar M. Sevilla, [Maritime Industry Authority]’s Administrator, pointing out to the latter, in letter of April 4, 2001, that continuous grant of the allowances in question would not only contradict the provisions of Administrative Order no. 5 issued by the Office of the President and Budget Circular No. 2001-1 but would likewise negate the objective of generating savings.”<br><br>However, the checks for the disallowed benefits and allowances were issued prior to April 4, 2001.

These provisions do not require that the approving officer must first receive the illegal disbursement as a necessary prerequisite for his personal and solidary liability.<br><br>Thereafter, Justice Leonen circulated the present revised <i>ponencia</i> whose disposition follow the lines of my dissent in <i>TESDA v. COA</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Based on these developments, I submit this Concurring Opinion to the present and revised <i>ponencia</i>.<br><br><b><center><u>THE CASE</u></center></b><br>To briefly summarize the case, Republic Act No. 6758 (RA 6758), which took effect on July 1, 1989, standardized the salaries of government employees. Section 12 of RA 6758 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 12. <i>Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation.</i> - <u>All allowances</u>, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM, <u>shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed</u>.</b> Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.<br><br>Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government. (Underlines and emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>On September 30, 1989, the Department of Budget and Management <i>(DBM)</i> issued National Compensation Circulars Nos. 56 and 59, enumerating additional allowances that are deemed integrated into the basic salary.<br><br>Due to these developments, Marina discontinued the grant of several allowances to its employees. In a memorandum dated February 10, 2000, Marina recommended to President Estrada the restoration of allowances of its employees.&nbsp; The President approved and signed the memorandum on October 16, 2000.<br><br><i>Relying on this approval, Marina restored the grant of allowances and incentives to its employees beginning January 2001.</i><br><br>The COA disallowed the granted allowances and incentives, except per diems and monthly commutable allowances of Marina board members. In particular, the COA held the following persons liable for the disallowance:<br><br><blockquote>1. Elenita Delgado – Approving Officer<br>2. Yolanda Quinones – Chief Accountant<br>3. Agrifina Lacson – Certifying Officer<br>4. Erlinda Baltazar – Cashier<br>5. Myrna Colag – Alternate Approving Officer<br>6. Miriam Dimayuga – Alternate Approving Officer</blockquote><br>The COA held that allowances are already integrated as part of the salaries of government employees under RA 6758.&nbsp; The COA did not give probative value to the memorandum to President Estrada dated February 10, 2000 for Marina’s failure to present its original copy. The COA noted that the Malacanang Records Office did not have a copy of this memorandum. Furthermore, the COA ruled that the President’s approval of the memorandum was insufficient, since a law was required for the grant of additional allowances and incentives.<br><br><center><b><u>THE ISSUES</u></b></center><br>(1) Whether the grant of allowances to Marina employees has legal basis; and<br><br>(2) Whether the approving officers and the recipients should solidarily refund the disallowance.<br><br><b><center><u>THE <i>PONENCIA’S</i> RULING</u></center></b><br>The <i>ponencia</i> explained that RA 6758 provides a new system in the position classification and compensation of government employees. Under this new system, all allowances are deemed part of the standardized salary. However, there are allowances that may be given on top of the standardized salary – (1) the non-integrated allowances specifically enumerated under Section 12 of RA 6758; and (2) additional compensation as may be determined by the DBM.<br><br>Consequently, if the allowance does not fall under these two exceptions, it is deemed part of the standardized salary.&nbsp; In <i>Napocor Employees Consolidation Union v. The National Power Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Court held that Section 12 of RA 6758 is self-executing and the allowance need not be specifically enumerated to be integrated in the standardized salary.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> upheld the disallowance on the ground that the subject allowances were neither non-integrated allowances nor additional compensation allowed by the DBM. Furthermore, the President’s alleged approval of the memorandum would not suffice since it was not a law. The <i>ponencia</i> further ruled that the receipt of additional allowances and incentives contravene Section 12 of RA 6758 and the constitutional prohibition against double compensation.<br><br><b>The <i>ponencia</i> held that the approving officers and Erlinda Baltazar are solidarily liable to refund the disallowed amounts received by Erlinda Baltazar.</b> The <i>ponencia</i> observed that only Erlinda Baltazar received hundreds of thousands of pesos in allowances while other recipients only received a few thousand pesos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The exorbitant amount that she received should have alerted her and the approving officers to the dubious legality of the allowances. These officers should be knowledgeable of the amounts allowed for allowances and benefits.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> exempted the directors, officers, and other employees of Marina from liability. It does not appear from the records of the case that these employees were informed prior to the illegal disbursements that the allowances and benefits were in violation of existing rules and regulations.<br><br><b><center><u>THE CONCURRENCE</u></center></b><br>I <b>concur</b> with the <i>ponencia</i>. While only Erlinda was the recipient of the disallowances among the persons the COA held liable,<b> the circumstances surrounding the release of her allowances, appears to me to be questionable.</b><br><br>From January to May 2001, Erlinda successively received unconscionable allowances from Marina.&nbsp; How this escaped the attention of the approving officers is puzzling and leaves many unanswered questions.&nbsp; The given facts, in fact, raise doubts on whether or not these officers had colluded with Erlinda. There appears indicia of bad faith, if not gross negligence, on the part of these officers among them, the following:<br><br><ol><li>Marina failed to present the original of the memorandum dated February 10, 2000.<br><br></li><li>The Malacanang Records Office does not have a copy of this memorandum.<br><br></li><li>No guideline appears on record as to the amount and the qualifications for the receipt of the allowances.&nbsp; (In the Supreme Court, prior to the release of allowances, the Office of the Chief Justice issues a guideline on the amount and qualifications for the receipt of allowances).<br><br></li><li>Erlinda received P550,000.00, P565,400.00, P561,000.00, P552,200.00 as <i>monthly</i> rice and medical allowance; P139,000.00, P186,000.00, P124,000.00 as birthday and employment anniversary bonus for February 2001; and P835,376.33, P893,910.14, and P877,270.30 as performance incentive allowance. This is in contrast to a few thousand of pesos received by other employees of Marina.</li></ol>Consistent with my dissent in <i>TESDA v. COA,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> I take the position that the officers found by COA to be solidarily liable should be so held for the full amount of the disallowance. Section 43, Chapter V, Book VI of the Administrative Code expressly provides that every official or employee authorizing an illegal payment and every person receiving the illegal payment shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the full amount so paid or received. The non-receipt of the approving officers of the disallowance should not exempt them from solidary liability. Otherwise, the approving officers can easily evade liability by merely ordering or colluding with others so that their receipt of the portion of the illegal disbursement would not be documented.<br><br>Finally, the facts of the case <i>prima facie</i> show signs of irregularities in the handling of public funds – particularly in the release of exorbitant amounts of allowances despite the clear intent of the law to standardize salaries, as well as the failure to produce the memorandum issued by former President Estrada. In this light, and to foster public accountability in government, I highly recommend that we forward a copy of the records of this case to the Ombudsman, that it may investigate the public officers involved for possible criminal and/or administrative liabilities.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
