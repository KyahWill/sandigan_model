The DOTC and the MIAA invited the public to submit competitive and comparative proposals to AEDC’s unsolicited proposal in accordance with the BOT Law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and its implementing rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><b>2.

The Government and PIATCO likewise entered into a series of supplemental agreements, namely: the First Supplement signed on August 27, 1999; the Second Supplement signed on September 4, 2000; and the Third Supplement signed on June 22, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Under the 1997 Concession Agreement, the ARCA and the Supplemental Agreement (for brevity, <i>PIATCO contracts</i>), the Government authorized PIATCO to build, operate, and maintain the NAIA-IPT III during the concession period of twenty-five (25) years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b>3.

The Court also ruled that <b><i>Security Bank </i></b>(member of the Paircargo Consortium) invested its entire net worth in a single undertaking or enterprise in gross <b><i>violation of Section 21-B of the General Banking Act</i></b> (which limits a commercial bank’s equity investment, whether allied or non-allied, to fifteen percent (15%) of its net worth).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Court further found that the PIATCO contracts contained <b><i>provisions that substantially departed from the draft Concession Agreement</i></b>.

The RTC likewise prohibited the Government from performing acts of ownership over the NAIA-IPT III such as awarding concessions or leasing any part of the NAIA-IPT III to other parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Government sought reconsideration of the January 4, 2005 Order, arguing that Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, and not RA 8974, applied to the case since the NAIA-IPT III was not a national government infrastructure project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>RA 8974 is otherwise known as “An Act To Facilitate The Acquisition Of Right-Of-Way, Site Or Location For National Government Infrastructure Projects And For Other Purposes.”<br><br>The Government argued that under Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, it shall have the right to a writ of possession upon deposit with the authorized government depositary of an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation, which amount shall be held by the depositary subject to the orders of the court. In contrast, Section 4 of RA 8974, as a rule, requires the Government to immediately pay the property owner the amount equivalent to 100% of the value of the property based on the BIR’s relevant zonal valuation and the value of the improvements/and or structures, upon the filing of the complaint and after due notice to the defendant.<br><br>On <b>January 7, 2005</b>, the <b>RTC appointed three Commissioners</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to determine just compensation without consulting the Government and PIATCO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Due to these successive adverse rulings, the Government sought to inhibit Judge Henrick F.

The Government asserted that just compensation should only be paid to claimants who are legally entitled to receive just compensation.<br><br>The Government thus asked the RTC’s leave to deposit the just compensation due in an escrow account that shall be subject to the following conditions:<br><br><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">8.1. </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The claimant(s) shall have been held to be entitled to receive the sum claimed from the “Just Compensation (NAIA Terminal 3) Fund” in accordance with Philippine law and regulation, by a final, binding and executory order or award of the expropriation court;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">8.2. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The claimant(s) shall have been held to have accepted or otherwise become subject to the jurisdiction of the expropriation court and other relevant courts of the Republic of the Philippines, by reason of or in connection with the expropriation of NAIA Terminal 3 by the ROP, directly or indirectly;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">8.3. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The claimant(s) shall have executed a valid and effective quitclaim in favor of the Republic of the Philippines acknowledging that claimant(s) against the ROP or any agency or instrumentality or corporation of the ROP, by reason of, or in connection with, the expropriation of NAIA Terminal 3 by the ROP, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">8.4. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The claimant(s) has complied with in good faith any condition or undertaking required from it/him/her by the expropriation court by reason of or in connection with the expropriation of NAIA Terminal 3 by the ROP, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The Government thus prayed:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Pending determination of the entitled claimants, to allow the Government to deposit just compensation less the proffered value in an escrow account with a reputable bank whose senior unsecured obligations are rated at least ‘BBB’ by Standard and Poor’s Investors Service, Inc. or ‘Baa2’ by Moody’s Service Investors Service, Inc. to be designated by the RTC;<br><br></li><li>After depositing the amount in an escrow account, to confirm the Government’s right to fully exercise any and all acts of ownership over the NAIA-IPT III; and<br><br></li><li>To order the release of just compensation, or of any portion thereof from the escrow account to the entitled claimants provided that the entitled claimants have fully complied with all the conditions and requirements set forth under paragraphs 8.1 to 8.4 of the Manifestation and Motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>PIATCO opposed the Manifestation and Motion and argued that the Government could not vary the terms of the May 23, 2011 Decision as well as the Court’s rulings in <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i> commanding the Government to make a direct payment of just compensation to PIATCO. It insisted that the offer to pay through an escrow account is not equivalent to direct payment. PIATCO further denied the Government’s allegations that there were several claimants on the just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Takenaka and Asahikosan agreed with the Government that just compensation should only be paid to entitled claimants. They posited that the Court’s directive in Agan (with respect to the direct payment to PIATCO) was premised on the erroneous assumption that PIATCO was the builder of the NAIA-IPT III. Takenaka and Asahikosan insisted that they were the actual builders of the NAIA-IPT III. Nonetheless, they contended that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the Manifestation and Motion because the parties already filed their respective Notices of Appeal before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br><b><ol start="2"><li>The Omnibus Order dated October 11, 2011</li></ol></b>In an Omnibus Order dated October 11, 2011, the RTC granted the Manifestation and Motion.<br><br>The RTC ruled that it has residual jurisdiction to adjudicate the Government’s Manifestation and Motion considering that the motion was filed prior to the parties’ filing of the Notice of Appeal. The RTC opined that the Manifestation and Motion was akin to a motion for execution pending appeal. The Manifestation and Motion showed the Government’s intent to voluntarily comply with the May 23, 2011 decision which was pending appeal before the CA. Under Section 9, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the RTC has the residual power to issue orders for the protection and preservation of the parties’ rights, and to order the execution of a decision pending appeal. Furthermore, Section 6, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court provides that courts have incidental power to issue orders that are necessary to effectuate their judgments.<br><br>The RTC held that the creation of an escrow account conforms with the Court’s rulings in <i>Gingoyon</i> that just compensation shall be paid in accordance with law and <i>equity</i>. Since the Government had no legal obligation to create an escrow account, it could impose conditions for the release of just compensation in the escrow account, including: (a) PIATCO’s submission of a warranty that the NAIA-IPT III shall not be burdened by liens and encumbrances and an undertaking that PIATCO shall be solely liable for any claims from third persons involving the NAIA-IPT III; and (b) PIATCO’s execution of a Deed of Conveyance of the NAIA-IPT III in favor of the Government. Equity dictated that the Government’s payment of just compensation should free the NAIA-IPT III from liens and encumbrances. The Deed of Conveyance should be without prejudice to the appellate court’s determination of just compensation.<br><br>Conversely, PIATCO had likewise no legal obligation to accept or reject the Government’s offer of payment.<br><br><b>The RTC clarified that PIATCO is the sole entity entitled to receive the payment from the Government. The RTC pointed out that the Court has remanded the <i>Gingoyon</i> case for the sole purpose of determining the amount of just compensation to be paid to PIATCO.</b><br><br>Moreover, the Government did not raise the alleged dispute in the ownership of the NAIA-IPT III during the expropriation proceedings. The RTC stated that it could not take judicial notice of the allegation that PIATCO was indebted to various creditors, apart from Takenaka and Asahikosan, since these alleged creditors were not impleaded in the expropriation complaint.<br><br>The RTC likewise observed that compliance with the Government’s conditions under 8.1 and 8.3 for the release of just compensation from the escrow account pending appeal was legally impossible. For this reason, the payment through an escrow account was not the payment that would transfer the title of the NAIA-IPT III to the Government.<br><br>The RTC lastly ruled that the payment of just compensation through an escrow account shall be payment of just compensation <i>within a reasonable time</i>. Consequently, the Government may exercise full rights of ownership over the NAIA-IPT III upon the creation of an escrow account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of this order provides:<br><br><blockquote>IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, plaintiffs’ Manifestation and Motion is GRANTED in part:<br><br><ol><li>Plaintiffs’ prayer for the court to determine who is/are legally entitled to receive just compensation is DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br></li><li>Plaintiffs’ prayer that they be allowed to deposit the payment of just compensation (less the proffered value) to an escrow account is hereby GRANTED, provided that only the following conditions may be imposed for the release of the money deposited:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>PIATCO must submit a <i>Warranty</i> that the structures and facilities of NAIA IPT III are free from all liens and encumbrances;<br><br></li><li>PIATCO must submit an <i>Undertaking</i> that it is assuming sole responsibility for any claims from third persons arising from or relating to the design or construction of any structure or facility of NAIA IPT III structures, if any; and<br><br></li><li>PIATCO must submit a duly executed <i>Deed</i> transferring the title of the NAIA IPT III structures and facilities to the Republic of the Philippines, without however, prejudice to the amount which will finally be awarded to PIATCO by the appellate court;</li></ol><br>The Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines are hereby jointly appointed [a]s the Escrow Agents for the above purpose.<br><br>Upon payment of the plaintiffs of the said just compensation in an escrow account, this court recognizes the Republic of the Philippines’ right to exercise full rights of ownership over the NAIA IPT III structures and facilities in accordance [with] 2 (c).<br><br></li><li>Plaintiffs’ Formal Offer of Evidence and defendant PIATCO’s Comment and Opposition thereto are NOTED.<br><br></li><li>Defendant PIATCO’s motion for reconsideration with plaintiffs’ comment/opposition of the order of this court denying the motion for inhibition is hereby denied.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The RTC subsequently denied PIATCO’s as well as Takenaka and Asahikosan’s respective motions for partial reconsideration of the above-quoted order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> opening the way for PIATCO’s petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary injunction, filed with the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> This petition was docketed as <b>CA-G.R.

Under Section 10 of RA 8974 IRR, replacement cost shall consist of the construction and attendant costs.<br><br><b><i>$300,206,693.00 as construction cost.</i></b> The CA relied on the Gleeds Report which it characterized as more “particularized, calculable and precise.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The Government’s construction cost did not vastly differ from the BOC and PIATCO’s computed construction costs of $341,954,311.42 and $360,969,791.00, respectively. But the BOC and PIATCO’s computed construction costs were unreliable since they lacked detailed proof that the quoted amounts were directly related to the construction of NAIA-IPT III.<br><br><b><i>$0 as attendant cost.</i></b> The CA stated that there was no need to award additional attendant costs since these costs had already been included in the Government’s computations under the heading “General Requirements and Conditions.” The inclusion of attendant cost in the construction cost was justified since the attendant cost becomes part of the total construction cost once the construction of a project is completed. Based on the Bills of Quantities, the Government provided the following detailed list of attendant costs in the construction of the NAIA-IPT III:<br></li></ul><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td align="center" width="60%"><div><b>Attendant Cost</b></div></td> <td align="center" width="40%"><div><b>In US Dollars</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Design</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Staff and labour</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Insurance</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">PI Insurance</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Consequential Loss</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Setting out</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Health and safety</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Enviro Management</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Design</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Staff and labour</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Insurance</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></td> <td><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">6,439,680</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">10,491,139.54</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">925,210.78</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">2,200,000.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">800,000.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">364,647.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">403,224.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">176,490.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">2,631,100.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">2,590,774.19</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">71,109.77</td> </tr> </tbody></table></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Total</b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>25,293,376.28</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The CA likewise observed that PIATCO’s summarized computation of attendant costs was self-serving and unsubstantiated by relevant evidence. On the other hand, the BOC and the RTC’s computation of attendant costs at 10% of the construction cost lacked factual and legal support. Pegging attendant costs at 10% of the construction cost was only relevant during the pre-construction stage since the costs of the construction at that time could only be estimated. This estimate carried no relevance at the post-construction stage since the total construction costs, including the attendant costs, could already be determined.<br><ul><li><b>Depreciation, costs for noncompliance with contract specifications, and unnecessary areas of NAIA-IPT III shall not be deducted from the replacement cost.</b> The CA reversed the RTC’s finding that the NAIA-IPT III suffered from massive structural defect. The CA opined that the collapse of the portion of the NAIA-IPT III merely relates to “finishing” rather than to “structural” defects. In construction lingo, “finishing” pertains to aesthetics, convenience, and functionality of a built structure while “structural” refers to the very integrity and stability of the built structure.<br><br>The CA disagreed with the RTC’s conclusion that depreciation, costs for non-compliance with contract specifications, and unnecessary areas of the NAIA-IPT III, shall be excluded from the computation of construction cost. Depreciation should not be deducted since it merely measures the book value of the property or the extent of use of the property. Depreciation is inconsistent with the replacement cost method since the replacement cost merely measures the cost of replacing the structure at current market price at the time of taking.<br><br>Furthermore, the market price of a building increases over time; thus, if the construction cost of NAIA-IPT III in 2002 was $300,206,693.00, its replacement cost in 2004 should be equal to or higher than $300,206,693.00.<br><br></li><li><b>Interest</b>. The CA further held that interest shall be added to just compensation as of September 11, 2006. Citing Gingoyon, the CA explained that law and equity dictated that the Government shall be liable for legal interests as a result of the delay in the payment of just compensation to PIATCO. Since there was no stipulation on interests, the CA fixed the interest rate at 6%. Upon finality of the judgment, the interest shall be 6% until fully paid. As of July 31, 2013, the CA computed the interest as follows:<br></li></ul><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="75%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>In US Dollars</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Interest from December 21, 2004 to December 21, 2005<br> $300,206,693*6%</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">18,012,401.58</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Interest from December 22, 2005 to September 11, 2006<br> $300,206,693*6%*268 days/365 days</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">13,225,544.17</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Interest from September 12, 2006 to September 12, 2012<br> $240,768,035*6%*6 years</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">86,676,492.60</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Interest from September 13, 2012 to July 31, 2013<br> $240,768,035*6%*322 days/365 days</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">12,744,214.89</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Total Interest as of July 31, 2013</b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>130,658,653.24</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The CA further ordered Takenaka and Asahikosan to share in the expenses of the BOC.

The Government’s Position (G.R. Nos. 209917, 209731, and 209696)</b><br><br><b><center>G.R. No. 209917<br></center></b><br>In G.R. No. 209917, the Government asks the Court to partially reverse the CA rulings and <b>to deduct from the replacement cost of US$300,206,693.00</b> the following items: (a) <b>depreciation</b> in the amount of US$36,814,612.00; and (b) <b>PIATCO’s non-compliance with contract specifications</b> in the amount of US$113,944,044.00. The Government also refutes the CA’s imposition of a <b>legal interest</b> on just compensation.<br><br>The Government asserts that the CA did not consider equity in computing the replacement cost of the NAIA-IPT III. Contrary to the Court’s pronouncement in <i>Gingoyon</i>, the CA computed just compensation based solely on RA 8974 and its IRR. The CCV of $300,206,639.00 only reflects the valuation of the NAIA-IPT III as of November 2002 when PIATCO stopped the construction of the terminal, and did not take into account other factors that lowered its valuation as of December 2004.<br><br>The Government posits that there are two standards in measuring the replacement cost. The implementing rules of RA 8974 failed to provide a complete formula to arrive at the replacement cost of an expropriated property.<br><br>The <i>first and common standard</i> is the<b> depreciated replacement cost method</b> which measures the cost of replacing an asset at current prices <b>but in its actual condition, i.e., adjusted for age, wear and tear</b>. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting defines depreciated replacement cost as “a method of valuation which provides the current cost of replacing an asset with its modern equivalent asset less deductions for all physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimization” and as “the replacement value of property minus physical depreciation and obsolescence; insurance adjusters estimate the actual cash value of property based on its depreciated replacement cost.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>In other words, depreciated replacement cost adjusts the cost of replacing the actual asset in accordance with the asset’s age in order to take into account the lower economic utility of an asset that is not brand new. As an asset ages, higher economic cost is required to maintain that asset to the level of utility of a brand new one.<br><br>The <i>second and less common standard</i> is the <b>new replacement cost method</b> which measures the cost of replacing an asset at current prices with no adjustment for age, wear, and tear. It refers to “the cost to replace damaged property with like property of the same functional utility without regard to depreciation (physical wear and tear) and obsolescence.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>The Government asks the Court to adopt the depreciated replacement cost method where depreciation is deducted from the replacement cost. The Government asserts that it is an internationally accepted practice to consider depreciation and other forms of obsolescence and optimization in measuring the replacement cost of an asset.<br><br>The Government argues that the new replacement cost method usually applies in cases where the property must be rebuilt. For example, an insurance policy for a house would usually use the new replacement cost method because a house, which was destroyed by fire or other natural disaster, must be rebuilt. On the other hand, an insurance policy for an automobile would use the depreciated replacement cost because it presupposes that a new automobile must be purchased to replace the old automobile that suffered from wear and tear.<br><br>The Government disputes the CA’s opinion that the replacement cost cannot be lower than the actual construction because market prices tend to move upward over time. The Government contends that the replacement cost may be lower than the construction cost if the price of the materials such as steel, cement, and copper used during the construction stage decreases after the construction of the improvement. Moreover, labor productivity and technological advancements affect the replacement cost since these counter-balance inflation. The depreciated replacement cost method is utilized “in setting user rates for public utilities precisely because this standard of value will tend to result in lower prices over time, not higher prices.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>The Government likewise disagrees with the CA that the depreciation adjustment “would irrationally result in [a] book value which continues to be lower and lower over time.” Since an asset must be maintained, the cost of performing maintenance and repairs increases the asset’s replacement cost. Consequently, repairs and maintenance cost counter-balance depreciation. The recognition that an asset depreciates impliedly acknowledges that the owner will spend more costs in maintaining the asset’s utility than on a brand new asset.<br><br>The Government agrees with the CA that depreciation is a cost allocation method and not a valuation method. However, the Government stresses that depreciation is also an economic cost; depreciation thus recognizes that an asset suffers from wear and tear and would require higher cost to maintain an asset’s economic utility. Depreciation, as both economic and accounting concepts, represents cost adjustments to reflect the fair value of the asset due to age, wear, and tear.<br><br>The Government adds that the premise of the replacement cost method is “to measure the cost of replacing an asset at current prices with an asset that has the <b>same economic utility</b>.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Thus, the CA erred when it held that the depreciation adjustment was inconsistent with the replacement cost method for the reason that this method factors in the current market price to measure the cost of replacing an asset.<br><br>For instance, if the Government would expropriate a ten-year-old automobile, the new replacement cost method would compensate the owner the amount of an asset that has more economic utility than the ten-year-old automobile. On the other hand, if the Government would use the depreciated replacement cost method, it would only pay the value of an asset that has economic utility of a ten-year-old automobile.<br><br>The Government likewise insists that the CA erred in not deducting from the replacement cost the construction costs for deviations from the original contract, the inappropriate and defective structures, and structures that were built in violation of international standards.

The Government emphasizes that when the Court nullified the PIATCO contracts, the NAIA-IPT III was <i>almost complete</i>. Consequently, the Government had every reason to expect that PIATCO would build the NAIA-IPT III according to the agreed specifications. PIATCO, however, acted in bad faith in not complying with the nullified PIATCO contracts.

Pursuant to these provisions, the Government engaged the services of Gleeds, Ove Arup and Gensler for purposes of appraising the NAIA-IPT III.<br><br>The Government also argues that the appointment of an independent appraiser would only duplicate the efforts of the existing appraisers.

PIATCO alleges that it incurred attendant costs of $70,197,802.00 apart from the construction cost of $360,969,790.82. It also emphasizes that its consultancy fees are even below the international norms, as shown in the Scott Wilson Report. It also claims that site preparation costs, legal costs in planning and constructing the development, and financing costs form part of attendant costs since these costs are indispensable in completing a complex infrastructure project.<br><br>PIATCO further alleges that its attendant costs are supported by the attachments in its Compliance dated December 14, 2010, including the summary of payments for incurred attendant costs, official receipts, statements of account, sales invoices, endorsements, insurance policies and other related documents, acknowledgement receipts, agreements, invoices, and bonds.

Depreciation is merely an accounting concept that facilitates the standard of decreasing asset values in the books of accounts. It is not a method of valuation, but of cost allocation; an asset may still be valuable and yet appear fully depreciated in the financial statements.

In exercising the power of eminent domain, the Government takes the property on “as is, where is” basis. Takenaka and Asahikosan point out that the Government has the option not to expropriate the terminal. Consequently, the Government cannot base the value of the building on whether or not the building caters to the Government’s needs.<br><br>Furthermore, RA 8974 IRR provides that only the costs necessary to replace the expropriated property should be considered in appraising the terminal. Statutes authorizing the deprivation of private property, as in expropriation cases, must be strictly complied with because these are in derogation of private rights. The Court’s intent in Agan when it declared that equity should likewise be considered in appraising the NAIA-IPT III is to prevent the Government from undervaluing the property and enriching itself at the expense of private parties.<br><br>Takenaka and Asahikosan also insist that a multi-level retail mall is not an unnecessary area.

Takenaka and Asahikosan opine that Ove Arup did not use the 1992 NSCP in the August 2007 Site Observation Report.<br><br>Ove Arup’s finding that the NAIA-IPT III has a potential for seismic pounding is baseless. The terminal is designed and built to address the possibility of seismic pounding, taking into consideration that the NAIA-IPT III is built on Type I soil.

These experts unanimously concluded that the NAIA-IPT III’s design is structurally sound because it complied with the 1992 NSCP, thus, effectively negating the Government’s claim that the NAIA-IPT III suffers from structural defects.<br><br>Takenaka and Asahikosan impugn the ASEP Report. They reiterate that they constructed the NAIA-IPT III in accordance with the Onshore Construction and Offshore Procurement Contracts and the prevailing building code at the time of the design and construction of the NAIA-IPT III. The statement in the ASEP Report that “the NAIA-IPT III may be partially opened provided that retrofitting works are done prior to its full operation” does not mean that the terminal is defective.

Its purpose is to act as some guide; it is not value, however, and the courts recognize the fact that it is not a value of the physical structures. Second, evidence of reproduction cost new is then considered, for it is an element of value of specialty property. In figuring this cost, all overhead expenses are included. These expenses include engineering, construction, management fees, insurance, legal expenses, office overhead, and interest during construction period. Third, from the reproduction cost new an allowance for depreciation of the improvements must be made. This depreciation is a matter of opinion, formed after a physical examination of the improvements as a whole and is generally not based on a straight-line depreciation according to age. Some authorities, however, have not accepted such an item of depreciation and prefer the straight-line method, at so much per year.

Construction or direct costs is also defined as the costs that are “normally and directly incurred in the purchase and installation of an asset or group of assets into functional use.” Construction costs generally take into account the labor used to construct buildings; materials, products, and equipment; contractor's profit and overhead, including job supervision, workers' compensation, fire and liability insurance, and unemployment insurance; performance bonds, surveys, and permits; use of equipment; watchmen; contractor's shack and temporary fencing; materials storage facilities; and power-line installation and utility costs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup><br><br><b>We find the Government’s computation of construction cost to be more realistic and appropriate.</b> As the CA aptly observed, the Gleeds Report is more “particularized, calculable and precise.” Tim Lunt sufficiently explained how he arrived at the value of $300,206,693.00:<br><br><blockquote><b>2.2 Methodology</b><br><blockquote>2.2.1 Stated simply, valuation of any given structure is derived by multiplying the structure’s dimensions, i.e., quantities by a price (i.e., rate) for constructing the works at a designated time and specific location, adding the cost of works in, on, and around the structure, and then accounting for inferior and non-performing works, and rectification of those works.<br><br>2.2.2 I have arrived at the CCVs by carrying out the following sequence of tasks:<br></blockquote>1) Understanding the project as bid and as eventually constructed.<br><br>2) Preparing measured quantities for the major elements of the completed works.<br><br>3) Establishing appropriate rates and prices for carrying out the works at that time in Manila, Philippines.<br><br>4) Adjusting the quantities and/or rates and prices to take into account the extent of non-performing and/or inferior quality works, the extent of rectification and remediation of the Terminal to bring it to Code and making it structurally safe, and 22,193 m2 of ‘Unnecessary Areas’ that was built in the Terminal.<br><br>5) Making provision for the cost of remediation on items which deteriorated between December 2002 and December 2004.<br><br>6) Making provision for the value of depreciation of Terminal 3 between December 2002 and December 2004.<br><br>7) Deducting the cost of rectification to otherwise bring the Terminal to the standards in the Bid Documents, including the cost of building some 63,490 m2 of ‘Necessary Operational Areas’ that was not built in the Terminal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup><br><br><b>2.3 Understanding the Project</b><br><br>2.3.1 I visited the Terminal 3 site between May 9, 2006 and May 12, 2006; May 30, 2006 and June 2, 2006; and June 20 and June 25, 2006, when I held meetings with the Office of the Solicitor General, White &amp; Case, MIAA, Arup, TCGI, and Gensler.

We did not check the drawings for detailed accuracy of the contents in the drawings (i.e., what is within the dimensions).<br><br>2.3.3 Members of my staff also visited the Terminal 3 site between February 26, 2008 and March 11, 2007.

Preparing the Quantities</b><br><blockquote><b>Bills of Quantities</b><br><br>2.4.1 Construction projects are generally priced by construction contractors for the purpose of competitive tendering using a Bill (or Bills) of quantities. Bills of Quantities are defined as:<br><br>A list of numbered items, each of which describes the work to be done in a civil engineering or building contract. Each item shows the quantity or work involved. When the procedure of tendering is adopted (as is usual), the Bill is sent out to contractors. Those contractors who wish to do the work return the bill, with an extended price opposite each item. This priced bill constitutes the contractors’ offer (or tender to bid) to do the work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup><br><br>2.4.5 As noted, it was apparent from commencement of preparation of the CCVs that it was doubtful that the set of drawings listed in Appendix “B” that Takenaka provided were “As-built” or approved. Accordingly, because of uncertainty over the accuracy of the “As-built” drawings, and to avoid preparing Bills of Quantities based on potentially inaccurate information, I opted not to produce full Bills of Quantities to form the basis of the CCVs. Instead, I relied on a “Principle Quantities” type approach.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Principle Quantities</b><br><blockquote>2.4.6 The “Principle Quantities” type approach is common in the cost planning and cost estimating of construction projects. CESMM3 describes Principle Quantities as “a list of principle components of the works with their approximated estimated quantities x x x given solely to assist surveyors and estimators in making rapid assessment of the general scale and character of the proposed works prior to the examination of the remainder of the bills of quantities and other contract documents on which construction estimates or tenders will be based.” This methodology involves the preparation of quantities for the major elements of the construction works where the costs cannot be estimated accurately from historical data, or for those areas which are known to vary in cost due to the quality or nature of the works. The quantities produced by adopting this approach are what I term “Principle Quantities.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup><br><br>2.4.7 Given the serious concerns over the accuracy of the so called “As-built” drawings, and in order to make some assessment of the dimensional accuracy of the Takenaka drawings, we carried out a number of checks of the plan dimensions against our measurement of the physical dimensions of the structures. Overall dimensions (length and width) were checked for a single floor plate in each of the Terminal North Concourse, the Terminal South Concourse and the Terminal Head House buildings. Our checks revealed no major discrepancies in respect of the physical plan dimensions of the drawings against the actual dimensions of the overall building floor plans. We therefore decided to use the drawings provided by Takenaka to produce the “Principle Quantities” dimensions required for us to prepare the CCVs.<br><br>2.4.8 The ‘Principle Quantities’ dimensions produced by Gleeds from the drawings made available by Takenaka (listed in Appendix ‘B’ Drawing List 1) are included in Appendix “G.”<br><br>2.4.9 It is standard good practice for quantities produced as part of the measurement process to be checked by another member of the team who is not connected to the particular project. The quantities we produced were technically checked by another member of Gleeds for consistency among inter-related items, e.g., consistency between floors and ceilings, and to identify any major items not measured. Another member of Gleeds also checked the accuracy of the gross floor area, or “GFA,” calculations for each of the buildings and no significant errors were identified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup><br></blockquote><b>2.5. Arriving at the Rates and Prices</b><br><br>2.5.1 In order to derive the rates by which the quantities are produced to arrive at the CCV figures for this project, it is necessary to establish:<br><ul><li>The period of construction;</li><li>The geographical location of the works;</li><li>Access to the site;</li><li>Any physical restrictions that might impede construction of the works;</li><li>The duration for carrying out construction;</li><li>Database of costs;</li><li>The specification of the works;</li><li>The quality of the works as constructed; and</li><li>The extent of works requiring remediation and rectification</li></ul>2.5.2 All of the above factors have an effect on the CCVs and it is necessary to consider the implications of each to arrive at the CCV figures. General guidance including a number of the above items are referred to in the document titled “Guide to Carrying Out Reinstatement Cost Assessments’ published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in September 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup><br><br><b>3. CCV CALCULATIONS</b><br><br><b>3.1 Calculation of Rates and Prices</b><br><br>3.1.1 The CCVs have been calculated in £UK costs converted to $USD in Manila. x x x<br><br>3.1.2 The basic approach to producing the CCV figures entails the following steps:<br><blockquote>1) Establish UK pricing levels at 2nd Quarter 2006 (£UK @ 2Q06) (the date when the pricing exercise was initially carried out);<br><br>2) Convert the £UK @ 2Q06 prices into £UK at 3rd Quarter 2001 prices (£UK @ 3Q01) (the mid point of construction) using published and recognized indices;<br><br>3) Convert the £UK @3Q01 prices into US dollars at 3rd Quarter ($USD @3Q01) (the currency of the Termianl 3 Concession Contract) using published currency exchange rates;<br><br>4) Convert the $USD @3Q01 prices to reflect local levels of pricing by applying a Location Adjustment using various methods and sources of information to check the accuracy of the conversion.<br></blockquote>Each of these steps is described below.<br><br>3.1.3 First, the quantities produced for Terminal 3 were priced using a mixture of current data in Gleeds’ Database of costs and published cost data, including Spons, and are priced at 2Q06 prices. These costs are shown in the CCVs as £UK @ 2Q06. The rates used are included in Appendix “D.” Support in respect of the reference to the source derivation of each of the rates and prices included in the CCVs are also included in Appendix ‘D’ in the column headed “Rate Source.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup><br><br>3.1.4 Second, it was necessary to adjust the prices to the midpoint of construction. As such the “£UK @ 3Q01” levels to align them with required base costs for inclusion in both CCVs. This conversion is made by using the BCIS All-in Tender Price Indices published by the Royal Institution of Chartered surveyors. These costs are shown in the CCV as “<u>£UK @ 3Q01</u>.”<br><br>3.1.5 Third, the “£UK @ 3Q01” costs were converted from UK pounds to US dollars using an exchange rate of UK£1 = ISD$1.4540. This exchange rate is obtained by averaging the exchange rates recorded for October 1, November 1 and December 3, 2001 (i.e., 3Q01) using historical data from the xrates.com website. These particular dates represent the midpoint of construction which I refer to earlier in this report. The result of this conversion is shown in the column marked “£UK @ 3Q01” in Appendix “D.”<br><br>3.1.6 Fourth, a “Location Adjustment” of the “$USD @ 3Q01” cost is necessary to account for the local cost of constructing in Manila. Local cost data gathered in Manila by members of my team in February and March 2007 was compared directly with UK prices to establish a ratio between the UK and the Philippines. The cost data gathered in Manila was compared on a like for like basis with 1st Quarter 2007 UK prices. The results of this comparison of rates result in the “Location Adjustment.” The Location Adjustments resulting from this calculation which are applied to the CCV are UK£1=$USD0.7576 for the mechanical, electrical and plant elements. The average conversion rate across the CCVs is UK£1=$USD0.5370 or 53.70%.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup><br><br>3.1.7 I double-checked my calculations of the Philippine prices by considering what the conditions in the Philippines construction market were at the time the project would have been bid, and how these conditions changed through to the end of 2002 when works stopped on site.<br><br>During the period of 1995 to 2002 the “Construction Materials Wholesale Price Index” (“CMWPI”) published by the ‘Economic Indices and Indicators Division, Industry and Trade Statistics Department, Philippine National Statistics Office, Manila, Philippines’ showed an average increase of 2.8% per annum.<br><br>During the periods 2000 to 2001 and 2001 to 2002 the increases where 2.1% and 3.4% respectively. The increases are seen to be at similar levels both in the period during which the works were priced, contracts executed and during construction and in my opinion this would have resulted in no material difference to the pricing level of the onshore works submitted at tender stage when compared with the actual cost incurred.<br><br>3.1.8 I also have gathered information from other Chartered Surveyors’ published data which also indicate that the Location Adjustment for the Philippines is in the region of 45%. This percentage is in line with the more detailed results obtained as part of my own calculations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup></blockquote><br>We thus rule in favor of the Government’s position and reject PIATCO’s claimed construction cost. For one, PIATCO made inconsistent statements with respect to the construction cost of the NAIA-IPT III. The Scott Wilson report states that the construction cost of the NAIA-IPT III amounted to US$338.83 million, exclusive of attorney’s fees, cost of the suit, interest rates, etc. This amount is inconsistent with PIATCO’s claimed construction cost of <b>$360,969,790.82</b> in its pleadings. The relevant portion of the Scott Wilson report states:<br><br><blockquote>2.1.4 When Scott Wilson was providing Lenders Technical Advice to the Asian Development Bank in September 2002, the total value of the construction contracts, estimated by PCI at that time, was as follows:<br><blockquote>On-Shore Contract: US$132.35 million<br><u>Off-Shore Contract: US$190.08 million</u><br><b>Total US$322.43 million, excluding VAT</b></blockquote>2.1.5 The contract priceS under the EPC Contracts are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>On-Shore Contract.

In deeds, wills, and contracts, a slight variation in words may mean a great difference in the rights and obligations of the parties. A substantial hazard of inaccuracy exists in the human process of making a copy by handwriting or typewriting.

It points out that a party need not submit the original when it consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time and the fact sought to be established from them is only the general result of the whole. PIATCO insists that the lower courts erred in not giving probative value to the report prepared by Reyes Tacandong &amp; Co., an auditing firm, validating PIATCO’s computation of attendant costs. <b>Significantly, Reyes Tacandong &amp; Co. failed to state that it examined the original documents in validating PIATCO’s computation of attendant costs.</b><br><br>We agree with PIATCO that it need not submit numerous and voluminous invoices, official receipts, and other relevant documents before the trial court to prove the attendant costs that it incurred in the construction of the NAIA-IPT III. The trial court may admit a <b>summary of voluminous original documents,</b> in lieu of original documents, if the party has shown that the underlying writings are numerous and that an in-court examination of these documents would be inconvenient. <b>In other words, Section 3 (c), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court does away with the item-by-item court identification and authentication of voluminous exhibits which would only be burdensome and tedious for the parties and the court.</b><br><br><b>However, as a condition precedent to the admission of a summary of numerous documents, <i>the proponent must lay a proper foundation for the admission of the original documents on which the summary is based</i></b>.

In ordinary trial-type proceedings, a proper foundation for the introduction of a summary may be established through the “testimony of the person who is responsible for the summary's preparation, or the person who supervised the preparation of the summary.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup><br><br>The primary reason for these procedural foundations is that the summary of numerous documents is, in strict terms,<b> hearsay evidence</b>. The trial court should not haphazardly allow a party to present a summary of numerous documents and immediately admit and give probative value to such summary without sufficiently laying these foundations. If the source documents of the summary are non-original, the trial court would commit a grave error in admitting and/or giving probative value to the summary of non-original documents; the evidence admitted would be <b>double hearsay.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[291]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, when a party invokes Section 3 (c), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, he does not similarly invoke Section 3 (a), (b), and/or (d), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.

The December 2004 base value is not adjusted to account for inflation because the items which make up the construction of NAIA3, i.e., the labour, plant, materials, systems and equipment installed should not be paid for at a higher rate (that takes into account inflation) than the rate which would have been paid when they were purchased at the earlier date. Put simply, it makes no sense to apply December 2004 prices to items bought and used in the construction of NAIA3 sometime between June 2000 and December 2002.<br><br>16. PIATCO do (sic) not consider depreciation. Having explained above why inflation should not be included, it is the application of a similar logic which demonstrates why depreciation should be included. In the case of NAIA3 the materials, systems and equipment installed are at least two years older as at December 2004 than at the time they were incorporated into the construction of NAIA3. Their value should therefore be less. The method used for assessing this reduced value is that of depreciation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[322]</sup><br><br>66.

This concept of depreciation is contrary to the GRP’s own statistics which shows a Consumer Price Index for Manila (“CPI”) increase from 107.8 (Aug 01) to 125.1 (Nov. 04), a 16% increase over the period. The CPI is a conglomerate of all consumer prices in the Manila region and includes property values and is published by the GRP on a monthly basis. In assessing such a depreciation value, Gleeds have (sic) taken an arbitrary life cycle of the building and assumed a write off of asset over that period, then assessed the two (2) year depreciation over the period 3Q01 to 4Q04. Whilst we acknowledge that an airport terminal building is something of a specialized asset and appreciation of value is not always in line with the area’s general value assessments, it is still a major structure and appreciation before depreciation (which should be limited to equipment and fittings within the building) should not be discounted. The concept of long term value of an asset on a similar concept is proven out by NAIA Terminal 1, which since its construction more than 30 years ago has maintained a value to this date.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[323]</sup></blockquote><br><b>We uphold the Government’s computed extent of deterioration and depreciation</b>. In the <i>Reply to Tengson International Ltd.

Moreover, Scott Wilson did not question the assumed useful life of the NAIA-IPT III, but agreed that the question of whether depreciation should be deducted is a legal issue.<br><br>Since PIATCO, Takenaka, and Asahikosan failed to present contrary assumptions or estimates with respect to the NAIA-IPT III’s useful life, we adopt Tim Lunt’s computations with respect to deterioration and depreciation.<br><br><b><i>5.b.

They pray that just compensation of at least $85,700,000.00 be set aside through an escrow account or other means, in their favor, to answer for their pending money claims against PIATCO in G.R.

Instead, it created an escrow account in favor of the “entitled claimants” of just compensation. The Government fears that the NAIA-IPT III would still be burdened with liens and mortgages – as a result of PIATCO’s indebtedness to other entities – even after it pays PIATCO the full amount of just compensation.<br><br><b><i>9.a. Takenaka and Asahikosan’s<br>intervention in the case as unpaid <br>subcontractors is proper.</i></b><br><br>The defendants in an expropriation case are not limited to the owners of the property condemned. They include all other persons owning, occupying, or claiming to own the property. Under Sections 8 and 14 of RA 8974 IRR, in relation with Section 9, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, all persons who claim to have lawful interest in the property to be condemned should be included as defendants in the complaint for expropriation:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 8 of RA 8974 IRR</b>. Expropriation. – If the owner of a private property needed by the government implementing agency does not agree to convey his property to the government by any of the foregoing modes of acquiring and/or transferring ownership of the property, then the government shall exercise its right of eminent domain by filing a complaint with the proper Court for the expropriation for the private property.<br><br>The verified complaint shall state with certainty the right and purpose of expropriation, describe the real or personal property sought to be expropriated, and join as defendants all persons owning or claiming to own, or occupying, any part thereof or interest therein, showing as far as practicable, the interest of each defendant separately. <b>If the title to any property sought to be condemned appears to be in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, although occupied by private individuals, or if the title is otherwise obscure or doubtful so that the plaintiff cannot with accuracy or certainty specify the real owners, averment to that effect may be made in the complaint.</b><br><br><b>Section 14 of RA 8974 IRR</b>. Trial Proceedings. – Within sixty (60)-day period prescribed by the Act, <b>all matters regarding defences and objections to the complaint, issues on uncertain ownership and conflicting claims, effects of appeal on the rights of the parties, and such other incidents affecting the complaint shall be resolved under the provisions on expropriation of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.</b><br><br><b>Section 9, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court</b>. <i>Uncertain ownership; conflicting claims. </i>— If the ownership of the property taken is uncertain, or there are conflicting claims to any part thereof,<b> the court may order any sum or sums awarded as compensation for the property to be paid to the court for the benefit of the person adjudged in the same proceeding to be entitled thereto. But the judgment shall require the payment of the sum or sums awarded to either the defendant or the court before the plaintiff can enter upon the property, or retain it for the public use or purpose if entry has already been made.</b> (9a) (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>All persons who have lawful interest in the property sought to be expropriated should be impleaded in the complaint <b>for purposes of determining who shall be entitled to just compensation. </b>If a known owner is not joined as defendant, he may intervene in the proceeding. If the owner is joined but not served with process and the proceeding is already closed before he came to know of the condemnation, he may maintain an independent suit for damages.<br><br>Consequently, Takenaka and Asahikosan are correct in invoking Section 9, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court for purposes of determining who shall be entitled to just compensation in this case. This rule is likewise their proper basis of intervention in the RTC’s March 12, 2007 order in Civil Case No. 04-0876.<br><br>Our ruling on this point does not contradict Section 4 (a) of RA 8974 which provides for a scheme of <b>direct and immediate initial payment to the property owner</b> in cases involving national government infrastructure projects.<br><br>Section 4 (a) of RA 8974 applies only to cases where the issue of ownership of the expropriated property is not disputed. In cases where the ownership is contested; where conflicting claims or interests over the expropriated property exist; or where there are other incidents affecting the complaint for expropriation, the governing rule is Section 9, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. By creating a separate provision applicable only to the latter cases, Section 14 of RA 8974 IRR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[359]</sup> necessarily acknowledged that the scheme of immediate and direct initial payment is not an absolute and all-encompassing rule applicable in all circumstances.<br><br>We are aware of our pronouncement in the <b>December 19, 2005 <i>Gingoyon</i> decision </b>directing the Government to directly and immediately pay PIATCO the proffered value of P3 billion. We rendered the December 19, 2005 Decision based on the fact that Takenaka and Asahikosan <b>were not yet parties to G.R. No. 166429 and Civil Case No. 04-0876 at that time</b>. The Court denied Takenaka and Asahikosan’s motions for leave to intervene in our <b>February 1, 2006 Resolution</b> in <i>Gingoyon</i> for palpable violation of Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court which only allows intervention before the rendition of judgment by the court. Moreover, Takenaka and Asahikosan had not yet instituted<b> Civil Case No. 06-171</b> (the enforcement case) when we promulgated our rulings in <i>Gingoyon.</i><br><br>The RTC’s issuance of the March 12, 2007 order, which is binding on the parties and which allows Takenaka and Asahikosan to intervene in the case, changed the factual circumstances of this case. As an incident in our determination of the just compensation, we necessarily should resolve the issue of NAIA-IPT III’s ownership and the question of who the recipient of the just compensation should be.<br><br><b><i>9.b. The property owner is entitled <br>to just compensation. </i></b><br><br>Citing Agan, Takenaka and Asahikosan argue that the Court intended that the <b>real builders</b> of the NAIA-IPT III should be paid just compensation. Takenaka and Asahikosan assert that they are the entities who actually built the NAIA-IPT III pursuant to the Onshore Construction and Offshore Procurement Contracts. In <i>Agan</i>, the Court declared that PIATCO is the builder of the NAIA-IPT III. The Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>This Court, however, is not unmindful of the reality that the structures comprising the NAIA IPT III facility are almost complete and that funds have been spent by PIATCO in their construction. For the government to take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures. The compensation must be just and in accordance with law and equity for the government cannot unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[360]</sup><br></blockquote><br>This finding is likewise affirmed in our February 1, 2006 Resolution in <i>Gingoyon </i>where we declared:<br><br><blockquote>The Court is not wont to reverse its previous rulings based on factual premises that are not yet conclusive or judicially established. Certainly, whatever claims or purported liens Takenaka and Asahikosan against PIATCO or over the NAIA 3 have not been judicially established. Neither Takenaka nor Asahikosan are parties to the present action, and thus have not presented any claim which could be acted upon by this Court. The earlier adjudications in <i>Agan v. PIATCO</i> made no mention of either Takenaka or Asahikosan, and certainly made no declaration as to their rights to any form of compensation. If there is indeed any right to remuneration due to these two entities arising from NAIA 3, they have not yet been established by the courts of the land.<br><br><b>It must be emphasized that the conclusive ruling in the Resolution dated 21 January 2004 in <i>Agan v. PIATCO</i> (Agan 2004) is that PIATCO, as builder of the facilities, must first be justly compensated in accordance with law and equity for the Government to take over the facilities. It is on that premise that the Court adjudicated this case in its 19 December 2005 Decision.<br><br>While the Government refers to a judgment rendered by a London court in favor of Takenaka and Asahikosan against PIATCO in the amount of US$82 Million, it should be noted that this foreign judgment is not yet binding on Philippine courts. It is entrenched in Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure that a foreign judgment on the mere strength of its promulgation is not yet conclusive, as it can be annulled on the grounds of want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. It is likewise recognized in Philippine jurisprudence and international law that a foreign judgment may be barred from recognition if it runs counter to public policy.<br><br>Assuming that PIATCO indeed has corresponding obligations to other parties relating to NAIA 3, the Court does not see how such obligations, yet unproven, could serve to overturn the Decision mandating that the Government first pay PIATCO the amount of 3.02 Million Pesos before it may acquire physical possession over the facilities. This directive enjoining payment is in accordance with Republic Act No. 8974, and under the mechanism established by the law the amount to be initially paid is that which is provisionally determined as just compensation. The provisional character of this payment means that it is not yet final, yet sufficient under the law to entitle the Government to the writ of possession over the expropriated property.<br><br>There are other judicial avenues outside of this Motion for Reconsideration wherein all other claims relating to the airport facilities may be ventilated, proved and determined. Since such claims involve factual issues, they must first be established by the appropriate trier of facts before they can be accorded any respect by or binding force on this Court.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[361]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Contrary to Takenaka and Asahikosan’s position, in the Philippine jurisdiction, the person who is solely entitled to just compensation is the <b>owner of the property at the time of the taking</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[362]</sup> <i>As shown below, the test of who shall receive just compensation is not who built the terminal, but rather who its true owner is.</i><br><br>From the express provision of Section 4 of RA 8974, just compensation shall only be paid to the property owner. We implead persons with lawful interests in the property in order to determine the person who shall receive just compensation. Note that the last paragraph, Section 4 of RA 8974 states: “When the <b>decision of the court becomes final and executory</b>, the implementing agency shall pay the owner the difference between the amount already paid and the just compensation as determined by the court.” This provision thus envisions a situation where the court determines with finality, for purposes of payment of just compensation, the conflicting claims of the defendants and intervenors.<br><br>The cases cited by Takenaka and Asahikosan are inapplicable to justify their right to receive just compensation. The Court did not award just compensation to a non-owner in <i>De Knecht v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[363]</sup> The Court held in that case that a person who had no legal interest in the property at the time of the filing of a complaint for expropriation had no right to intervene in the case. The Court ruled that only persons who have lawful interests in the property may be impleaded as defendants or may intervene in the expropriation case under Section 1, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. This case thus, at most, support their right to intervene.<br><br>In <i>Calvo v. Zandueta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[364]</sup> the Court stayed the execution of the trial court’s judgment ordering the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan to pay Aquilino Calvo just compensation due to the pendency of the interpleader that Juana Ordoñez brought based on her own claim of ownership of the expropriated land. Ordoñez asserted that she acquired all rights and interests on the subject land when she purchased it during the execution sale while the expropriation proceedings were still pending.<br><br><i>Philippine Veterans Bank v. Bases Conversion Development Authority</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[365]</sup> further affirms the rule that just compensation shall only be paid to the owner of the expropriated property at the time of taking. In that case, the Court held that the trial court may order the payment of just compensation to itself pending the adjudication of the issue of ownership in other proceedings pursuant to Section 9, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The Court likewise did not award just compensation to a non-owner in <i>Republic v. Mangotara.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[366]</sup> The Court held that the filing of a supplemental complaint for expropriation impleading private parties does not necessarily amount to an admission that the parcels of land sought to be expropriated are privately owned. The Republic merely acknowledged that there are private persons also claiming ownership of the parcels of land. The Republic can still consistently assert, in both actions for expropriation and reversion, that the subject parcels of land are part of the public domain.<br><br>The record of the present case show that PIATCO has been the original contracting party commissioned by the Government to construct the NAIA-IPT III based on a build-operate-transfer arrangement and who, in this capacity, contracted out the actual construction to Takenaka and Asahikosan. Thus, when the NAIA-IPT III was built, it was in PIATCO’s name and account, although it subsequently owed sums to subcontractors, incurred in the course of the construction. From this perspective, PIATCO has been the owner recognized as such by the Government although the basis of its contractual relationship with the Government was later on nullified. Takenaka and Asahikosan, on the other hand, had always been subcontractors with whom the Government did not have any formal link. These facts indubitably show that PIATCO has been the owner of the NAIA-IPT III entitled to receive the just compensation due. Takenaka and Asahikosan for their part, have not shown that they possess legal title or colorable title to the NAIA-IPT III that would defeat PIATCO’s ownership.<br><br>To recap and expound on the matter:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, Takenaka and Asahikosan were mere subcontractors in the nullified NAIA-IPT III project. That Takenaka and Asahikosan actually built the NAIA-IPT III does not make them the owner of the terminal building.<br><br>We carefully point out that our finding in this case that Takenaka and Asahikosan are the actual builders of the NAIA-IPT III does not contravene our rulings in <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i> that PIATCO is the builder of the NAIA-IPT III. <b>The word “builder” is broad enough to include the contractor, PIATCO, and the subcontractors, Takenaka and Asahikosan, in the nullified NAIA-IPT III project.</b> Republic Act No. 4566<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[367]</sup> defines a “builder” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9 (b) of RA 4566. “Contractor” is deemed synonymous with the term “builder” and, hence, any person who undertakes or offers to undertake or purports to have the capacity to undertake or submits a bid to, or does himself or by or through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation or other structure, project, development or improvement, or to do any part thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in connection therewith. The term contractor includes subcontractor and specialty contractor.</blockquote><br>In <i>Gingoyon</i>, the Court loosely used the word “builder” and “owner” interchangeably. We clarify, however, that a builder is different from the owner of the property. As we stated above, a builder includes the contractor and the subcontractor. On the other hand, the “owner” who is constitutionally entitled to just compensation is the person who has legal title to the property. Logically, a builder is not necessarily the owner of the property and vice-versa.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, we cannot recognize Takenaka and Asahikosan’s claimed liens over the NAIA-IPT III in this just compensation case. Since G.R. No. 202166 is still pending before the Court, we cannot conclusively rule that Takenaka and Asahikosan are unpaid creditors of PIATCO without pre-empting the Court’s ruling in the enforcement case.<br><br>Even assuming that Takenaka and Asahikosan – as unpaid contractors in the botched NAIA-IPT III construction contract – indeed have liens over the NAIA-IPT III, PIATCO is still the <i>property owner</i> who, as such, should directly receive just compensation from the Government.<br><br>We clarify that the expropriation court’s determination of the lawful property owner is merely <b>provisional</b>. By filing an action for expropriation, the condemnor merely serves notice that it is taking title to and possession of the property, and that the defendant is asserting title to or interest in the property, not to prove a right to possession, <b><i>but to prove a right to compensation for the taking</i></b>. The Court’s disposition <b>with respect to the ownership of the property is not conclusive</b>, and it remains open to challenge through proper actions. The court’s resolution of the title to the land at the time of taking has no legal consequences beyond the eminent domain proceedings. The court’s decision cannot be pleaded as a defense of res judicata or collateral estoppel in any action <b><i>to determine title to the property</i></b>.<br><br>As we explained in<i> Republic of the Philippines v. Samson-Tatad:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[368]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>However, the authority to resolve ownership should be taken in the proper context.

For if valid, said spouses must be the ones to be paid by the condemnor; but if invalid, the money will be paid to someone else. x x x<br><br><b>Thus, such findings of ownership in an expropriation proceeding should not be construed as final and binding on the parties. By filing an action for expropriation, the condemnor (petitioner), merely serves notice that it is taking title to and possession of the property, and that the defendant is asserting title to or interest in the property, not to prove a right to possession, but to prove a right to compensation for the taking.<br><br>If at all, this situation is akin to ejectment cases in which a court is temporarily authorized to determine ownership, if only to determine who is entitled to possession. This is not conclusive, and it remains open to challenge through proper actions.

Zandueta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[370]</sup> the Court <b>did not stay the execution of a final and executory ruling</b> in the eminent domain case during the pendency of the interpleader case.<br><br><b>A close reading of <i>Calvo</i> shows that the order of payment of just compensation in that case was not yet final and executory.</b><br><br>In <b>November 1924</b>, the municipality of San Quintin, Pangasinan filed an action for expropriation of a parcel of land owned by Aquilino Calvo and with a Certificate of Title No. 25100.<br><br>On <b>November 25, 1925</b>, the Court of First Instance <i>(CFI)</i> approved the commissioners’ valuation of the subject land in the sum of P6,943.25. The municipality of San Quintin appealed the case but subsequently withdrew the appeal on June 23, 1926. <i>The CFI approved the withdrawal of appeal on <b>July 20, 1926</b>.</i><br><br>In the meantime, Juana Ordoñez levied on the subject land after she obtained a favorable judgment against Calvo. The levy was recorded on the certificate of title on <b>December 23, 1925</b>. Thereafter, the sheriff sold the subject land to Ordoñez in an execution sale. On <b>January 23, 1926</b>, the sale was duly entered by memorandum on the certificate of title. <b><u>On the same date</u></b>, <i>Ordoñez filed a motion for substitution as a defendant in the expropriation case on the ground that she acquired all the rights and interests of Calvo on the subject land.</i><br><br>On <b>June 29, 1926</b>, the CFI declared the November 25, 1925 decision final and ordered the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan to pay Calvo a part of just compensation. The <b>following day</b>, Ordoñez filed a motion praying for the revocation of the June 29, 1926 order and for the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan to retain the award of just compensation.<br><br>On <b>July 20, 1926, the CFI revoked the June 29, 1926 order</b> and ordered the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan to retain the money until further orders of the court. After the CFI denied Calvo et al.’s motion for reconsideration, they filed a petition for certiorari before the Court.<br><br>The Court denied the petition. The Court ruled that “<i><b><u>assuming</u></b> that the judgment of November 25, 1925, constituted a final determination of the petitioners’ right to receive the award,”</i> Ordoñez was not a party to the expropriation case and, therefore, could not be bound by the judgment. Ordoñez’ claim that she stands subrogated to Calvo’s right to just compensation has the appearance of validity. The judicial determination of her claim may be adjudicated in an action for interpleader which was then pending when the motion for substitution was filed. Consequently, the trial court correctly stayed the execution of the judgment in the expropriation case. “Whenever necessary to promote the ends of justice, courts have the power to temporarily stay executions of judgments rendered by them.”<br><br>Clearly, the November 25, 1925 decision in <i>Calvo</i> was not yet final and executory when the Court suspended the execution of that ruling. <i>The July 29, 1926 order revoked the June 29, 1926 order which in turn declared the finality of the November 25, 1925 decision of the CFI.</i> Ordoñez filed a motion for the reversal of the June 29, 1926 order prior to the CFI’s withdrawal of appeal on July 20, 1926. Significantly, the CFI approved the withdrawal of appeal on the same date that the CFI revoked the June 29, 1926 order and ordered the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan to withhold the just compensation. <b>There is thus no basis to Takenaka and Asahikosan’s claim that the execution of a final and executory judgment on just compensation may be suspended if there is still a subsisting case regarding the disputed ownership of the expropriated property.<br></b><br><b><i>9.d.

Thus, the Government’s <b>commitment</b> is limited to the <b>pursuit of the project</b>; it does not award the project to the original proponent.

Consequently, AEDC had no enforceable right to be awarded the NAIA-IPT III project. Moreover, the nullification of the award to PIATCO neither revived the proposal nor re-opened the bidding.<br><br>The Court also stated that AEDC’s original proposal was to undertake the building, operation, and transfer to the Government of the NAIA-IPT III. This proposal was no longer feasible since the NAIA-IPT III was already substantially built. Furthermore, AEDC was not financially qualified to undertake the NAIA-IPT III project since it then had a paid-in capital of only P150,000,000.00 at the time of the submission of the bids.<br><br>In <b>G.R.

Under Section 12, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, the commissioners’ fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the proceedings. The plaintiff shall pay all costs, except those of rival claimants litigating their claims. If the property owner appeals from the expropriation court’s judgment, he shall pay for the costs of the appeal. According to the RTC, PIATCO should not shoulder the appraisal fee since it is constitutionally entitled to just compensation.<br><br>The RTC also affirmed DG Jones and Partners’ independence. The RTC impartially chose this firm upon a thorough review of its qualifications and upon the BOC’s recommendation. The Government would likewise not directly communicate with and pay the appraisal fee to DG Jones and Partners. The Government shall deposit the appraisal fee with the RTC who shall in turn pay DG Jones and Partners.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC order provides:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Orders dated May 3, 2007 and May 18, 2007 are Affirmed without modification. Consequently, Plaintiffs’ Omnibus Motion dated June 15, 2007 is denied. This expropriation having been initiated in December 2004, the certificate of availability of funds from Plaintiffs for the necessary full compensation to PIATCO, the costs and the expenses entailed in this expropriation is clearly justified and should be submitted to this Court within 15 days from plaintiffs’ receipt of this order.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br></blockquote>See <i>rollo</i> in G.R.

Firstly, we need to summarize the history of this issue to ensure that our position is reiterated and maintained.<br><br>After the appointment by you of your consultant TCGI, we received on 2 March 2007, a 91 page document detailing suggestions by TCGI. This document was issued despite the fact that we had (nor have since) accepted the allegation of defective design and despite the fact that no supporting documents were issued by TCGI to support both their allegations and/or their “remediation” suggestions.<br><br><b>Alleged Structural Design Deficiencies</b><br><br>With the exception of “non-supported” calculations in respect of 26 beams and part of the PT Slab, TCGI have always failed to produce structural calculations in respect of their allegation of design deficiencies, even when requested to do so in order that these may be checked by our design consultants and our structural design office in Tokyo. Despite this failure, TCGI continue to maintain its position on these alleged design deficiencies. In our opinion, if allegations are made, proof must be forthcoming; otherwise any allegations should be regarded as erroneous and should be ignored.<br><br>We have responded in every way and at every juncture, and provided all details and opinions to support our position, yet you, on the advice of TCGI have not accepted our position despite unequivocal proof that our design is safe and in accordance with the relevant codes and standards. We therefore conclude that TCGI’s submission and their position cannot be based on technical grounds.<br><br>We have identified and pointed out to you (and TCGI) inaccuracies in TCGI calculations and documents and as yet TCGI have not been able to refute these facts. They have instead tried to redirect the focus of attention onto discussions regarding the ETABS modeling, which, it is important to note, primarily for the structural model analysis of the shear walls within the superstructure (for the Building Frame System adapted for the Head House and Concourse buildings), for which TCGI have again failed to provide any alleged design deficiency calculations.<br><br>Our position remains the same, and we and our design consultants cannot accept TCGI’s approach on these structural issues, whereby they continue to make unsubstantiated and unproven allegations. We now reiterate that any further discussions on these matters must be subject to TCGI stating in detail what the alleged design deficiencies are, with full and complete supporting calculations for our and Meinhardt’s response.<br><br><b>Ductility (Code Interpretation)</b><br><br>We have repeatedly stated and clarified in detail our interpretation of the relevant Sections of NSCP 1992 related to ductility. We have also provided supporting opinions from two members of the American Concrete Institute (ACI), Dr.’s Ghosh and Mast, which state that our interpretation is correct. However, TCGI have refused to accept any interpretation other than their own. Neither have TCGI produced letters from any ACI members, or members from any other recognized institute, supporting their interpretation of the code. It is worthwhile noting here that the NSCP 1992 code is based on the ACI 318 1989 code and therefore such opinions from these ACI members, as obtained by us, should be taken seriously.<br><br>We therefore maintain that our designs conform to NSCP 1992, (which is the relevant version of the code for this design) and as such the design is safe and sound.<br><br>Regardless of our position, we have, as a gesture of goodwill, and in an attempt to solve the structural issue, proposed beam enhancement to strengthen the structure, even though we maintain that this is not necessary. Even with this proposal submitted, TCGI continue to question our design professionalism and we understand their advice, you have not as yet accepted this proposal, even though the enhancement would strengthen the building structure. The final version of this proposal is still open to acceptance by you.<br><br><b>PT Slabs</b><br><br>Again, TCGI has made allegations of design deficiencies in this design, without providing substantiation and/or proof of the same, and with the provision of only half the required design calculations. However, we have provided our design calculations for level 2 sector 3, (from our D&amp;C contractor, BBR) which prove there is no design deficiency. BBR has also provided further calculations to show the impact of “overstressing” the PT Slab, and these calculations again prove the adequacy of the design. Yet TCGI continue to make these allegations.<br><br>Furthermore, our proposal to carry out load tests on specific slabs, which as TCGI has pointed out have some visible “cracking”, has been presented on the basis of testing the worst affected slabs, thus proving that if these worst slabs pass the load test, all others by definition would pass the same test. Therefore we see no need to carry out 14 tests as suggested by TCGI, and still consider 2 tests more than adequate, even though we will add another 9 tests (Maximum) as a gesture of goodwill.<br><br><b>General<br></b><br>Finally, we would make some general points and state a few additional facts and observations:<br><br>Both Meinhardt and ourselves have given you adequate design guarantees which you may call upon in the event of any proven design deficiencies. These guarantees are comprehensive and long standing and both parties shoulder a heavy responsibility by issuing these documents especially Takenaka who have a single point responsibility to MIAA and the DOTC.<br><br>In Arup’s letter to you ref: 131269/RVM/08-0023, dated 15 January 2008, they have described the procedure which is outlined n NSCP 1992, in respect of the required calculations for ductility and structural deformation compatibility. What they fail to state is whether TCGI’s interpretation of NSCP 1992 is correct or not, or whether our interpretation is correct or not. They have also made reference to ACI 318 1995, which is not a national code, neither is it one representing the basis of the design. They have failed to conclude this issue even with their own opinion, and we therefore concluded that they cannot state unequivocally that our interpretation of NSCP 1992 is incorrect, a point we have made on numerous occasions in the past.<br><br>Both ourselves and Meinhardt have presented all design details and an ETABS modeling presentation to you and TCGI. We have requested on numerous occasions that TCGI present their version of the same calculations and ETABS modeling, without success, with TCGI unable or unwilling to present the same, even though you, as the Employer, have instructed them to do so several times. We now have a “request” (demand) from TCGI to make yet another design and modeling presentation and have had the audacity to present us with their RULES for this presentation, even requiring that we allow filming and photography of the proceedings. This is totally unacceptable. We have therefore concluded that there will be no further presentation to TCGI whilst their attitude remains unchanged, and unless they provide us with full supporting calculations to substantiate their allegations, and even in that event neither Takenaka nor Meinhardt will accept or be subjected to any “rules” for any future presentation, which have been presented recently by TCGI.<br><br>We again refer you to the Clause 4.5 of the General Framework Agreement, (GFA) (dated 6 September 2005) which confirms that we have no obligation to approve or confirm your consultant’s findings and we have no obligation to be bound by the same. Despite this “no obligation” and despite our position regarding the correctness and safety of the design, we have over the past 9 months discussed various possibilities and scenarios, have submitted numerous presentations and compromise documents and other calculations, and spent large amounts of money to try and convince you and your consultant that our position is correct, where in fact we had no need to do so. If TCGI continue with their present unsubstantiated position we may find our position untenable and would need to discuss our future position on this project with our Senior Management in Tokyo. We also remind you that any design and/or works done by any third party on the Terminal 3 structure would invalidate any single point responsibility and any guarantees we or Meinhardt have given you.<br><br>See RTC <i>rollo,</i> Volume 32-R, pp. 26-28.

The CPI is used in calculating the inflation rate and purchasing power of the peso. The inflation rate is defined as the annual rate of change or the year-on-year change in the CPI. It is the rate of change in the average price level between two periods. The purchasing power of the peso shows how much the peso in the base period is worth in the current period. It is computed as the reciprocal of the CPI for the period under review multiplied by 100.<br><br>See Consumer Price Index, Inflation and Purchasing Power of the Peso, http://www.bsp.gov.ph/statistics/Metadata/CPI_metadata.pdf (last accessed February 27, 2015).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[336]</sup> Consumer Price Index, Inflation and Purchasing Power of the Peso, http://www.bsp.gov.ph/statistics/Metadata/CPI_metadata.pdf (last accessed February 27, 2015).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[337]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> in G.R.

If the defendant and his counsel absent themselves from the court, or decline to receive the amount tendered, the same shall be ordered to be deposited in court and such deposit shall have the same effect as actual payment thereof to the defendant or the person ultimately adjudged entitled thereto.
