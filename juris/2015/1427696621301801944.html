In addition, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, <i>i.e.</i>, (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land, (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties, (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property and the income therefrom, (<i>d</i>) the owner’s sworn valuation, (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations, (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors, (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (<i>h</i>) the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the RTC and the CA applied the provisions of DAR AO No. 5, series of 1998 in computing the just compensation for the subject lands.

On the other hand, they used the one-factor formula under the said AO, <i>i.e.</i>, <b>LV = MV x 2</b>, in valuing the subject riceland considering the lack of comparable sales (CS) and production data to arrive at the capitalized net income (CNI). It appears, however, that both the RTC and the CA made variations from the formula under the said AO.<br><br><b>A. <u>RTC and CA Valuation of the Subject Cocoland</u>.</b><br><br>For its part, the RTC used <u>production data or values within the 12-month period preceding the presumptive date of taking of the subject cocoland on June 30, 2009</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> in accordance with DAR AO No. 1, series of 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It is significant to point out, however, that the said AO only applies to <u>tenanted rice and corn lands acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <u>and Executive Order No. (EO) 228</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which scenario does not obtain in this case.

Particularly, under the foregoing AO, the selling price (SP) for purposes of computing the capitalized net income (CNI) shall be “<u>the average of the latest available 12-months' selling prices prior to the date of receipt of the CF by LBP for processing</u>, such prices to be secured from the Department of Agriculture (DA) and other appropriate regulatory bodies or, in their absence, from the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics. x x x.”<br><br>In rejecting the LBP’s proposed valuation which used the prices of copra from July 2000 to June 2001 per certification from the PCA, the CA opined that the data and values used therein did not reflect the true income generating capacity of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Instead, it used the data for the four-year period from 2000 to 2003, thus, including data or values beyond the time of taking. Consequently, the Court similarly cannot adopt the CA’s computation.<br><br><b>B.&nbsp; <u>RTC and CA Valuation of the Subject Riceland</u>.</b><br><br>The RTC used the one-factor formula under DAR AO No. 5, series of 1998, utilizing unit market value (UMV) taken from the Schedule of Base Unit Market Value<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> as of <u>2002</u>, pursuant to the pertinent ordinance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Albay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Having been based on data or values beyond the time of taking on November 29, 2001, the Court cannot accept the RTC’s valuation. To reiterate, just compensation is the fair market value of an expropriated property at the time of <i>taking</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> in this case, the value of the subject lands upon the issuance of the OCTs in the name of the beneficiaries on November 29, 2001.<br><br>For its part, the CA used the same formula but utilized the unit market value (UMV) from the Schedule of Unit Market Value for Albay effective 2000 in the amount of P34,690.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and then grossed it up with the location adjustment factor and the applicable Regional Consumer Price Index in accordance with Item II (A.9)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of DAR AO No. 5, series of 1998. Considering that the taking took place on November 29, 2001, the UMV should be that corresponding for the year 2001. However, records are bereft of showing that the UMV for the year 2000 is the same UMV obtaining for the year 2001. Thus, on this score, the CA’s computation must equally be rejected.<br><br><b>C. <u>RTC and CA Valuation of the Trees Included in the Just Compensation</u>.</b><br><br>It is relevant to point out that the RTC’s valuation of the standing trees in the amount of P241,461.64,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> as affirmed by the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> appears to have been pegged according to the prevailing values within the 12-month period preceding June 30, 2009. As mentioned, such date was long after the subject lands’ taking on November 29, 2001 and, hence, can neither be countenanced.<br><br><b>D. <u>The Proper Valuation and Remand Guidelines</u>.</b><br><br>In view of the foregoing disquisitions, the just compensation for the subject lands should be computed based on the factors stated in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended. However, the Court has pored over the records and observed that <b>the only factors considered by both courts in determining the just compensation were (<i>a</i>) the nature and actual use of the property, and the income therefrom, as well as (<i>b</i>) the market value of the subject lands,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> <i>without a showing that the other factors under the said section were even taken into account or, otherwise, found to be inapplicable, contrary to what the law requires</i>.<br><br>Similarly, the Court has gone over the LBP’s findings and computation, as contained in the Claims and Valuation and Processing Form,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and is likewise unable to adopt the same since it was partly based on the field investigation report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> which <b>admittedly did not consider (<i>a</i>) the economic and social benefits of the subject lands,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> <b>and (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties within the vicinity</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> To reiterate, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657 must be considered in computing just compensation. Accordingly, the Court finds a need to remand Agrarian Case No. 04-02 to the RTC for the determination of just compensation in accordance with these factors. Relative thereto, the RTC is further directed to observe the following guidelines in the remand of the case:<br><br>1. <b><i>Just compensation must be valued at the time of taking</i></b>, or the “time when the landowner was deprived of the use and benefit of his property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> in this case, upon the issuance of OCT Nos.

To do so would deprive the courts of their judicial prerogatives and reduce them to the bureaucratic function of inputting data and arriving at the valuation. While the courts should be mindful of the different formulae created by the DAR in arriving at just compensation, they are not strictly bound to adhere thereto if the situations before them do not warrant it. <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i> [(565 Phil. 418 (2007)] thoroughly discusses this issue, to wit:<br><blockquote>[T]he basic formula and its alternatives–administratively determined (as it is not found in Republic Act No. 6657, but merely set forth in DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998)–although referred to and even applied by the courts in certain instances, does not and cannot strictly bind the courts. To insist that the formula must be applied with utmost rigidity whereby the valuation is drawn following a strict mathematical computation goes beyond the intent and spirit of the law. The suggested interpretation is strained and would render the law inutile. Statutory construction should not kill but give life to the law. As we have established in earlier jurisprudence, the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which is vested in the regional trial court acting as a SAC, and not in administrative agencies. The SAC, therefore, must still be able to reasonably exercise its judicial discretion in the evaluation of the factors for just compensation, which cannot be arbitrarily restricted by a formula dictated by the DAR, an administrative agency. Surely, DAR AO No. 5 did not intend to straightjacket the hands of the court in the computation of the land valuation. While it provides a formula, it could not have been its intention to shackle the courts into applying the formula in every instance. The court shall apply the formula after an evaluation of the three factors, or it may proceed to make its own computation based on the extended list in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which includes other factors[.] x x x.<br></blockquote></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b> insofar as it seeks to sustain the valuation of the subject lands made by petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines. The Decision dated October 31, 2013 and the Resolution dated February 18, 2014 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 127483, fixing the just compensation for respondents’ 47.4535 hectares of land at P2,465,423.02, less the initial valuation already paid in the amount of P1,369,708.02, plus legal interest as afore-discussed, which did not fully consider the factors enumerated under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, are hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, Agrarian Case No. 04-02 is <b>REMANDED</b> to the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 3 for the proper determination of just compensation in accordance with the guidelines set in this Decision. The trial court is directed to conduct the proceedings in said case with reasonable dispatch and to submit to the Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within sixty (60) days from notice of this Decision.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
