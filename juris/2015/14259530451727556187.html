(TGICI) is is an open-end investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 21, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Sometime in 2002, the SEC conducted an investigation on TGICI and its subsidiaries.In the course thereof, it discovered that TGICI was selling securities to the public without a registration statement in violation of Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as “The Securities Regulation Code,” and that TGICI submitted a fraudulent Treasurer’s Affidavit before the SEC. Resultantly, on October 21, 2003, the SEC revoked TGICI’s corporate registration for being fraudulently procured.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The foregoing led to the filing of multiple criminal cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for Syndicated <i>Estafa</i> against the incorporators and directors of TGICI,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> namely, Jesus Tibayan, Ezekiel D. Martinez, Liborio E. Elacio, Jimmy C. Catigan, Nelda B. Baran, and herein accused-appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Consequently, warrants of arrest were issued against all of them; however, only accused-appellants were arrested, while the others remained at large.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>According to the prosecution, private complainants Hector H. Alvarez, Milagros Alvarez, Clarita P. Gacayan, Irma T. Ador, Emelyn Gomez, Yolanda Zimmer, Nonito Garlan, Judy C. Rillon, Leonida D. Jarina, Reynaldo A. Dacon, Cristina Dela Peña, and Rodney E. Villareal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (private complainants) were enticed to invest in TGICI due to the offer of high interest rates, as well as the assurance that they will recover their investments. After giving their money to TGICI, private complainants received a Certificate of Share and post-dated checks, representing the amount of the principal investment and the monthly interest earnings, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Upon encashment, the checks were dishonored,as the account was already closed, prompting private complainants to bring the bounced checks to the TGICI office to demand payment. At the office, the TGICI employees took the said checks, gave private complainants acknowledgement receipts, and reassured that their investments, as well as the interests, would be paid. However, the TGICI office closed down without private complainants having been paid and, thus, they were constrained to file criminal complaints against the incorporators and directors of TGICI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In their defense, accused-appellants denied having conspired with the other TGICI incorporators to defraud private complainants. Particularly, Puerto claimed that his signature in the Articles of Incorporation of TGICI was forged and that since January 2002,he was no longer a director of TGICI. For her part, Tibayan also claimed that her signature in the TGICI’s Articles of Incorporation was a forgery, as she was neither an incorporator nor a director of TGICI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Rulings</b><br></center><br>On various dates, the RTC issued six (6) separate decisions convicting Tibayan of 13 counts and Puerto of 11 counts of <i>Estafa</i> under Item 2 (a), Paragraph 4, Article 315 of the RPC in relation to PD 1689, to wit: (a) in a Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated December 4, 2009, the RTC found accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of <i>Estafa, </i>sentencing them to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for a period of 20 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> for each count, and ordering them to pay the amounts of P1,500,000.00, to Hector H.

Villareal the amount of P100,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>.<br><br>In the aforesaid decisions, the RTC did not lend credence to accused-appellants’ denials in light of the positive testimonies of the private complainants that they invested their money in TGICI because of the assurances from accused-appellants and the other directors/incorporators of TGICI that their investments would yield very profitable returns. In this relation, the RTC found that accused-appellants conspired with the other directors/incorporators of TGICI in misrepresenting the company as a legitimate corporation duly registered to operate as a mutual fund, to the detriment of the private complainants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, the RTC convicted accused-appellants of simple <i>Estafa</i> only, as the prosecution failed to allege in the informations that accused-appellants and the other directors/ incorporators formed a syndicate with the intention of defrauding the public, or it failed to adduce documentary evidence substantiating its claims that the accused-appellants committed Syndicated <i>Estafa</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, accused-appellants separately appealed the foregoing RTC Decisions to the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CR Nos. 33063, 33562, 336609, 336690, 33939, and 34398. Thereafter, the CA issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated February 19, 2013 ordering the consolidation of accused-appellants’ appeals.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated June 28, 2013, the CA modified accused-appellants’ conviction to that of Syndicated <i>Estafa</i>, and accordingly, increased their respective penalties to life imprisonment for each count.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The CA also increased the amount of actual damages awarded to private complainant Clarita P. Gacayan from P1,300,000.00 to P1,530,625.90, apart from the award of US$12,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>It held that TGICI and its subsidiaries were engaged in a Ponzi scheme which relied on subsequent investors to pay its earlier investors – and is what PD 1689 precisely aims to punish. Inevitably, TGICI could no longer hoodwink new investors that led to its collapse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>Thus, the CA concluded that as incorporators/directors of TGICI, accused-appellants and their cohorts conspired in making TGICI a vehicle for the perpetuation of fraud against the unsuspecting public.. As such, they cannot hide behind the corporate veil and must be personally and criminally liable for their acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The CA then concluded that since the TGICI incorporators/directors comprised more than five (5) persons, accused-appellants’ criminal liability should be upgraded to that of Syndicated <i>Estafa</i>, and their respective penalties increased accordingly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, accused-appellants filed the instant appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not accused-appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Syndicated <i>Estafa</i> defined and penalized under Item 2 (a), Paragraph 4, Article 315 of the RPC in relation to PD 1689.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Court sustains the convictions of accused-appellants.<br><br>Item 2 (a), Paragraph 4, Article 315 of the RPC provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 315. <i>Swindling (estafa).</i> – Any person who shall defraud another by any means mentioned herein below shall be punished by:<br><br>x x x x<br><ol start="2"><li>By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><br>(a) By using a fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business, or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.<br><br>x x x x</li></ol></blockquote><br>The elements of <i>Estafa</i> by means of deceit under this provision are the following: (a) that there must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; (b) that such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (c) that the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (d) that, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In relation thereto, Section 1 of PD 1689 defines Syndicated <i>Estafa</i> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Any person or persons who shall commit estafa or other forms of swindling as defined in Articles 315 and 316 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall be punished by life imprisonment to death if the swindling (estafa) is committed by a syndicate consisting of five or more persons formed with the intention of carrying out the unlawful or illegal act, transaction, enterprise or scheme, and the defraudation results in the misappropriation of moneys contributed by stockholders, or members of rural banks, cooperatives, “<i>samahang nayon(s)</i>,” or farmers’ associations, or funds solicited by corporations/associations from the general public.<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the elements of Syndicated<i> Estafa</i> are: (a) <i>Estafa</i> or other forms of swindling, as defined in Articles 315 and 316 of the RPC,, is committed; (b) the <i>Estafa </i>or swindling is committed by a syndicate of five (5) or more persons; and (c) defraudation results in the misappropriation of moneys contributed by stockholders, or members of rural banks, cooperative, “<i>samahang nayon(s),</i>” or farmers’ associations, or of funds solicited by corporations/associations from the general public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In this case, a judicious review of the records reveals TGICI’s <i>modus operandi</i> of inducing the public to invest in it on the undertaking that their investment would be returned with a very high monthly interest rate ranging from three to five and a half percent (3%-5.5%).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Under such lucrative promise, the investing public are enticed to infuse funds into TGICI. However, as the directors/incorporators of TGICI knew from the start that TGICI is operating without any paid-up capital and has no clear trade by which it can pay the assured profits to its investors,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> they cannot comply with their guarantee and had to simply abscond with their investors’ money. Thus, the CA correctly held that accused-appellants, along with the other accused who are still at large, used TGICI to engage in a Ponzi scheme, resulting in the defraudation of the TGICI investors.<br><br>To be sure, a Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Its organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, the perpetrators focus on attracting new money to make promised payments to earlier-stage investors to create the false appearance that investors are profiting from a legitimate business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; It is not an investment strategy but a gullibility scheme, which works only as long as there is an ever increasing number of new investors joining the scheme.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It is difficult to sustain the scheme over a long period of time because the operator needs an ever larger pool of later investors to continue paying the promised profits to early investors. The idea behind this type of swindle is that the “con-man” collects his money from his second or third round of investors and then absconds before anyone else shows up to collect. Necessarily, Ponzi schemes only last weeks, or months at the most.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this light, it is clearthat all the elements of Syndicated <i>Estafa</i>, committed through a Ponzi scheme,are present in this case, considering that: (a) the incorporators/directors of TGICI comprising more than five (5) people, including herein accused-appellants,, made false pretenses and representations to the investing public – in this case,the private complainants – regarding a supposed lucrative investment opportunity with TGICI in order to solicit money from them; (b) the said false pretenses and representations were made prior to or simultaneous with the commission of fraud; (c) relying on the same, private complainants invested their hard earned money into TGICI; and (d) the incorporators/directors of TGICI ended up running away with the private complainants’ investments, obviously to the latter’s prejudice.<br><br>Corollary thereto, the CA correctly upgraded accused-appellants’ conviction from simple <i>Estafa</i> to Syndicated <i>Estafa.</i> In a criminal case, an appeal throws the whole case wide open for review. Issues whether raised or not by the parties may be resolved by the appellate court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Hence, accused-appellants’ appeal conferred upon the appellate court full jurisdiction and rendered it competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
