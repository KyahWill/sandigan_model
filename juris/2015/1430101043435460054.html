Adolfo filed with the RTC Mandaue a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for judicial separation of property against his estranged wife, respondent Fe Adolfo, nee Tudtud.&nbsp; Docketed as Civil Case No. MAN-4821 and assigned to Branch 55, the petition alleged that the parties were married on November 26, 1966; that the union bore one child; that during the marriage, they acquired through conjugal funds Lot 1087-A-2-E, a 3,652-square meter property in Brgy. Cabancalan, Mandaue City, Cebu (the subject property) covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) 18368; that later on, the parties separated due to irreconcilable differences; that since reunion was no longer feasible, petitioner suggested a separation of the conjugal property, but respondent adamantly refused; that respondent denied petitioner’s co-ownership of the subject property, claiming the same as her paraphernal property; that several earnest efforts to amicably settle the matter between them proved unavailing; and that a judicial separation of property is proper under the circumstances and pursuant to Article 135(6) of the Family Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner thus prayed that judgment be rendered decreeing a separation of the conjugal property and the subdivision or sale thereof, to the end of dividing the same or the proceeds thereof; and ordering respondent to pay petitioner P50,000.00 as attorney’s fees, appearance fees (P2,000.00 per hearing), and P20,000.00 litigation costs.<br><br>In her Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with counterclaim, respondent contended that while she remained married to petitioner, she is the sole owner of the subject property, the same being her paraphernal property which she inherited from her mother; that petitioner is a lazy bum, gambler, drunkard, wife abuser, and neglectful father; that respondent found all means to support the family even as petitioner neglected it; that respondent bought on installment a tricycle for the petitioner’s use in business, but he kept the proceeds thereof to himself and used the same in his gambling and drinking sprees; that respondent alone took the initiative to support the family and found ways to take care of the daily needs of her child; that she caused to be built on a portion of her mother’s land a house even while petitioner was bumming around; that one day, petitioner destroyed the roof of the house that was then being built; that petitioner subsequently abandoned her and their child in 1968, and transferred to Davao City where he took a mistress and begot four children by her; that in 1986, petitioner returned to Cebu City seeking reconciliation with respondent; that respondent took petitioner back, but in 1987 they once more separated; that thereafter, respondent never again saw or heard from petitioner.<br><br>Respondent claimed in her Answer that the subject property was a portion of a bigger lot (mother lot) owned by her mother Petronila Tudtud which was covered by TCT T-15941.&nbsp; On October 11, 1967, her mother executed a quitclaim deed transferring a portion of the mother lot – the subject property – to respondent.&nbsp; The mother title TCT T-15941 was then cancelled and a new one, TCT (17216)-5415, was issued in respondent’s name.&nbsp; Respondent then sold the subject property to her brother on January 19, 1968, and a new TCT (17833)-5515 was issued in her brother’s name.&nbsp; Her brother then mortgaged the property to Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), which foreclosed on the same.&nbsp; TCT 18231 was issued in DBP’s name.&nbsp; DBP then sold the property to the spouses Antonio and Lucy Garcia (the Garcias), and TCT 18266 was in turn issued in their name.&nbsp; Finally, on May 25, 1983, the Garcias sold back the subject property to respondent, and a new title – TCT 18368<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> – was then issued in the name of respondent “FE M. TUDTUD, x x x married to Teofilo Adolfo.”<br><br>Respondent argued that she is the sole owner of the subject property, the same being her paraphernal property which she alone redeemed from the Garcias; that the inclusion of petitioner’s name in TCT 18368 does not make him a co-owner of the property, but was merely necessary to describe respondent’s civil status; and that under Article 135<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the Civil Code, all property brought by the wife to the marriage as well as all property she acquires during the marriage in accordance with Article 148<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the same Code constitutes paraphernal property.<br><br>Respondent thus prayed that the petition be dismissed.&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, she sought the payment of moral, exemplary, and nominal damages, attorney’s fees, and litigation expenses.<br><br><b><i>Civil Case No. MAN-2683</i></b><br><br>In 1996, respondent’s sister Florencia Tudtud and her husband Juanito Gingoyon (the Gingoyons) filed a case for partition with damages against respondent.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. MAN-2683 and raffled to Branch 55 of the RTC Mandaue.&nbsp; The Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> therein alleged that in 1988, respondent executed a deed of sale in favor of the Gingoyons over a 300-square meter portion of the subject property, but that respondent refused to partition/subdivide the same even after the Gingoyons paid the taxes, fees and expenses of the sale.&nbsp; For her defense, respondent claimed in her Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that when the sale to the Gingoyons was made, the subject property constituted conjugal property of her marriage with petitioner; that as early as 1983, or when the Garcias executed the deed of sale in her favor, the subject property became a conjugal asset; since petitioner did not sign the deed of sale in favor of the Gingoyons as he was in Davao at the time and knew nothing about the sale, the sale was null and void.<br><br>On May 15, 2002, the trial court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in Civil Case No. MAN-2683, declaring that the subject property constituted conjugal property of the marriage.&nbsp; It thus nullified the 1988 deed of sale executed by respondent in favor of the Gingoyons for lack of consent on the part of petitioner, citing Article 124 of the Family Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court likewise awarded moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses in favor of the respondent in the total amount of P107,000.00.<br><br>The Gingoyons filed an appeal with the CA, which was docketed as CA-G.R.

CV No. 78971; that since the proceedings in Civil Case No. MAN-2683 have not been terminated and the issue regarding the character of the subject property has not been resolved with finality, then petitioner’s resort to a request for admission and motion for judgment on the pleadings was premature; and that with the May 30, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R.

CV No. 78971 that the subject lot was respondent’s paraphernal property cannot bind him because he was not a party to Civil Case No. MAN-2683.<br><br>On October 6, 2009, the CA issued the assailed Decision containing the following decretal portion:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based from the foregoing premises, the Order of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Mandaue City, in Civil Case No. MAN-4821, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the records of this case are remanded to RTC (Branch 55), Mandaue City, for further proceedings.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>In arriving at the above conclusion, the CA held that the trial court cannot treat petitioner’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as one for summary judgment.&nbsp; It stated that in a proper case for judgment on the pleadings, there are no ostensible issues at all on account of the defending party’s failure to raise an issue in his answer, while in a proper case for summary judgment, such issues exist, although they are sham, fictitious, or not genuine as shown by affidavits, depositions or admissions.&nbsp; In other words, a judgment on the pleadings is a judgment on the facts as pleaded, while a summary judgment is a judgment on the facts as summarily proved by affidavits, depositions, or admissions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It added that respondent’s Answer appeared on its face to tender an issue; it disputed petitioner’s claim that the subject property is their conjugal property.&nbsp; The next thing to be determined is whether this issue is fictitious or sham as to justify a summary judgment.<br><br>The CA added that although respondent was bound by the resulting admission prompted by her failure to reply to petitioner’s request for admission, her claims and documentary exhibits clearly contradict what petitioner sought to be admitted in his request; that the trial court disregarded the fact that the issue of whether the subject property is conjugal was still unresolved as CA-G.R. CV No. 78971 was still pending; and that finally, the trial court should have been guided by the principles that trial courts have but limited authority to render summary judgments and that summary judgments should not be rendered hastily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved to reconsider, but in a March 2, 2012 Resolution, he was rebuffed.&nbsp; Hence, the present Petition was filed on April 30, 2012.<br><br>In a March 20, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court resolved to give due course to the instant Petition.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Petitioner now claims that the Court of Appeals erred in deciding the case on a question of substance not in accord with law, Rule 26 of the 1997 Rules, and applicable jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In his Petition seeking to reverse and set aside the assailed CA dispositions and thus reinstate the October 2, 2006 Order of the trial court, petitioner insists that respondent’s failure to reply to his written request for admission resulted in her admitting that the subject property is a conjugal asset, applying Rule 26, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules; that the CA grossly erred in disregarding the rule; that with the resulting admission, there remains no genuine issue to be resolved in Civil Case No. MAN-4821, such that judgment based on the pleadings is proper.&nbsp; Finally, petitioner adds that respondent’s trifling with the law and rules of procedure – by conveniently claiming in one case that the subject property is conjugal, and then in another that it is paraphernal – should not be countenanced; she should be held to her original declaration that the subject property is conjugal.<br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> respondent counters that, as correctly ruled by the CA, petitioner elected the wrong remedy in filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings when he should have moved for summary judgment; that in a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the movant is deemed to admit the truth of all of the opposing party’s material and relevant allegations, and rest his motion on those allegations taken together with that of his own as are admitted in the pleadings;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that the effect of this is that petitioner is deemed to have admitted that the subject property is paraphernal, as claimed in her Answer; that with the final and executory May 30, 2007 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R.

Now, if an answer does in fact specifically deny the material averments of the complaint and/or asserts affirmative defenses (allegations of new matter which, while admitting the material allegations of the complaint expressly or impliedly, would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by the plaintiff), a judgment on the pleadings would naturally be improper.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, “whether x x x the issues raised by the Answer are genuine is not the crux of inquiry in a motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; It is so only in a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; In a case for judgment on the pleadings, the Answer is such that no issue is raised at all.&nbsp; The essential question in such a case is whether there are issues generated by the pleadings.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; “A ‘genuine issue’ is an issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from a sham, fictitious, contrived or false claim.&nbsp; When the facts as pleaded appear uncontested or undisputed, then there is no real or genuine issue or question as to the facts, and summary judgment is called for.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In rendering summary judgment, the trial court relied on respondent’s failure to reply to petitioner’s request for admission, her admission in Civil Case No. MAN-2683, as well as its May 15, 2002 Decision declaring that the subject property is a conjugal asset.&nbsp; It took judicial notice of the proceedings in said case.&nbsp; While there is nothing irregular with this – as courts may “take judicial notice of a decision or the facts prevailing in another case sitting in the same court if (1) the parties present them in evidence, absent any opposition from the other party; or (2) the court, in its discretion, resolves to do so”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> – the trial court however disregarded the fact that its decision was then the subject of a pending appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971.&nbsp; It should have known that until the appeal is resolved by the appellate court, it would be premature to render judgment on petitioner’s motion for judgment on the pleadings; that it would be presumptuous to assume that its own decision would be affirmed on appeal.&nbsp; One of the issues raised in the appeal is precisely whether the subject property is conjugal, or a paraphernal asset of the respondent.&nbsp; Thus, instead of resolving petitioner’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court should have denied it or held it in abeyance.&nbsp; It should have guided petitioner to this end, instead of aiding in the hasty resolution of his case.&nbsp; In the first place, Civil Case No. MAN-4821 was transferred to it from Branch 56 precisely for the reason that it was the court which tried the closely related Civil Case No. MAN-2683.<br><br>Even if respondent is deemed to have admitted the matters contained in petitioner’s request for admission by her failure to reply thereto, the trial court should have considered the pending appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971.&nbsp; It cannot take judicial notice solely of the proceedings in Civil Case No. MAN-2683, and ignore the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971.&nbsp; After all, CA-G.R. CV No. 78971 is merely a continuation of Civil Case No. MAN-2683; an appeal is deemed a continuation of the same case commenced in the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On the part of petitioner, it must be said that he could not have validly resorted to a motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment.&nbsp; While it may appear that under Rules 34 and 35 of the 1997 Rules, he may file a motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment as a result of the consequent admission by respondent that the subject property is conjugal, this is not actually the case.&nbsp; Quite the contrary, by invoking the proceedings and decision in Civil Case No. MAN-2683, petitioner is precluded from obtaining judgment while the appeal in said case is pending, because the result thereof determines whether the subject property is indeed conjugal or paraphernal.&nbsp; He may not preempt the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971.<br><br>While it is true that a judgment cannot bind persons who are not parties to the action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> petitioner cannot, after invoking the proceedings in Civil Case No. MAN-2683 to secure affirmative relief against respondent and thereafter failing to obtain such relief, be allowed to repudiate or question the CA’s ruling in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971.&nbsp; The principle of estoppel bars him from denying the resultant pronouncement by the appellate court, which became final and executory, that the subject property is respondent’s paraphernal property.&nbsp; “In estoppel, a person, who by his deed or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner, is barred from adopting an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that thereby causes loss or injury to another.&nbsp; It further bars him from denying the truth of a fact which has, in the contemplation of law, become settled by the acts and proceeding of judicial or legislative officers or by the act of the party himself, either by conventional writing or by representations, express or implied or <i>in pais</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court notes that the appellate court overlooked the May 30, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971, which became final and executory on June 23, 2007.&nbsp; The respondent included this development in her appellee’s brief, but the CA did not take it into account.&nbsp; As an unfortunate consequence, the case was not appreciated and resolved completely.<br><br>Thus, with the development in Civil Case No. MAN-2683 brought upon by the final and executory decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 78971, petitioner’s case is left with no leg to stand on.&nbsp; There being no conjugal property to be divided between the parties, Civil Case No. MAN-4821 must be dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The October 6, 2009 Decision and March 2, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
