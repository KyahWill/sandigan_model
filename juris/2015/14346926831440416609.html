				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us for review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00305-MIN dated 22 June 2012 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Pagadian City, Branch 21, in Criminal Case No. 2287 finding appellant Ronnie Buat <i>alias</i> Datu Sinsuat guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br>Appellant was charged with rape in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>That sometime on the 30<sup>th</sup> day of June 1996 at about 2:00 o'clock dawn, at Pagadian City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Ronnie Buat, armed with a knife, by means of violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant [AAA]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>On arraignment, appellant entered a "not guilty" plea to the offense charged. Thereafter, the trial court proceeded with the reception of evidence for the prosecution which presented four witnesses, namely: AAA, the victim; BBB, the victim's mother; CCC, the victim's father and Dr. Rowena Tobillo (Dr. Tobillo), the physician who examined AAA. Their testimonies established the following facts:<br><br>AAA lives with her parents and some of her siblings in Pagadian City. On 30 June 1996, AAA's eldest and married sister DDD was requested by their parents to sleep in the house because AAA's mother BBB had to attend a wake in Dumaguete City while her father CCC was on night duty working as a security guard. DDD's husband, appellant in this case, also went with DDD.<br><br>AAA slept in the <i>sala</i> next to her twin nephews, along with DDD, and appellant. AAA's other siblings slept in another room. At around 2:00 a.m., AAA was awakened by appellant who was half-naked and lying on top of her. AAA tried to talk a loud but appellant suddenly covered her mouth with his right hand. Appellant managed to remove AAA's panties using his left hand while holding a knife threatening to kill AAA should she tell her parents about the act. AAA tried to resist but to no avail. Appellant ordered AAA to spread her legs. Appellant first inserted his two fingers into her vagina before inserting his penis. AAA felt pain. After successfully raping AAA, appellant proceeded to rape his wife DDD. AAA told DDD about what appellant did but DDD ignored her. At around three (3) hours later, appellant and DDD left the house. AAA went to the other room and immediately told one of her younger brothers that she was raped by appellant. When CCC arrived in the morning, AAA likewise told him about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>CCC accompanied AAA on 3 July 1996 to the police station to have it blottered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> CCC admitted that he was against his daughter DDD marrying appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>BBB testified that she stayed in Dumaguete City for 10 days to attend the funeral and burial service of her brother. She requested DDD to stay in their house while she was away. When she arrived in Pagadian City on 5 July 1996, AAA immediately told her that she was raped by appellant on 30 June 1996. After learning what happened to her daughter, BBB proceeded to the house of appellant and DDD but she did not see them. On 8 July 1996, she took her daughter to the provincial hospital for a medical examination.<br><br>Based on the examination conducted by Dr. Rowena Tobillo, the following findings were made:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="6%">HYMEN </td><td width="25%">- HEALED LACERATIONS AT:</td><td width="76%">3 O'CLOCK POSITION</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>6 O'CLOCK POSITION</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7 O'CLOCK POSITION</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2">- ADMITS 2 FINGERS WITH EASE</td></tr><tr><td>VAGINA</td><td colspan="2">- (-) TENDERNESS, (+) DISCHARGE WHITISH</td></tr><tr><td>CERVIX</td><td colspan="2">- (-) TENDERNESS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>For his defense, appellant denied raping AAA. Instead, he claimed that on 30 June 1996 at around 2:00 a.m., he noticed AAA was lying beside him, inserting her hand inside his brief, and touching his penis. He immediately parried AAA's hands causing his wife DDD to wake up. DDD scolded AAA. Out of shame, appellant left early in the morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Appellant stated that his wife's parents were against him marrying DDD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 2 June 2004, the RTC rendered a decision finding appellant guilty of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Appellant was further ordered to indemnify AAA the sum of P50,000.00 plus moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The trial court found the testimony of the victim credible and convincing while it took with disfavor appellant's defense of denial, his argument about the delay in reporting the case and the alleged ill motive of AAA's parents against him.<br><br>Appellant directly appealed his conviction to this Court. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 13 July 2005, the Court resolved to transfer the case to the Court of Appeals pursuant to <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 22 June 2012, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision affirming in <i>toto</i> the trial court's decision.<br><br>Appellant filed the instant appeal. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 26 June 2013, the parties were required to simultaneously submit their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired. Both parties manifested that they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for decision.<br><br>In his Brief, appellant contends that AAA's account of the alleged rape is riddled with improbabilities and inconsistencies which lead to failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>First, appellant states that it is physically impossible for him to have restrained AAA using his two hands to cover her mouth, hold a knife, remove her panties, and insert his two fingers into her private parts. We reject the submission. We find that it is not implausible for appellant to have physically subdued AAA because these acts were not committed simultaneously, but successively. Appellant initially covered AAA's mouth using his right hand. He then removed her underwear using his left hand while holding a knife. After removing her underwear, he then inserted his two fingers into her private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Court in <i>People v. Dizon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> recounted two cases of rape committed in similar fashion, thus:<br><blockquote>xxx. When she saw her father naked, she got scared and did not move. Because of her refusal, her father poked a three-<i>cantos</i> knife at her neck and he undressed her by pulling down her skirt and her panty until they were removed from her body. Her father then told her to sit up and when she did, he pulled her t-shirt off her head. She cried and her father threatened to kill her if her cries will be heard by others.<br><br>xxx. The accused awakened Mergena upon arriving from a drinking session with his brothers, pointed a knife at her and ordered her to stand up. When she refused to obey, he pulled her up. He removed his short pants, then with a knife still pointed at her, removed her skirt and made her lie down. He removed her panty and his underwear, separated her thighs and inserted his penis into her vagina while fondling her breast. This entire time his left hand was holding the knife.<br></blockquote>Second, appellant notes the inconsistency in AAA's testimony that appellant allegedly covered her mouth with his right hand but in her sworn statement, she stated that appellant covered her mouth with his left hand. It has been held that inconsistencies in the victim's testimony do not impair her credibility, especially if the inconsistencies refer to trivial matters that do not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Third, appellant brands as outrageous the claim that after he raped AAA, he also raped his wife DDD. AAA's statement that appellant also raped his wife was based on her observation that DDD was still sleeping when appellant had sexual intercourse with her. In all probability, it might have been consensual because when AAA tried to tell DDD that she was raped by her husband, the latter merely ignored her and even warned her not to tell their parents. Again, whether appellant had intercourse with his wife or not should not detract from the main issue that appellant raped AAA.<br><br>Fourth, appellant finds it incredulous that AAA never exerted any physical struggle or made any real resistance against his sexual advances. The Court, in <i>People v. Banig</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> has held that it is not necessary on the part of the victim to put up a tenacious physical struggle when threats and intimidation are employed and the victim submits herself to the embrace of her rapist because of fear. It was established in this case that appellant was pointing a knife at AAA which impelled her to submit to appellant's lustful desire.<br><br>Fifth, appellant points out another inconsistency in AAA's testimony when she narrated that she informed DDD about the rape but she was ignored but in her later testimony, AAA declared that after she was raped, she immediately went to her other siblings to sleep and when she woke up, appellant and DDD were already gone. It was revealed during the cross-examination of AAA that she informed DDD that she was raped by appellant after the latter had sexual intercourse with his wife and before the couple left the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>AAA testified in a straightforward manner as she vividly recounted her ordeal in the hands of appellant:<blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">You said that about 2:00 o'clock dawn of June 30, 1996 there was an unusual incident that took place.

This is especially true in rape cases where the crime is usually committed in the presence of no other person than the victim and the accused. Compared to appellate magistrates who are merely faced with the cold and inanimate pages of the transcript of records brought before them, the trial judge comes face to face with the rape victim herself on the witness stand. He personally observes her conduct and demeanor while responding to the questions propounded by the prosecutor on direct examination as well as those from the defense counsel on cross examination. Moreover, it is also the trial judge who has the chance to pose clarificatory questions to the victim. Thus, when the trial judge makes his findings as to the issue of credibility, such findings bear great weight upon the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>We find no cogent reason to depart from the findings of the courts below.<br><br>Note that rape was committed during the effectivity of the old rape provision, <i>i.e.</i>, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:<br><blockquote>Article 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>1. By using force or intimidation;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br></blockquote>The trial court correctly applied Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in this case. Article 63 provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 63. Rules for the application of indivisible penalties. - x x x. In all cases in which the law prescribes the penalty composed of two indivisible penalties the following rules shall be observed in the application thereof:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>2. When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br></blockquote>Absent any aggravating or mitigating circumstance in this case, the imposition of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> as penalty is proper.<br><br>Finally, we award exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00.
