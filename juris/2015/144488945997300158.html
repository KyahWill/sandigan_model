In fact, it was accredited with the CSC only on January 14, 2009, as evidenced by CSC Resolution No. 090087<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of even date, which states, <i>inter alia</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>NOW, THEREFORE</i></b>, the Commission hereby resolves to accredit the <b><i>Unyon ng mga Kawani ng Pamahalaang Lokal ng Tayabas (UNGKAT)</i></b>.

COA</i>,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[47]</sup></font> the Court declared that notwithstanding the disallowance of benefits by COA, the affected personnel who received the said benefits in good faith should not be ordered to refund the disallowed benefits. Similarly, in <i>Querubin v.

Indeed, no <i>indicia </i>of bad faith can be detected under the attendant facts and circumstances. The officials and chiefs of offices concerned disbursed such incentive benefits in the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients and the latter accept the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits.</blockquote>xxx Thus, being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the allowances and bonuses they received but disallowed by the COA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, the majority of the petitioners are the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon's rank-and-file employees and bona fide members of UNGKAT (named-below)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> who received the 2008 and 2009 CNA Incentives on the honest belief that UNGKAT was fully clothed with the authority to represent them in the CNA negotiations. As the records bear out, there was no indication that these rank-and-file employees, except the UNGKAT officers or members of its Board of Directors named below, had participated in any of the negotiations or were, in any manner, privy to the internal workings related to the approval of said incentives; hence, under such limitation, the reasonable conclusion is that they were mere passive recipients who cannot be charged with knowledge of any irregularity attending the disallowed disbursement. Verily, good faith is anchored on an honest belief that one is legally entitled to the benefit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> as said employees did so believe in this case. Therefore, said petitioners should not be held liable to refund what they had unwittingly received.<br><br>With respect, however, to the other petitioners who, apart from being rank-and-file employees of the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon, were also UNGKAT officers at the time, and who directly participated in the negotiations pertaining to the disallowed CNA incentives, namely, petitioners Nanez, Dr. Cesar Anthony Orias, Aurea S. Resare, Roselle Y. Villaverde, Celina B. Oabel, Aileen R. Ranera, Veronica N. Garcia, Allan C. Zagala, Nelson V. Coladilla, Mary Jane Z. Calupig, Irma C. Ilocario, as well as the members of the Board of Directors of UNGKAT, namely, Raymundo L. Constantino, Edmerlito P. Ybardolaza, Sr., Rolando Z. Olivar, Mario C. Reyes, Jr., Amelia F. Babierra, Nonilon Reyes, Rizalyn Z. Espedido, Marvin Jacela, Joy O. Taguilaso, and Fabian Jaballa,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> they cannot be deemed to have acted in good faith. Considering that prior accreditation as sole negotiating agent was required under DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-01, the UNGKAT officers and Board of Directors ought to have known that they were bereft of authority to enter into negotiations on behalf of the rank-and-file employees with respect to the CNA Incentives.<br><br>Similarly, such finding of good faith cannot be made to apply to Silang, who, as City Mayor, approved the allowances, as well as the local <i>Sanggunian</i> members, who enacted the ordinances authorizing the payment of the subject CNA Incentives. As City Mayor and members of the local <i>Sanggunian,</i> they are presumed to be acquainted with - and, in fact, even duty bound to have full knowledge of - the requirements under the applicable policies for the valid grant of CNA Incentives, <i>i.e.,</i> the requisite accreditation of UNGKAT with the CSC at the time of the signing of the CNA as required under DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-01. Indeed, knowledge of basic procedure is part and parcel of their shared fiscal responsibility under Section 305 (1), Chapter I, Title V, Book II of the LGC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 305. <i>Fundamental Principles</i>. - The financial affairs, transactions, and operations of local government units shall be governed by the following fundamental principles:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(1) Fiscal responsibility shall be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the local government units; x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br>Their unexplained failure in this wise, therefore, goes against their claim of good faith in the allowance and payments pf the CNA Incentives, especially since the 2008 CNA Incentive had already been disallowed even prior to the approval of Ordinance No. 09-01 authorizing the release of the 2009 CNA Incentive. That they did not receive any amount<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> from the disallowed benefits does not exculpate them from personal and solidary liability for reimbursement therefor, under the legal provisions above-quoted, <b><u>as receipt of the disallowed benefits is inconsequential, absent any showing of good faith</u></b>. As aptly pointed out by Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion during the deliberations on this case, the receipt or non-receipt of illegally disbursed funds is immaterial to the solidary liability of the government officials directly responsible therefor, as in the case of <i>Maritime Industry Authority v. COA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where the Court held the approving officers therein who acted in bad faith as solidarity liable to return the disallowed funds, even if they never got hold of them.<br><br>In fine, <b><u>Silang, the City Mayor, as well as the local <i>Sanggunian</i> members, as the approving authority, together with the UNGKAT officers and members of the Board of Directors who actively participated in the negotiations for the approval of the disallowed incentives despite knowledge of UNGKAT's non-accreditation at the time, are<i> solidarity liable</i> to refund the disallowed benefits in this cas</u></b>e, without prejudice to any further finding of administrative liability as a consequence of their actions.

In so doing, I express my support for the <i>ponencia's</i> decision to partially modify the respondent Commission on Audit's (COA) Resolution dated March 13, 2014, which upheld the Notices of Disallowance Nos. 2009-0001-101-(08) and 2009-002-101(09).<br><br>I point out at the outset that a local government has the authority and prerogative to negotiate and to enter into a Collective Negotiation Agreement (<i>CNA</i>) with its employees. ' In implementing its negotiated CNA, the local government necessarily has to disburse and use funds to support the agreed CNA terms.<br><br>That the law authorizes the use of its funds, however, does not automatically make the disbursement legal. The use of public funds must be in accordance with the requirements of law - in this case, DBM Circular No. 2006-1. The release of funds without fully complying with DBM Circular No. 2006-1 results into an illegal expenditure that can lead to possible liability, a solidary one to refund the disbursed funds by the responsible government officials and employees, as what had happened in the present case.<br><br><b><u>The Case</u></b><br><br>Before us is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> assailing the Resolution issued by the Commission on Audit (<i>COA</i>), which upheld the Notices of Disallowance Nos. 2009-0001-101-(08) and 2009-002-101(09). These NDs disallowed the CNA Incentives paid to the rank-and-file employees of the local government unit (<i>LGU</i>) of Tayabas, Quezon, for the years 2008 and 2009.<br><br>On November 13, 2007, and February 4, 2008, the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon, entered into CNAs with the Unyon ng mga Kawani ng Pamahalaang Lokal ng Tayabas (<i>UNGKAT</i>), an employee's organization of the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon, duly registered with the Department of Labor and Employment (<i>DOLE</i>) and with the Civil Service Commission (CSC)..<br><br>The local <i>Sanggunian</i> subsequently passed Ordinance No. 08-03 appropriating P9.23 million for the payment of the 2008 CNA. The implementation of the ordinance was ordered suspended by the Office of the COA Auditor, Province of Quezon. Eventually, a Notice of Disallowance was issued against it.<br><br>In the meantime, the Sanggunian passed Ordinance No. 09-01, which appropriated P39.86 million for the 2009 CNA. This was also subsequently disallowed, for the same reasons given in disallowing Ordinance No. 08-03.<br><br>The Office of the Auditor of the Province of Quezon disallowed these appropriations for the following reasons:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The CNAs lacked prior registration with the CSC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">UNGKAT is not accredited by the CSC as the sole and exclusive negotiation agent of the LGU concerned; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Cost-cutting measures in the CNA had not been identified.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The LGU of Tayabas, as represented by its mayor, Faustino Silang, contested the suspension and subsequent disallowance of these ordinances. The COA Regional Director and COA en bane affirmed the Notices of Disallowance for the following reasons:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">UNGKAT was <b><i>not accredited as the sole and exclusive negotiation agent</i></b> of the LGU of Tayabas at the time the LGU entered into CNAs with them, contrary to Item No. 5.1 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular No. 2006-1. At the time UNGKAT entered into the CNAs, it was merely registered with the DOLE, which gives it the right to be certified as the LGU's exclusive negotiating representative; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Funding for the 2008 CNA was sourced from the LGU's savings two months before it was signed; this violated Item 7.1.2 of DBM Circular No. 2006-1.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Thus, Silang and the rank-and-file employees of the LGU of Tayabas filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the COA en bane's acts of affirming the Notices of Disallowance.<br><br>I <b>agree</b> with the <i>ponencia's</i> decision to affirm the COA en bane's resolution upholding the Notices of Disallowance, and to partially modify the civil liabilities of the local government officials and employees involved.<br><br>As the <i>ponente</i> observed, these NDs merely followed the requirements of DBM Circular No, 2006-1. It was thus proper to order the disallowances as the ordinances - appropriating funds for the CNAs - did not comply with the requirements.<br><br>I now proceed to discuss my reasons for the liabilities of the local government officials and employees involved.<br><br><b><i>Liability of government employees <br>directly responsible for illegal<br>expenditures</i></b><br><br>Section 52, Chapter 9, Title I-B, Book V of the Administrative Code expressly provides that persons who are directly responsible for the illegal expenditures of public funds shall be liable:<br><br><blockquote>General Liability for Unlawful Expenditures. - Expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be <b><i>a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor.</i></b> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>This liability of government employees and officials for illegal expenditures similarly finds support in the Local Government Code, which imputes personal liability for unlawful expenditures against the official or employee responsible for it, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 351. General Liability for Unlawful Expenditures. -Expenditures of funds or use of property in violation of this Title and other laws shall be<b><i> a personal liability of the official or employee responsible therefor.</i></b> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Book VI, Chapter V, Section 43 of the Administrative Code expounds on what direct responsibility for illegal expenditures entails, particularly the extent of personal liability for reimbursement that each participating public employee would bear:<br><br><blockquote>Liability for Illegal Expenditures. - Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the general and special provisions contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be void. Every payment made in violation of said provisions shall be illegal and every official or employee <b><i>authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein, and every person receiving such payment shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the full amount so paid or received</i></b>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Thus, the law in clear terms expressly provides that public employees directly responsible for an illegal expenditure regardless of his or her part in authorizing its release, in making the payment, or in otherwise taking part shall be <b><i>solidarity liable for its reimbursement</i></b>. Also solidarity liable are the persons who received payment from an illegally disbursed public fund.<br><br>As an <b><u>exception</u></b>, jurisprudence absolves public employees who acted in good faith in approving, releasing, or receiving these funds. The Court, for practical and equitable reasons, no longer requires them to reimburse the funds already disbursed. Good faith in this case meant that the government employees and officers acted in "the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients."<br><br>Under these legal principles, I join the <i>ponencia</i> in finding that the approving officers, i.e., the Mayor and the members of the Sanggunian, have been directly responsible for the illegal expenditure of CNA incentives. Also responsible are the officers of the UNGKAT who directly participated in the negotiations for these incentives.<br><br>None of them can invoke the honest belief that the requirements of DBM Circular No. 2006-1 on CNA incentives were complied with; as the government officers and employees directly authorized to negotiate, to agree on, and to release these funds, they carry the duty to know and comply with the rules applicable to these transactions.<br><br><i><b>Liability of approving officers</b></i><br><br>Under the local government code, an ordinance is necessary for the use of local funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The local chief executive prepares the budget proposal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which is the basis for the budget to be enacted by the local Sanggunian.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>As a rule, savings generated from the annual budget revert back to the general fund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> DBM Circular No. 2006-1 authorizes the local chief executive and the Sanggunian to use savings from released Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (<i>MOOE</i>) funds to grant cash incentives to rank-and-file employees of the local government, through a CNA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Mayor and the Sanggunian exceeded their authority to grant cash incentives under a CNA, as they (7) entered into a CNA with a union that had not been accredited as the sole and exclusive negotiating agent of the local government employees of Tayabas; and (2) with regard to the 2008 CNA, they had used savings incurred two months before the CNA was signed.<br><br>These requirements are clearly stated in DBM Circular No. 2006-1, which provides the procedure for negotiating and entering into a CNA. As the approving officers vested with the authority to negotiate and enter into a CNA, the Mayor and Sanggunian members are directly responsible for the negotiation and release of the public funds involved and are thus solidarily liable for their illegal expenditure of these funds for noncompliance with the requirements.<br><br>Further, as the <i>ponente </i>had correctly observed, the Mayor and the Sanggunian could not invoke their good faith to absolve them from their solidary liability. Good faith, as earlier pointed out, involves the honest belief that one is legally entitled to the fund received.<br><br>The Mayor's and the Sanggunian members' roles in initiating, negotiating, and approving CNAs vest them with the responsibility to comply with the requirements of DBM Circular No. 2006-1; part of this responsibility is to know these requirements and to act as dictated by these requirements.<br><br>Moreover, I find it highly suspect that these approving officers continued to push for a second ordinance involving CNA incentives after the first ordinance had already been suspended by the provincial auditor. The second ordinance involved more money for the payment of CNA incentives and suffered from the same infirmities and noncompliance with DBM Circular No. 2006-1 as the first ordinance.<br><br>To my mind, the enactment of the second ordinance shows a reckless disregard for DBM Circular No. 2006-1. With the second ordinance, the approving officers ignored the reasons behind the earlier order of suspension of the first ordinance, particularly the failure to comply with DBM Circular No. 2006-1. This disregard for the DBM Circular most definitely could not qualify as good faith compliance with what had been shown to them that must be observed.<br><br>That these approving officers did not receive any of these funds is not sufficient justification to absolve them from liability. The receipt or non-receipt of illegally disbursed funds is immaterial to the solidary liability of government officials directly responsible therefor. We had the occasion to rule on this point in the recent case <i>Maritime Industry Authority v. COA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> where the Court en bane held the approving officers who acted in bad faith to be solidarity liable for the return of the disallowed funds even if they did not receive any part of the fund.<br><br><b><i>Liability of UNGKAT officers who <br>directly participated in the negotiations </i></b><br><br>Aside from the Mayor and the Sanggunian, UNGKAT officers who directly participated in the negotiations also share responsibility for the illegal disbursement of the released funds. They are responsible and liable as the funds were released after the negotiations where they had taken part; the CNAs were between UNGKAT (that they led and represented) and the local government.<br><br>Too, the reason behind the illegality of the CNAs is UNGKAT's failure to register as the exclusive negotiation agent of the LGU of Tayabas' rank-and-file employees. UNGKAT's officers, as the leaders and representatives of the LGU employees, have the duty to comply with the procedures and requirements that allow the union to represent the LGU employees in a CNA.<br><br>That the union in a CNA must be accredited as the sole negotiating agent is not a new requirement under DBM Circular No. 2006-1. As early as 2002, Public Sector Labor Management Council Resolution No. 01 Series of 2002 already required the registration of government employees' unions with the DOLE and their accreditation with the CSC before they are allowed to enter collective negotiations with management.<br><br>Thus, by the time UNGKAT started negotiations with the LGU of Tayabas in 2008, the requirement of prior accreditation had been in place for at least six years. Noncompliance with a requirement that had been in effect for this long can no longer be considered an act of good faith; such omission is an utter disregard of the laws involving the CNA negotiations.<br><br><b><i>Ordinary rank-and-file employees<br>and UNGKAT members with no <br>participation in the CNAs are not<br>liable for the return of the CNA<br>incentives.</i></b><br><br>Thus, the only set of employees who are not obliged to reimburse the illegally disbursed funds in the present case are its passive recipients, i.e., the ordinary rank-and-file employees of the LGU of Tayabas, including the UNGKAT members and officers who had no direct participation in the negotiations.<br><br>The reason for this conclusion is that they had been mere passive recipients of good graces and they had (and still have) every right to rely on the presumptions of regularity and good faith accorded to public officers responsible for the disbursement and expenditure of public funds. In particular, as mere passive recipients, they did not actively take part in the CNA, had no responsibility to undertake in carrying out the requirements for union registration and accreditation, and could not have known the taints of irregularities that the funds released to them carried.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See Public Sector Labor Management Council Resolution No. 04, Series of 2002.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Title V, Chapter 1, Section 305, Local Government Code.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Title V, Chapter 1, Section 318, Local Government Code. <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Title V, Chapter 1, Section 319, Local Government Code.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Title V, Chapter 1, Section 322, Local Government Code. <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Section 7.0, DBM Circular No. 2006-1.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> G.R.
