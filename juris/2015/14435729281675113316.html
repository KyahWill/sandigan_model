While we are aware that it's your desire to fight this case to its ultimate legal conclusion, allow us nonetheless, to present the pros and cons of having this case be amicably settled.<br><br><b><u>Point One:</u></b> He has in his possession the original copy of the checks you issued showing that upon signing of the <b>Contract Of Real Estate Mortgage</b>, he received from you Eighty Eight Thousand Pesos <b><u>(Php88,000.00)</u></b> only. Meaning, he has already paid in advance his interest of 12% or the equivalent of Twelve Thousand Pesos <b><u>(Php12,000.00)</u></b> when the contract was signed. Consequently, it is useless for us to argue before the court that his principal indebtedness amounted to One Hundred Thousand Pesos <b><u>(Php100,000.00)</u></b>. Hence, if you accept the compromise settlement of One Hundred Ten Thousand Pesos <b><u>(Php110,000.00)</u></b>, you stand to gain Twenty Two Thousand Pesos <b><u>(Php22,000.00)</u></b>.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rest assured, your undersigned counsel leaves it to your better judgment as to whether he deserves to be paid for his legal services regarding this case against Mr. Jose Calvario.<br><br>Repeat, I will no longer ask from you any compensation for my services regarding this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Atty.

Galarrita replied through the Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated January 27, 2006, stating in part:<br><blockquote>I entered into an amicable settlement with Mr. Jose Calvario because I am certain that in this kind of case, a compromise is better than WINNING it.<br><br>Everything is transparent. You even told me that you are not interested to acquire the land that's why you signaled your approval of a compromise.<br><br>I was hoping that you already understood my situation. As I have told you, I can't waste my time going to Gumaca every now and then. Traveling time is too precious for my cases here in Metro Manila.<br><br>The point is: I did not receive any appearance fee for the numerous hearings conducted there despite sending several statements of accounts (SOA) to your office.<br><br>If that's the case, why prolong the agony?<br><br>Why bother after all to pursue this case when indeed, you are not interested to acquire the land and you are not bent in spending the right remuneration for your undersigned counsel?<br><br>I have nothing to hide.

This is what we come out to [p]ropose to them, with the right amount to cover all those only been spent including Acceptance fee. You even waive[d] your fee on this, for every hearing which I couldn't understand, [y]et we end up that we still going [sic] to pursue this case, it was discussed during my trip there. [This is] [t]he reason I'm too surprised with your plea Agreement without my knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Luna mentioned that the delay in retainer's fee payments was due to Atty.

Galarrita with handling the civil case involving a mortgaged land in Quezon Province. However, without complainant Luna's consent, respondent Atty. Galarrita settled this case with the other party.<br><br>Article 1878 of the Civil Code provides that "[s]pecial powers of attorney are necessary in the following cases: . . . (3) <i>To compromise</i>, to submit questions to arbitration, to renounce the right to appeal from a judgment, to waive objections to the venue of an action or to abandon a prescription already acquired[.]"<br><br>The Rules of Court thus requires lawyers to secure special authority from their clients when entering into a compromise agreement that dispenses with litigation:<br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Authority of attorneys to bind clients</i>. - Attorneys have authority to bind their clients in any case by any agreement in relation thereto made in writing and in taking appeals, and in all matters of ordinary judicial procedure. <b><i>But they cannot, without special authority, compromise their client's litigation</i></b>, or receive anything in discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Atty. Galarrita contends that he holds a Special Power of Attorney to enter into compromise agreements, but as found by the Investigating Commissioner:<br><blockquote><b><i>There seems to be a compelling reason to believe that Complainant had not given any authority for the Complainant [sic] to enter into Compromise Agreement at that precise stage of the trial.</i></b> <i>Firstly</i>, the Complainant was not made a party to the Compromise Agreement despite the fact that he was not abroad when the agreement was executed. <i>Secondly</i>, there was no indication that he had agreed to the amount of P100,000.00 in exchange for his withdrawal of the complaint. <i>Thirdly</i>, he was not seasonably informed of the execution of the Compromise Agreement/payment of the P100,000.00 and came to know of the same only much later.<br><br>Respondent argued that Complainant had previously executed a Special Power of Attorney wherein he authorized the former to "<i>enter into possible amicable settlement or submit any matter to arbitration and alternative modes of dispute resolution, simplification of the issues, the necessity of amendment to the pleadings, the possibility of obtaining stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof the limitation of the number of witnesses, the advisability of preliminary reference of issues to a commissioner, the propriety of rendering judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, or of dismissing the action should a valid ground therefor be found to exist, the advisability of suspending the proceedings, offer matters that may properly be considered under Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure</i>." It would seem, however, that despite the authority given to Respondent, the same SPA cannot justify Respondent's representation in the Compromise Agreement on February 14, 2006.<b><i> To dissect, the SPA was executed on September 16, 2002 or a month before the filing of the Complaint for Foreclosure of Mortgage. Thus, the conclusion seems to be that the authority given therein to Respondent to enter into a possible settlement referred only to a possible settlement that could be secured or firmed up during the preliminary conference or pre-trial of the case.</i></b> In fact, the tenor of the SPA indicates that the SPA was precisely executed in order to constitute Respondent as Complainant's representative during the preliminary conference or pre-trial.<br><br>Assuming it can be inferred that the SPA and the authority given to Respondent can be liberally interpreted and allowed to extend up to the time the Compromise had been executed, still the Respondent may not have faithfully performed his sworn duty to his client. During the mandatory conference, it was established that at the time the compromise was executed the Complainant was not abroad and, therefore, given the current information technology it would have been easy or convenient for Respondent to have informed his client about it. Admittedly, his failure in this regard had only given Complainant the reason to cast doubt on his real intention in agreeing to the compromise agreement for and in his behalf.<br><br>It would seem, however, that by Complainant's act of demanding the amount from Respondent, the former may have already ignored the issue on the lack of authority on his part thus curing the defect on the latter's authority to enter into the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that "[a] lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Members of the bar must always conduct themselves in a way that promotes "public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Even though complainant Luna effectively abandoned the issue on respondent Atty. Galarrita's lack of authority to compromise the civil case when he demanded the payment of the settlement proceeds, this does not erase his acts of abusing the trust and confidence reposed in him by complainant Luna.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Worse, respondent Atty. Galarrita not only failed to promptly inform complainant Luna of the former's receipt of the P100,000.00 settlement proceeds but also refused to turn over the amount to complainant Luna.<br><br>This court has held that "any money collected for the client or other trust property coming into the lawyer's possession should promptly be reported by him [or her]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> ( Rule 16.03 under Canon 6 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that:<br><blockquote>CANON 16 - A lawyer shall hold in trust all moneys and properties of his client that may come into his possession.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rule 16.03 - A lawyer shall deliver the funds and property of his client when due or upon demand.

He shall also have a lien to the same extent on all judgments and executions he has secured for his client as provided for in the Rules of Court.<br></blockquote>In several cases, we have disciplined lawyers who failed or refused to remit amounts received for and on behalf of their clients.

Galarrita still continued to act in bad faith by refusing to turn over the P100,000.00 settlement amount received. The Integrated Bar of the Philippines Investigating Commissioner found that:<br><blockquote>On another point, there seems no cogent proof, too, that Respondent had been advised of Complainant's supposed agreement to Mr. Calvario's payment of P100,000.00. Despite R[es]pondent's allegations that he had informed Complainant about his so-called counsel's report, it remains undisputed that the Complainant did not give him any express approval of the same.<br><br>There is to the undersigned enough <i>indicia</i> to conclude that Respondent had committed bad faith in entering into the Compromise Agreement. From February 2006 to November 2010, or a period of four (4) years, Respondent failed to turn-over the P100,000.00 he had collected from Mr. Calvario to Complainant. Worse, he failed to seasonably inform Complainant about the same. He kept the money and claimed he had the right to retain the same invoking the counsel's right to a retaining line [sic]. He pointed out that Complainant had incurred accrued attorney's fees which he is bound to pay under the general retainer agreement. Thus, it is not amiss to state that he entered into the said agreement with the odious motivation to hold on to it and pave the way for the payment of his attorney's fees. In so doing, he violated the trust reposed in him by his client and violated Rule 16.03 of the Code of [Professional Responsibility.<br><br>As to Respondent's invocation of the lawyer's retaining lien and his retention of the money, the undersigned deems the same unlawful. True, the Code of Professional Responsibility allows the lawyer to apply so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his lawful fees and disbursements, giving notice promptly thereafter to his client. But this provision assumes that the client agrees with the lawyer as to the amount of attorney's fees and as to the application of the client's fund to pay his lawful fees and disbursements, in which case he may deduct what is due him and remit the balance to his client, with full disclosure on every detail. <b><i>Without the client's consent, the lawyer has no authority to apply the client's money for his fees, but he should instead return the money to his client, without prejudice to his filing a case to recover his unsatisfied fees.</i></b><br><br>. . . .<br><br>On Respondent's argument that prescription has already set in against Complainant, suffice it to state that the rules have already been supplanted by a new set of rules which do not anymore carry the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Administrative proceedings require only substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> This court accepts and adopts the findings of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors, but with modification increasing the period of suspension from the practice of law to two (2) years considering that respondent Atty.

Galarrita does not deny his receipt of the P100,000.00 but justifies his refusal to turn over the amount by invoking jurisprudence on retaining lien.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> The Rules of Court provides for attorney's retaining lien as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 37. <i>Attorney's liens</i>. - An attorney shall have a lien upon the funds, documents and papers of his client which have lawfully come into his possession and may retain the same until his lawful fees and disbursements have been paid, and may apply such funds to the satisfaction thereof. He shall also have a lien to the same extent upon all judgments for the payment of money, and executions issued in pursuance of such judgments, which he has secured in a litigation of his client, from and after the time when he shall have caused a statement of his claim of such lien to be entered upon the records of the court rendering such judgment, or issuing such execution, and shall have caused written notice thereof to be delivered to his client and to the adverse party; and he shall have the same right and power over such judgments and executions as his client would have enforce his lien and secure the payment of his just fees and disbursements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>First, "lawyer[s] [are] not entitled to unilaterally appropriate [their] clients['] money for [themselves] by the mere fact that the client[s] [owe] [them] attorney's fees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> They must give prompt notice to their clients of any receipt of funds for or on behalf of their clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Rule 16.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides for a lawyer's duty to "account for all money or property collected or received for or from the client."<br><br>Respondent Atty. Galarrita refused to comply with these duties, warranting his suspension from the practice of law.<br><br>Second, the elements required for full recognition of attorney's lien are: "(1) lawyer-client relationship; (2) lawful possession of the client's funds, documents and papers; and (3) unsatisfied claim for attorney's fees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>Respondent Atty. Galarrita must prove the existence of all these elements. However, this is not the main issue in this disbarment case against him, and the validity of his retaining lien defense was not established.
