				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Only natural-born Filipinos who owe total and undivided allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines could run for and hold elective public office.</i><br><br>Before this Court is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the <i>Per Curiam </i>Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated December 9, 2013 of respondent Commission on Elections (Comelec) <i>En Banc</i> in SPA No. 13-309 (DC), which affirmed the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated September 6, 2013 of the Comelec Second Division. The Comelec, relying on our ruling in <i>Maquiling v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> disqualified petitioner Rommel C. Arnado (Arnado) from running in the May 13, 2013 elections, set aside his proclamation as elected mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, and declared respondent Florante T. Capitan (Capitan) as the duly elected mayor of said municipality.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Arnado is a natural-born Filipino citizen who lost his Philippine citizenship after he was naturalized as citizen of the United States of America (USA). Subsequently, and in preparation for his plans to run for public office in the Philippines, Arnado applied for repatriation under Republic Act No. 9225<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (RA 9225) before the Consul General of the Philippines in San Franciso, USA. He took an Oath of Allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines on July 10, 2008 and, on even date, an Order of Approval of Citizenship Retention and ReÂ­ acquisition was issued in his favor. On April 3, 2009, Arnado executed an Affidavit of Renunciation of his foreign citizenship.<br><br>On November 30, 2009, Arnado filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte for the May 10, 2010 national and local elections.<br><br>Linog C. Balua (Balua), another mayoralty candidate, however, filed a petition to disqualify Arnado and/or to cancel his CoC on the ground, among others, that Arnado remained a US citizen because he continued to use his US passport for entry to and exit from the Philippines after executing aforesaid Affidavit of Renunciation.<br><br>While Balua's petition remained pending, the May 10, 2010 elections proceeded where Arnado garnered the highest number of votes for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan. He was proclaimed the winning candidate.<br><br>On October 5, 2010, the Comelec First Division issued a Resolution holding that Arnado's continued use of his US passport effectively negated his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation. Thus, he was disqualified to run for public office for failure to comply with the requirements of RA 9225. The Comelec First Division accordingly nullified his proclamation and held that the rule on succession should be followed.<br><br>Arnado moved for reconsideration. In the meantime, Casan Macode Maquiling (Maquiling), another mayoralty candidate who garnered the second highest number of votes, intervened in the case. He argued that the Comelec First Division erred in applying the rule on succession.<br><br>On February 2, 2011, the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> rendered a Resolution reversing the ruling of the Comelec First Division. It held that Arnado's use of his US passport did not operate to revert his status to dual citizenship. The Comelec <i>En Banc</i> found merit in Arnado's explanation that he continued to use his US passport because he did not yet know that he had been issued a Philippine passport at the time of the relevant foreign trips. The Comelec <i>En Banc </i>further noted that, after receiving his Philippine passport, Arnado used the same for his subsequent trips.<br><br>Maquiling then sought recourse to this Court by filing a petition docketed as G.R No. 195649.<br><br>While G.R No. 195649 was pending, the period for the filing of CoCs for local elective officials for the May 13, 2013 elections officially began. On October 1, 2012, Arnado filed his CoC<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[6]</sup></font> for the same position. Respondent Capitan also filed his CoC for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan.<br><br>On April 16, 2013, this Court rendered its Decision in <i>Maquiling</i>. Voting 10-5, it annulled and set aside the Comelec <i>En Banc'</i>s February 2, 2011 Resolution, disqualified Arnado from running for elective position, and declared Maquiling as the duly elected mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao Del Norte in the May 10, 2010 elections. In so ruling, the majority of the Members of the Court opined that in his subsequent use of his US passport, Arnado effectively disavowed or recalled his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with the pronouncement of the COMELEC First Division that "Arnado's act of consistently using his US passport effectively negated his "Affidavit of Renunciation." Tills does not mean that he failed to comply with the twin requirements under R.A. No. 9225, for he in fact did. It was after complying with the requirements that he perfonned positive acts which effectively disqualified him from running for an elective public office pursuant to Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code of 1991. <br><br>The purpose of the Local Government Code in disqualifying dual citizens from running for any elective public office would be thwarted if we were to allow a person who has earlier renounced his foreign citizenship, but who subsequently represents himself as a foreign citizen, to hold any public office.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We therefore hold that Arnado, by using his US passport after renouncing his American citizenship, has recanted the same Oath of Renunciation he took. Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code applies to his situation. He is disqualified not only from holding the public office but even from becoming a candidate in the May 2010 elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>The issuance of this Court's April 16, 2013 Decision sets the stage for the present controversy.<br><br>On May 9, 2013 or shortly after the Court issued its Decision in <i>Maquiling</i>, Arnado executed an Affidavit Affirming Rommel C. Arnado's "Affidavit of Renunciation Dated April3, 2009."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The following day or on May 10, 2013, Capitan, Arnado's lone rival for the mayoralty post, filed a Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> seeking to disqualify him from running for municipal mayor of Kauswagan and/or to cancel his CoC based on the ruling of this Court in <i>Maquiling</i>. The case was docketed as SPA No. 13-309 (DC) and was raffled to the Comelec's Second Division. The resolution of said petition was, however, overtaken by the May 13, 2013 elections where Arnado garnered 8,902 votes (84% of the total votes cast) while Capitan obtained 1,707 (16% of the total votes cast) votes only.<br><br>On May 14, 2013, Arnado was proclaimed as the winning candidate.<br><br>Unfazed, Capitan filed another Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> this time seeking to nullify Arnado's proclamation. He argued that with the April 16, 2013 Decision of this Court in <i>Maquiling,</i> there is no doubt that Arnado is disqualified from running for any local elective office. Hence, Arnado's proclamation is void and without any legal effect.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Comelec Second Division</i></b><br><br>On September 6, 2013, the Comelec Second Division promulgated a Resolution granting the petition in SPA No. 13-309 (DC) and disqualify Arnado from running in the May 13, 2013 elections. Following Maquiling, it ratiocinated that at the time he filed his CoC on October 1, 2012, Arnado still failed to comply with the requirement of RA 9225 of making a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship. While he executed the April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation, the same was deemed withdrawn or recalled when he subsequently traveled abroad using his US passport, as held in <i>Maquiling.</i><br><br>The Comelec Second Division also noted that Arnado failed to execute another Affidavit of Renunciation for purposes of the May 13, 2013 elections. While a May 9, 2013 Affidavit Affirming Rommel C. Arnado's "Affidavit of Renunciation dated April 3, 2009" was submitted in evidence, the same would not suffice because it should have been executed on or before the filing of the CoC on October 1, 2012.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Comelec Second Division's Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is granted. Respondent Rommel Cagoco Arnado is disqualified from running in the 13 May 2013 National and Local Elections.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Comelec En Banc</i></b><br><br>Aggrieved, Arnado filed a Verified Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He argued that the Comelec Second Division erred in applying <i>Maquiling</i> claiming that the said case is not on all fours with the present controversy; that Capitan's Petition was filed beyond the 25-day reglementary period reckoned from the filing of the CoC sought to be cancelled; and, that the Comelec must uphold the sovereign will of the people of Kauswagan who expressed, thru the ballots, their overwhelming support for him as their mayor. Arnado prayed that the Comelec Second Division's September 6, 2013 Resolution be reversed and that he be declared as eligible to run for mayor ofKauswagan.<br><br>On December 9, 2013, the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> affirmed the ruling of the Comelec Second Division. It accordingly annulled the proclamation of Arnado and declared Capitan as the duly elected mayor of Kauswagan. The dispositive portion of the Comelec <i>En Banc'</i>s Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant motion for reconsideration is hereby DISMISSED. The Proclamation of Private Respondent Rommel C. Arnado as the duly elected mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. FLORANTE T. CAPITAN is hereby DECLARED the duly elected Mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte inthe May 13, 2013 Elections.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, on December 16, 2013 Arnado filed the instant Petition with ancillary prayer for injunctive relief to maintain the status <i>quo ante</i>. On December<br><br>26, 2013, Arnado filed an Urgent Motion for Issuance of Status Quo Ante Order or Temporary Restraining Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in view of the issuance by the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> of a Writ of Execution to implement its December 9, 2013 Resolution.<br><br>On January 14, 2014, this Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> requiring the respondents to file their respective comments on the petition. In the same Resolution, this Court granted Arnado's ancillary relief for temporary restraining order.<br><br>Capitan thus filed an Urgent Motion to Lift and/or Dissolve Temporary Restraining Order dated January 14, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> contending that the acts sought to be restrained by Arnado are already<i> fait accompli.</i> He alleged that the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>had already issued a Writ of Execution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and pursuant thereto a Special Municipal Board of Canvassers was convened. It proclaimed him to be the duly elected mayor of Kauswagan and on January 2, 2014 he took his oath of office. Since then, he has assumed and performed the duties and functions of his office.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated February 25, 2014, this Court ordered the issuance of a Status <i>Quo Ante</i> Order directing the parties to allow Arnado to continue performing his functions as mayor of Kauswagan pending resolution of this case.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>In support of his Petition, Arnado raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>WHETHER x x x THE COMELEC EN BANC AND 2<sup>ND</sup> DIVISION VIOLATED PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS AND COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FAILING TO DISMISS THE PETITIONS OF RESPONDENT CAPITAN ON THE GROUND OF FORUM-SHOPPING AND/OR LATE FILING, ETC.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>WHETHER x x x THE COMELEC EN BANC VIOLATED DUE PROCESS AND COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY ALLOWING COM.

He avers that Capitan is guilty of forum-shopping because the latter subsequently filed a similar case docketed as SPC No. 13-019. In addition, SPA No. 13-309 (DC) was filed beyond the 25-day prescriptive period reckoned from the time of the filing of his CoC on October 1, 2012.<br><br>Arnado likewise claims that the proceeding before the Comelec is peppered with procedural infirmities. He asserts that the Comelec violated its own rules in deciding SPA No. 13-309 (DC) without first resolving Capitan's motion to consolidate; that SPA No. 13-309 (DC) was not set for trial and no hearing for the reception of evidence was ever conducted; and, that the Comelec did not follow its own rules requiring the issuance of a notice of promulgation of resolutions.<br><br>Arnado further claims that the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> not only committed grave abuse of discretion but also violated his constitutional right to due process when it allowed Commissioner Elias R. Yusoph (Commissioner Yusoph) to participate in the review of the Decision he penned for the Second Division. Furthermore, the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> committed grave abuse of discretion when it disqualified him from running in the May 13, 2013 elections, thereby disenfranchising 84% of the voters of Kauswagan who all voted for him.<br><br>Finally, Arnado avers that further inquiry and examination of the notarial register of his former counsel, Atty. Thomas Dean M. Quijano, revealed that he executed an Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of Allegiance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on November 30, 2009. Hence, at the time he filed his CoC on October 1, 2012, he is a citizen of the Philippines who does not owe allegiance to any other country and, therefore, is qualified to run for mayor of Kauswagan in the May 13, 2013 elections.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition is devoid of merit.<br><br><b><i>Petition for certiorari is limited to the <br>determination of whether the respondent<br> tribunal acted with grave abuse of discretion<br> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.</i></b><br><br>In a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the primordial issue to be resolved is whether the respondent tribunal committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed resolution. And as a matter of policy, this Court will not interfere with the resolutions of the Comelec unless it is shown that it had committed grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion, a Rule 64 petition will not prosper. Jurisprudence, on the other hand, defines grave abuse of discretion as the "capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> "Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Grave abuse of discretion has likewise been defined as an act done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In this case, and as will be discussed below, there is no showing that the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> acted capriciously or whimsically in issuing its December 9, 2013 Resolution. Neither did it act contrary to law or jurisprudence.<br><br><b><i>Arnado's allegations that Capitan<br>violated the rule against forumÂ­shopping <br>and that the latter's petition in<br>SPA No.13-309(DC) was filed late,<br>unsubstantiated and erroneous.</i></b><br><br>There is forum-shopping when two or more actions or proceedings, founded on the same cause, are instituted by a party on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It exists when the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Thus, there is forum-shopping when in both actions there exist: (1) identity of parties, or at least such parties as would represent the same interests in both actions; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (3) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Here, Arnado failed to substantiate his claim of forum-shopping. He merely made a general averment that in resolving the petitions of Capitan in SPA No. 13-309 (OC) and SPC No. 13-019, the Comelec <i>En Banc</i>, as well as its Second Division, failed to comply with this Court's Revised Circular No. 28-91,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> without demonstrating how forum-shopping was supposed to be present. He has not shown that the petitions in SPA No. 13-309 (DC) and SPC No. 13-019 involved the same parties, issues, and reliefs. In fact, Arnado did not even bother to submit to this Court a copy of the Petition in SPC No. 13-019 (annulment of proclamation case). As the party insisting that Capitan committed forum-shopping, Arnado bears the burden of establishing the same. After all, it is settled that he who alleges has the burden of proving it; mere allegation is not sufficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Besides, and as correctly observed by the Solicitor General, the parties in SPA No. 13-309 (DC) and SPC No. 13-019 are not the same. In the first case, the parties are only Capitan and Arnado. In the second case, the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte is impleaded as respondent. There is also dissimilitude in the reliefs sought. The former case sought to disqualify Arnado and/or to cancel his CoC while the latter case prayed for the annulment of Arnado's proclamation as mayor of Kauswagan.<br><br>With regard to the alleged tardiness in the filing of Capitan's Petition in SPA No. 13-309 (DC), it appears that Arnado either failed to grasp the import of Capitan's allegations therein or he made a deliberate partial misrepresentation in stating that the same is one for cancellation of CoC. A copy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> thereof annexed to Arnado's herein petition states that it is a petition "to disqualify and/or cancel the certificate of candidacy" of Arnado. The allegations therein state in no uncertain terms that it is one for disqualification based on Arnado's failure to comply with the requisites of RA 9225 and on the ruling of this Court in <i>Maquiling</i>. Thus, the Comelec Second Division appropriately treated it as a petition for disqualification with the alternative prayer to cancel Arnado's CoC. It is elementary that the nature of the action is determined by the allegations in the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Under Section 3, Rule 25 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> a petition for disqualification should be filed "any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy <i>but not later than the date of proclamation</i>." Here, Arnado was proclaimed as the winning candidate on May 14, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, the petition in SPA No. 13-309 (DC) was seasonably filed on May 10, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b><i>The other procedural lapses allegedly<br>committed by the Comelec are likewise <br>unsubstantiated. Assuming the allegations of <br>Arnado to be true, the Comelec did not commit<br>grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or<br>excess of jurisdiction.</i></b><br><br>Arnado's claim that the Comelec gravely abused its discretion in deciding SPA No. 13-309 (DC) without first resolving Capitan's motion to consolidate likewise lacks substantiation. In the first place, Arnado has not attached a copy of said motion to his petition. This alone is sufficient ground for the dismissal of his Rule 64 Petition, filed in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, for not being accompanied by pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Also, it was Capitan who filed the motion for consolidation. Not being the movant, Arnado is not in a position to question the alleged inaction of the Comelec on said motion. And even assuming that he has, by filing a Verified Motion for Reconsideration with the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> and subsequently appealing to this Court despite the still unresolved motion for consolidation, Arnado effectively abandoned said motion for consolidation. In <i>Cayago v. Hon. Lina</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> it was held that once a party elevates the case before the appellate tribunal, the appellant is deemed to have abandoned the unresolved motion which remains pending with the tribunal of origin. "[I]t is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards make a <i>volte face</i> and deny that same jurisdiction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In any case, under Section 9, Rule 3 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure, consolidation is only permissive. It is not mandatory. Section 9 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 9. Consolidation of Cases.- When an action or proceeding involves a question of law and fact which is similar to or common with that of another action or proceeding, the same may be consolidated with the action or proceeding bearing the lower docket number.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>MuÃ±oz v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> this Court accentuated "that the term '<i>may</i>' is indicative of a mere possibility, an opportunity or an option. The grantee of that opportunity is vested with a right or faculty which he has the option to exercise. If he chooses to exercise the right, he must comply with the conditions attached thereto, which in this case require that the cases to be consolidated must involve similar questions of law and fact."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, the consolidation of SPA No. 13-309 (DC) and SPC No. 13-019 does not appear to be necessary. As earlier mentioned, said cases do not even involve the same parties and reliefs sought. Hence, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the Comelec in not consolidating them.<br><br>Arnado's protestation that the Comelec violated its own rules when it decided SPA No. 13-309 (DC) without setting it for trial likewise deserves scant consideration.&nbsp; The proceedings in a special action for disqualification of candidates under Rule 25 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure are summary in nature where a trial type proceeding may be dispensed with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Diangka v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Again, our ingrained jurisprudence is that technical rules of evidence should not be rigorously applied in administrative proceedings specially where the law calls for the proceeding to be summary in character. Pursuant to Section 4, Rule 25 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure, petitions for disqualifications are subject to summary hearings. In relation thereto, Section 3, Rule 17 of the said Rules provides that it remains in the sound discretion of the COMELEC whether clarification questions are to be asked the witnesses-affiants, and whether the adverse party is to be granted opportunity to cross-examine said witnessesÂ­ affiants. Furthermore, when the COMELEC en banc reviews and evaluates a party's petition, or as in the case at bar, a party's answer and the supporting papers attached thereto, the same is tantamount to a fair "hearing" of his case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Arnado's claim that the Comelec En Banc<br>committed grave abuse of discretion and violated <br>his right to due process in allowing Commissioner<br>Yusoph to participate in the deliberation of the assailed<br>Comelec En Banc Resolution is likewise bereft of<br>substantiation.</i></b><br><br>Arnado's claim that Commissioner Yusoph penned both the September 6, 2013 Resolution of the Comelec Second Division and the December 9, 2013 Resolution of the Comelec<i> En Banc</i> is not correct. While Commissioner Yusoph, together with Commissioners Maria Gracia Cielo M. Padaca and Luie Tito F. Guia, signed said Resolution, there is nothing therein which would indicate that Commissioner Yusoph was the writer or the<i> ponente </i>of said Resolution. The September 6, 2013 Resolution of the Comelec Second Division does not state who the <i>ponente</i> is. The same goes true with the questioned December 9, 2013 <i>Per Curiam</i> Resolution<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[43]</sup></font> of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i>. As a <i>per curiam</i> resolution, it was arrived at by the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> as a whole and without any particular <i>ponente.</i> Hence, we need not belabor Arnado's claim of denial of due process as his basis therefor lacks factual moorings.<br><br><b><i>Arnado has not yet satisfied the twin <br>requirements of Section 5(2) of RA 9225 at<br>the time he filed his CoC for the May 13, 2013<br>elections; subsequent compliance does not suffice.</i></b><br><br>Under Section 4(d) of the Local Government Code, a person with "dual citizenship" is disqualified from running for any elective local position.&nbsp; In <i>Mercado v. anzan</i>o,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> it was clarified that the phrase "dual citizenship" in said Section 4(d) must be understood as referring to "dual allegiance.''<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Subsequent, Congress enacted RA 9225 allowing natural-born citizens of the Philippines who have lost their Philippine citizenship by reason of their naturalization abroad to reacquire Philippine citizenship and to enjoy full civil and political rights upon compliance with the requirements of the law. They may now run for public office in the Philippines provided that they: (1) meet the qualifications for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws; and, (2) make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenships before any public officer authorized to administer an oath46 prior to or at the time of filing of their CoC. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Civil and Political Rights and Liabilities</i>- Those who retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines and the following conditions:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) Those seeking elective public office in the Philippines shall meet the qualification for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath;</blockquote><br>In the case at bench, the Comelec Second Division, as affirmed by the Comelec <i>En Banc</i>, ruled that Arnado failed to comply with the second requisite of Section 5 (2) of RA 9225 because, as held in <i>Maquiling v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation was deemed withdrawn when he used his US passport after executing said affidavit. Consequently, at the time he filed his CoC on October 1, 2012 for purposes of the May 13, 2013 elections, Arnado had yet to comply with said second requirement. The Comelec also noted that while Arnado submitted an affidavit dated May 9, 2013, affirming his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation, the same would not suffice for having been belatedly executed.<br><br>The Comelec <i>En Banc</i> did not err, nor did it commit grave abuse of discretion, in upholding the Resolution of the Comelec Second Division disqualifying Arnado from running for public office. It is worth noting that the reason for Arnado's disqualification to run for public office during the 2010 elections â being a candidate without total and undivided allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines - still subsisted when he filed his CoC for the 2013 elections on October 1, 2012. The Comelec <i>En Banc</i> merely adhered to the ruling of this Court in <i>Maquiling</i> lest it would be committing grave abuse of discretion had it departed therefrom.<br><br>Moreover, it cannot be validly argued that Arnado should be given the opportunity to correct the deficiency in his qualification because at the time this Court promulgated its Decision in <i>Maquiling</i> on April 16, 2013, the period for filing the CoC for local elective office had already lapsed. Or, as Justice Arturo D. Brion puts it in his Dissenting Opinion, "[t]o the extent that Arnado was denied the chance to submit a replacement oath of renunciation in 2013, then there was an unfair and abusive denial of opportunity equivalent to grave abuse of discretion." Besides, shortly after learning of the Court's April 16, 2013 ruling in <i>Maquiling</i> or on May 9, 2013, Arnado substantially complied therewith by executing an affidavit affirming his April3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation.<br><br>The ruling in <i>Maquiling</i> is indeed novel in the sense that it was the first case dealing with the effect of the use of a foreign passport on the qualification to run for public office of a natural-born Filipino citizen who was naturalized abroad and subsequently availed of the privileges under RA 9225. It was settled in that case that the use of a foreign passport amounts to repudiation or recantation of the oath of renunciation. Yet, despite the issue being novel and of first impression, plus the fact that Arnado could not have divined the possible adverse consequences of using his US passport, the Court in <i>Maquiling</i> did not act with leniency or benevolence towards Arnado. Voting 10-5, the Court ruled that matters dealing with qualifications for public elective office must be strictly complied with. Otherwise stated, the Court in <i>Maquiling</i> did not consider the novelty of the issue as to excuse Arnado from strictly complying with the eligibility requirements to run for public office or to simply allow him to correct the deficiency in his qualification by submitting another oath of renunciation. Thus, it is with more reason that in this case, we should similarly require strict compliance with the qualifications to run for local elective office.<br><br>The circumstances surrounding the qualification of Arnado to run for public office during the May 10, 2010 and May 13, 2013 elections, to reiterate for emphasis, are the same. Arnado's use of his US passport in 2009 invalidated his oath of renunciation resulting in his disqualification to run for mayor of Kauswagan in the 2010 elections. Since then and up to the time he filed his CoC for the 2013 elections, Arnado had not cured the defect in his qualification. <i>Maquiling</i>, therefore, is binding on and applicable to this case following the salutary doctrine of <i>stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>, which means to adhere to precedents, and not to unsettle things which are established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Under the doctrine, "[w]hen the court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases where facts are substantially the same."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It enjoins adherence to judicial precedents and bars relitigation of the same issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>It may not be amiss to add that as early as 2010, the year when Balua filed a petition to disqualify him, Arnado has gotten wind that the use of his US passport might pose a problem to his candidacy. In other words, when Arnado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012, he was not totally unaware that the use of his US passport after he had executed the Affidavit of Renunciation might have an impact on his qualification and candidacy. In fact, at that time, <i>Maquiling</i> had already reached this Court. But despite the petitions filed against him questioning his qualification to run for public office in 2010, Arnado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012 unmindful of any possible legal setbacks in his candidacy for the 2013 elections and without executing another Affidavit of Renunciation. In short, the argument that Arnado should be given the opportunity to correct the deficiency in his CoC since <i>Maquiling</i> was promulgated after the lapse of the period for filing a CoC for the 2013 elections, is totally bereft of merit. Consistent with our April 16, 2013 ruling in <i>Maquiling</i>, Arnado should be made to face the consequences of his inaction since he could have remedied it at the time he filed his CoC on October 1, 2012 or even before that. There is no law prohibiting him from executing an Affidavit of Renunciation every election period if only to avert possible questions about his qualifications.<br><br><b><i>The alleged November 30, 2009<br>Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of<br>Allegiance cannot be given any<br>probative weight.</i></b><br><br>As to the alleged recently discovered November 30, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of Allegiance, the same is highly suspect. As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General, the original or certified true copy thereof was not presented. In addition, such crucial evidence sufficient to alter the outcome of the case was never presented before the Comelec much less in the<i> Maquiling</i> case.&nbsp; Curiously, it only surfaced for the first time in this petition. In <i>Jacot v. Dal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this Court disallowed the belated presentation of similar evidence on due process considerations. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>As a rule, no question will be entertained on appeal unless it has been raised in the proceedings below. Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court, administrative agency or quasi- judicial body need not be considered by a reviewing court, as they cannot be raised for the first time at that late stage. Basic considerations of fairness and due process impel this rule. Courts have neither the time nor the resources to accommodate parties who chose to go to trial haphazardly.<br><br>Likewise, this Court does not countenance the late submission of evidence. Petitioner should have offered the Affidavit dated 7 February 2007 during the proceedings before the COMELEC.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 43 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides that "In the absence of any applicable provisions of these Rules, the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court in the Philippines shall be applicable by analogy or in suppletory character and effect." Section 34 of Rule 132 of the Revised Rules of Court categorically enjoins the admission of evidence not formally presented:<br><blockquote>SEC. 34. <i>Offer of evidence</i>.- The court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered. The purpose for which the evidence is offered must be specified.<br></blockquote><br>Since the said Affidavit was not formally offered before the COMELEC, respondent had no opportunity to examine and controvert it. To admit this document would be contrary to due process. Additionally, the piecemeal presentation of evidence is not in accord with orderly justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, in <i>Maquiling</i> it was mentioned that Arnado used his US passport on January 12, 2010 and March 23, 2010. Thus:<br><br>Balua likewise presented a certification from the Bureau of Immigration dated 23 April 201 0, certifying that the name "Arnado, Rommel Cagoco" appears in the available Computer Database/Passenger manifest/IBM listing on file as of 21 April 2010, with the following pertinent travel records:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="35%"><div align="JUSTIFY">DATE OF Arrival </div></td> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td width="55%"><div align="JUSTIFY">01/12/2010</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">NATIONALITY</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">USA-AMERICAN</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">PASSPORT </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">057782700</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">DATE OF Arrival</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">03/23/2010</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">NATIONALITY</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">USA-AMERICAN</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">PASSPORT</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">057782700<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Despite the existence of such statement in<i> Maquiling</i>, We are puzzled why Arnado never bothered to correct or refute it. He neither alleged nor presented evidence in this petition to prove that he did not travel abroad on those dates using his US passport.<br><br>Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, however, dissents and maintains the same position he had taken in <i>Maquiling</i> that Arnado's use of his US passport in 2009 is an isolated act justified by the circumstances at that time. At any rate, Arnado started to use his Philippine passport in his travels abroad beginning December 11, 2009 and thenceforth. This, according to J. Leonen, is borne out by Arnado's Philippine passport.<br><br>With due respect to my esteemed colleague, it appears that J. Leonen is not only reviving an issue that had already been settled with finality in the <i>Maquiling</i> case, but he is also going beyond the issues raised in this petition. To reiterate for clarity, Arnado's argument in this case-that he is qualified to run for mayor as he has satisfied the requirements of Sec. 5(2) of RA 9225 relative to the May 13, 2013 elections- is premised only on the alleged newly discovered November 30, 2009 Affidavit. Nothing more. He does not claim in this case that his use of US passport in his travel abroad in 2009 is an isolated act, as J. Leonen insists. In <i>Vazquez v. De Borja</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> it was held that courts do not have jurisdiction over issues neither raised in the pleading nor tried with the express or implied consent of the parties. They cannot render judgment based on issues that have never been raised before them. Equally settled is the rule that "points of law, theories, issues, and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower [tribunal] need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time at such late stage. Basic considerations of due process underlie this rule."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The same goes true with J. Brion's theory that what was cancelled by virtue of <i>Maquiling</i> was only the April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation where Arnado expressly renounced any foreign citizenship; not the July 10, 2008 Oath of Allegiance which carried with it an implied abdication of foreign citizenship. For J. Brion, "[t]he requirement of an express renunciation x x x does not negate the effect of, or make any less real, the prior implicit renunciation of citizenship and allegiance made upon taking the oath of allegiance." Again, this was never raised in this petition. At any rate, the execution of an Oath of Allegiance is required by Section 3<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[56]</sup></font> of RA 9225. For those who avail themselves of RA 9225 and intend to run for public office, Section 5(2) thereof provides the additional requirement of making a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenships prior to or at the time of filing of their CoC. Definitely, the provisions of Section 5(2) are not useless or meaningless surplusage. When the law expressly requires an explicit renunciation, an implicit one would be insufficient. Furthermore, even assuming that Arnado's 2008 implied renunciation is sufficient, the same has also been negated by his use of his US passport in 2009, following the ruling in <i>Maquiling</i>.<br><br>Otherwise, we would give more weight to an implied renunciation than to an express one specifically required by law.<br><br>Besides, the Decision of this Court in <i>Maquiling</i> holding that Arnado's use of his US passport effectively recanted his Affidavit of Renunciation has already become final and immutable. We can no longer resurrect in this case the issues that have already been resolved there with fmality.<br><br>In maintaining that Arnado used his Philippine passport in travelling abroad in the first quarter of 2010, J. Leonen relies on the copy thereof attached to the <i>rollo</i> of the <i>Maquiling</i> case. But said copy of Arnado's Philippine passport<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> is a mere "CERTIFIED TRUE COPY <b>FROM THE MACIDNE COPY ON FILE</b>" as attested to by Rosario P. Palacio, Records Officer Ill of the Comelec.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This is clearly stamped on aforesaid copy of Arnado's Philippine passport. A machine copy or photocopy is a mere secondary evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> As such, it cannot be admitted in evidence until and unless the offeror has proven the due execution and the subsequent loss or unavailability of the original.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In this case, however, Arnado's Philippine passport is not missing. Thus, said photocopy of Arnado's Philippine passport cannot sway us to depart from the uncontroverted certification of the Bureau ofimmigration that Arnado used his US passport on January 12, 2010 and March 23, 2010. Consequently, even assuming that the recently discovered November 30, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of Allegiance is true and authentic, Arnado once more performed positive acts on January 12, 2010 and March 23, 2010, which effectively negated the alleged November 30, 2009 Affidavit resulting in his disqualification to run for an elective public office.<br><br><b><i>Landslide election victory cannot<br>override eligibility requirements.</i></b><br><br>In Maquiling, this Court emphasized that popular vote does not cure the ineligibility of a candidate. Thus, while in this case Arnado won by landslide majority during the 2013 elections, garnering 84% of the total votes cast, the same "cannot override the constitutional and statutory requirements for qualifications and disqualifications."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In <i>Velasco v. Comelec,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court pronounced that election victory cannot be used as a magic formula to bypass election eligibility requirements; otherwise, certain provisions of laws pertaining to elections will become toothless. One of which is Section 39 of the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies the basic positive qualifications of local government officials. If in Velasco the Court ruled that popular vote cannot override the required qualifications under Section 39,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> <i>a fortiori</i>, there is no reason why the Court should not follow the same policy when it comes to disqualifications enumerated under Section 40<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the same law. After all, "[t]he qualifications set out in [Section 39] are roughly half of the requirements for election to local public offices. The other half is contained in the succeeding section which lays down the circumstances that disqualify local candidates."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Finally, this case is strikingly similar to the case of <i>Lopez v. Comelec</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In that case, petitioner Lopez was also a natural-born Filipino who lost his Philippine citizenship after he became a naturalized US citizen. He later reacquired his Philippine citizenship by virtue of RA 9225. Thereafter, Lopez filed his candidacy for Chairman of <i>Barangay</i> Bagacay, San Dionisio, Iloilo in the synchronized <i>Barangay</i> and <i>Sangguniang Kabataan</i> Elections held on October 29, 2007 without first making a personal and sworn renunciation of his foreign citizenship. In spite of the fact that Lopez won in the elections, this Court still affmned the Resolution of the Comelec disqualifying Lopez as a candidate for a local elective position for his failure to comply with the requirements of Section 5(2) of RA 9225. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>While it is true that petitioner won the elections, took his oath and began to discharge the functions of Barangay Chairman, his victory cannot cure the defect of his candidacy. Garnering the most number of votes does not validate the election of a disqualified candidate because the application of the constitutional and statutory provisions on disqualification is not a matter of popularity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>In fine, this Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> in sustaining the Resolution of the Comelec Second Division disqualifying Arnado from running in the May 13, 2013 elections and in accordingly setting aside his proclamation as elected mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte and proclaiming Capitan as the duly elected mayor of said municipality.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> and the assailed Comelec Resolutions are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.

In this case the Court differentiated dual citizenship from dual allegiance as follows:<br><br>The former arises when, as a result of the concurrent application of the different laws of two or more states, a person is simultaneously considered a national by the said states. For instance, such a situation may arise when a person whose parents are citizens of a state which adheres to the principle of <i>jus sanguinis</i> is born in a state which follows the doctrine of <i>jus soli.</i> Such a person, <i>ipso facto</i> and without any voluntary act on his part, is concurrently considered a citizen of both states. Considering the citizenship clause (Art.

Arnado (Arnado) was qualified to run for public office in the 201 0 elections. It did not operate as, nor was it intended to be, a final determination of Arnado's citizenship that would forever derail his career as a public official.<br><br>In <i>Maquiling</i>, we reiterated that natural-born citizens of the Philippines who have lost their citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign country may qualify to run for public office upon taking the Oath of Allegiance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and making a sworn renunciation of their foreign citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Arnado subjected his citizenship to attack when he continued to use his United States (US) passport to travel in and out of the country despite previously renouncing his US citizenship. The Court ruled that his use of his US passport nullified the effect of his previous renunciation of US citizenship. While he did not lose his Philippine citizenship in the process, he reverted to his status as a dual citizen and remained as such at the time that he filed his Certificate of Candidacy for the position of mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte in the 2010 elections. Under Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code, those with dual citizenship are disqualified from running for any elective local position.<br><br>Considering that the Court had pinpointed the defect in Arnado's oath of renunciation, the simple act of taking the oath anew would have been enough compliance with the requirement of the law.<br><br>The Decision found that from the time Arnado used his US passport to travel in and out of the country up to the filing of his Certificate of Candidacy for the succeeding elections in 2013, there had been no change in his circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He still had not made a sworn renunciation of his US citizenship. Thus, the ruling in <i>Maquiling</i> still applies: that Arnado had dual citizenship when he filed for his candidacy on 1 October 2012.<br><br>It did not matter that <i>Maquiling</i> was promulgated months after Arnado had filed for candidacy. Since he was not totally unaware that the use of his US passport might have adverse consequences on his candidacy for the 2013 elections, the Decision concludes that he should have been prudent enough to remedy whatever defect there might have been in his citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Even <i>J.</i> Brion concedes that Arnado could have been more circumspect in order to secure his qualification to run for public office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, it is insisted that the members of this Court should remove the present case from the shadow of <i>Maquiling</i> and arrive at its resolution based merely on the attendant factual and legal considerations specific to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It cannot be denied that by virtue of its being a decision of the Court that joins the country's body of laws as jurisprudence, <i>Maquiling</i> serves as a "legal consideration" in the resolution of the present case. <i>Maquiling</i>'s application cannot be helped, especially since the Decision therein hinged not only on relevant laws, but largely on the facts then presented before the Court. Thus, while the legal conclusion in <i>Maquiling</i> was not a final determination of Arnado's citizenship- as it applied only for purposes of the 2010 elections - the facts on which its legal conclusion was founded cannot be totally ignored.<br><br>A person's citizenship may be "threshed out again and again"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in every proceeding as long as it becomes relevant and necessary. Except for some clearly unmeritorious cases, it is always a good idea to decide on the merits, especially in election controversies in which the law is sometimes placed at odds with the will of the people. At the same time, the Court puts a premium on economy, and where previous declarations of one's citizenship become pertinent, those cases may be used as a take-off point if only to emphasize the differences and similarities, as well as the measures that were taken in the interim.<br><br>One point of contention between the Decision and the Dissenting Opinion is the finding that Arnado used his US passport for his travels in and out of the country on 12 January 2010 and 23 March 2010.<br><br><i>Maquiling</i> indeed made a finding that Arnado used his US passport for travel on those dates. In the Court Resolution dated 2 July 2013, we said:<br><br><blockquote>Well-settled is the rule that findings of fact of administrative bodies will not be interfered with by the courts in the absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of said agencies, or unless the aforementioned findings are not supported by substantial evidence. They are accorded not only great respect but even finality, and are binding upon this Court, unless it is shown that the administrative body had arbitrarily disregarded or misapprehended evidence before it to such an extent as to compel a contrary conclusion had such evidence been properly appreciated.<br><br>Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that COMELEC First Division found that Arnado used his U.S. Passport at least six times after he renounced his American citizenship. This was debunked by the COMELEC En Banc, which found that Arnado only used his U.S. passport four times, and which agreed with Arnado's claim that he only used his U.S. passport on those occasions because his Philippine passport was not yet issued. The COMELEC En Banc argued that Arnado was able to prove that he used his Philippine passport for his travels on the following dates: 12 January 2010, 31 January 2010, 31 March 2010, 16 April2010, 20 May 2010, and 4 June 2010.<br><br>None of these dates coincide with the two other dates indicated in the <b>certification issued by the Bureau of Immigration showing that on 21 January 2010 and on 23 March 2010, Arnado arrived in the Philippines using his U.S. Passport No. 057782700 which also indicated therein that his nationality is USA-American. Adding these two travel dates to the travel record provided by the Bureau of Immigration showing that Arnado also presented his U.S. passport four times (upon departure on 14 April2009, upon arrival on 25 June 2009, upon departure on 29 July 2009 and upon arrival on 24 November 2009), these incidents sum up to six.</b><br><br>The COMELEC En Banc concluded that "the use of the US passport was because to his knowledge, his Philippine passport was not yet issued to him for his use." This conclusion, however, is not supported by the facts. Arnado claims that his Philippine passport was issued on 18 June 2009. <b>The records show that he continued to use his U.S. passport even after he already received his Philippine passport. Arnado's travel records show that he presented his U.S. passport on 24 November 2009, on 21 January 2010, and on 23 March 2010. These facts were never refuted by Arnado.</b><br><br>Thus, the ruling of the COMELEC En Banc is based on a misapprehension of the facts that the use of the U.S. passport was discontinued when Arnado obtained his Philippine passport.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>It is important to clarify that the certification from the Bureau of Immigration indicated that Arnado arrived in the country using his US passport on <b><u>12</u></b> January 2010 and 23 March 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The Court gave full credence to the certification, not only because it carried with it the presumption of regularity, but more important, Arnado never bothered to refute the contents thereof.<br><br>On the basis of this finding, the Court rejected the claim that Arnado's use of his US passport several times were mere isolated acts that were done only because he was not yet issued his Philippine passport.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>To my mind, this is the turning point of <i>Maquiling</i> that regrettably still applies in this case: that whatever professions of faith and allegiance to the Republic that Arnado claims when his citizenship is in question, the fact remains that during the instances that he used his US passport despite having a Philippine passport in his possession, those same professions became hollow. And, that up to the filing of Arnado's Certificate of Candidacy for the 2013 elections, he failed to remedy the fatal blow that such repeated use of his US passport dealt on his electoral qualifications.<br><br>I therefore concur with the <b>DISMISSAL</b> of the <b>PETITION.</b><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 148-B Phil. 773 (1971). <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 855.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> CONSTITUTION, Article X, Section 8.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Republic v.

Private respondent Florante <b><i>Capitan</i></b> seeks to strengthen the linkage with the earlier <i>Maquiling</i> case by adopting the <i>Maquiling</i> positions and considering the present case as a seamless continuation of <i>Maquiling.</i><br><br>Despite some commonalities, the present disqualification case, however, is separate and substantively distinct from the <i>Maquiling</i> disqualification case. The present case involves an election period (2013) separate and distinct from the election period covered by the<i> Maquiling</i> ruling (2010). The factual circumstances and consequent legal considerations also vary, as will be explained below, so that the present case need not necessarily follow the governing ruling in <i>Maquiling.</i><br><br>Thus, at the outset, I invite the Court: to keep an open mind and remove any initial impression that the present case is a re-run of <i>Maquiling</i>; to recognize that at some point, the present case diverges from and must be viewed independently of <i>Maquiling</i>; and to resolve it from the perspective solely of the attendant factual and legal considerations specific to it.<br><br>The Court must not also forget that this is an election case where<b><i> the electorate has its own separate interest to protect.</i></b> This is an interest that the Court must not ignore when the issues posed carry the potential of setting aside the electorate's expressed choice.<br><br>Notably, the present controversy involves a candidate whose disqualification (to run for elective office) has twice been sought based on the same cited facts and grounds, but who nevertheless has twice been elected by a clear and overwhelming majority of the voters- in the May 2010 and May 2013 Elections. <b><i>In 2013, he garnered 84% of the votes of the people of Kauswagan.</i></b><br><br>This clear and undeniably overwhelming voice of the electorate, to my mind, renders it necessary for the Court to consider and apply <b><i>deeper democratic principles</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The circumstances of the present controversy call for this kind of consideration, particularly when the electorate's already limited democratic decision making process runs the risk of being negated for no clear and conclusive reason, as discussed below.<br><br>To disregard the electorate's voice <b><i>once</i></b> can perhaps be excused by invoking the rule of law; to ignore the people's voice<b><i> a second time</i></b> can only be justified by clear reasons from this Court that the people can readily understand.<br><br><b>I submit this Dissenting Opinion to object to the <i>ponencia's</i> conclusion that Arnado is disqualified from running in the May 2013 Elections and that his proclamation as elected Mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, should now be set aside.</b><br><br>I specifically find the <i>ponencia 's</i> conclusions grossly erroneous and tainted with grave abuse of discretion based on the following considerations:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Arnado became a "pure" Philippine citizen on April 3, 2009, after he took his oath of allegiance and executed his affidavit of renunciation. That he was subsequently deemed to have recanted his renunciation is unfortunate, but even the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling recognizes that for some eleven (11) days (<i>i.e.</i>, from April 3 to 14, 2009), he was qualified to run for public office because he was a "pure" Filipino.<br><br>Arnado more than reconfirmed and regained this status and was qualified to run for public office in the May 2013 Elections based on his persistent assertions of sole allegiance to the Republic and his repeated renunciation of his US citizenship.<br><ol type="a"><li>Separately from the April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation that <i>Maquiling</i> said Arnado recanted, Arnado executed on May 9, 2013, another Affidavit of Renunciation affirming the terms of his April 3, 2009 Affidavit and thus cured any defect in his qualification to run in the May 2013 Elections.</li></ol>(2) The legal consequences of the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling is limited to Arnado's qualification for public office in the May 2010 elections.<br><ol type="a"><li>The intervening 2010 <i>Maquiling</i> disqualification ruling did not and could not have invalidated Arnado's status as a "pure" Philippine citizen who was qualified to run for public office after having complied with the RA No. 9225 requirements in the May 2013 Elections.<br></li></ol>(3) The Comelec gravely abused its discretion in ruling that the May 9, 2013 Confirmation of the Oath of Affirmation was filed out of time.<br><ol type="a"><li>The Comelec grossly failed to consider (i) the circumstances of the filing of the October 1, 2012 Certificate of Candidacy (CoC), and (ii) the circumstances and the dynamics between the 2010 <i>Maquiling</i> case and ruling, and the present 2013 disqualification case, in terms&nbsp; of the retroactive application of the<i> Maquiling</i> ruling.<br><br></li><li>When Arnado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012 (for the 2013 Elections), the prevailing Comelec <i>en banc</i> ruling [in its February 2, 2011 resolution in SPA No. 10-109 (DC)] was that he was <b>not disqualified</b> to run for elective public office; hence, Arnado did not need to execute another affidavit of renunciation.<br><br></li><li>Based solely on the <i>Maquiling</i> Decision (that pertained to Arnado's <b><i>disqualification for the 2010 elections</i></b>), the Comelec disqualified Arnado for the May 2013 elections because his October 1, 2012 CoC was not supported by any Affidavit of Renunciation&nbsp; (since <i>Maquiling </i>considered his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation for the 2010 elections effectively recanted).

The <b><i><u>oath of renunciation</u></i></b>, on the other hand, complements their oath of allegiance through the express manifestation, for purpose of running for public office, that the candidate is a "pure" Filipino.<br><br><b>B. <i>Arnado's attainment, loss of '"pure" <br>Filipino citizen status, and subsequent<br> developments</i></b><br><br>Based on the above discussions, I find -<b> as the<i> ponencia</i> and the majority in Maquiling did </b>- that Arnado became a "pure" Philippine citizen when he took his oath of allegiance to the Philippines on July 10, 2008, and his oath of renunciation on April 3, 2009.30 With his oath of renunciation, he became solely a Filipino citizen with total allegiance to the Republic ofthe Philippines.<br><br>He could have, at that point, validly run for public office, except that subsequent to his renunciation, he travelled using his U.S. passport - a development that the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling unfortunately characterized as a recantation of his previous renunciation of American citizenship.<br><br>Had the developments that transpired in Arnado's political life simply stopped with his candidacy in the May 2010 Elections, then the present case and its complications would have been avoided. But as subsequent developments showed, a confluence of complicating factors arose.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, Arnado ran again for the same office in the May 2013 Elections, and events overlapped. His disqualification case was not resolved with dispatch so that the <b>period for the filing of the CoC for the May 2013 </b>Elections (in October 2012) was set while the <b>present case was still pending with this Court.</b><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, at that time, the <b>standing ruling</b> was the Comelec <i>en banc</i> decision that Arnado was not disqualified and had perfected the required submissions for his candidacy. <b>No restraining order or any other ruling from this Court intervened to prevent this Comelec ruling from being the governing rule in the interim.</b><br><br>As a result, Arnado saw no need to undertake remedial measures addressing the matters complained about in the 2010 <i>Maquiling</i> disqualification case. But at that point, <b>he had already filed two oaths of renunciation</b> - on April 3, 2009 and on November 30, 2009 - <b>when he filed his CoC for the May 2010 Elections.</b><br><br><b><i>Third,</i></b> he did not submit any oath of renunciation together with his October 1, 2012 CoC since, to his knowledge, he had complied with the requirements of RA No. 9225 and the Local Government Code, and had attained "pure" Filipino citizen status. (That he did attain this status based on the 2008 oath of allegiance and his 2009 affidavit of renunciation is in fact confirmed by <i>Maquiling</i>, although his subsequent recantation intervened.)<br><br>Arnado's political world was overturned when the Court resolved the May 2010 disqualification case on April 16, 2013, <i>or a few days before the May 2013 elections</i>. But Arnado did not fully dwell on the past. While filing a motion for reconsideration of the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling, he also acted on his October 1, 2012 CoC by executing and submitting, on May 9, 2013, <b><u>an Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Renunciation affirming his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation.</u></b><br><br>Thus, from the perspective of the laws governing natural-born Filipinos who have re-acquired Philippine citizenship and who wish to run for public office, Arnado <b><i>did not only comply</i></b> with the twin requirements of RA No. 9225 as of April 3, 2009; he even <b><i>exceeded the requirements</i></b> of the law by <b><i>asserting his oath of allegiance to the Republic four times, while also impliedly renouncing any and all foreign citizenships for the same number of "times, and twice expressly renouncing any and all other citizenships</i></b> (with one express renunciation declared recanted by <i>Maquiling</i>).<br><br>All these are material considerations that should be taken into account in resolving the present case and are more fully discussed under separate headings below.<br><br><b><i>C.&nbsp; The Comelec gravely abused its<br>discretion in ruling that the May 9, 2013<br>Confirmation of Oath of Affirmation <br>was out of time</i></b><br><br>After the promulgation of the <i>Maquiling</i> Decision disqualifying Arnado for the May 2010 elections and relying solely on its terms, the Comelec disqualified Arnado for the May 2013 elections because his October 1, 2012 CoC was not supported by any Affidavit of Renunciation (since <i>Maquiling</i> considered his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation for the May 2010 elections effectively recanted).<br><br>The Comelec ruling and its underlying reasons are, on their face, patently unreasonable since they did not consider at all the surrounding circumstances of the filing of the October 1, 2012 CoC and the circumstances that led to the absence of any oath of renunciation after the <i>Maquiling </i>ruling. The Comelec approach is in fact simplistic to the point of grave abuse of discretion. Apparently, it considered that with the oath of renunciation recanted and with no oath filed with the October 1, 2012 CoC, then the CoC should be considered fatally deficient. The <i>ponencia's</i> reasoning also runs this way.<br><br>Subject to fuller discussions below, I submit that the Comelec missed out on at least three (3) basic considerations.<br><br><b>First,</b> at the time the October 1, 2012 CoC was filed, the prevailing ruling, although then contested before the Court, was the <b><i>Comelec en banc ruling that did not consider. Arnado disqualified</i></b>.&nbsp; To reiterate, <b><i>no intervening restraining order was issued by this Court </i></b>addressing this Comelec ruling. Hence, there was no immediate need, at the time of the CoC's filing, for a replacement supporting oath of renunciation.<br><br><b>Second</b>, since the Comelec did not accept Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation (for the May 2013 Elections) in the light of the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling (affecting the May 2010 elections), he was placed in an impossible situation of being disqualified in the May 2013 Elections for a ruling applicable only to the May 2010 Elections, without being given the opportunity to submit his compliance for the May 2013 Elections.<br><br><b>Third</b>, along the same line ofthought, Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation, submitted to comply with his May 2013 candidacy, was rejected because it should have been filed on October 1, 2012 (<i>i.e.</i>, when he filed his CoC for the May 2013 elections).<br><br>If the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling of April 16, 2013, which addressed the separate 2010 disqualification case, was made to retroactively apply to October 1, 2012, in the separate 2013 disqualification case, then a retroactive opportunity should also be given in the 2013 disqualification case to comply with what retroactively applied in <i>Maquiling</i>.<br><br>To the extent that Arnado was denied the chance to submit a replacement â¢oath of renunciation in 2013, there was an unfair and abusive denial of opportunity equivalent to grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><b><i>D. The Maquiling ruling is limited to</i></b> <b><i>Arnado's</i></b><b><i> <br>qualification to run for public office and only <br>for the purpose of the May 2010 elections</i></b><br><br>I submit that the ponencia 's ruling, insofar as it adopts the <i>Maquiling </i>ruling, is an overreach that runs counter to the policy behind RA No. 9225.<br><br>I submit that the extent of the legal consequences of the <b><i>Maquiling ruling affect solely Arnado's qualification to run for public office and only for the purpose of the May 2010 elections. These consequences should not be extended to situations outside of and not contemplated by Maquiling.</i></b><br><br>The following reasons support my view:<br><br><b><i><u>First</u></i></b>, the <i><u>Maquiling</u></i> ruling only considered the material facts surrounding the May 2010 Elections. The critical facts on which the <i>Maquiling</i> case turned dwelt with the travels of Arnado using his U.S. passport. These facts are not contested in the present case. Nor am I contesting that for eleven days in April 2009, Arnado was a "pure" Filipino, until a recantation of his renunciation oath took place. These are settled and accepted facts.<br><br>The <i>Maquiling</i> ruling left out, because these are facts that it did <b><i>not consider material for its resolution </i></b>(such as the overlaps in the filing of the October 1, 2012 CoC and the resolution of <i>Maquiling</i>; the effect of <i>Maquiling</i> on the 2013 disqualification case; the oath of allegiance and renunciation that accompanied the November 30, 2009 CoC for the May 2010 elections) or because they were <b><i>outside the scope of the relevant facts of Maquiling</i></b> (such as the prevailing Comelec <i>en banc</i> ruling on October 1, 2012 when Arnado filed his CoC; the facts surrounding the filing of the CoC on October 1, 2012; and the May 9, 2013 filing of the Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Renunciation affirming his April 3,' 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation).<br><br>From these perspectives, how can the 2010 <i>Maquiling</i> case be a seamless continuation of the 2013 disqualification case now before this Court?<br><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, the implied renunciation of foreign citizenship that Arnado made on several occasions is different from and has distinct legal implications separate from the express renunciation he made on April 3, 2009.<br><br>The <b><i>implied renunciation</i></b> of foreign citizenship proceeds from the oath of allegiance that natural-born Filipino citizens take to re-acquire Philippine citizenship.&nbsp; This is patent from the terms of the oath of allegiance and is a consequence of the resulting re-acquisition of Philippine citizenship.<br><br>The express renunciation, in contrast, is an <b><i>after-the-fact requirement</i></b> that arises only if these natural-born Filipino citizens choose to run for public office. The requirement of an express renunciation of foreign citizenship arises only after they have re-acquired Philippine citizenship <b><i>for the exclusive purpose of qualifying them for elective public office.</i></b><br><br>Note in this regard that <b><i>Maquiling declared as recanted only the express renunciation that Arnado executed on April 3, 2009</i></b>, not the implied renunciation that Arnado made on several occasions when he swore allegiance to the supreme authority of the Republic.<br><br>This <i>Maquiling</i> declaration and the distinction that it signifies are crucial: <i>first</i>, the implied renunciation of foreign allegiance that Arnado made on several occasions still stands as valid, as <i>Maquiling</i> affected only his April 3, 2009 express renunciation; <i>second,</i> the implied renunciation must be valid because it did not affect Arnado's reacquisition of Filipino citizenship; and <i>third</i>, Arnado's express renunciation was declared recanted solely for the purpose of the May 2010 Elections, not for any and all other purposes.<br><br>In short, <i>Maquiling <b>did not declare Arnado's renunciation</b></i> of his US citizenship <b><i><u>invalid for all purposes</u></i></b>; it certainly could not have done so as that case involved an election disqualification case that challenged Arnado's candidacy for the mayoralty post by reason of an alleged defect in his qualification,<i> i.e.,</i> Arnado's isolated acts that, to the majority, effectively recanted his express renunciation.<br><br>In ruling as it did, Maquiling did not and<i><b> could not have gone beyond the confines of the underlying election disqualification case and could not have ruled on Arnado's Philippine citizenship per se </b></i>without exceeding the confines of the Court's jurisdiction.<br><br>Citizenship and its loss, acquisition, and re-acquisition are much broader concepts that cannot definitively be affected by a Court ruling in an election disqualification case, even if the disqualification case touches on the citizenship qualification of the candidate. Thus, I submit that <b><i>Maquiling invalidated Arnado's renunciation oath solely for the purpose of his qualification for the May 2010 elections.</i></b><br><br><b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, Arnado became a "pure" Philippine citizen as of April 3, 2009, a legal consequence that <i>Maquiling</i> recognized and conceded as it declared that "he in fact did" comply with the "twin requirements under RA No. 9225" for the purpose of election qualification.<br><br>What made the Court rule against Arnado's qualification for the May 2010 Elections was the finding of positive, <i>albeit</i> isolated, acts that effectively "disqualified him from running for an elective public office pursuant to Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code of 1991."<br><br>Otherwise stated, Arnado, in the <i>Maquiling</i> sense, was indisputably already a "pure" Philippine citizen as of April 3, 2009. He reverted to a dual citizen status (and only from the perspective of the concerned foreign country) only on the date subsequent to April 3, 2009, and only by virtue of the ruling that considered his use of his US passport on isolated occasions as a "voluntar[y] and effective[] [act of] revert[ing] to [the] earlier status [of] a dual citizen."<br><br>To quote and highlight the majority's pronouncement on this point: <b><i>"[such reversion was not retroactive as it took place the instant Arnado represented himself as an American citizen by using his US passport."</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Thus, even if only for qualification purposes, the April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation was a valid and Court-recognized express declaration of Arnado's renunciation of his US citizenship that the Court cannot lightly disregard in the present disqualification case.<br><br><b><i><u>Fourth</u></i></b>, even <i>Maquiling</i> did not perpetually and absolutely disqualify Arnado from running for any elective public office, or from running in any elections as they declared that "<i>[h]e is disqualified x x from becoming a candidate <b>in the May 2010 elections</b>."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In other words, Maquiling declared Arnado as disqualified from running only in the May 2010 Elections; they did not declare him as disqualified for any and all other elections, including the May 2013 Elections.<br><br><b><i>E. Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of<br>Renunciation, affirming his April 3, 2009<br>Affidavit, cured any alleged defect in his <br>qualification to run for public office during<br>the May 2013 Elections</i></b><br><br>I take exception to the <i>ponencia's</i> ruling that ignores Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation simply because it was executed after Arnado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012. I submit that Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation bears crucial significance to Arnado's qualification to run for the May 2013 Elections which the Court cannot and should not lightly ignore.<br><br><i>Maquiling</i> unequivocably held that by using an American passport, he effectively <b><u>recanted</u></b> his express renunciation of his US citizenship.<br><br>Jurisprudence defines the act of recantation to mean to "withdraw or repudiate formally and publicly;" "to renounce or withdraw prior statement." To "retract" means to "take back;" "to retract an offer is to withdraw it before acceptance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>That Arnado took back his statement disavowing allegiance to the US government, however, does not render invalid his status as a natural-born Filipino citizen; neither does it negate the fact that he had impliedly renounced his US citizenship, and had subsequently made an express renunciation of his US citizenship.<br><br>Granting that Arnado's use of his US passport amounted to a withdrawal of the express renunciation he made of his allegiance to the US, this withdrawal does not erase the fact that he did make an express renunciation ofhis US citizenship.<br><br>To my mind, this express renunciation, even if recanted, may still be re-affirmed, in the same way a statement already made and subsequently denied, can be re-confirmed.&nbsp; Thus, Arnado's 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation can validly re-affirm the 2009 express renunciation that the Court held to have been recanted in <i>Maquiling.</i><br><br>Note that in the <b><u>May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation</u></b>, Arnado categorically stated that he <b>renounces his US citizenship,</b> as well as <b>any and all foreign citizenship</b>; swears <b>allegiance to the Republic; and confirms the renunciation (of his US citizenship). he had previously made in the April3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation.</b><br><br>Note, likewise, that as explained above, the April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation is a valid and Court-confirmed oath that Arnado had validly confirmed in his May 9, 2013 Affidavit. To confirm means "to make firm: strengthen in a resolution, conviction, loyalty, position; to give new assurance of the truth or validity; to state or imply the truth,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and implies a prior existinact.<br><br>Finally, note that the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling was issued after Arnado took his oath of allegiance to the Republic four times- on July 10, 2008, April 3, 2009 (when he executed the affidavit of renunciation); November 30, 2009 (when he filed his CoC for the May 2010 Elections); and October 1, 2012 (when he filed his CoC for the May 2013 Elections). It was also issued after Arnado renounced his US citizenship expressly on April 3, 2009, and impliedly on four occasions - on July 10, 2008; April 3, 2009; November 30, 2009; and October 1, 2012- when he swore allegiance to the supreme authority of the Republic.<br><br>In fact, in his October 1, 2012 CoC, Arnado made the following oath:<br><br><blockquote>I will support and defend the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines and <b>will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto</b>. I will obey all laws, legal orders and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities. I impose this obligation upon myself voluntarily, withour mental reservation and purpose of evasion.<br></blockquote><br>Taken together, all these facts undeniably show that Arnado's May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation was <b><i>not entirely new, nor completely different and independent from the oath of renunciation that Arnado took on April 3, 2009</i></b>. Rather, it affirmed and revalidated the Court-recognized renunciation oath that he had earlier taken.<br><br>Indisputably, <i>Maquiling</i> found that Arnado's express renunciation had been validly made. This express renunciation, having been disavowed, can be re-affirmed by subsequent acts - through his May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation and through the statement in his October 1, 2012 CoC.<br><br>The statement in Arnado's October 1, 2012 CoC, for instance, is substantially similar to the oath of allegiance required in RA No. 9225. This oath not only recognizes Arnado's Filipino citizenship, but impliedly renounces his US citizenship.&nbsp; That he swore sole allegiance to the Philippine Republic in his October 1, 2012 CoC in effect affirmed his express renunciation of US citizenship; and thus dispenses with the need for another express renunciation.<br><br>Rather than an oath that should simply be brushed aside as the Comelec did, the May 9, 2013 Affidavit served:<i> first</i>, to repair his reverted dual citizen status as declared in<i> Maquiling</i>; and <i>second</i>, to re-assert and emphasize his clear intent to renounce his US citizenship which he had expressly done once and impliedly done four times.<br><br>In this sense, the May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation retroacted to April 3, 2009, and cured any alleged defect in Arnado's October 1, 2012 CoC. More importantly, it cured any defect that the intervening <i>Maquiling</i> ruling introduced on Arnado's qualification to run for public office during the May 2013 Elections.<br><br>That Arnado executed his May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation while <i>Maquiling</i> was still under the Court's consideration (it was not confirmed on reconsideration until July 2, 2013) is not without significance. While the May 9, 2013 Affidavit was filed for purposes of the present disqualification case, it could have, had the Court been so inclined, considered as a factor in ruling on <i>Maquiling's </i>reconsideration; but apparently it was not at all considered since Arnado's use of his US passport was the focal point of the controversy.<br><br><b><i>F. The intervening Maquiling ruling did<br>not and could not have invalidated his status <br>as a ''pure" Philippine citizen who was qualified<br>to run and had filed a valid CoCfor the <br>May 2013 Elections</i></b><br><br>As the legal consequences of the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling on Arnado's renunciation of his US citizenship did not extend beyond his qualification to run for public office during the May 2010 elections; and that the May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation cured any alleged defect in Arnado's qualification to run for the May 2013 Elections, I submit that the <i>Maquiling</i> ruling on April 16, 2013 did not affect and could not have affected Arnado's qualification to run for public office for the purpose of the May 2013 Elections.<br><br>Under the circumstances, Arnado had effectively become a "pure" natural-born Philippine citizen again on October 1, 2012, when he executed the retroactive and curative May 9, 2013 Affidavit of Renunciation, and which status continued well beyond the May 2013 Elections. In this way, Arnado qualified for the position of Mayor of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, and filed a valid CoC.<br><br><b><i>G.

This Comelec ruling still stood and had not yet been overturned at the time Arnado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012 for the May 2013 Elections. Arnado, therefore, had every right and reason to rely on this Comelec ruling and to believe that he was not disqualified to run in the May 2013 Elections.<br><br>I concede that, as the events have shown, he should, in retrospect, have exercised greater care and have taken every. step to secure his qualification to run for public office. His failure, however, should not and cannot affect his qualification which then stands and is authoritatively affirmed by the Comelec.<br><br>Indeed "there is no law prohibiting him from executing an Affidavit of Renunciation every election period" as the <i>ponencia</i> puts it. But, note that <b>there is equally no law that requires him to constantly and consistently&nbsp; assert his renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship.</b> Neither is there any law that expressly or impliedly imposes on natural-born Filipino citizens the obligation to constantly assert their allegiance to the Republic and perform positive acts to assert this allegiance.<br><br>In fact, as the law stands, natural-born Filipino citizens who have lost their Philippine citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign country need only to take an oath of allegiance to the supreme authority of the Republic to re-acquire Philippine citizenship as they are <i>"deemed not to have lost their Philippine citizenship.</i>" Once they re-acquire their Philippine citizenship after complying with these legal steps, they no longer need to perform any positive act to assert Philippine citizenship or to elect citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b><i>H.

In this respect, I submit that in situations of doubt where the strict application of the equivocal letter of the law would clearly and undoubtedly disregard the legislative intent, the Court must and should tread lightly as it rules on the relatively uncharted area of application where RA No. 9225 overlaps with our elections laws.<br><br>The unique factual situation of this case presents such situation of doubt which the Court must resolve in the light of the clear legislative intent, rather than from the strict application of the <b><i>equivocal</i></b> letter of the law.

He had also renounced his US citizenship expressly on April 3, 2009, and impliedly thrice on July 10, 2008, November 30, 2009, and October 1, 2012.<br><br>Additionally, on October 1, 2012, the Comelec <i>en banc, via</i> the February 2, 2011 resolution in SPA No. 10-109(DC), had ruled in his favour, affirmed the existence and validity of his oath of renunciation, and confirmed his continuing qualification for the elective post. At that time, the February 2, 2011 Comelec ruling had not yet been reversed by this Court and stood as the final and most recent ruling as regards his qualification to run for the local elective post. As it had not yet been reversed, he clearly and rightfully had every reason to rely on this Comelec ruling when he filed his CoC on October 1, 2012.<br><br>In these lights, Arnado's allegiance to the supreme authority of the Republic and his renunciation of any and all foreign allegiance, including those to the US government, cannot be doubted. From the time he had reÂ­acquired "pure" Philippine citizenship under the terms of RA No. 9225, Arnado has persistently asserted these oaths even while the law does not require him to do so.<br><br>In this situation, any doubt or ambiguity should be resolved in favor of his full Filipino citizenship - with his qualification to run for the May 2013 Elections- since the thrust ofRA No. 9225 is to encourage the return to Filipino citizenship of natural-born Filipinos who lost their Philippine citizenship through their acquisition of foreign citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Note in this regard that Arnado consciously and voluntarily gave up a very much soughtÂ­ after citizenship status in favor of returning to full Filipino citizenship and of participating in Philippine govemance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b><i>I.

This is made clear in the discussion of the Bicameral Conference Committee on Disagreeing Provisions of House Bill No. 4720 and Senate Bill No. 2130 held on 18 August 2003 (precursors of Republic Act No. 9225), where the Hon.

To qualify as a candidate in Philippine elections, Filipinos must only have one citizenship, namely, Philippine citizenship.<br><br>By the same token, the oath of allegiance contained in the Certificate of Candidacy, which is substantially similar to the one contained in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9225, does not constitute the personal and sworn renunciation sought under Section 5(2) of Republic Act No. 9225. It bears to emphasize that the said oath of allegiance is a general requirement for all those who wish to run as candidates in Philippine elections; while the renunciation of foreign citizenship is an additional requisite only for those who have retained or reacquired Philippine citizenship under Republic Act No. 9225 and who seek elective public posts, considering their special circumstance of having more than one citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9225 restores <i>full</i> civil and political rights to those who wish to reacquire their citizenship, including the right to vote and be voted for.

Domicile, however, does not ipso facto prove his or her citizenship. A Filipino may reside in the United States but still remain a Filipino citizen. An American may also reside in the Philippines and still remain an American citizen. The presumption created by residency is not conclusive of one's citizenship.<br><br>Residency also need not be continuous for as long as the total number of required years have been complied with before the election. Section 39(a) of the Local Government Code requires residency for "at least one (1) year immediately preceding the day of the election for local elective office." A candidate for local elective office may be eligible to run for as long as he or she is proven to have <i>animus revertendi</i> in a certain domicile for at least one (1) year immediately preceding the elections.<br><br>The purpose of the residency requirement is "to give candidates the opportunity to be familiar with the needs, difficulties, aspirations, potentials for growth[,] and all matters vital to the welfare of their constituencies; likewise, it enables the electorate to evaluate the office seekers' qualifications and fitness for the job they aspire for."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The length of a candidate's residency depends on the time necessary to acquire familiarity with the constituency as well as sensitivity to the welfare of the constituents.&nbsp; The requirement seeks "to exclude a stranger or newcomer, unacquainted with the conditions and needs of a community and not identified with the latter, from an elective office to serve that community."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Continuity does not always guarantee familiarity.&nbsp; A momentary absence from the country does not negate the purpose of the residency requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> A candidate who has spent some time abroad may offer a unique perspective as opposed to a candidate who has never left the country.&nbsp; The former may be in a better position to observe the changes the country may have undergone through the years, or may have a stronger intuition as to the level of growth it still needs.

He would have had no choice but to use his American passport to exit the United States.<br><br>However, petitioner did use his Philippine passport in his subsequent travels. Hence, his isolated use of his American passport when he did not yet have his Philippine passport is not sufficient cause to negate his Affidavit of Renunciation.<br><br>The ponencia cites <i>Maquiling</i>, in that Linog C. Balua, petitioner's rival candidate in the 2010 Elections, presented a certification dated April 23, 2010 from the Bureau of Immigration indicating that as of January 12, 2010 and March 23, 2010, petitioner's nationality was "USA-American." The Computer Database/Passenger Manifest states:<br><br><blockquote>DATE OF Arrival:&nbsp;&nbsp; 01/12/2010<br>NATIONALITY:&nbsp;&nbsp; USA-AMERICAN<br>PASSPORT:&nbsp;&nbsp; 057782700<br><br>DATE OF Arrival:&nbsp;&nbsp; 03/23/2010<br>NATIONALITY:&nbsp;&nbsp; USA-AMERICAN<br>PASSPORT:&nbsp;&nbsp; 057782700<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[19]</sup></font></blockquote><br>This certification is contradicted by petitioner's Philippine pass ort which was stamped by the Bureau of Immigration also on these dates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; It was, therefore, erroneous for the ponencia to refer to the certification as "uncontroverted."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The ponencia unduly gives weight to the Bureau of Immigration's certification on the basis that the copy of his Philippine passport was a mere "certified true copy from the machine copy on file."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Maquiling</i> undoubtedly states that petitioner was issued a Philippine passport and that he used it for his subsequent travels abroad.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> There is a presumption that this piece of evidence, like the certification by the Bureau of Immigration, can be relied upon since it forms part of the case records. Under the presumption of regularity, his passport is presumed to have been stamped by the Bureau of Immigration. Until and unless it is alleged and proven that the stamps on his Philippine passport are fraudulent, it is presumed that the Bureau of Immigration certified the use of his Philippine passport <i>and</i> the use of his American passport on the dates alleged. It is also possible that at the time the certification was issued, the Bureau of Immigration had not yet updated its database.&nbsp; Therefore, it was erroneous for the ponencia to conclude that petitioner used his American passport on January 12, 2010 and on March 23, 2010 based merely on the certification dated April23, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center>III<br></center><br>Even if the ponencia applied the ruling in <i>Maquiling</i>, Amado should have already been qualified to run in the 2013 Elections.<br><br>Maquiling held that petitioner's use of his American passport negated his Affidavit of Renunciation, thus disqualifYing him to run in the 2010 Elections:<br><br><blockquote>We therefore hold that Amado, by using his US passport after renouncing his American citizenship, has recanted the same Oath of Renunciation he took. Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code applies to his situation. He is disqualified not only from holding the public office but even from becoming a candidate in the May 2010 elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that, per <i>Maquiling</i>, petitioner's use of his Philippine passport signifies his Philippine citizenship.<br><br>According to Republic Act No. 8239,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> a passport is "a document issued by the Philippine government to its citizens and requesting other governments to allow its citizens to pass safely and freely, and in case of need to give him/her all lawful aid and protection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>By definition, a Philippine passport is a document issued by the government <i>to its citizens</i>. Clearly, a Philippine passport cannot be issued to an American citizen.<br><br>If this court concludes, as the ponencia has done, that petitioner remained an American citizen, the facts should show that he continued to use his American passport before he filed his Certificate of Candidacy for the 2013 Elections.<br><br>As of June 18, 2009, petitioner was issued a Philippine passport. He has continually used his Philippine passport from December 11, 2009. He also executed an Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of Allegiance on November 30, 2009. By the time he filed his Certificate of Candidacy on October 1, 2012, he was already the bearer of a Philippine passport.<br><br>In <i>Yu v. Defensor-Santiago</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> a petition for habeas corpus was filed against then Commissioner for Immigration and Deportation Miriam Defensor-Santiago for the release of Willie Yu (Yu) from detention. This court, confronted with the issue of Yu's citizenship, found:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner's own compliance reveals that he was originally issued a Portuguese passport in 1971, valid for five (5) years and renewed for the same period upon presentment before the proper Portuguese consular officer. Despite his naturalization as a Philippine citizen on 10 February 1978, on 21 July 1981, petitioner applied for and was issued Portuguese Passport No. 35/81 serias N. 1517410 by the Consular Section of the Portuguese Embassy in Tokyo. Said Consular Office certifies that his Portuguese passport expired on 20 July 1986. While still a citizen of the Philippines who had renounced, upon his naturalization, "absolutely and forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and pledged to "maintain true faith and allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines,'' he declared his nationality as Portuguese in commercial documents he signed, specifically, the Companies Registry of Tai Shun Estate Ltd. filed in Hongkong sometime in April 1980.<br><br>To the mind of the Court, the foregoing acts considered together constitute an express renunciation of petitioner's Philippine citizenship acquired through naturalization. In <i>Board of Immigration Commissioners vs. Go Gallano, express renunciation was held to mean a renunciation that is made known distinctly and explicitly and not left to inference or implication. Petitioner, with full knowledge, and legal capacity, afier having renounced Portuguese citizenship upon naturalization as a Philippine citizen resumed or reacquired his prior status as a Portuguese citizen, applied for a renewal of his Portuguese passport and represented himself as such in official documents even after he had become a naturalized Philippine citizen. Such resumption or reacquisition of Portuguese citizenship is grossly inconsistent with his maintenance of Philippine citizenship</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Yu's renewal of his Portuguese passport was a renunciation of his Philippine citizenship. This court took into account Yu's application for renewal and his declaration of his Portuguese nationality in commercial documents.<br><br>In contrast, petitioner was forced by his circumstances to use his American passport at a time when he had not yet been issued a Philippine passport. Upon the issuance of his Philippine passport, however, petitioner consistently used this passport for his travels. His consistent use of his Philippine passport was a positive act that showed his continued allegiance to the country.<br><br>Petitioner's continued intent to renounce his American citizenship is clear when he executed his Affidavit Affirming Rommel C. Arnado 's "<i>Affidavit of Renunciation Dated April 3, 2009</i>" on May 9, 2013.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9225 requires a personal and sworn renunciation from persons who seek to reacquire their Philippine citizenship in order to run for local office. Petitioner's Affidavit of Renunciation dated April 3, 2009, his continued use of his Philippine passport, his alleged Affidavit of Renunciation with Oath of Allegiance dated November 30, 2009, and his Affidavit dated May 9, 2013 are more than enough evidence to show his personal and sworn renunciation of his American citizenship.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Election laws must be interpreted to give effect to the will of the people. <br><br>Petitioner garnered an oveiWhelming 8,902 votes, 84% of the total votes case0 in the 2013 mayoralty elections.

This court will have substituted its discretion over the sovereign will of the people.<br><br>The ponencia erroneously cites <i>Lopez v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as basis for stating that petitioner's landslide victory could not override eligibility requirements.<br><br>In <i>Lopez,</i> a petition for disqualification was filed against Eusebio Eugenio K. Lopez (Lopez) to disqualifY him from running for Barangay Chair in the 2007 Barangay Elections. Lopez argued that he was a dual citizen by virtue of Republic Act No. 9225 and, hence, was qualified to run.<br><br>This court disagreed and disqualified Lopez from running in public office since he failed to make a personal and sworn renunciation of his American citizenship.&nbsp; It also ruled that his subsequent victory in the elections could not cure the defect of his disqualification:<br><br><blockquote>While it is true that petitioner won the elections, took his oath and began to discharge the functions of Barangay Chairman, his victory cannot cure the defect ofhis candidacy. Garnering the most number of votes does not validate the election of a disqualified candidate because the application of the constitutional and statutory provisions on disqualification is not a matter of popularity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Lopez</i>, however, does not apply since the candidate in that case failed to execute a personal and sworn renunciation of his American citizenship. In this case, petitioner made a personal and sworn renunciation of his American citizenship no less than three times.<br><br>In <i>Japzon v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> a petition for disqualification was brought against Jaime S. Ty (Ty), who won as Mayor of MacArthur, Eastern Samar in the 2007 Elections. Ty was a natural-born Filipino citizen who migrated to the United States and stayed there for 25 years. He took an Oath of Allegiance in 2005 and renounced his American citizenship before a notary public on March 19, 2007. The question before this court, however, was whether his reacquisition of citizenship has the effect of regaining his domicile, in compliance with the residency requirements for elections.<br><br>In resolving the issue, this court found that Ty substantially complied with the requirements of Section 5(2) of Republic Act No. 9225 when he personally executed a Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship before a notary public before filing his Certificate of Candidacy. It also ruled that Ty was able to comply with the residency requirements:<br><br><blockquote>[W]hen the evidence of the alleged lack of residence qualification of a candidate for an elective position is weak or inconclusive and it clearly appears that the purpose of the law would not be thwarted by upholding the victor's right to the office, the will of the electorate should be respected. For the purpose of election laws is to give effect to, rather than frustrate, the will of the voters. To successfully challenge Ty's disqualification, Japzon must clearly demonstrate that Ty's ineligibility is so patently antagonistic to constitutional and legal principles that overriding such ineligibility and thereby giving effect to the apparent will of the people would ultimately create greater prejudice to the very democratic institutions and juristic traditions that our Constitution and laws so zealously protect and promote. In this case, Japzon failed to substantiate his claim that Ty is ineligible to be Mayor of the Municipality of General Macarthur, Eastern Samar, Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Bengson III v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> a similar citizenship issue was raised against Teodoro C. Cruz (Cruz) on the ground that he lost his citizenship when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1985. This court disagreed, stating that Cruz reacquired his Philippine citizenship through repatriation under Republic Act No. 2630.<br><br>Former Associate Justice Artemio V. Panganiban's Concurring Opinion is particularly instructive in stating that this court has a duty to uphold the clear mandate of the people, thus:<br><br><blockquote>4. In Case of Doubt, Popular Will Prevails<br><br><i>[T]he Court has a solemn duty to uphold the clear and unmistakable mandate of the people. It cannot supplant the sovereign will of the Second District of Pangasinan with fractured legalism.&nbsp; The people of the District have clearly spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp; They overwhelmingly and unequivocally voted for private respondent to represent them in the House of Representatives. The votes that Cruz garnered (80,119) in the last elections were much more than those of all his opponents combined (66,182). In such instances, all possible doubts should be resolved in favor of the winning candidate's eligibility; to rule otherwise would be to defeat the will of the people.</i><br><br>Well-entrenched in our jurisprudence is the doctrine that in case of doubt, political laws must be so construed as to give life and spirit to the popular mandate freely expressed through the ballot. Public interest and the sovereign will should, at all times, be the paramount considerations in election controversies. For it would be better to err in favor of the people's choice than to be right in complex but little understood legalisms.<br><br>"Indeed, this Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of giving effect to the sovereign will in order to ensure the survival of our democracy. In any action involving the possibility of a reversal of the popular electoral choice, this Court must exert utmost effort to resolve the issues in a manner that would give effect to the will of the majority, for it is merely sound public policy to cause elective offices to be filled by those who are the choice of the majority. <i>To successfully challenge a winning candidate's qualifications, the petitioner must clearly demonstrate that the ineligibility is so patently antagonistic to constitutional and legal principles that overriding such ineligibility and thereby giving effect to the apparent will of the people would ultimately create greater prejudice to the very democratic institutions and juristic traditions that our Constitution and laws so zealously protect and promote.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37] </sup>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner has proven over and over again that he has renounced his American citizenship.
