She averred that aside from the aforementioned property, she and Carlos also acquired an 8,640-square meter ricefield located in Pulo, San Antonio, Quezon. For humanitarian reasons, she acceded to the spouses Andal’s request to take care of her two parcels of land, provided that they would not be considered as tenants. To stress the fact that neither she nor the spouses Andal intended that the latter be deemed as tenants, Irene pointed to the following: (1) the condition for her purchase of the property in Tiaong that the same should not have any tenants; and (2) Miraflor’s execution of a <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> wherein she waived any tenancy rights that she and her husband might have over the said property.<br><br>In their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the spouses Andal denied Irene’s allegations and claimed that they were tenants of Irene’s predecessor-in-interest and continued to be such despite the transfer of ownership of the properties to Irene. They likewise contended that since the suit is an action to dispossess them as tenants, it is not the MTC which has jurisdiction over the complaint but the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB).<br><br>Rejecting the tenancy claim, Irene averred in her Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that her real properties are not covered by agrarian reform laws as they are within the retention limit allowed by law. She again stressed that the spouses Andal had already voluntarily surrendered their rights as tenants way back in 1997 as evidenced by the <i>Pagpapatunay</i> and the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>. She added the said spouses voluntarily waived their rights and received P1.1 million as commission for brokering the sale of the Tiaong property to her. This was after Irene made clear that the sale would not materialize and, consequently spouses Andal would not get the commission, if the property has tenants. Irene averred that the spouses Andal’s receipt of the said amount of money, being advantageous to them, is a valid ground for termination of tenancy relations.<br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Municipal Trial Court</b></i><br><br>Prior to the preliminary conference, the MTC heard the respective sides of the parties for a preliminary determination of the existence of tenancy.<br><br>The spouses Andal, in support of their claim that the controversy should be resolved by the DARAB because of the issue of tenancy, submitted the following evidence to prove their status as Irene’s tenants: (1) their December 19, 2005 Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> attesting that: a) they agreed to act as agents for the sale of the lands on the condition that they would remain as tenants; b) they personally cultivated Irene’s lands and; c) they have been receiving 1/4 shares of the proceeds of the sales of the coconut, rambutan, and harvested <i>palay</i>; (2) the December 19, 2005 Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of Anastacio corroborating the spouses Andal’s statements in their affidavit of even date; (3) a receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated July 27, 2005 showing that Irene received from the spouses Andal P9,694.00 as her share in the harvest equivalent to 30 sacks of <i>palay</i> and; 4) a February 27, 1997 Affidavit of Landholding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> executed by Irene and Carlos, the second paragraph of which provides:<br><blockquote>2. That we hereby testify that said parcel of land containing an area of 27,974 Square Meters is the only parcel of agricultural land registered in our names; <b>and we hereby agree that the same tenant Miraflor Andal, will continue as a tenant, over the said parcel of land</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, Irene insisted that the spouses Andal are not tenants but mere caretakers of her lands. She disputed the documentary evidence of the said spouses as follows: (1) it is the <i>Pagpapatunay</i> issued by Anastacio in 1997 and furnished the Registry of Deeds of Lucena City and Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) which must be considered as more credible evidence over his apparently fabricated affidavit executed at a later time (2005); (2) the share in the produce of the lands as reflected in the receipt was the only share given to her by the spouses Andal throughout the eight years that they took care of her properties; and, (3) the copy of the Affidavit of Landholding presented by the spouses Andal contained in the second paragraph thereof an insertion made through a manual typewriter. Irene claimed that the said insertion which reads “<i>and we</i> [Irene and Carlos] <i>hereby agree, that the same tenant Miraflor Andal, will continue as a tenant, over the said parcel of land</i>,” was made without her knowledge and consent. In fact, her copy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the said document does not contain such inserted portion.<br><br>In its August 14, 2006 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the MTC found no <i>prima facie</i> showing of tenancy relations between the parties and proceeded with the case.<br><br>On February 27, 2007, the MTC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> holding that spouses Andal failed to adduce proof that they are tenants. It gave weight to the <i>Pagpapatunay</i> issued by Anastacio in 1997 as against the affidavit he executed in 2005 which it found ambivalent as to whether spouses Andal are working as tenants on the lands of Irene. The MTC did not also accord any evidentiary weight to the copy of the Affidavit of Landholding presented by spouses Andal because of the doubtful insertion. Hence, it concluded that the spouses Andal were in possession of the properties by mere tolerance of Irene. It ultimately ruled:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, on the basis of the foregoing findings, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, ordering:<br><br>a) Defendants and all other persons living in said premises without permission of the plaintiff, to vacate and restore to the plaintiff the peaceful possession and occupation of the landholdings in question;<br><br>b) Defendants to pay the plaintiff the amount of P30,000.00 as attorney’s and appearance fees[;]<br><br>c) Defendants to pay the plaintiff the amount of P80,000.00 as actual damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>Resolving the appeal of the spouses Andal, the RTC in its August 28, 2007<br><br>Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> affirmed <i>in toto</i> the MTC ruling.

In its assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of July 13, 2009, the CA ratiocinated that since the existence of tenancy relations between the previous owners of the properties and the spouses Andal is undisputed, the question of whether the said spouses may be dispossessed therefrom constitutes an agrarian dispute despite the severance of such relations. This is considering that severance of the tenurial arrangement does not render the action beyond the ambit of an agrarian dispute and, hence, jurisdiction over the same remains with the DARAB. In support of its conclusion, the CA cited the cases of <i>Rivera v. David</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and <i>Spouses Amurao v. Spouses Villalobos</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review is GRANTED.

Where the case involves the dispossession by a former landlord of a former tenant of the land claimed to have been given as compensation in consideration of the renunciation of the tenurial rights, there clearly exists an agrarian dispute. On this point the Court has already ruled:<br><blockquote>Indeed, Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199, provides that ‘all cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landlord or by a third party and/or the settlement and disposition of disputes arising from the relationship of landlord and tenant … shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations.’ This jurisdiction does not require the continuance of the relationship of landlord and tenant – at the time of the dispute. The same may have arisen, and oftentimes arises, precisely from the previous termination of such relationship. If the same existed immediately, or shortly, before the controversy and the subject matter thereof is whether or not said relationship has been lawfully terminated, or if the dispute otherwise springs or originates from the relationship of landlord and tenant, the litigation is (then) cognizable only by the Court of Agrarian Relations…<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>In the said case, Agustin Rivera (Agustin) was in possession of a 1.8-hectare portion of the 5-hectare lot owned in common by the heirs of Cristino and Consolacion David, and these heirs demanded that he vacate the premises. Thus, Agustin filed a Complaint to Maintain Peaceful Possession before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAB). He averred that his possession of the property was, originally, as registered tenant of the said heirs’ predecessor-in-interest, Cristino, as evidenced by the certification issued by the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO). Subsequently in 1957, he became the lot owner because the spouses Cristino and Consolacion David gave him the 1.8-hectare land as his ‘disturbance compensation,’ in exchange for the renunciation of his tenurial rights. On the other hand, Nemesio David (Nemesio), one of the heirs, argued that the DAR has no jurisdiction over the case as the same only involves the issue of ownership of the land.<br><br>The DAR (thru the PARAB and the DARAB) assumed jurisdiction over the case and went on to render judgments in favor of Agustin. The CA, however, ruled that the DAR no longer had any jurisdiction on the ground that the alleged tenancy, per Agustin’s own admission, had already ended in 1957. Thus, it set aside the respective decisions of the PARAB and the DARAB. The Court, though, did not agree with the CA on the issue of jurisdiction. Although it denied Agustin’s appeal because he was not able to sufficiently prove his ownership of the land, DAR’s jurisdiction over the case was nevertheless upheld. And it was at that point that the above-quoted pronouncement was restated.<br><br>Indeed in <i>Rivera</i>, the severance of the tenancy relations when the suit was filed did not matter because the prior agricultural tenancy served as the juridical tie which compelled the characterization of the controversy as an agrarian dispute. This is due to the fact that the land from which Agustin was being dispossessed was claimed to have been owned by him by way of disturbance compensation given to him as a former tenant by his former landlord.<br><br>On the other hand, in <i>Amurao</i>, the spouses Amurao bought in 1987 from a certain Ruperto Endozo a parcel of land which was then tenanted by the spouses Villalobos. The spouses Amurao allowed the spouses Villalobos to continue working on the land until such time that their need for the same arises. In 1994, the therein parties executed a <i>Kasulatan</i> in which the spouses Villalobos promised to surrender the possession of the lot should the spouses Amurao need it, while the latter, in return, bound themselves to give the spouses Villalobos a 1,000-sqm. portion of the land. But because the spouses Villalobos reneged on their promise in accordance with the <i>Kasulatan</i>, the spouses Amurao filed an ejectment case against them before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC). On the defense that the issue concerns an agrarian dispute, the spouses Villalobos questioned the trial court’s jurisdiction. Both the MCTC and the RTC upheld their jurisdiction over the case but the CA ruled otherwise.<br><br>Before this Court, the spouses Amurao argued that the tenancy relationship between them and the spouses Villalobos was terminated upon the execution of the <i>Kasulatan</i>. Hence, there can be no agrarian dispute between them over which the DAR can take cognizance of. The Court held:<br><blockquote>The instant case undeniably involves a controversy involving tenurial arrangements because the <i>Kasulatan</i> will definitely modify, nay terminate the same. Even assuming that the tenancy relationship between the parties had ceased due to the <i>Kasulatan</i>, there still exists an agrarian dispute because the action involves an incident arising from the landlord and tenant relationship.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioners’ claim that the tenancy relationship has been terminated by the <i>Kasulatan</i> is of no moment. As long as the subject matter of the dispute is the legality of the termination of the relationship, or if the dispute originates from such relationship, the case is cognizable by the DAR, through the DARAB. The severance of the tenurial arrangement will not render the action beyond the ambit of an agrarian dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>To restate, what brought <i>Rivera</i> under the ambit of an agrarian dispute is the fact that the land from which Agustin was being dispossessed of by the heirs of his former landlord is claimed to have been given to him by the said former landlord as consideration for the renunciation of his tenurial rights. While in <i>Amurao</i>, it was the issue of whether the <i>Kasulatan</i> entered into by the parties terminated the landlord-tenant relationship between them. Clearly, as the action in both cases involved an incident arising from landlord-tenant relationship, the severance or alleged severance of such relationship did not take them beyond the ambit of an agrarian dispute and, consequently, it is DAR which has jurisdiction over the said cases.<br><br><i>Rivera and Amurao are not on all fours with the present case</i>.<br><br>Here, Irene claims that there can be no agrarian dispute since there exists no landlord-tenant relationship between her and the spouses Andal. If ever such a relationship existed, it was between the former owner of the properties and the spouses Andal and the same had already been renounced by Miraflor prior to Irene’s acquisition of the properties. The CA, however, ruled that even if the landlord-tenant relationship between the previous owner and the spouses Andal had already ceased, the action to dispossess the latter from the subject properties still involves an agrarian dispute, as held in <i>Rivera</i> and <i>Amurao</i>.<br><br>Suffice it to say, however, that the present case is not on all fours with <i>Rivera</i> and <i>Amurao</i>.<br><br>As already discussed, in <i>Rivera</i>, the land involved is claimed to have been given to the former tenant by the former landlord by way of disturbance compensation. Hence, even if the landlord-tenant relationship was asserted to have been severed as early as 1957, the Court considered the action as arising from an agrarian dispute, the rightful possession of the land being an incident of such previous landlord-tenant relationship. In the present case, there is no claim that the subject properties were given to the spouses Andal by their former landlord as a form of disturbance compensation. While the spouses Andal in this case refuse to surrender the properties to Irene on the ground that they are tenants of the same just like in <i>Amurao</i>, it cannot be gainsaid that in <i>Amurao</i>, the tenancy relations between the former owners of the property involved therein and the spouses Villalobos, had, undisputedly, been continued by and between the said spouses and the spouses Amurao when the latter acquired the property. And it was on that supposition that the Court held that even if the <i>Kasulatan</i> executed by the spouses Amurao and the spouses Villalobos terminated the tenancy relationship between them, the action of the former to dispossess the latter from the property tenanted involved an agrarian dispute. However, in this case, unlike in Amurao the severance of the tenancy relations between the former owners of the properties and the spouses Andal, as well as the non-existence of a similar relationship between the said spouses and Irene as the new owner, were sufficiently shown as will be discussed below. Hence, the said pronouncement made in <i>Amurao</i> finds no application in this case.<br><br><i>The tenancy relationship between the former owners of the properties and the spouses Andal was clearly severed prior to Irene’s purchase of the same; no such relationship was subsequently created between Irene and the spouses Andal</i>.<br><br>Certainly telling are the <i>Pagpapatunay</i> and the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> which were voluntarily executed and never impugned by the spouses Andal. Both contain express declarations that at the time Irene and her husband bought the property, the tenancy then existing between the heirs of Teresita as former owners and the spouses Andal as tenants had already ceased, and that no tenancy relations would continue between the latter and the new owner, Irene. Notably, the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, being a public document, is evidence of the facts in the clear unequivocal manner therein expressed and has in its favor the presumption of regularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The spouses Andal are bound by their admissions against their own interest.<br><br>Indeed, while a tenancy relationship cannot be extinguished by the sale, alienation, or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the same may nevertheless be terminated due to circumstances more advantageous to the tenant and his/her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Here, records show that Miraflor, who brokered the sale between the heirs of Teresita and Irene, voluntarily executed, days prior to the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Absolute Sale, her <i>Pagpapatunay</i> before the BARC Chairman stating that she and her parents have already received a ‘sufficient consideration’ for her to release her former landlord and the purchaser of the lot from liability. As later disclosed by Irene during trial, such ‘sufficient consideration’ amounted to P1.1 million by way of disturbance compensation, a factual allegation which was again never refuted by the spouses Andal before the lower court and was found to be an uncontroverted fact by the CA. To the Court, the said amount is adequate enough for the spouses Andal to relinquish their rights as tenants. In fine, it can be reasonably concluded that the tenancy relationship between the previous owners and the spouses Andal had already been severed.<br><br>The next question now is whether a new tenancy relationship between Irene and the spouses Andal was subsequently formed. This becomes crucial because for the DARAB to have jurisdiction over the case, there must be a tenancy relationship between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Evidence is necessary to prove the allegation of tenancy. “The principal factor in determining whether a tenancy relationship exists is intent. Tenancy is not a purely factual relationship dependent on what the alleged tenant does upon the land. It is also a legal relationship.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>An allegation of tenancy before the MTC does not automatically deprive the court of its jurisdiction. Basic is the rule that:<br><blockquote>x x x the material averments in the complaint determine the jurisdiction of a court. x x x a court does not lose jurisdiction over an ejectment suit by the simple expedient of a party raising as a defense therein the alleged existence of a tenancy relationship between the parties. The court continues to have the authority to hear and evaluate the evidence, precisely to determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and, if, after hearing, tenancy is shown to exist, it shall dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court agrees with the conclusion of both the MTC and the RTC that for dearth of evidence, tenurial relationship between the parties was not sufficiently shown. Thus, the said courts correctly assumed jurisdiction over the ejectment case.<br><br>The fact alone of working on another’s landholding does not raise a presumption of the existence of agricultural tenancy. For tenancy to be proven, all indispensable elements must be established, the absence of one or more requisites will not make the alleged tenant a <i>de facto</i> one. These are: 1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; 2) the subject is agricultural land; 3) there is consent by the landowner; 4) the purpose is agricultural production; 5) there is personal cultivation; and 6) there is sharing of the harvests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The <i>Pagpapatunay</i> and the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> both support Irene’s claim that she purchased the landholdings only on the condition that there will be no tenants. Her refusal to give her consent to any tenancy relationship is glaring. On the other hand, the spouses Andal, in their attempt to prove tenancy, submitted their copy of the February 27, 1997 Affidavit of Landholding, which contains an inserted statement that Irene and Carlos agree “<i>that the same tenant Miraflor Andal, will continue as tenant, over the said parcel of land</i>.” However, serious doubt is cast on the authenticity of said inserted statement considering that it does not bear the respective initials/signatures of Carlos and Irene attesting their conformity thereto. More importantly, Irene’s copy of the said document does not contain the same insertion.<br><br>Anent the proof of sharing of harvest, what the spouses Andal merely presented was a single receipt dated July 27, 2005 representing Irene’s ‘share’ in the harvest. This even militates against the spouses Andal’s claim of tenancy considering that they did not present the receipts for the alleged sharing system prior to 2005 or from 1997, the year when Irene purchased the land. Notably, the receipt they submitted is dated July 27, 2005 or just a few months before the filing of the complaint. To the Court’s mind, such act of the spouses Andal to give Irene a share is a mere afterthought, the same having been done during the time that Irene was already making serious demands for them to account for the produce of the lands and vacate the properties. Be that as it may, the Court stresses “that it is not unusual for a landowner to receive the produce of the land from a caretaker who sows thereon. The fact of receipt, without an agreed system of sharing, does not <i>ipso facto</i> create a tenancy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court holds that absent any tenurial relationship between them, the spouses Andal’s possession of Irene’s properties was by mere tolerance of the latter. The action to dispossess the spouses Andal therefrom is therefore a clear case of summary action for ejectment cognizable by the regular courts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
