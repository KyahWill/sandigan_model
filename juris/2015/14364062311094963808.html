Malang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Butukan S. Malang was one of the 197 accused of 57 counts of murder for allegedly participating in the November 23, 2009 Maguindanao Massacre. He had a pending warrant of arrest issued by the trial court in <i>People of the Philippines v. Datu Andal Ampatuan, Jr., et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Salibo presented himself before the police officers of Datu Hofer Police Station to clear his name. There, he explained that he was not Butukan S.

They then detained Salibo at the Datu Hofer Police Station for about three (3) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The police officers transferred Salibo to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group in Cotabato City, where he was detained for another 10 days. While in Cotabato City, the Criminal Investigation and Detention Group allegedly made him sign and affix his thumbprint on documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On August 20, 2010, Salibo was finally transferred to the Quezon City Jail Annex, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology Building, Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, where he is currently detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On September 17, 2010, Salibo filed before the Court of Appeals the Urgent Petition for Habeas Corpus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> questioning the legality of his detention and deprivation of his liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He maintained that he is not the accused Butukan S.

The Warden, however, failed to file a Return one day before the hearing. He also appeared without counsel during the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Thus, the trial court canceled the hearing and reset it to September 29, 2010 at 2:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On September 28, 2010, the Warden filed the Return of the Writ. However, during the September 29, 2010 hearing on the Return, the Warden appeared with Atty. Romeo L.

Romeo L. Villante, Jr. on behalf of the Warden and argued that only the Office of the Solicitor General has the authority to appear on behalf of a respondent in a habeas corpus proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The September 29, 2010 hearing, therefore, was canceled. The trial court reset the hearing on the Return to October 1, 2010 at 9:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Return was finally heard on October 1, 2010. Assistant Solicitors Noel Salo and Isar Pepito appeared on behalf of the Warden of the Quezon City Jail Annex and argued that Salibo's Petition for Habeas Corpus should be dismissed. Since Salibo was charged under a valid Information and Warrant of Arrest, a petition for habeas corpus was "no longer availing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Salibo countered that the Information, Amended Information, Warrant of Arrest, and Alias Warrant of Arrest referred to by the Warden all point to Butukan S. Malang, not Datukan Malang Salibo, as accused. Reiterating that he was not Butukan S. Malang and that he was in Saudi Arabia on the day of the Maguindanao Massacre, Salibo pleaded the trial court to order his release from detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The trial court found that Salibo was not "judicially charged"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> under any resolution, information, or amended information. The Resolution, Information, and Amended Information presented in court did not charge Datukan Malang Salibo as an accused. He was also not validly arrested as there was no Warrant of Arrest or Alias Warrant of Arrest against Datukan Malang Salibo. Salibo, the trial court ruled, was not restrained of his liberty under process issued by a court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The trial court was likewise convinced that Salibo was not the Butukan S. Malang charged with murder in connection with the Maguindanao Massacre. The National Bureau of Investigation Clearance dated August 27, 2009 showed that Salibo has not been charged of any crime as of the date of the certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> A Philippine passport bearing Salibo's picture showed the name "Datukan Malang Salibo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the trial court said that Salibo "established that [he] was out of the country"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> from November 7, 2009 to December 19, 2009. This fact was supported by a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> from Saudi Arabian Airlines confirming Salibo's departure from and arrival in Manila on board its flights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A Flight Manifest issued by the Bureau of Immigration and Saudi Arabian Airlines Ticket No. 0652113 also showed this fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the Decision dated October 29, 2010, the trial court granted Salibo's Petition for Habeas Corpus and ordered his immediate release from detention.<br><br><b>Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</b><br><br>On appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> by the Warden, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the trial court's Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Through its Decision dated April 19, 2011, the Court of Appeals dismissed Salibo's Petition for Habeas Corpus.<br><br>Contrary to the trial court's finding, the Court of Appeals found that Salibo's arrest and subsequent detention were made under a valid Information and Warrant of Arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Even assuming that Salibo was not the Butukan S. Malang named in the Alias Warrant of Arrest, the Court of Appeals said that "[t]he orderly course of trial must be pursued and the usual remedies exhausted before the writ [of habeas corpus] may be invoked[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> According to the Court of Appeals, Salibo's proper remedy was a Motion to Quash Information and/or Warrant of Arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Salibo filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated July 6, 2011.<br><br><b>Proceedings before this court</b><br><br>On July 28, 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> petitioner Salibo filed before this court the Petition for Review (With Urgent Application for a Writ of Preliminary<br><br>Mandatory Injunction).

He is being illegally deprived of his liberty and, therefore, his proper remedy is a Petition for Habeas Corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Salibo adds that respondent Warden erred in appealing the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 153, Pasig City before the Court of Appeals. Although the Court of Appeals delegated to the trial court the authority to hear respondent Warden on the Return, the trial court's Decision should be deemed a Decision of the Court of Appeals. Therefore, respondent Warden should have directly filed his appeal before this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>As for respondent Warden, he maintains that petitioner Salibo was duly charged in court. Even assuming that he is not the Butukan S.

Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court enumerates the instances when a warrantless arrest may be made:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i>.—A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on- personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In cases falling under paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the person arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail and shall be proceeded against in accordance with section 7 of Rule 112.<br></blockquote>It is undisputed that petitioner Salibo presented himself before the Datu Hofer Police Station to clear his name and to prove that he is not the accused Butukan S. Malang. When petitioner Salibo was in the presence of the police officers of Datu Hofer Police Station, he was neither committing nor attempting to commit an offense. The police officers had no personal knowledge of any offense that he might have committed. Petitioner Salibo was also not an escapee prisoner.<br><br>The police officers, therefore, had no probable cause to arrest petitioner Salibo without a warrant.

Again, this is erroneous premise. The fiscal misinvoked and misapplied the cited rules. <i>The petitioners are not persons "lawfully arrested without a warrant."</i> The fiscal could not rely on the stale and inoperative PDA of January 25, 1985. Otherwise, the rules would be rendered nugatory, if all that was needed was to get a PDA and then serve it at one's whim and caprice when the very issuance of the PDA is premised on its imperative urgency and necessity as declared by the President himself. The majority decision then relies on Rule 113, Sec. 5 which authorizes arrests without warrant by a citizen or by a police officer who witnessed the arrestee <i>in flagrante delicto, viz. in the act of committing the offense</i>. Quite obviously, the arrest was not a citizen's arrest nor were they caught in flagrante delicto violating the law. In fact, this Court in promulgating the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure have tightened and made the rules more strict. Thus, the Rule now requires that an offense "has in fact <i>just</i> been committed." <i>This connotes immediacy in point of time</i> and excludes cases under the old rule where an offense "has <i>in fact</i> been committed" no matter how long ago. Similarly, <i>the arrestor must have</i> "<i>personal knowledge of facts</i> indicating that the [arrestee] has committed it" (instead of just "reasonable ground to believe that the [arrestee] has committed it" under the old rule). Clearly, then, <i>an information could not just be filed against the petitioners without due process and preliminary investigation</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</blockquote>Petitioner Salibo's proper remedy is not a Motion to Quash Information and/or Warrant of Arrest.

Changing the name of the accused appearing in the Information and/or Warrant of Arrest from "Butukan S.
