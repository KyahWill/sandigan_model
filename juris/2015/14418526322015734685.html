Citing Section 28 of the Corporation Code, the Bernas Group argued that the authority to call a meeting lies with the Corporate Secretary and not with the MSCOC which functions merely as an oversight body and is not vested with the power to call corporate meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp; For being called by the persons not authorized to do so, the Bernas Group urged the SEC to declare the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting, including the removal of the sitting officers and the election of new ones, be nullified.<br><br>For their part, the Cinco Group insisted that the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting is sanctioned by the Corporation Code and the MSC by-laws.&nbsp; In justifying the call effected by the MSCOC, they reasoned that Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of the MSC by-laws merely authorized the Corporate Secretary to issue notices of meetings and nowhere does it state that such authority solely belongs to him.&nbsp; It was further asseverated by the Cinco Group that it would be useless to course the request to call a meeting thru the Corporate Secretary because he repeatedly refused to call a special stockholders’ meeting despite demands and even filed a suit to restrain the holding of a special meeting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the newly elected directors initiated an investigation on the alleged anomalies in administering the corporate affairs and after finding Bernas guilty of irregularities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Board resolved to expel him from the club by selling his shares at public auction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; After the notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> requirement was complied with, Bernas’ shares was accordingly sold for P902,000.00 to the highest bidder.<br><br>Prior to the resolution of SEC Case No. 5840, an Annual Stockholders’ Meeting was held on 20 April 1998 pursuant to Section 8 of the MSC bylaws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; During the said meeting, which was attended by 1,017 stockholders representing 2/3 of the outstanding shares, the majority resolved to approve, confirm and ratify, among others, the calling and holding of 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting, the acts and resolutions adopted therein including the removal of Bernas Group from the Board and the election of their replacements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Due to the filing of several petitions for and against the removal of the Bernas Group from the Board pending before the SEC resulting in the piling up of legal controversies involving MSC, the SEC <i>En Banc,</i> in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated 30 March 1999, resolved to supervise the holding of the 1999 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.&nbsp; During the said meeting, the stockholders once again approved, ratified and confirmed the holding of the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting.<br><br>The conduct of the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting was likewise ratified by the stockholders during the 2000 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting which was held on 17 April 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 9 May 2000, the SICD rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in SEC Case No. 12-97-5840 finding, among others, that the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting and the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting conducted on 20 April 1998 and 19 April 1999 are invalid.&nbsp; The SICD likewise nullified the expulsion of Bernas from the corporation and the sale of his share at the public auction.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the said decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations this Office, through the undersigned Hearing Officer, hereby declares as follows:<br><br>(1) The supposed Special Stockholders’ Meeting of December 17, 1997 was prematurely or invalidly called by the [the Cinco Group].&nbsp; It therefore failed to produce any legal effects and did not effectively remove [the Bernas Group] as directors of the Makati Sports Club, Inc.<br><br>(2) The April 20, 1998 meeting was not attended by a sufficient number of valid proxies.&nbsp; No quorum could have been present at the said meeting.&nbsp; No corporate business could have been validly completed and/or transacted during the said meeting.&nbsp; Further, it was not called by the validly elected Corporate Secretary Victor Africa nor presided over by the validly elected president Jose A. Bernas.&nbsp; Even if the April 20, 1998 meeting was valid, it could not ratify the December 17, 1997 meeting because being a void meeting, the December 17, 1997 meeting may not be ratified.<br><br>(3) The April 1998 meeting was null and void and therefore produced no legal effect.<br><br>(4) The April 1999 meeting has not been raised as a defense in the Answer nor assailed in a supplemental complaint.&nbsp; However, it has been raised by [the Cinco Group] in a manifestation dated April 21, 1999 and in their position paper dated April 8, 2000.&nbsp; Its legal effects must be the subject of this Decision in order to put an end to the controversy at hand.&nbsp; In the first place, by [the Cinco Group’s] own admission, the alleged attendance at the April 1999 meeting amounted to less than 2/3 of the stockholders entitled to vote, the minimum number required to effect a removal.&nbsp; No removal or ratification of a removal may be effected by less than 2/3 vote of the stockholders.&nbsp; Further, it cannot ratify the December 1997 meeting for failure to adhere to the requirement of the By-laws on notice as explained in paragraph (2) above, even if it was accompanied by valid proxies, which it was not.<br><br>(5) The [the Cinco Group], their agents, representatives and all persons acting for and conspiring on their behalf, are hereby permanently enjoined from carrying into effect the resolutions and actions adopted during the 17 December 1997 and April 20, 1998 meetings and of the Board of Directors and/or other stockholders’ meetings resulting therefrom, and from performing acts of control and management of the club.<br><br>(6) The expulsion of complainant Jose A. Bernas as well as the public auction of his share is hereby declared void and without legal effect, as prayed for.&nbsp; While it is true that [the Cinco Group] were not restrained from acting as directors during the pendency of this case, their tenure as directors prior to this Decision is in the nature of de facto directors of a de facto Board.&nbsp; Only the ordinary acts of administration which [the Cinco Group] carried out de facto in good faith are valid.&nbsp; Other acts, such as political acts and the expulsion or other disciplinary acts imposed on the [the Bernas Group] may not be appropriately taken by de facto officers because the legality of their tenure as directors is not complete and subject to the outcome of this case.<br><br>(7) No awards for damages and attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>On appeal, the SEC <i>En Banc</i>, in its 12 December 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> reversed the findings of the SICD and validated the holding of the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting as well as the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting held on 20 April 1998 and 19 April 1999.<br><br>On 28 April 2003, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> declaring the&nbsp; 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting invalid for being improperly called but affirmed the actions taken during the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting held on 20 April 1998, 19 April 1999 and 17 April 2000.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated 27 April 2004, the appellate court refused to reconsider its earlier decision.<br><br>Aggrieved by the disquisition of the Court of Appeals, both parties elevated the case before this Court by filing their respective Petitions for Review on <i>Certiorari.</i>&nbsp; While the Bernas Group agrees with the disquisition of the appellate court that the Special Stockholders’ Meeting is invalid for being called by the persons not authorized to do so, they urge the Court to likewise invalidate the holding of the subsequent Annual Stockholders’ Meetings invoking the application of the holdover principle.&nbsp; The Cinco Group, for its part, insists that the holding of 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting is valid and binding underscoring the overwhelming ratification made by the stockholders during the subsequent annual stockholders’ meetings and the previous refusal of the Corporate Secretary to call a special stockholders’ meeting despite demand.&nbsp; For the resolution of the Court are the following issues:<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE 17 DECEMBER 1997 SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS’ MEETING IS INVALID; AND<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FAILING TO NULLIFY THE HOLDING OF THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS’ MEETING ON 20 APRIL 1998, 19 APRIL 1999 AND 17 APRIL 2000.<br></blockquote><br><b><center><i>The Court’s Ruling</i><br></center></b><br>The Corporation Code laid down the rules on the removal of the Directors of the corporation by providing, <i>inter alia</i>, the persons authorized to call the meeting and the number of votes required for the purpose of removal, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 28</b>. <i>Removal of directors or trustees</i>. - Any director or trustee of a corporation may be removed from office by a vote of the stockholders holding or representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital stock, or if the corporation be a non-stock corporation, by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members entitled to vote: Provided, That such removal shall take place either at a regular meeting of the corporation or at a special meeting called for the purpose, and in either case, after previous notice to stockholders or members of the corporation of the intention to propose such removal at the meeting. <b>A special meeting of the stockholders or members of a corporation for the purpose of removal of directors or trustees, or any of them, must be called by the secretary on order of the president or on the written demand of the stockholders representing or holding at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock</b>, or, if it be a non-stock corporation, on the written demand of a majority of the members entitled to vote. Should the secretary fail or refuse to call the special meeting upon such demand or fail or refuse to give the notice, or if there is no secretary, the call for the meeting may be addressed directly to the stockholders or members by any stockholder or member of the corporation signing the demand. Notice of the time and place of such meeting, as well as of the intention to propose such removal, must be given by publication or by written notice prescribed in this Code. Removal may be with or without cause: Provided, That removal without cause may not be used to deprive minority stockholders or members of the right of representation to which they may be entitled under Section 24 of this Code. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Corollarily, the pertinent provisions of MSC by-laws which govern the manner of calling and sending of notices of the annual stockholders’ meeting and the special stockholders’ meeting provide:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 8. Annual Meetings.&nbsp; The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at the Clubhouse on the third Monday of April of every year unless such day be a holiday in which case the annual meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day.&nbsp; At such meeting, the President shall render a report to the stockholders of the clubs.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 10. Special Meetings.&nbsp; Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at the Clubhouse when called by the President or by the Board of Directors or upon written request of the stockholders representing not less than one hundred (100) shares.&nbsp; Only matters specified in the notice and call will be taken up at special meetings.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 25. Secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary shall keep the stock and transfer book and the corporate seal, which he shall stamp on all documents requiring such seal, fill and sign together with the President, all the certificates of stocks issued, give or caused to be given all notices required by law of these By-laws as well as notices of all meeting of the Board and of the stockholders; shall certify as to quorum at meetings; shall approve and sign all correspondence pertaining to the Office of the Secretary; shall keep the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and of all committees in a book or books kept for that purpose; and shall be acting President in the absence of the President and Vice-:President. The Secretary must be a citizen and a resident of the Philippines.&nbsp; The Secretary shall keep a record of all the addresses and telephone numbers of all stockholders. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Textually, only the President and the Board of Directors are authorized by the by-laws to call a special meeting.&nbsp; In cases where the person authorized to call a meeting refuses, fails or neglects to call a meeting, then the stockholders representing at least 100 shares, upon written request, may file a petition to call a special stockholder’s meeting.<br><br>In the instant case, there is no dispute that the 17 December 1997 Special Stockholders’ Meeting was called neither by the President nor by the Board of Directors but by the MSCOC.&nbsp; While the MSCOC, as its name suggests, is created for the purpose of overseeing the affairs of the corporation, nowhere in the by-laws does it state that it is authorized to exercise corporate powers, such as the power to call a special meeting, solely vested by law and the MSC by-laws on the President or the Board of Directors.<br><br>The board of directors is the directing and controlling body of the corporation.&nbsp; It is a creation of the stockholders and derives its power to control and direct the affairs of the corporation from them.&nbsp; The board of directors, in drawing to itself the power of the corporation, occupies a position of trusteeship in relation to the stockholders, in the sense that the board should exercise not only care and diligence, but utmost good faith in the management of the corporate affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The underlying policy of the Corporation Code is that the business and affairs of a corporation must be governed by a board of directors whose members have stood for election, and who have actually been elected by the stockholders, on an annual basis.&nbsp; Only in that way can the continued accountability to shareholders, and the legitimacy of their decisions that bind the corporation’s stockholders, be assured.&nbsp; The shareholder vote is critical to the theory that legitimizes the exercise of power by the directors or officers over the properties that they do not own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Even the Corporation Code is categorical in stating that a corporation exercises its powers through its board of directors and/or its duly authorized officers and agents, except in instances where the Corporation Code requires stockholders’ approval for certain specific acts:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i> The Board of Directors or Trustees</i>. – Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the corporate powers of all the corporations formed under this Code shall be exercised, all business conducted and all property of such corporations controlled and held by the board of directors and trustees x x x.</blockquote><br>A corporation’s board of directors is understood to be that body which (1) exercises all powers provided for under the Corporation Code; (2) conducts all business of the corporation; and (3) controls and holds all the property of the corporation.&nbsp; Its members have been characterized as trustees or directors clothed with fiduciary character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>It is ineluctably clear that the fiduciary relation is between the stockholders and the board of directors and who are vested with the power to manage the affairs of the corporation.&nbsp; The ordinary trust relationship of directors of a corporation and stockholders is not a matter of statutory or technical law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It springs from the fact that directors have the control and guidance of corporate affairs and property and hence of the property interests of the stockholders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Equity recognizes that stockholders are the proprietors of the corporate interests and are ultimately the only beneficiaries thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Should the board fail to perform its fiduciary duty to safeguard the interest of the stockholders or commit acts prejudicial to their interest, the law and the by-laws provide mechanisms to remove and replace the erring director.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Relative to the powers of the Board of Directors, nowhere in the Corporation Code or in the MSC by-laws can it be gathered that the Oversight Committee is authorized to step in wherever there is breach of fiduciary duty and call a special meeting for the purpose of removing the existing officers and electing their replacements even if such call was made upon the request of shareholders.&nbsp; Needless to say, the MSCOC is neither empowered by law nor the MSC by-laws to call a meeting and the subsequent ratification made by the stockholders did not cure the substantive infirmity, the defect having set in at the time the void act was done.&nbsp; The defect goes into the very authority of the persons who made the call for the meeting.&nbsp; It is apt to recall that illegal acts of a corporation which contemplate the doing of an act which is contrary to law, morals or public order, or contravenes some rules of public policy or public duty, are, like similar transactions between individuals, void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; They cannot serve as basis for a court action, nor acquire validity by performance, ratification or estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The same principle can apply in the present case. The void election of 17 December 1997 cannot be ratified by the subsequent Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.<br><br>A distinction should be made between corporate acts or contracts which are illegal and those which are merely <i>ultra vires</i>.&nbsp; The former contemplates the doing of an act which are contrary to law, morals or public policy or public duty, and are, like similar transactions between individuals, void.&nbsp; They cannot serve as basis of a court action nor acquire validity by performance, ratification or estoppel.&nbsp; Mere <i>ultra vires</i> acts, on the other hand, or those which are not illegal or void <i>ab initio,</i> but are not merely within the scope of the articles of incorporation, are merely voidable and may become binding and enforceable when ratified by the stockholders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The 17 December 1997 Meeting belongs to the category of the latter, that is, it is void <i>ab initio</i> and cannot be validated.<br><br>Consequently, such Special Stockholders’ Meeting called by the Oversight Committee cannot have any legal effect.&nbsp; The removal of the Bernas Group, as well as the election of the Cinco Group, effected by the assembly in that improperly called meeting is void, and since the Cinco Group has no legal right to sit in the board, their subsequent acts of expelling Bernas from the club and the selling of his shares at the public auction, are likewise invalid.<br><br>The Cinco Group cannot invoke the application of <i>de facto</i> officership doctrine to justify the actions taken after the invalid election since the operation of the principle is limited to third persons who were originally not part of the corporation but became such by reason of voting of government- sequestered shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Cojuangco v. Roxas,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court deemed the directors who were elected through the voting of government of sequestered shares who assumed office in good faith as de facto officers, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In the light of the foregoing discussion, the Court finds and so holds that <b>the PCGG has no right to vote the sequestered shares of petitioners including the sequestered corporate shares</b>.&nbsp; Only their owners, duly authorized representatives or proxies may vote the said shares.&nbsp; Consequently, the election of private respondents Adolfo Azcuna, Edison Coseteng and Patricio Pineda as members of the board of directors of SMC for 1990-1991 should be set aside.<br><br>However, petitioners cannot be declared as duly elected members of the board of directors thereby.&nbsp; An election for the purpose should be held where the questioned shares may be voted by their owners and/or their proxies.&nbsp; Such election may be held at the next shareholders’ meeting in April 1991 or at such date as may be set under the by-laws of SMC.<br><br>Private respondents in both cases <b>are hereby declared to be <i>de facto</i> officers who in good faith assumed their duties and responsibilities as duly elected members of the board</b> of directors of the SMC. They are thereby legally entitled to emoluments of the office including salary, fees and other compensation attached to the office until they vacate the same. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Apparently, the assumption of office of the Cinco Group did not bear parallelism with the factual milieu in <i>Cojuangco</i> and as such they cannot be considered as <i>de facto</i> officers and thus, they are without colorable authority to authorize the removal of Bernas and the sale of his shares at the public auction.&nbsp; They cannot bind the corporation to third persons who acquired the shares of Bernas and such third persons cannot be deemed as buyer in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The case would have been different if the petitioning stockholders went directly to the SEC and sought its assistance to call a special stockholders’ meeting citing the previous refusal of the Corporate Secretary to call a meeting.&nbsp; Where there is an officer authorized to call a meeting and that officer refuses, fails, or neglects to call a meeting, the SEC can assume jurisdiction and issue an order to the petitioning stockholder to call a meeting pursuant to its regulatory and administrative powers to implement the Corporation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; This is clearly provided for by Section 50 of the Corporation Code which we quote:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 50.&nbsp; <i>Regular and special meetings of stockholders or members.</i> – x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Whenever, for any cause, there is no person authorized to call a meeting, the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon petition of a stockholder or member, and on a showing of good cause therefore, may issue an order to the petitioning stockholder or member directing him to call a meeting of the corporation by giving proper notice required by this Code or by the by-laws.&nbsp; The petitioning stockholder or member shall preside thereat until at least majority of the stockholders or members present have chosen one of their member[s] as presiding officer.</blockquote><br>As early as <i>Ponce v.

If it be true that the Corporate Secretary refused to call a meeting despite fervent demand from the MSCOC, the remedy of the stockholders would have been to file a petition to the SEC to direct him to call a meeting by giving proper notice required under the Code.&nbsp; To rule otherwise would open the floodgates to abuse where any stockholder, who consider himself aggrieved by certain corporate actions, could call a special stockholders’ meeting for the purpose of removing the sitting officers in direct violation of the rules pertaining to the call of meeting laid down in the by-laws.<br><br>Every corporation has the inherent power to adopt by-laws for its internal government, and to regulate the conduct and prescribe the rights and duties of its members towards itself and among themselves in reference to the management of its affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The by-laws of a corporation are its own private laws which substantially have the same effect as the laws of the corporation.&nbsp; They are in effect written into the charter.&nbsp; In this sense they become part of the fundamental law of the corporation with which the corporation and its directors and officers must comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The general rule is that a corporation, through its board of directors, should act in the manner and within the formalities, if any, prescribed in its charter or by the general law.&nbsp; Thus, directors must act as a body in a meeting called pursuant to the law or the corporation’s by-laws, otherwise, any action taken therein may be questioned by the objecting director or shareholder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Certainly, the rules set in the by-laws are mandatory for every member of the corporation to respect.&nbsp; They are the fundamental law of the corporation with which the corporation and its officers and members must comply.&nbsp; It is on this score that we cannot upon the other hand sustain the Bernas Group’s stance that the subsequent annual stockholders’ meetings were invalid.<br><br>First, the 20 April 1998 Annual Stockholders Meeting was valid because it was sanctioned by Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of the MSC bylaws.&nbsp;

1999 Annual Stockholders Meeting is likewise valid because in addition to the fact that it was conducted in accordance to Section 8 of the MSC bylaws, such meeting was supervised by the SEC in the exercise of its regulatory and administrative powers to implement the Corporation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Needless to say, the conduct of SEC supervised Annual Stockholders Meeting gave rise to the presumption that the corporate officers who won the election were duly elected to their positions and therefore can be rightfully considered as <i>de jure</i> officers.&nbsp;

The former contemplates the doing of an act which is contrary to law, morals, or public policy or public duty, and are, like similar transactions between public order, or contravene some rules of individuals, void. They cannot serve as basis of a court action, nor acquire validity by performance, ratification, or <i>estoppel</i>. Mere <i>ultra vires</i> acts, on the other hand, or those which are not illegal and void <i>ab initio</i>, but are not merely within the scope of the articles of incorporation. are merely voidable and may become binding and enforceable when ratified by the stockholders.</blockquote><br>As earlier mentioned, the December 17, 1997 Meeting is void <i>ab initio</i> for contravening Section 28 of the Corporation Code. Hence, while I agree with the <i>ponencio</i> that the April 20, 1998 and April 19, 1999 Meetings were called in compliance with the MSC by-laws,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> I differ in that the removal of the Bernas Group and election of the Cinco Group which are mere incidents resulting from the void December 17, 1997 Meeting could not have been ratified, notwithstanding the fact that the latter April 19, 1999&nbsp; Meeting was held under the supervision of the SEC. The SEC, being a mere regulatory body, cannot lend validity to otherwise invalid acts. Further, the presumption of regularity 10 cannot apply for the purpose of validating an internal action of a private corporation.<br><br>While Section 51 of the Corporation Code states that a meeting shall be valid even if improperly called if all the stockholders are present or duly represented at the meeting, it has not been shown that this is the case here.<br><br>Neither can the ratifications done during the April 20, 1998 and April 19, 1999 Meetings be equated to the valid election of the Cinco Group, enough to accord them with <i>de jure</i> status.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Clearly, these meetings were specifically called for the ratification of acts taken during the void December 17, 1997 Meeting, and not for the actual election of directors anew; to reiterate, the ratification of void acts is strictly prohibited under the doctrine enunciated in <i>Pirovano</i>. Besides, the procedure in ratifying acts approved or taken during prior meetings is different from the procedure in electing directors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which was not shown to have been complied with in any of those meetings.<br><br>Ultimately, however, it should be pointed out that the issue of directorship has been rendered moot and academic by the lapse of the three (3)-year staggered term prescribed by the MSC's by-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In fact, the MSC's own website<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> states that the corporation has a new set of directors which does not include any of the herein parties. Thus, the only actual issue left to be resolved is the validity of the expulsion of Bernas from MSC and the subsequent sale of his shares, all effected in the February 27, 1998 Meeting. On this score, I join the <i>ponencia</i> in ruling that both actions are void and without legal effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>III.</u><br></center></b><br>Under the MSC by-laws,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> a member may be suspended or expelled with the two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Board of Directors.<br><br>As aptly observed by the <i>ponencia</i>, the Cinco Group cannot invoke the <i>de facto</i> officership doctrine to justify its actions after their invalid election in the December 17, 1997 Meeting, particularly, the expulsion of Bernas from MSC and the sale of his shares. A <i>de facto </i>officer is one who acts as such under color of an election or appointment, but fails being a <i>de jure</i> officer by some irregularity or failure to qualify as required by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Having ruled out the validity of their election either through the December 17, 1997 Meeting or through the ratifications in the April 20, 1998 and April 19, 1999 Meetings, the Cinco Group cannot be considered as <i>de facto</i> directors of MSC. As such, they could not have validly expelled Bernas from MSC and sold his shares of stock. More significantly, since the <i>de facto</i> doctrine rests on public policy and justice, the official dealings of directors <i>de facto</i> with third persons being sustained as rightful and valid on the ground of the corporation's continuous acquiescence to the officers holding themselves out as having such authority, it is only available to third persons dealing with corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; No such third person invoked the doctrine here.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, subject to the qualifications herein made, I vote to DENY the consolidated petitions.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See <i>Ponencia</i>, pp. 13-15 and 9-10. respectively.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Batas Pambansa Bilang 68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
