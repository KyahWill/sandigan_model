				<H3>OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. MS. FLORED L. NICOLAS, FORMER COURT INTERPRETER AND OFFICER-IN-CHARGE; MS. ERLINDA U. CABRERA, FORMER CLERK OF COURT II; AND MR.

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Sometime in 2004, a financial audit was conducted on the books of accounts of the Municipal Trial Court of Guiguinto, Bulacan (Guiguinto MTC) covering the period March 1985 to July 31, 2004 under then Clerk of Court II Erlinda U. Cabrera. The 2004 audit revealed that Cabrera incurred shortages amounting to P1,483,351.85 which served as the basis of the administrative cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed against her docketed as A.M. Nos. P-05-2027 and P-05-2028.<br><br>To prevent further dissipation of court funds, Cabrera was relieved from her duty as collecting officer. Pending the resolution of Cabrera's administrative cases, Court Interpreter Flored L. Nicolas was appointed as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) and was designated to handle the financial transactions of the court particularly the collections, remittances and reporting of all legal fees collected by the court. Nicolas acted as such until the appointment of Clerk of Court II Edwin C. Santos on July 13, 2006.<br><br>In the meantime, Cabrera was dismissed from service for dishonesty and gross misconduct and was ordered to restitute P1,483,351.85 in this Court's decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 27, 2006 in A.M. Nos. P-05-2027 and P-05-2028.<br><br>Due to the absence without leave (AWOL) of Nicolas and the grant of study leave to Santos, a second financial audit was conducted from March 1 to 5, 2010 on the books of accounts of the Guiguinto MTC covering the period August 1, 2004 to February 28, 2010. The period of accountability of Nicolas was from August 1, 2004 to July 31, 2006 while that of Santos was from August 1, 2006 to February 28, 2010.<br><br>Below is the summary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the accountability of Nicolas and Santos from the second audit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%">Mr. Edwin C.

The above-computed shortages have already been restituted by Santos.<br><br>The shortages attributed to Nicolas, on the other hand, were due to her failure to deposit her collections on time during her tenure as collecting officer. Her shortages remain outstanding.<br><br>The audit team also noted that the triplicate FF Official Receipts Nos. 6729451-6729500 issued by Nicolas for the period February 2005 to June 2006 were not presented for examination. All cash bonds collected during said period were extracted mainly from the Monthly Reports of Collections/Deposits and Withdrawals for Fiduciary Fund, records of cases filed for said period, as well as from the withdrawals reflected on the court's LBP Savings Account. All efforts were exhausted by the audit team to establish the true and correct amount collected under O.R. Nos. 6729451-6729500 but the following official receipts remain unaccounted for:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center">6729466</div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center">9729485</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">6729478</div></td><td><div align="center">9729500<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">6729481</div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>According to the audit team, Nicolas' accountability may still increase if the above unaccounted official receipts will be identified and examined.<br><br>In its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated June 10, 2010 to Court Administrator Jose Midas P.

To confirm the information relayed by Mr. Mesenda, the OCA endeavored to secure the telephone number of the office of Barangay Sta. Rita, but to no avail.

She claimed that she does not know how she will give an explanation since she is not in possession of any record regarding the missing court funds and official receipts. She is also requesting that she be given a copy of complete records of the financial audit that was conducted in Guiguinto MTC. She also prayed that she be given an opportunity to return to the service, or that she be informed if she is still entitled to receive any benefits including her terminal leave benefits.<br><br>In the meantime, a copy of the August 15, 2012 Resolution sent to Santos at his given address, which, among others, imposed upon him a P10,000 fine for his failure to deposit his collections on time, was returned unserved with postal notation "RTS-Resigned." A copy of the Resolution dated June 19, 2013 which was also sent to Santos at his given address was returned with the postal notation "RTS-No One to Receive, Addressee Abroad."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated February 26, 2014, this Court informed Nicolas that this administrative matter was already referred to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation and that she can file her compliance with the OCA considering that the extension she requested has already lapsed.<br><br>In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated July 9, 2014, the OCA opined that Nicolas had already been given sufficient time to answer/comply with the August 23, 2010 Resolution. It noted that despite the lapse of the requested extension of time to file the compliance, she has not submitted the same. The OCA is of the opinion that the requirement of due process has been complied with as she has been given an opportunity to be heard. Thus, it recommended, among others, that Nicolas be found guilty of gross neglect of duty for non-remittance of her judiciary collections; that she be dismissed from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and with perpetual disqualification from re-employment in any government agency, including government-owned and controlled corporations; and that she be directed to pay the amount of P177,838.24 representing her shortages.<br><br>We agree with the OCA that Nicolas should be held administratively liable.<br><br>Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution declares that a public office is a public trust, and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. The demand for moral uprightness is more pronounced for the members and personnel of the judiciary who are involved in the dispensation of justice. As frontliners in the administration of justice, they should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Circular No. 50-95 mandates that "[a]ll collections from bailbonds, rental deposits, and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited within twenty four (24) hours by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with the Land Bank of the Philippines." Undoubtedly, Nicolas violated said circular considering the shortages she incurred when she was OIC of Guiguinto MTC.<br><br>Clerks of court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice. Their office is the hub of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns. They perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises. As such, they generally are also the treasurer, accountant, guard and physical plant manager thereof. They are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The fact that Nicolas was a mere OIC did not diminish the expectation<br><br>from her to perform all the duties and responsibilities of a Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As the OIC, she bore the same responsibilities and was expected to serve with the same commitment and efficiency as a duly-appointed Clerk of Court. Likewise, she must be held liable for any loss, shortage, destruction, or impairment of the funds entrusted to her by virtue of her office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In this case, Nicolas failed to offer an explanation on the shortages that were incurred during her period of accountability. We agree with the OCA that she was given more than enough time to submit her explanation and that the requirement of due process was sufficiently complied with. She even allowed the 45 to 60 days extension she requested to lapse. Thus, it is clearly her fault why she failed to explain the shortages discovered during the audit.<br><br>Since Nicolas failed to offer any explanation on the audit findings, the Court shall consider the audit team's report as conclusive and adjudge her liability on the sole basis thereof.<br><br>Failure of a public officer, Nicolas in this case, to remit funds upon demand by an authorized officer constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the public officer has put such missing funds or property to personal use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Without Nicolas' explanation as to the non-remittance of court collections while she was the accountable officer, the prima facie presumption stands.<br><br>In <i>Audit Report, RTC-4, Davao del Norte</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court held that the failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Under Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, dishonesty, gross neglect of duty, and grave misconduct are classified as grave offenses with the corresponding penalty of dismissal for the first offense.<br><br>The Court notes the observation of the audit team regarding the missing official receipts, which, if identified and examined, may still increase the accountability of Nicolas. While she mentioned in her <i>Sulat Kahilingan</i>, that she has no records of said receipts or any document pertaining thereto, the July 9, 2014 Memorandum of the OCA did not mention Nicolas' liability regarding them, if any. Thus, there is a need for OCA to ascertain if Nicolas may still be held liable regarding the receipts which remain unaccounted for.<br><b><br>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court finds Ms. Flored L.
