The informant alleged that Latif was engaged in selling <i>shabu</i> and capable of selling large amounts of <i>bulto</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> IO2 Sandaan instructed the informant to call Latif and order seven <i>bulto</i> of <i>shabu</i> and learned that each bulto would cost P27,000.00. The informant confirmed the transaction.<br><br>IO2 Sandaan called a team composed of IO1 Frederick Santos, IO1 Reed, IO1 Samson and IO1 Leverette Lopez and briefed them on the alleged drug activities in Caloocan City. At about 4:00 a.m. the following day, IO2 Sandaan conducted a briefing on the buy-bust operation. IO1 Samson was the designated poseur-buyer while IO1 Santos was the immediate back-up arresting officer. IO2 Sandaan handed two P500-bills as buy-bust money to IO1 Samson who marked the bills with his initials. They made it appear that the money was in a bundle placing one P500-bill at the top of the stack and another at the bottom.<br><br>They agreed that if the deal was consummated, IO1 Samson would remove his cap as the signal. IO2 Sandaan asked her team to prepare the Pre-Operation Report and Authority to Operate. Before leaving, the team coordinated with the Tactical Operation Center, the Quezon City Police and the Caloocan City Police.<br><br>The team with the informant went to Brgy. Malaria, Caloocan City on-board a red L-300 van. Upon arriving at around 9:30 a.m., IO1 Samson and the informant alighted from the van and proceeded to the designated area, an eatery near the barangay hall. The rest of the team stayed at a nearby burger place about eight meters away.<br><br>With the team positioned, the informant called Latif. A short male person, subsequently identified as appellant, arrived shortly after the call. The informant introduced IO1 Samson as the buyer and asked whether he had the item with him. Appellant replied in the affirmative and asked IO1 Samson if he brought the money. IO1 Samson replied in the affirmative and partly opened the plastic bag containing the money showing the top portion to appellant. He then informed appellant that he will only hand the money when he received the item.<br><br>Appellant pulled out from his pocket a transparent plastic wrapped with electrical tape and handed it to IO1 Samson. Upon receipt of the plastic packet with the crystalline substance, IO1 Samson grabbed appellant, introduced himself as PDEA agent, and removed his cap to notify the team. The team approached the target area and IO1 Santos assisted IO1 Samson in arresting appellant by handcuffing him and reading to him his constitutional rights.<br><br>There being a commotion caused by the arrest and spectators drawn to the sight, IO2 Sandaan called the driver to the target area. A person introducing himself as the barangay captain approached her and asked what had happened. IO2 Sandaan introduced herself as a PDEA agent and told him that they were arresting someone. She learned that appellant was a member of a Muslim drug group and a tricycle driver. Noting that she only had five agents with her she decided to promptly leave the area and conduct an inventory of the seized articles in Brgy. Pinyahan, Quezon City. En route, IO1 Samson maintained custody and possession of the items taken from appellant.<br><br>When the team arrived at the barangay hall of Brgy. Pinyahan, they opened the plastic bag and found seven sachets of<i> shabu</i>. These were included in the list along with electrical wrapper and plastic bag. An Inventory of Seized Properties/Items<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was prepared by IO1 Samson in the presence of Barangay Kagawad Melinda Gaffud. Inventory was made and the evidence marked by IO1 Samson while IO1 Lopez photographed the same. After finalizing the inventory and markings, the team went back to the PDEA-MMRO to prepare the requests for laboratory examination and drug test examination. IO1 Samson personally brought the specimen and the request to the PDEA Crime Laboratory Service on the same day.<br><br>Upon receipt of the request, Maria Criser Abad, the Crime Laboratory Chemist on duty, personally performed the examination on the seven sachets containing white crystalline substance submitted by IO1 Samson. Appellant's urine sample was likewise submitted.<br><br>The evidence was found pos1t1ve for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On the other hand, appellant's urine sample was found negative for the presence of <i>shabu</i> and marijuana.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Defense's Version</u></b></center><br><br>The defense's evidence consisted of the testimonies of Jocelyn Garcia-Carrera, live-in partner of appellant, and appellant.<br><br>Appellant denied owning and possessing the plastic sachets containing the white crystalline substance. Appellant, a tricycle driver, asserts that he was working on that day. His services were contracted by a passenger who wanted a ride from Phase 12, Tala, Caloocan to Brgy. Malaria and back. Jocelyn decided to ride with appellant and the passenger to Brgy. Malaria because she wanted to buy medicines. When they arrived at Brgy. Malaria, the passenger alighted and told appellant to wait for him. While he was waiting with Jocelyn for the passenger's return, they were suddenly handcuffed by the members of the buy-bust team. He identified his passenger as one of the people who arrested him. Both he and Jocelyn were frisked. They took his wallet but the same was returned without his driver's license. Both he and Jocelyn then were placed inside a van. Jocelyn was let-off at Lagro, Quezon City. He was then asked if he knew a person named Latif which he answered in the negative.<br><br>They left Caloocan, stayed for a while at Quezon City Memorial Circle, and then proceeded to the barangay hall of Brgy. Pinyahan. It was when they were in the barangay hall of Brgy. Pinyahan that appellant saw for the first time the prohibited drugs.<br><br>In its November 27, 2012 Decision, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The RTC ruled:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring [appellant] Rolando Carrera y Imbat for Violation of Sec. 5, Art.

No. 9165. It ruled:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The November 27, 2012 Decision of Caloocan City Regional Trial Court, Branch 127, in Criminal Case No. C-81635, finding [appellant] Rolando Carrera y Imbat guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> in that this Court instead finds [appellant] <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of illegal possession of prohibited drugs penalized under Section 11, Art.

Both parties<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> decided to forego the tiling of such pleadings and opted to adopt the briefs they had submitted before the CA.<br><br>The issue for our consideration is whether appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal possession of illegal drugs.<br><br>We deny the appeal and affirm with modification the July 10, 2014 Decision of the CA.<br><br>We note at the outset that appellant was charged in the information with selling and delivering <i>shabu</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and was apprehended during a buy-bust operation conducted by the PDEA.<br><br><b>FEAR FOR LOSS OF LIFE AND LIMB<br>IS A SUITABLE JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT <br>CONDUCTING THE INVENTORY AND <br>MARKING AT THE NEAREST BARANGAY <br>HALL OR POLICE STATION</b><br><br>Buy-bust operations are recognized in this jurisdiction as a legitimate form of entrapment of the persons suspected of being involved in drug dealings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the prosecution of illegal sale of dangerous drugs in a buy­ bust operation, there must be a concurrence of all the elements of the offense: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment thereof. The prosecution must also prove the illegal sale of the dangerous drugs and present the <i>corpus delicti</i> in court as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>We have stated that strict compliance with the prescribed procedure is required for the prosecution of illegal sale because of the illegal drug's unique characteristic rendering it indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It is thus important that the "chain of custody," provided under Section 21(1),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Article II of R.A. No. 9165 and Section 21(a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165, be established to allay any suspicion of tampering. In a buy-bust operation, the failure to conduct a physical inventory and to photograph the items seized from the accused will not render his arrest illegal or the items confiscated from him inadmissible in evidence as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the said items have been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We have recognized that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 may not always be possible under field conditions. As the IRR states, "non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]" These lapses, however, must be recognized and explained in terms of their justifiable grounds, and the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized must be shown to have been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is thus the prosecution's burden to prove justifiable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Here, IO1 Samson narrated:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">So, what happened when you arrived in Bgy.

Malaria.<br><br><b>APPELLANT IS GUILTY OF ILLEGAL <br>DELIVERY OF A PROHIBITED DRUG</b><br><br>We agree with the CA that appellant may not be held guilty of illegal sale of a prohibited drug. In order to establish the crime of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the identity of the object and the consideration of the sale; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and of the payment for the thing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It is thus imperative that proof of the transaction or sale be established together with the presentation of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in court.<br><br>Here, IO1 Samson, as the poseur-buyer, admitted that while he was in possession of the marked money he failed to effect payment even after the seller delivered the item to him. There being no payment, no sale was ever consummated between the parties. There being no consummated sale, appellant cannot be found guilty of illegal sale.<br><br>While we agree with the CA that appellant is still liable for an offense under R.A. No. 9165, we disagree with its conclusion that appellant is guilty of illegal possession of a prohibited drug. We previously held that Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 punishes acts in addition to selling prohibited drugs. We stated:<br><br><blockquote>It must be emphasized that appellants were charged with selling, trading, delivering, giving away, dispatching in transit and transporting dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. The charge was not limited to selling. Said section punishes not only the sale but also the mere act of delivery of prohibited drugs after the offer to buy by the entrapping officer has been accepted by the seller. In the distribution of prohibited drugs, the payment of any consideration is immaterial. The mere act of distributing the prohibited drugs to others is in itself a punishable offense. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>As we noted, appellant was charged with illegal sale and delivery of a prohibited drug under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. Appellant thus based on the information and the evidence presented may be found liable of illegal delivery of prohibited drugs.<br><br>In <i>People v. Maongco,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> we stated that a person may be convicted of illegal delivery of dangerous drugs if it is proven that (1) the accused passed on possession of a dangerous drug to another, personally or otherwise, and by any means; (2) such delivery is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused knowingly made the delivery with or without consideration. In this case, we convicted a person charged with illegal sale of <i>shabu </i>of illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i> for non-payment by the poseur-buyer.<br><br>Likewise, in <i>People v. Reyes</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we convicted a person of illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i> instead of illegal sale of a prohibited drug because the prosecution did not establish payment - an essential element of the crime of illegal sale of a prohibited drug.<br><br>In the present case, the prosecution established that appellant based on a prior arrangement knowingly passed the <i>shabu</i> to IO1 Samson. Being a tricycle driver, appellant was without authority to hold and deliver the drug. Thus, appellant is guilty of illegal delivery of <i>shabu.</i><br><br>Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 provides that the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a tine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person who shall be found guilty of illegal delivery of a prohibited drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.
