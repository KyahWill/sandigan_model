				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Nature of the Case</b><br></div><br>Before the Court is the Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> filed following the leak in the oil pipeline owned by First Philippine Industrial Corporation (FPIC) in Makati City.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Respondent FPIC operates two pipelines since 1969, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>: (1) the White Oil Pipeline (WOPL) System, which covers a 117-kilometer stretch from Batangas to the Pandacan Terminal in Manila and transports diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene; and (b) the Black Oil Pipeline (BOPL) System, which extends 105 kilometers and transports bunker fuel from Batangas to a depot in Sucat, Parañaque. These systems transport nearly 60% of the petroleum requirements of Metro Manila and parts of the provinces of Bulacan, Laguna, and Rizal.<br><br>The two pipelines were supposedly designed to provide more than double the standard safety allowance against leakage, considering that they are made out of heavy duty steel that can withstand more than twice the current operating pressure and are buried at a minimum depth of 1.5 meters, which is deeper than the US Department of Transportation standard of 0.9 meters.<br><br>In May 2010, however, a leakage from one of the pipelines was suspected after the residents of West Tower Condominium (WestTower) started to smell gas within the condominium. A search made on July 10, 2010 within the condominium premises led to the discovery of a fuel leak from the wall of its Basement 2. Owing to its inability to control the flow, WestTower’s management reported the matter to the Police Department of Makati City, which in turn called the city’s Bureau of Fire Protection.<br><br>What started as a two-drum leak at the initial stages became a 15-20 drum a day affair. Eventually, the sump pit of the condominium was ordered shut down by the City of Makati to prevent the discharge of contaminated water into the drainage system of Barangay Bangkal. Eventually, the fumes compelled the residents of WestTower to abandon their respective units on July 23, 2010 and the condo’s power was shut down.<br><br>Petitioner FPIC initially disowned any leak from its oil pipeline. Thus, the residents of WestTower shouldered the expenses of hauling the waste water from its basement, which eventually required the setting up of a treatment plant in the area to separate fuel from the waste water.<br><br>On October 28, 2010, the University of the Philippines-National Institute of Geological Sciences (UP-NIGS), which the City of Makati invited to determine the source of the fuel, found a leak in FPIC’s WOPL about 86 meters from West Tower.<br><br>A day after, or on October 29, 2010, FPIC admitted that indeed the source of the fuel leak is the WOPL, which was already closed since October 24, 2010, but denied liability by placing blame on the construction activities on the roads surrounding West Tower.<br><br>On November 15, 2010, West Tower Condominium Corporation (West Tower Corp.) interposed the present Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> on behalf of the residents of West Tower and in representation of the surrounding communities in Barangay Bangkal, Makati City. West Tower Corp. also alleged that it is joined by the civil society and several people’s organizations, non-governmental organizations and public interest groups who have expressed their intent to join the suit because of the magnitude of the environmental issues involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In their petition, petitioners prayed that respondents FPIC and its board of directors and officers, and First Gen Corporation (FGC) and its board of directors and officers be directed to: (1) permanently cease and desist from committing acts of negligence in the performance of their functions as a common carrier; (2) continue to check the structural integrity of the whole 117-kilometer pipeline and to replace the same; (3) make periodic reports on their findings with regard to the 117-kilometer pipeline and their replacement of the same; (4) rehabilitate and restore the environment, especially Barangay Bangkal and West Tower, at least to what it was before the signs of the leak became manifest; and (5) to open a special trust fund to answer for similar and future contingencies in the future. Furthermore, petitioners pray that respondents be prohibited from opening the pipeline and allowing the use thereof until the same has been thoroughly checked and replaced, and be temporarily restrained from operating the pipeline until the final resolution of the case.<br><br>To bolster their petition, petitioners argued that FPIC’s omission or failure to timely replace its pipelines and to observe extraordinary diligence caused the petroleum spill in the City of Makati. Thus, for petitioners, the continued use of the now 47-year old pipeline would not only be a hazard or a threat to the lives, health, and property of those who live or sojourn in all the municipalities in which the pipeline is laid, but would also affect the rights of the generations yet unborn to live in a balanced and “healthful ecology,” guaranteed under Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>On November 19, 2010, the Court issued the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> with a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) requiring respondents FPIC, FGC, and the members of their Boards of Directors to file their respective verified returns. The TEPO enjoined FPIC and FGC to: (a) cease and desist from operating the WOPL until further orders; (b) check the structural integrity of the whole span of the 117-kilometer WOPL while implementing sufficient measures to prevent and avert any untoward incident that may result from any leak of the pipeline; and (c) make a report thereon within 60 days from receipt thereof.<br><br>In compliance with the writ, FPIC directors Edgar Chua, Dennis Javier, Dennis Gamab and Willie Sarmiento submitted a Joint Return<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> praying for the dismissal of the petition and the denial of the privilege of the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>. They alleged that: petitioners had no legal capacity to institute the petition; there is no allegation that the environmental damage affected the inhabitants of two (2) or more cities or provinces; and the continued operation of the pipeline should be allowed in the interest of maintaining adequate petroleum supply to the public.<br><br>Respondents FPIC and its directors and officers, other than the aforementioned four (4) directors, also filed a Verified Return<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> claiming that not all requirements for the issuance of the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> are present and there is no showing that West Tower Corp. was authorized by all those it claimed to represent. They further averred that the petition contains no allegation that respondents FPIC directors and officers acted in such a manner as to allow the piercing of the corporate veil.<br><br>Meanwhile, on January 18, 2011, FGC and the members of its Board of Directors and Officers filed a Joint Compliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> submitting the report required by the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>/TEPO. They contended that they neither own nor operate the pipelines, adding that it is impossible for them to report on the structural integrity of the pipelines, much less to cease and desist from operating them as they have no capability, power, control or responsibility over the pipelines. They, thus, prayed that the directives of the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>/TEPO be considered as sufficiently performed, as to them.<br><br>On January 21, 2011, FPIC, in compliance with the writ, submitted its 4-page “Report on Pipeline Integrity Check and Preventive Maintenance Program.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In gist, FPIC reported the following:<br><blockquote>(I) For the <b>structural integrity</b> of the 117-kilometer pipeline, (a) the DOE engaged the services of UP-NIGS to do <u>borehole testing</u> on 81 pre-identified critical areas of the WOPL in eight cities and municipalities—all the boreholes showed negative presence of petroleum vapors; (b) <u>pressure tests</u> were conducted after the repair of the leak and results showed negative leaks and the DOE’s pipeline expert, Societe General de Surveillance, New Zealand, has developed a pressure test protocol requiring a 24-hour operation of running a scraper pig through the pipeline to eliminate air gap; (c) <u>In-Line Inspection Test</u>, was conducted by NDT through MFL and ultrasonic. The NDT later cleared the WOPL from any damage or corrosion.<br><br>(II) For <b>preventive maintenance measures</b>, (a) <u>Cathodic Protection Systems</u> are installed involving the use of anode materials and the introduction of electric current in the pipeline to enhance prevention of corrosion; (b) <u>Regular Scraper Runs</u> through the pipeline to maintain cleanliness and integrity of the pipelines’ internal surface; (c) <u>Daily Patrols</u> every two hours of the pipeline route to deter unauthorized diggings in the vicinity of the pipeline segments; (d) <u>Regular coordination meetings with DPWH, MMDA and utility companies</u> to monitor projects that might involve digging or excavation in the vicinity of the pipeline segments; (e) Installation of <u>Security Warning Signs along the pipeline route</u> with <u>toll free number</u> which can be called in the event of an accident or emergency; (f) <u>Emergency Response Procedure</u> of the ERT is activated by a call-out procedure; (g) Maintenance of <u>Emergency Equipment and Repair Kit</u> which are always on standby; and, (h) Remotely controlled <u>Isolation Valves</u> are in place to shut the pipeline when necessary.<br></blockquote>On February 9, 2011, petitioners filed, and the Court eventually granted, their Motion to Set the Case for Preliminary Conference and Hearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> pursuant to Sec. 11, Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases.<br><br>On April 15, 2011, the Court conducted an ocular inspection of the WOPL in the vicinity of West Tower to determine the veracity of the claim that there were two (2) additional leaks on FPIC’s pipeline. Results of the ocular inspection belied the claim.<br><br>In the meantime, petitioners also filed civil and criminal complaints against respondents arising from the same incident or leakage from the WOPL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Since after the Court’s issuance of the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> and the TEPO on November 19, 2010, FPIC has ceased operations on both the WOPL and the BOPL. On May 31, 2011, however, the Court, answering a query of the DOE, clarified and confirmed that what is covered by the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> and TEPO is only the WOPL System of FPIC; thus, FPIC can resume operation of its BOPL System.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On July 7, 2011, petitioners filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> assailing the Court’s May 31, 2011 Resolution, praying for the conduct of oral argument on the issue of reopening the BOPL System. This was followed, on September 9, 2011, by a Manifestation (Re: Current Developments) with Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> wherein petitioners invoked the precautionary principle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and asserted that the possibility of a leak in the BOPL System leading to catastrophic environmental damage is enough reason to order the closure of its operation. They likewise alleged that the entities contracted by FPIC to clean and remediate the environment are illegally discharging waste water, which had not undergone proper treatment, into the Parañaque River. Petitioners, thus, prayed that respondents be directed to comply with environmental laws in rehabilitating the surroundings affected by the oil leak and to submit a copy of their work plan and monthly reports on the progress thereof. To these omnibus motions, respondents were directed to file their respective comments.<br><br>On September 28, 2011, respondent FPIC filed an Urgent Motion for Leave (To Undertake “Bangkal Realignment” Project)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in order to reduce stress on the WOPL System. FPIC sought to construct a new realigned segment to replace the old pipe segment under the Magallanes Interchange, which covers the portion that leaked. Petitioners were directed to file their comment on FPIC’s motion.<br><br><center><b>Report and Recommendation of the Court of Appeals</b><br></center><br>To expedite the resolution of the controversy, the Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals (CA). By this Court’s Resolution dated November 22, 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the appellate court was required to conduct hearings and, thereafter, submit a report and recommendation within 30 days after the receipt of the parties’ memoranda.<br><br>On March 21, 2012, the preliminary conference was continued before the CA wherein the parties made admissions and stipulations of facts and defined the issues for resolution. In view of the technical nature of the case, the CA also appointed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> several <i>amici curiae</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>but only four (4) filed their reports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On December 26, 2012, the CA Former 11th Division submitted to the Court its well-crafted and exhaustive 156-page Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated December 21, 2012 (CA Report). Some highlights of the Report:<br><ol><li>Anent petitioners’ June 28, 2011 Omnibus Motion assailing the reopening of the BOPL System, the CA directed respondent FPIC to submit the appropriate certification from the DOE as to the safe commercial operation of the BOPL; otherwise, the operation of the BOPL must also be enjoined. <br><br></li><li>On petitioners’ September 9, 2011 Manifestation (Re: Current Developments) with Omnibus Motion, the CA directed the Inter-Agency Committee on Health to submit its evaluation of the remediation plan prepared by CH2M Hill Philippines, Inc. for FPIC. Further, the appellate court directed FPIC to strictly comply with the stipulations contained in the permits issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for its remediation activities in Barangay Bangkal, Makati City.

Nonetheless, to prevent such event, the CA ordered FPIC to: (i) review, adopt and strictly observe appropriate safety and precautionary measures; (ii) closely monitor the conduct of its maintenance and repair works; and (iii) submit to the DOE regular monthly reports on the structural integrity and safe commercial operation of the pipeline.<br><br></li><li>As to the merits of the case, the CA submitted the following recommendations:<br><br>(a) That the people’s organizations, non-governmental organizations, and public interest groups that indicated their intention to join the petition <u>and submitted proof of juridical personality</u> (namely: the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of the Philippines; <i>Kilusang Makabansang Ekonomiya</i>, Inc.; Women’s Business Council of the Philippines, Inc.; Junior Chambers International Philippines, Inc. – San Juan Chapter; Zonta Club of Makati Ayala Foundations; and the Consolidated Mansions Condominium Corporation) be allowed to be formally impleaded as petitioners.<br><br>(b) That respondent FPIC be ordered to submit a certification from the DOE Secretary that the WOPL is already safe for commercial operation. The certification should take into consideration the adoption by FPIC of the appropriate leak detection system to be used in monitoring the entire pipeline’s mass input versus mass output. The certification must also consider the necessity of replacing the pipes with existing patches and sleeves. In case of failure of respondent FPIC to submit the required certification from the DOE Secretary within sixty (60) days from notice of the Honorable Supreme Court’s approval of this recommendation, the TEPO must be made permanent.<br><br>(c) That petitioners’ prayer for the creation of a special trust fund to answer for similar contingencies in the future be denied for lack of sufficient basis.<br><br>(d) That respondent FGC be not held solidarily liable under the TEPO.<br><br>(e) That without prejudice to the outcome of the civil and criminal cases filed against respondents, the individual directors and officers of FPIC and FGC be not held liable in their individual capacities.<br></li></ol>On January 11, 2013, petitioners filed their Motion for Partial Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the CA’s Report praying that (a) instead of the DOE, the required certification should be issued by the DOST-Metal Industry Research and Development Center; (b) a trust fund be created to answer for future contingencies; and (c) the directors and officers of FPIC and FGC be held accountable.<br><br>On January 25, 2013, FPIC filed its Compliance (Re: Department of Energy Certification on the Black Oil Pipeline)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and submitted the required DOE Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> issued on January 22, 2013 by DOE Secretary Carlos Jericho L. Petilla (Secretary Petilla). On March 14, 2013, petitioners countered with a Manifestation with Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> asserting that FPIC’s certification is not compliant with the CA’s requirement. Hence, petitioners moved that the certification should be disregarded, the 30-day period be deemed to have lapsed, and FPIC be permanently enjoined from operating the BOPL.<br><br>On July 30, 2013, the Court issued a Resolution adopting the recommendation of the CA in its Report and Recommendation that FPIC be ordered to secure a certification from the DOE Secretary before the WOPL may resume its operations. The pertinent portion of said Resolution reads:<br><blockquote>[FPIC] is hereby <b>ORDERED</b> to submit a certification from the DOE Secretary that the pipeline is already safe for commercial operation. The certification should take into consideration the adoption by FPIC of the appropriate leak detection system to be used in monitoring the entire pipeline’s mass input versus mass output.

The Certification, in its entirety, reads:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that based on the Pipeline Integrity Management Systems (PIMS) being implemented by [FPIC] for its [WOPL] facility, the same is safe to resume commercial operations. This certification is being issued after consultation with the [DOST] and on the basis of the following considerations, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>DOE noted the adoption by FPIC of the appropriate leak detection system to be used in monitoring the pipeline’s mass input versus mass output, as well as the other measures of leak detection and prevention adopted by the latter;<br><br></li><li>DOE further noted that FPIC has already undertaken realignment and reinforcement works on the current pipeline to remove majority of the patches. FPIC has likewise presented substantial and adequate documentation showing that the remaining patches and sleeves are safe, and that the use of such is recognized by the industry and complies with existing standards;<br><br></li><li>DOE finally noted the results of various tests and inspections done on the pipeline as indicated in the <i>Manifestation</i> submitted by the DOE on March 31, 2012, in the civil case docketed as <i>CA GR SP No. 00008</i> and entitled <i>West Tower Condominium, et al.

Until now, the unit owners and residents of West Tower could still not return to their condominium units. Thus, there is no gainsaying that the residents of West Tower are real parties-in-interest.<br><br>There can also be no denying that West Tower Corp. represents the common interest of its unit owners and residents, and has the legal standing to file and pursue the instant petition. While a condominium corporation has limited powers under RA 4726, otherwise known as The Condominium Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> it is empowered to pursue actions in behalf of its members.

The records show that petitioners submitted a notarized Secretary’s Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> attesting that the authority of Chuaunsu to represent the condominium corporation in filing the petition is from the resolution of the total membership of West Tower Corp. issued during their November 9, 2010 meeting with the requisite quorum. It is, thus, clear that it was not the Board of West Tower Corp. which granted Chuaunsu the authority but the full membership of the condominium corporation itself.<br><br>As to the residents of Barangay Bangkal, they are similarly situated with the unit owners and residents of West Tower and are real parties-in-interest to the instant case, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, if they so wish to join the petitioners.<br><br><b>Organizations that indicated their intention to join the petition and submitted proof of juridical personality</b><br><br>Anent the propriety of including the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, <i>Kilusang Makabansang Ekonomiya</i>, Inc., Women’s Business Council of the Philippines, Inc., Junior Chambers International Philippines, Inc. – San Juan Chapter, Zonta Club of Makati Ayala Foundations, and the Consolidated Mansions Condominium Corporation, as petitioners in the case, the Court already granted their intervention in the present controversy in the adverted July 30, 2013 Resolution.<br><br>This is so considering that the filing of a petition for the issuance of a writ of <i>kalikasan</i> under Sec. 1, Rule 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases does not require that a petitioner be directly affected by an environmental disaster.

Suffice it to state in the outset that as regards the substantive issues presented, the Court, likewise, concurs with the other recommendations of the CA, with a few modifications.<br><br><center><b>II.<br><br>Propriety of Converting the TEPO to PEPO or its Lifting in light of the DOE Certification of the WOPL’s Commercial Viability</b><br></center><br>To recall, petitioners’ persistent plea is for the conversion of the November 19, 2010 TEPO into a Permanent Environmental Protection Order (PEPO) pursuant to Sec. 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases. For its part, respondent FPIC asserts that regular testing, as well as the measures that are already in place, will sufficiently address any concern of oil leaks from the WOPL.<br><br>With respect to leak detection, FPIC claims that it has in place the following systems: (a) regular cleaning scraper runs, which are done quarterly; (b) pipeline integrity gauge (PIG) tests/Intelligent PIG, now known as in-line inspections (ILI), which is done every five years; (c) pressure monitoring valves; and (d) 24-hour patrols. Additionally, FPIC asserted that it also undertook the following: (a) monitoring of wells and borehole testing/vapor tests; (b) leak tightness test, also known as segment pressure test; (c) pressure-controlled test; (d) inspection and reinforcement of patches; (e) inspection and reinforcement of dents; and (f) Pandacan segment replacement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Furthermore, in August 2010, with the oil leak hogging the headlines, FPIC hired NDT Middle East FZE (NDT) to conduct ILI inspections through magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and ultrasonic tests to, respectively, detect wall thinning of the pipeline and check it for cracks.<br><br>The CA, however, observed that all of these tests and measures are inconclusive and insufficient for purposes of leak detection and pipeline integrity maintenance. Hence, considering the necessary caution and level of assurance required to ensure that the WOPL system is free from leaks and is safe for commercial operation, the CA recommended that FPIC obtain from the DOE a certification that the WOPL is already safe for commercial operation. This certification, according to the CA, was to be issued with due consideration of the adoption by FPIC of the appropriate leak detection systems to monitor sufficiently the entire WOPL and the need to replace portions of the pipes with existing patches and sleeves. Sans the required certification, use of the WOPL shall remain abated.<br><br>The Court found this recommendation of the appellate court proper. Hence, We required FPIC to obtain the adverted DOE Certification in Our July 30, 2013 Resolution. We deemed it proper to require said certification from the DOE considering that the core issue of this case requires the specialized knowledge and special expertise of the DOE and various other administrative agencies. On October 25, 2013, the DOE submitted the certification pursuant to the July 30, 2013 Resolution of the Court. Later, however, on August 5, 2014, DOE Secretary Carlos Jericho I. Petilla submitted a letter recommending certain activities and the timetable for the resumption of the WOPL operations after conducting a dialogue between the concerned government agencies and FPIC.<br><br><b>After a perusal of the recommendations of the DOE and the submissions of the parties, the Court adopts the activities and measures prescribed in the DOE letter dated August 5, 2014 to be complied with by FPIC as conditions for the resumption of the commercial operations of the WOPL. The DOE should, therefore, proceed with the implementation of the tests proposed in the said August 5, 2014 letter. Thereafter, if it is satisfied that the results warrant the immediate reopening of the WOPL, the DOE shall issue an order allowing FPIC to resume the operation of the WOPL. On the other hand, should the probe result in a finding that the pipeline is no longer safe for continued use and that its condition is irremediable, or that it already exceeded its serviceable life, among others, the closure of the WOPL may be ordered.</b><br><br>The DOE is specially equipped to consider FPIC’s proper implementation and compliance with its PIMS and to evaluate the result of the various tests conducted on the pipeline. The DOE is empowered by Sec. 12(b)(1), RA 7638 to formulate and implement policies for the efficient and economical “distribution, transportation, and storage of petroleum, coal, natural gas.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that the DOE possesses technical knowledge and special expertise with respect to practices in the transportation of oil through pipelines.<br><br>Moreover, it is notable that the DOE did not only limit itself to the knowledge and proficiency available within its offices, it has also rallied around the assistance of pertinent bureaus of the other administrative agencies: the ITDI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the DOST, which is mandated to undertake technical services including standards, analytical and calibration services; the MIRDC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> also of the DOST, which is the sole government entity directly supporting the metals and engineering industry;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the EMB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the DENR, the agency mandated to implement, among others, RA 6969 (Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Control Act of 1990) and RA 9275 (Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004); and the BOD of the DPWH, which is mandated to conduct, supervise, and review the technical design aspects of projects of government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The specialized knowledge and expertise of the foregoing agencies must, therefore, be availed of to arrive at a judicious decision on the propriety of allowing the immediate resumption of the WOPL’s operation. In a host of cases, this Court held that when the adjudication of a controversy requires the resolution of issues within the expertise of an administrative body, such issues must be investigated and resolved by the administrative body equipped with the specialized knowledge and the technical expertise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Hence, the courts, although they may have jurisdiction and power to decide cases, can utilize the findings and recommendations of the administrative agency on questions that demand “the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Justice Leonen, in his dissent, is of the view that the petition should be denied and the TEPO immediately lifted in light of the DOE’s issuance of a certification attesting to the safety of the WOPL for continued commercial operations, thereby rendering the instant petition moot and academic, seeking, as it does, the checking of the pipeline’s structural integrity. According to his dissent, the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> issued by the Court has already served its functions and, therefore, is <i>functus officio</i>. Moreover, he argues that directing the DOE and FPIC to repeat their previous procedures is tantamount to doubting the agency’s performance of its statutorily-mandated tasks, over which they have the necessary expertise, and implies that said DOE certification is improper, a breach, allegedly, of the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>He also contends that the majority ordered the repetition of the procedures and tests already conducted on the WOPL because of the fear and uncertainty on its safeness despite the finding of the DOE in favor of its reopening, taking into consideration the occurrence of numerous pipeline incidents worldwide. The dissent argues that the precautionary principle should not be so strictly applied as to unjustifiably deprive the public of the benefits of the activity to be inhibited, and to unduly create other risks.<br><br>The dissent’s contentions that the case is already moot and academic, that the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> has already served its function, and that the delay in the lifting of the TEPO may do more harm than good are anchored on the mistaken premise that the precautionary principle was applied in order to justify the order to the DOE and the FPIC for the conduct of the various tests anew. The following reasons easily debunk these arguments:<br><ol><li>The precautionary principle is not applicable to the instant case;<br><br></li><li>The DOE certification is not an absolute attestation as to the WOPL’s structural integrity and in fact imposes several conditions for FPIC’s compliance;<br><br></li><li>The DOE itself, in consultation with FPIC and the other concerned agencies, proposed the activities to be conducted preparatory to the reopening of the pipeline; and<br><br></li><li>There are no conclusive findings yet on the WOPL’s structural integrity.<br></li></ol>Section 1, Rule 20 of A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC or the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, on the Precautionary Principle, provides that “[w]hen there is lack of full scientific certainty in establishing a causal link between human activity and environmental effect, the court shall apply the precautionary principle in resolving the case before it.”<br><br>According to the dissent, the directive for the repetition of the tests is based on speculations, justified by the application of said principle. This, however, is not the case. Nowhere did We apply the precautionary principle in deciding the issue on the WOPL’s structural integrity.<br><br>The precautionary principle only applies when the link between the cause, that is the human activity sought to be inhibited, and the effect, that is the damage to the environment, cannot be established with full scientific certainty. Here, however, such absence of a link is not an issue. Detecting the existence of a leak or the presence of defects in the WOPL, which is the issue in the case at bar, is different from determining whether the spillage of hazardous materials into the surroundings will cause environmental damage or will harm human health or that of other organisms. As a matter of fact, the petroleum leak and the harm that it caused to the environment and to the residents of the affected areas is not even questioned by FPIC.<br><br>It must be stressed that <b>what is in issue in the instant petition is the WOPL’s compliance with pipeline structure standards so as to make it fit for its purpose, a question of fact that is to be determined on the basis of the evidence presented by the parties on the WOPL’s actual state.</b> Hence, Our consideration of the numerous findings and recommendations of the CA, the DOE, and the <i>amici curiae</i> on the WOPL’s present structure, and not the cited pipeline incidents as the dissent propounds.<br><br>Consider also the fact that it is the DOE itself that imposed several conditions upon FPIC for the resumption of the operations of the WOPL. This, coupled with the submission by the DOE of its proposed activities and timetable, is a clear and unequivocal message coming from the DOE that the WOPL’s soundness for resumption of and continued commercial operations is not yet fully determined. <b>And it is only after an extensive determination by the DOE of the pipeline’s actual physical state through its proposed activities, and not merely through a short-form integrity audit,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><b> that the factual issue on the WOPL’s viability can be settled.</b> The issue, therefore, on the pipeline’s structural integrity has not yet been rendered moot and remains to be subject to this Court’s resolution. Consequently, We cannot say that the DOE’s issuance of the certification adverted to equates to the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> being <i>functus officio</i> at this point.<br><br>The dissent is correct in emphasizing that We defer to the findings of fact of administrative agencies considering their specialized knowledge in their field. And We, as a matter of fact, acceded to the DOE’s conclusions on the necessity of the conduct of the various activities and tests enumerated in Sec. Petilla’s letter to this Court dated August 5, 2014. Hence, Our directive for the DOE to immediately commence the activities enumerated in said Letter, to determine the pipeline’s reliability, and to order its reopening should the DOE find that such is proper.<br><br>The dissent also loses sight of the fact that the petition not only seeks the checking of the WOPL’s structural integrity, but also prays for the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the leak, the creation of a special trust fund, the imposition of liability upon the directors of FPIC, among others. These issues, undoubtedly, are matters that are not addressed by the DOE certification alone. Furthermore, these are issues that no longer relate to the WOPL’s structure but to its maintenance and operations, as well as to the residues of the incident. It will, thus, be improper for Us to simply dismiss the petition on the basis solely of the alleged resolution of only one of several issues, which purportedly renders the issue on the WOPL’s soundness moot, without disposing of the other issues presented.<br><br>Lastly, any delay in the reopening of the WOPL, if said delay is for the purpose of making sure that the pipeline is commercially viable, is better than hastily allowing its reopening without an extensive check on its structural integrity when experience shows that there were and may still be flaws in the pipeline. Even the DOE, the agency tasked to oversee the supply and distribution of petroleum in the country, is well aware of this and even recommended the checking of the patched portions of the pipeline, among others. In this regard, the Court deems it best to take the necessary safeguards, which are not similar to applying the precautionary principle as previously explained, in order to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future.<br><br><center><b>III.<br><br>Propriety of the Creation of a Special Trust Fund</b><br></center><br>Anent petitioners’ prayer for the creation of a special trust fund, We note that under Sec. 1, Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, a trust fund is limited solely for the purpose of <b><u>rehabilitating or restoring</u></b> the environment. Said proviso pertinently provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. <i>Reliefs in a citizen suit</i>. – If warranted, the court may grant to the plaintiff proper reliefs which shall include the protection, preservation or rehabilitation of the environment and the payment of attorney’s fees, costs of suit and other litigation expenses. <u>It <b>may</b> also require the violator to submit a program of <b>rehabilitation or restoration of the environment</b>, the costs of which shall be borne by the violator, or to <b>contribute to a special trust fund for that purpose</b> subject to the control of the court.</u> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, Sec. 15(e), Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases expressly prohibits the grant of damages to petitioners in a petition for the issuance of a writ of <i>kalikasan</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>Section 15. <i>Judgment</i>. - Within sixty (60) days from the time the petition is submitted for decision, the court shall render judgment granting or denying the privilege of the writ of <i>kalikasan</i>.<br><br>The reliefs that may be granted under the writ are the following:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) Such other reliefs which relate to the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology or to the protection, preservation, rehabilitation or restoration of the environment, <b>except the award of damages to individual petitioners</b>.<br></blockquote>A reading of the petition and the motion for partial reconsideration readily reveals that the prayer is for the creation of a trust fund for <b>similar future contingencies</b>.This is clearly outside the limited purpose of a special trust fund under the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, which is to rehabilitate or restore the environment that has presumably already suffered. Hence,the Court affirms with concurrence the observation of the appellate court that the prayer is but a claim for damages, which is prohibited by the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases. As such, the Court is of the considered view that the creation of a special trust fund is misplaced.<br><br>The present ruling on petitioners’ prayer for the creation of a special trust fund in the instant recourse, however, is without prejudice to the judgment/s that may be rendered in the civil and/or criminal cases filed by petitioners arising from the same incident if the payment of damages is found warranted.<br><br><center><b>IV.<br><br>Liability of FPIC, FGC and their respective Directors and Officers</b><br></center><br>On the last issue of the liability of FPIC, FGC and their respective directors and officers, the CA found FGC not liable under the TEPO and, without prejudice to the outcome of the civil case (Civil Case No. 11-256, RTC, Branch 58 in Makati City) and criminal complaint (Complaint-Affidavit for Reckless Imprudence, Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Makati City) filed against them, the individual directors and officers of FPIC and FGC are not liable in their individual capacities.<br><br>The Court will refrain from ruling on the finding of the CA that the individual directors and officers of FPIC and FGC are not liable due to the explicit rule in the Rules of Procedure for Environmental cases that in a petition for a writ of <i>kalikasan</i>,the Court cannot grant the award of damages to individual petitioners under Rule 7, Sec. 15(e) of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases. As duly noted by the CA, the civil case and criminal complaint filed by petitioners against respondents are the proper proceedings to ventilate and determine the individual liability of respondents, if any, on their exercise of corporate powers and the management of FPIC relative to the dire environmental impact of the dumping of petroleum products stemming from the leak in the WOPL in Barangay Bangkal, Makati City.<br><br>Hence, the Court will not rule on the alleged liability on the part of the FPIC and FGC officials which can, however, be properly resolved in the civil and criminal cases now pending against them.<br><br><center><b>Other Matters</b><br></center><br>The CA’s resolution on petitioners’ September 9, 2011 Manifestation (Re: Current Developments) with Omnibus Motion on the remediation plan in Barangay Bangkal by directing the Inter-Agency Committee on Environmental Health to submit its evaluation of the said plan prepared by CH2M Philippines, Inc., for FPIC to strictly comply with the stipulations embodied in the permits issued by the DENR, and to get a certification from the DENR of its compliance thereto is well taken. DENR is the government agency tasked to implement the state policy of “maintaining a sound ecological balance and protecting and enhancing the quality of the environment”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and to “promulgate rules and regulations for the control of water, air, and land pollution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> It is indubitable that the DENR has jurisdiction in overseeing and supervising the environmental remediation of Barangay Bangkal, which is adversely affected by the leak in the WOPL in 2010.<br><br>With regard to petitioners’ March 29, 2012 Supplemental Manifestation about a recent possible leak in the pipeline, the CA appropriately found no additional leak. However, due to the devastating effect on the environs in Barangay Bangkal due to the 2010 leak, the Court finds it fitting that the pipeline be closely and regularly monitored to obviate another catastrophic event which will prejudice the health of the affected people, and to preserve and protect the environment not only for the present but also for the future generations to come.<br><br>Petitioner’s January 10, 2013 Motion for Partial Recommendation of the CA’s Report need not be discussed and given consideration. As the CA’s Report contains but the appellate court’s <i>recommendation</i> on how the issues should be resolved, and not the adjudication by this Court, there is nothing for the appellate court to reconsider.<br><br>As to petitioner’s October 2, 2013 Motion for Reconsideration with Motion for Clarification, the matters contained therein have been considered in the foregoing discussion of the primary issues of this case. With all these, We need not belabor the other arguments raised by the parties.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the Motion for Partial Reconsideration is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

After FPIC has undertaken the activities prescribed in the preceding paragraph 1, the DOE shall determine if the activities and the results of the test run warrant the re-opening of the WOPL. In the event that the DOE is satisfied that the WOPL is safe for continued commercial operations, it shall issue an order allowing FPIC to resume the operations of the pipeline.<br><br>III. Once the WOPL is re-opened, the DOE shall see to it that FPIC strictly complies with the following directives:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Continue implementation of its Pipeline Integrity Management System (PIMS), as reviewed by the DOE, which shall include, but shall not be limited to:<br><ol><br><li>the conduct of daily patrols on the entire stretch of the WOPL, every two hours;<br><br></li><li>continued close monitoring of all the boreholes and monitoring wells of the WOPL pipeline;<br><br></li><li>regular periodic testing and maintenance based on its PIMS; and<br><br></li><li>the auditing of the pipeline’s mass input versus mass output;<br></li></ol><br></li><li>submit to the DOE, within ten (10) days of each succeeding month, monthly reports on its compliance with the above directives and any other conditions that the DOE may impose, the results of the monitoring, tests, and audit, as well as any and all activities undertaken on the WOPL or in connection with its operation.

This is the reason for the increasing vesture of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers in what is now not unreasonably called the fourth department of the government. . . .

Even expert findings may be wrong or contradictory. The courts have little competence on technical matters to determine which expert finding should be given weight. In environmental cases, courts defer to administrative agencies’ technical knowledge.

Unlike in quasi-judicial proceedings, determination of facts is not solely the province of the administrative agencies.

Courts and administrative agencies may get access to the facts at the same time.<br><br>For these reasons, the courts’ leeway to examine the substantiality of evidence in environmental cases is greater.

Pressure has been stable and ocular inspection of monitoring wells did not indicate any leaks.<br><br>The FPIC has also provided a copy of their monitoring results to UP NIGS. Their results showed no leak along the pipeline. However, monitoring data has also shown a 10% discrepancy in the Chevron line. As the relationship of pressure and temperature are directly proportional, the absence of a Temperature Monitoring Recorder, an instrument to provide more accurate data and reliable monitoring chart due to the effect of temperature on pressure was duly noted.<br><br>After several days of data review and analysis and interviews with FPIC technical personnel, UPNIGS [sic] pipeline consultant Pedro Carascon pointed out that some temperature gauges of FPIC were not actually synchronized and connected to the pipeline, leading to the erratic temperature readings. However, further review of the data showed that the pressure did not change significantly to suggest the presence [of] a leak in the pipeline. Also, the time allotted for the pipeline pressure test, was exceeded by at least two days, and the pressure in the pipeline remained constant, suggesting further that there were no more leaks in the pipeline.<br><br><b>V. Conclusion</b><br><br>In as much as there wasno [sic] significant changes of pressure drops observed throughout the holding time of pressure testing, it can therefore be concluded that the pressure testing of FPIC White Oil Pipeline is sensible and that it is free of leak at the time of pressure testing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, Societe Generale de Surveillance noted in its March 30, 2012 Report that the tests were conducted under the approved and standard procedures, methods, and tolerances.

Environmental laws protect nature and the environment from degradation while taking into account people’s needs and general welfare.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This policy espouses the need for a balance between resource exploitation and environmental protection to promote the general welfare of the people. Environmental protection is a necessary means to increase the chances of the human species to subsist.<br><br>The ponencia recognized the need to achieve a balance between human necessities and environmental protection, thus:<br><blockquote>The Court is fully cognizant of the WOPL’s value in commerce and the adverse effects of a prolonged closure thereof. Nevertheless, there is a need to balance the necessity of the immediate reopening of the WOPL with the more important need to ensure that it is sound for continued operation, since the substances it carries pose a significant hazard to the surrounding population and to the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>This need for “balance”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and the incidence of oil pipeline tragedies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> prompted the majority to further delay the lifting of the temporary environmental protection order despite findings that support the pipeline’s integrity/safety.

Speculations may be sufficient causes for the grant of either a temporary environmental protection order or a permanent environmental protection order, regardless of the extent of losses and risks resulting from it.<br><br>This interpretation may be inconsistent with the purpose of avoiding threat or damage to the environment and to the people’s general welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It was argued that:<br><blockquote>If [the precautionary principle] is taken for all that it is worth, it leads in no direction at all. The reason is that risks of one kind or another are on all sides of regulatory choices, and it is therefore impossible, in most real-world cases, to avoid running afoul of the principle. Frequently, risk regulation creates a (speculative) risk from substitute risks or from foregone risk-reduction opportunities. And because of the (speculative) mortality and morbidity effects of costly regulation, any regulation—if it is costly—threatens to run afoul of the Precautionary Principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>Inhibiting an activity, especially one recognized for its role in commerce, has drawbacks. Although it may ensure that no risk of harm to the environment will directly result from the activity, it can also unjustifiably deprive the public of its benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Inhibiting pipeline activities, for example, may deprive the public of the benefits of an oil transport system that can deliver more products at a given time and to a wider area, compared to other modes of distributing oil such as through roads or rails. This will slow down oil distribution along the production and distribution chains. Therefore, it will have a significant negative impact on commerce.<br><br>Inhibiting an activity may also unduly create other risks that are not immediately apparent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Inhibition of oil pipeline activities may prevent pipeline leaks from happening again. However, it will also force suppliers to resort to other modes of oil distribution to maintain a supply to address national demands. These other modes may include the use of trucks and trains, which has negative environmental impact as well.<br><br>Trucks have relatively limited capacity to distribute oil compared to pipelines. Thus, to keep up with national demands, trucks must be dispatched in greater number and with more frequency. As a result, our highways may have to be constantly lined with trucks. This will cause road congestion and—more certainly than the existence of leaks on the White Oil Pipeline—worsened air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, about seven million deaths in 2012 were linked to air pollution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Air pollution is related to “cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, . . . [and] respiratory diseases . . . [such as] acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> It is also reported to increase the risk of cancer among humans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the delay in lifting the temporary environmental protection order despite evidence that prove that the pipeline is free from leaks, as well as the order to repeat respondent First Philippine Industrial Corporation’s procedures, will unnecessarily force not only respondent but also the concerned agencies to spend much needed resources that may be used for other public purposes. In effect, other equally important tasks or projects are deprived of the agencies’ resources and attention. This may likewise cause unintended drawbacks that we may not yet realize.<br><br>In the end, the inhibition of pipeline activities may in itself be a plausible and equally harmful threat to the general welfare compared to the threat posed by the pipeline. Permitting the increase of air pollution and unnecessary use of public resources may be inconsistent with the precautionary principle that the majority tried to apply in resolving the case.<br><br>Thus, dealing with environmental issues is not as simple as applying the precautionary principle in its strict sense when faced with uncertainty. We must recognize the interconnectedness of variables and issues so that we can address them more effectively and truly in accordance with our policy of taking care of the people’s general welfare through environmental protection.<br><br>The Department of Energy has already issued its Certification stating its conclusion that the White Oil Pipeline is already safe for commercial operations. Its conclusion is consistent with expert findings. When conclusions support the project’s operation, and when there is no showing that an error was committed in arriving at such conclusions, the fear of disaster without basis is not a sufficient reason to deny the lifting of an issued temporary environmental protection order.
