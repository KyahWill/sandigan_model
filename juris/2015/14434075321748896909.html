As a general rule, constitutional provisions are given prospective application, not retroactive, unless retroactivity is expressly provided or necessarily implied (People vs. Isagani, et al., 63 SCRA 4). Hence, due to the prospective application of the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions, it is the provisions of the 1935 Constitution that should apply to petitioner's application for registration. Undoubtedly, under the 1935 Philippine Constitution, private corporations are allowed in acquiring alienable and disposable land of the public domain. (Republic vs. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.[,] GR. No. 154953, June 26, 2008).<br><br>Interestingly, the original reckoning point for the required length of possession under the Public Land Act (C.A. 141) is possession since July 26, 1894. The period of possession was shortened to thirty (30) years by Republic Act No. 1942, which was enacted on June 22, 1957. Then, on January 25, 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1073 was enacted pegging the reckoning point of possession to June 12, 1945. Hence, until 1972, prior to the effectivity of the 1973 Philippine Constitution, the required possession of alienable public land that would qualify to judicial confirmation under C.A. 141 is at least thirty (30) years, or at least from the year 1942. If reckoned from 1972, the latest date when private corporations are allowed to acquire alienable public lands. Therefore, petitioner already acquired a vested right over the subject property in 1972.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><br>La Tondeña submits that "its possession was open, continuous, uninterrupted for more than thirty (30) years until 1972 prior to the effectivity of the 1973 and 1987 Philippine Constitution[,] [t]hus, the land became a private property by acquisitive prescription in accordance with the doctrine that open, exclusive and undisputed possession of alienable land for the period prescribed by law creates the legal fiction whereby the land, upon completion of the requisite period, <i>ipso jure</i> and without the need of judicial order or other sanction ceases to be public land and becomes private property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>La Tondeña contends that it presented sufficient evidence for approval of its application for registration.

Court of Appeals and Naguit,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the majority in <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan</i> emphatically declared:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>Following the OSGs approach, all lands certified as alienable and disposable after 12 June 1945 cannot be registered either under Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree or Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act as amended</b>. <u>The absurdity of such an implication was discussed in <i>Naguit</i></u>.<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner suggests an interpretation that the alienable and disposable character of the land should have already been established since June 12, 1945, or earlier. <b>This is not borne out by the plain meaning of Section 14(1). Since June 12, 1945, as used in the provision, qualifies its antecedent phrase under a bonafide claim of ownership. Generally speaking, qualifying words restrict or modify only the words or phrases to which they are immediately associated, and not those distantly or remotely located. <i>Ad proximum antecedents fiat relation nisi impediatur sentencia</i>.</b><br><br>Besides, we are mindful of the absurdity that would result if we adopt petitioners position. Absent a legislative amendment, the rule would be, adopting the OSGs view, that all lands of the public domain which were not declared alienable or disposable before June 12, 1945 would not be susceptible to original registration, no matter the length of unchallenged possession by the occupant.&nbsp; Such interpretation renders paragraph (1) of Section 14 virtually inoperative and even precludes the government from giving it effect even as it decides to reclassify public agricultural lands as alienable and disposable. The unreasonableness of the situation would even be aggravated considering that before June 12, 1945, the Philippines was not yet even considered an independent state.<br></blockquote><br>Accordingly, the Court in <i>Naguit</i> explained:<br><br><blockquote><b>[T]he more reasonable interpretation of Section 14(1) is that it merely requires the property sought to be registered as already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed</b>. If the State, at the time the application is made, has not yet deemed it proper to release the property for alienation or disposition, the presumption is that the government is still reserving the right to utilize the property; hence, the need to preserve its ownership in the State irrespective of the length of adverse possession even if in good faith. However, if the property has already been classified as alienable and disposable, as it is in this case, then there is already an intention on the part of the State to abdicate its exclusive prerogative over the property.</blockquote><br><b>The Court declares that the correct interpretation of Section 14(1) is that which was adopted in Naguit.&nbsp; The contrary pronouncement in <i>Herbieto</i>, as pointed out in Naguit, absurdly limits the application of the provision to the point of virtual inutility since it would only cover lands actually declared alienable and disposable prior to 12 June 1945</b>, even if the current possessor is able to establish open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership long before that date.<br><br>Moreover, the <i>Naguit</i> interpretation allows more possessors under a <i>bona fide </i>claim of ownership to avail of judicial confirmation of their imperfect titles than what would be feasible under <i>Herbieto</i>.&nbsp; This balancing fact is significant, especially considering our forthcoming discussion on the scope and reach of Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree. [All emphases and underscoring supplied.]</blockquote><br>As I maintain the same view and legal reasoning, I reiterate below the pertinent portions of my <i>Malabanan Opinion</i> that I invoke as basis, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of my position in the present case.<br><br><b><i><ol type="A"><li>Classification is a constitutionally and <br>statutorily required step without which<br> the land forms part of the mass of the <br>public domain that are completely<br> inalienable<br></li></ol></i></b>The Constitution, under Section 2, Article XII,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> classifies public lands into agricultural, mineral, and timber.&nbsp; Of these public lands, only agricultural lands can be alienated. These classifications are important and should be given full legal recognition and effect for without the requisite classification, there is no basis to determine which lands of the public domain are alienable and which are not.<br><br>In other words, <b><u>classification is a constitutionally required step</u></b>. As I explained in my <i>Malabanan Opinion: "... without classification into disposable agricultural land, the land forms part of the mass of the public domain that, not being agricultural, must be mineral or timber land that are completely inalienable and as such cannot be possessed with legal effocts.</i> "<br><br>This conclusion proceeds from the settled constitutional and jural precept, otherwise known as the regalian doctrine, that all lands of the public domain as well as all natural resources enumerated therein, whether on private or public land, belong to the State. "<i>To allow effoctive possession is to do violence to the regalian doctrine; the ownership and control that the doctrine denotes will be less than full if the possession that should be with the State as owner, but is elsewhere without any authority, can anyway be recognized."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Classification, too, is a fundamental and indispensable requirement from the perspective of statutory law.<br><br>In my<i> Malabanan Opinion,</i> I pointed out that the PLA, under which grants of public lands can be claimed under its Section 48 (b), operates only on public lands already classified as alienable and disposable. A necessary implication of this legal reality is the other legal reality that prior to such classification, possession under Section 48 (b) cannot be claimed.<br><br>The reason for this position is simple: "<i>In the absence of such classification, the land remains unclassified public land that fully belongs to the State. This is fully supported by Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of CA 141. If the land is either mineral or timber and can never be the subject of administration and disposition, it defies legal logic to allow the possession of these unclassified lands to produce legal effect. Thus, the classification of public land as alienable and disposable is inextricably linked to effective possession that can ripen into a claim under Section 48(b) of the PLA.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In short, "[t]here can simply be no imperfect title to be confirmed over lands not yet classified as disposable or alienable."<br><br><b><i><ol start="2" type="A"><li>Under Article 530 of the Civil Code, <br>only things and rights susceptible <br>of being appropriated may be the <br>object of possession.</li></ol></i></b><br>Consistent with the constitutional and statutory reasons explained above, I also pointed out in my <i>Malabanan Opinion </i>that possession is essentially a civil law term that can best be understood in terms of the Civil Code given the absence of any specific definition in the PLA except in terms of time of possession.<br><br>In this respect, "<i>Article 530 of the Civil Code provides that '[o]nly things and rights which are susceptible of being appropriated may be the object of possession.

The provisions of Section 48(b) and Section 48(c), Chapter VIII of the Public Land Act are hereby amended in the sense that <i>these provisions shall apply only to alienable and disposable lands of the public domain which have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation by the applicant himself or thru his predecessor-in-interest, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945.</i></blockquote><br>Note well that while "<i>PD 1073 did not expressly state what Section 48(b) should provide under the amendment PD 1073 introduced in terms of the exact wording of the amended Section 48(b)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> its intent to reckon the alienability of the public land from June 12, 1945, is very clear. The provision "applies <i><b><u>only</u></b></i> to alienable and disposable lands of the public domain that is described in terms of the character of the possession required since June 12, 1945," <i>i.e.</i>, open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition.<br><br>In other words, I submit that the clear legislative intent is demonstrated by the <i>direct, continuous and seamless linking of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain to June 12, 1945, under the wording of the Decree </i>- an intent which the Court must respect and uphold.<br><br>This position is obviously contrary to the position taken by the majority in<i> Heirs of Mario Malabanan </i>as they declared that (and I quote again) "[g]enerally speaking, qualifying words restrict or modify only the words or phrases to which they are immediately associated, and not those distantly or remotely located. <i>Ad proximum antecedents fiat relation nisi impediatur sentencia."</i><br><br>In simpler terms, the majority in <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan</i> theorized that the June 12, 1945 cutoff date is far removed from. the words "alienable and disposable" by the more proximate words "in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation" such that the latter is the only condition qualified by the cutoff date. Thus, they hold the position that it is only the time of possession, not the declaration of alienability, which must begin as of June 12, 1945, or earlier.<br><br>What the majority in<i> Heirs of Mario Malabanan </i>apparently failed to note and mention is that the rule - that the antecedent bears relation to what follows next - applies only as long as it does not destroy the meaning of the sentence.<br><br>For the reasons I explained above, I submit that the interpretation espoused in <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan</i> that all the law requires is possession from June 12, 1945, regardless of the declaration-of-alienability date as long as the land has been classified as alienable at the time of application for registration - in fact destroys the meaning of PD 1073 as it amends Section 48 (b) of the PLA.<br><br>PD 1073 reads in a continuous, uninterrupted flow from the classification of the land - as<i> alienable and disposable</i> - to the character of the possession of this land (classified as alienable and disposable) <i>as open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation by the applicant himself or thru his predecessor-in-interest -that begins as of June 12, 1945.</i><br><br>In other words, the <i>June 12, 1945 cutoff date modifies not only the more immediate words that it follows, i.e., the open, continuous, etc. character of possession that I described above, but also the classification of the land which must be alienable and disposable.</i><br><br><b><i><ol start="4" type="A"><li>The use of June I2, I945 as cutoff date for<br> the declaration of alienability will not render<br> the grant of alienable lands out of reach as it <br>may still be obtained by other modes under<br> the PLA, i.e., free patents under Republic <br>Act No.6940, and homestead settlement<br> and sales under Section II of the PLA.</li></ol></i></b><br>I reiterate, as well, that "<i>the use of June 12, 1945, as cutoff date for the declaration of alienability will not render the grant of alienable public lands out of reach."</i><br><br>Contrary to what the majority ominously portrayed in <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan</i>, the acquisition of ownership and title may, in fact, still be obtained by other modes under the PLA.<br><br>Among other laws, RA No. 6940<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> allows the issuance of free patents for lands not in excess of twelve (12) hectares to any natural-born citizen of the Philippines who is not the owner of more than 12 hectares and who, for at least thirty (30) years prior to effectivity of the amendatory act, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, a tract or tracts of agricultural public lands subject to disposition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> "RA No. 6940 was approved on March 28, 1990; thus, counting 30 years backwards, possession since April 1960 or thereabouts may qualifY a possessor to apply for a free patent."

As I pointedly declared in my Malabanan Opinion, "<i>[e]ven this Court cannot read into the law an intent that is not there even [if the] purpose is to avoid an absurd situation.
