				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 22, 2006 and the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 22, 2007, respectively, of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>), in the civil case entitled <i>NFF Industrial Corporation v.

(<i>respondent company</i>) is among its customers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Respondent Gerardo Trinidad is the general manager of respondent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>According to petitioner, on July 20, 1999, respondent company ordered one thousand (1,000) pieces of bulk bags from petitioner, at Three Hundred Eighty Pesos (P380.00) per piece, or a total purchase price of Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Pesos (P380,000.00), payable within thirty (30) days from delivery, covered by Purchase Order No. 97-002 dated July 29, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In the said Purchase Order, an instruction was made that the bulk bags were for immediate delivery to “<i>G &amp;

and finally, a third demand letter dated October 2, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As the demands remained unheeded, petitioner filed a complaint for sum of money against respondents on December 19, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As no settlement was reached during the pre-trial stage, trial proceeded. On January 25, 2005, the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) rendered its decision in favor of petitioner. The <i>fallo</i> of the Decision provides:<br><blockquote>PRESCINDING FROM THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff NFF INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION and against the defendant Corporation G &amp; L Associated Brokerage, Inc., and the latter is hereby ordered to pay the plaintiff the following:<br><ol><li>The sum of Php760,000.00 – representing overdue accounts plus interest from the first demand on October 27, 1999 until fully paid.<br><br></li><li>The sum of Php152,000.00 as attorney’s fees.<br><br></li><li>Cost of suit.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, respondents appealed before the CA.

The same was, however, denied in the assailed Order dated May 22, 2007.<br><br>Hence, this petition stating the following grounds:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE RESPONDENT COMPANY ACCEPTED DELIVERY OF THE BULK BAGS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>RESPONDENTS’ CONDUCT PREPONDERANTLY SHOWS THAT DELIVERY OF THE BULK BAGS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>FINDINGS OF FACT OF THE TRIAL COURT ARE ENTITLED TO GREAT WEIGHT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV.<br></div><br>TO SUSTAIN THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS WILL CAUSE UNJUST ENRICHMENT ON THE PART OF RESPONDENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Simply, the issue before us is whether or not there was valid delivery on the part of petitioner in accordance with law, which would give rise to an obligation to pay on the part of respondent for the value of the bulk bags.<br><br>The question is basically factual since it involves an evaluation of the conflicting evidence presented by the opposing parties, including the existence and relevance of specific surrounding circumstances, to determine the truth or falsity of alleged facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>While it is well settled that factual issues are not within the province of this Court, as it is not a trier of facts and is not required to examine or contrast the oral and documentary evidence <i>de novo</i>, nevertheless, the Court has the authority to review and, in proper cases, reverse the factual findings of lower courts in these instances: (a) when the findings of fact of the trial court are in conflict with those of the appellate court; (b) when the judgment of the appellate court is based on misapprehension of facts; and (c) when the appellate court manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Considering that in the instant case, the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the RTC, a minute scrutiny by this Court is in order, and resort to duly proven evidence becomes necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that it has delivered the bulk bags to respondent company, which effectively placed the latter in control and possession thereof, as in fact, respondent company had made use of the said bulk bags in the ordinary course of its business activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Conversely, respondents contend that the evidence on record miserably failed to establish that the alleged deliveries were received by the authorized representative of the respondents. Thus, there was no delivery at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>We find respondents' contention devoid of persuasive force.<br><br>The resolution of the issue at bar necessitates a scrutiny of the concept of “delivery” in the context of the Law on Sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Under the Civil Code, the vendor is bound to transfer the ownership of and deliver, as well as warrant the thing which is the object of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The ownership of thing sold is considered acquired by the vendee once it is delivered to him in the following wise:<br><blockquote>Art. 1496. The ownership of the thing sold is acquired by the vendee from the moment it is delivered to him in any of the ways specified in Articles 1497 to 1501, or in any other manner signifying an agreement that the possession is transferred from the vendor to the vendee.<br><br>Art. 1497. The thing sold shall be understood as delivered, when it is placed in the control and possession of the vendee.<br></blockquote>Thus, ownership does not pass by mere stipulation but only by delivery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Manresa explains, “the delivery of the thing x x x signifies that title has passed from the seller to the buyer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Moreover, according to Tolentino, the purpose of delivery is not only for the enjoyment of the thing but also a mode of acquiring dominion and determines the transmission of ownership, the birth of the real right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The delivery under any of the forms provided by Articles 1497 to 1505 of the Civil Code signifies that the transmission of ownership from vendor to vendee has taken place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Here, emphasis is placed on Article 1497 of the Civil Code, which contemplates what is known as real or actual delivery, when the thing sold is placed in the control and possession of the vendee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In <i>Equatorial Realty Development, Inc. v. Mayfair Theater, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the concept of “delivery” was elucidated, to wit:<br><blockquote>Delivery has been described as a composite act, a thing in which both parties must join and the minds of both parties concur. It is an act by which one party parts with the title to and the possession of the property, and the other acquires the right to and the possession of the same. In its natural sense, delivery means something in addition to the delivery of property or title; it means transfer of possession. In the Law on Sales, delivery may be either actual or constructive, but both forms of delivery contemplate <b><i>"the absolute giving up of the control and custody of the property on the part of the vendor, and the assumption of the same by the vendee."</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Applying the foregoing criteria to the case at bar, We find that there were various occasions of delivery by petitioner to respondents, and the same was duly acknowledged by respondent Trinidad.

In addition, by allowing petitioner’s employee to pass through the guard-on-duty, who allowed the entry of delivery into the premises of Hi-Cement, which is the designated delivery site, respondents had effectively abandoned whatever infirmities may have attended the delivery of the bulk bags. As a matter of fact, if respondents were wary about the manner of delivery, such issue should have been brought up immediately after the first delivery was made. Instead, Mr. Trinidad acknowledged receipt of the first batch of the bulk bags and even followed up the remaining balance of the orders for delivery.<br><br>Thus, the RTC correctly held that:<br><blockquote>The evidence adduced by the parties clearly proved that Gerardo Trinidad himself, initially ordered 1,000 pieces of NFF bulk bags at Php380.00 per piece from the plaintiff on or about July 29, 1999. After testing and checking sample bags, Mr. Trinidad had approved it and even instructed the Sales Manager of NFF in the person of Richard Bergamo to place and print the bags with G &amp; L logo as well as control number on all our sides of bags and thereafter agreed to the quantity of Two Thousand [2,000] pieces as what had been agreed upon during the meeting with the Union Cement Marketing personnel at the Cement manufacturing [TSN March 10, 2003, pp. 25]. <b><i>Initial delivery of 400 pieces of bulk bags were made on July 31, 1999 and then followed by another delivery of additional bulk bags on August 5, 1999 while the remaining 600 pieces of bags were delivered on August 6, 1999 to complete the 2,000 pieces ordered by the defendant. All these deliveries were made to defendant’s designated address at “G &amp; L Associated Brokerage, Inc., C/O HI CEMENT CORPORATION, NORZAGARAY BULACAN.” These deliveries were made in compliance with Hi-Cement’s standard/regular operating procedure. It passed thru guard on duty, who allowed the entry of delivery into the premises of Hi-Cement, which is the designated delivery site and then a representative of the defendant thereat received the delivered items in behalf of the defendant.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents’ mere allegations of non-delivery and misdelivery deserve scant consideration. On the matter of non-delivery, We find it bizarre that respondents failed in demanding the delivery of the bulk bags despite its urgent need to procure the same, as admitted by respondents’ witnesses. Customarily, failure to deliver the goods could have prompted respondents to follow up on the orders and ensure that the same is delivered at the earliest opportunity. In fact, if they had not actually received any quantity of bulk bags, despite their alleged repeated demands, they could have demanded in writing or resorted to legal action for the enforcement thereof. But there was dearth of evidence showing the same. On the matter of misdelivery, when the instruction to deliver the partial five hundred (500) pieces of bulk bags was made by Mr. Trinidad, the latter did not even mention the name Ramil Ambrosio.

The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him, and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.<br></blockquote>As early as <i>Sy v. Mina</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> it has been pronounced that the vendee’s acceptance of the equipment and supplies and accessories, and the use it made of them is an implied conformity to the terms of the invoices and he is bound thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court in that case also held that the buyer’s failure to interpose any objection to the invoices issued to it, to evidence delivery of the materials ordered as per their agreement, should be deemed as an implied acceptance by the buyer of the said conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the use by respondent of the bulk bags is an act of dominion, which is inconsistent with the ownership of petitioner. As correctly observed by the RTC, the use of the bulk bags by respondents can be readily verified from the records of the case, to wit:<br><blockquote>The plaintiff’s witness affirmatively testified that the personnel of G &amp; L Associated Brokerage used the bulk bags by loading cement inside the bulk bags and it was lifted by a forklift and lifted the same towards the truck belonging to G &amp; L Associated Brokerage [TSN May 12, 2003 pp. 13]. Case records even disclosed that the Exhibits L and its submarkings which was identified by the plaintiff’s witness Richard Agustin Bergamo who took the pictures himself evidently showing that the defendant being the haulers of the Union Cement, withdrew tonner bags from Union Cement Bulacan Plan and used these tonner bags supplied by the plaintiff in hauling Union Cement intended for CP Casecnan. The self-serving claim of Gerardo Trinidad that he was constrained to make an order to some other suppliers due to alleged non-delivery of the tonner bags likewise, deserved scant consideration. Defendant Gerardo Trinidad admitted having used more than four thousand bags for the Casecnan Project but when asked to produce copies of sales invoices and proof of purchase with respect to these alleged suppliers in connection with Casecnan Project, said defendant miserably failed to produce even a single proof and instead identified some delivery receipts covering the period year 2000 contrary to his very claim that the bulk bags were urgently needed sometime in July 1999 for the Casecnan Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Also, the fact that respondent company was the sole user of the tonner bags at the Bulacan Plant of Union Cement during the period pertinent to this case was duly proven by the Certification issued by Union Cement Corporation, dated July 26, 2002, that respondent was the only sole user of tonner bags at Union Cement Bulacan Plant intended for the CP Casecnan Project(<i>Project</i>) from August 1999 to June 2001. To bolster this, the pictures taken at the premises of respondent company situated near the Project clearly depict respondent company’s act of using tonner bags supplied by petitioner, in hauling Union Cement intended for the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, the overriding consideration is the evidence adduced that the bulk bags delivered by petitioner at the Union Cement Plant were actually used by respondents, and this Court cannot allow respondents to enrich themselves at the expense of another.<br><br>Having received the aforesaid billings, the corresponding delivery receipts and demand letters rendered by petitioner, respondents should have forthwith called the attention of petitioner, if indeed, its insinuation that the bulk bags themselves have not been delivered or misdelivered were true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the ordinary course of business, in case of unwarranted claims of payment of a sum of money, one would immediately protest the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> But no such action was taken by respondents despite notice thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Only when respondents were required by the RTC to submit an answer to the complaint were they constrained to contest the claims of petitioner. If respondent were to be defeated only by its failure to effect delivery to the designated representative of respondent, the latter would inevitably be unjustly enriched at the expense of the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>If at all, respondents’ failure to pay the purchase price may have been due to lack of funds rather than non-delivery or misdelivery of the bulk bags. On cross-examination, Aurelio L. Gomez, petitioner’s general manager, testified that respondents admitted after the third delivery that they were postponing the payment because they have no money to pay. Thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><u>CROSS-EXAMINATION</u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

By preponderance of evidence is meant that the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to that of the other side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Essentially, preponderance of evidence refers to the comparative weight of the evidence presented by the opposing parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> As such, it has been defined as “the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side,” and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term greater weight of the evidence or greater weight of the credible evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It is proof that is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Contrary to respondents’ view, We find that petitioner has successfully established its case. Accordingly, We give greater weight, credit and value to its evidence.<br><br>Finally, with regard to the liability of respondent Trinidad, we adopt with approval the findings of the RTC that he was merely being sued in his capacity as General Manager of respondent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Since there was no showing of any of circumstances warranting the piercing the veil of corporate fiction, he cannot be held jointly and severally liable for the outstanding obligation of respondent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> As held in <i>Kukan International Corporation v. Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> citing an earlier case, those who seek to pierce the veil must clearly establish that the separate and distinct personalities of the corporations are set up to justify a wrong, protect fraud, or perpetrate a deception, to wit:<br><blockquote>The same principle was the subject and discussed in <i>Rivera v. United Laboratories, Inc.</i>:<br><blockquote>While a corporation may exist for any lawful purpose, the law will regard it as an association of persons or, <b><i>in case of two corporations, merge them into one, when its corporate legal entity is used as a cloak for fraud or illegality. This is the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. The doctrine applies only when such corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, or when it is made as a shield to confuse the legitimate issues</i></b>, or where a corporation is the mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation.<br><br><b><i>To disregard the separate juridical personality of a corporation, the wrongdoing must be established clearly and convincingly.</i></b> It cannot be presumed. (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>All told, We find reason to overturn the findings of the CA and affirm the decision of the trial court. Accordingly, respondent is hereby ordered to pay petitioner the sum of Seven Hundred Sixty Thousand Pesos (P760,000.00), representing overdue accounts plus interest from the first demand on October 27, 1999 until fully paid in accordance with the doctrine laid down in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines v.
