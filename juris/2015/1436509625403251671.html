				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The prohibition on midnight appointments only applies to presidential appointments. It does not apply to appointments made by local chief executives.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Civil Service Commission has the power to promulgate rules and regulations to professionalize the civil service. It may issue rules and regulations prohibiting local chief executives from making appointments during the last days of their tenure. Appointments of local chief executives must conform to these civil service rules and regulations in order to be valid.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> that denied the appeal of the Provincial Government of Aurora (the Province). The Province appealed the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Civil Service Commission granting the Motion for Execution filed by Hilario M. Marco (Marco). The Civil Service Commission had earlier reversed and set aside the disapproval of Marco's permanent appointment as Cooperative Development Specialist II.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Governor Ramoncita P.

Annexed to Marco's appointment papers was a certification from Provincial Budget Officer Norma R. Clemente (Provincial Budget Officer Clemente) and Provincial Accountant Wilfredo C.

It ruled that Marco's appointment was valid since it was accompanied by a certification of availability of funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As to the Letter withdrawing the certification, the Civil Service Commission ruled that it did not affect the validity of Marco's appointment because the Province "failed to submit documentary evidence to support its claim [that it had no funds to pay for the services of Governor Ong's appointees]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Civil Service Commission added that the Province's withdrawal of the certification was "unfair to Marco":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><blockquote>It is unfair to Marco who applied for the said position believing in good faith that funds were available, passed the screening conducted by the Personnel Selection Board (PSB) on February 12 &amp; 13, 2004, was appointed on June 25, 2004 and was later told to stop reporting for work as his appointment was disapproved by [the Civil Service Commission Field Office-Aurora] simply because the provincial government under the new governor realized that it has no funds to pay for his services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the Civil Service Commission ordered the Regional Office to investigate whether Provincial Budget Officer Clemente and Provincial Accountant Saturno were administratively liable for certifying that funds were available to cover the positions filled by Governor Ong's appointees but subsequently withdrawing this certification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It ordered the.

Ocampo (Provincial Administrator Ocampo), on behalf of the Province, filed before the Civil Service Commission a Petition for Relief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on the ground of extrinsic fraud. According to him, the Civil Service Commission deprived the Province of an opportunity to be heard when it failed to implead the Province as an indispensable party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He reiterated that Marco's appointment was void since the Province had no funds to pay for Marco's salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Civil Service Commission denied outright the Petition for Relief in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated November 4, 2008. It ruled that Provincial Administrator Ocampo had no legal personality to file the Petition for Relief absent an authorization from the Provincial Governor. Moreover, a petition for relief was not allowed under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Thus, Provincial Administrator Ocampo erred in filing a Petition for Relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Provincial Administrator Ocampo filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this time with a written authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to file from Governor Bellafior Angara-Castillo annexed to the Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Civil Service Commission denied the Motion for Reconsideration in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated September 8, 2009.

As the Civil Service Commission had ordered, the Province reflected the April 14, 2008 Resolution.in Marco's appointment papers and in his Service Record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated January 24, 2011, the Civil Service Commission denied the Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Quash "Execution." It noted that the Province still refused to reinstate Marco despite the April 14, 2008 Resolution and thus clarified that this Resolution necessarily resulted in the approval of Marco's appointment and his reinstatement as Cooperative Development Specialist II.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The January 24, 2011 Resolution states:<br><blockquote><i>Ocampo, et al.</i> nonchalantly tries to sweep away what is obvious in the ruling of the Commission in [the April 14, 2008 Resolution], <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the reversal of the disapproval by [the Regional Office] and [the Field Office] of Marco's appointment. The reversal of the two (2) decisions mean[s] that Marco's appointment as Cooperative Development Specialist II is in order and should be approved. Consequently, the approval of Marco's appointment is legal proof that he is entitled to perform the duties and functions of the said position and receive the salaries and benefits attached to the position.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Quash of Alex N. Ocampo, Provincial Administrator, and Manuel Joseph R. Bretana III, Legal Counsel, Provincial Government of Aurora, is <b>DENIED</b>. Accordingly, [the July 6, 2010 Resolution] which grants the Motion for the Implementation of [the April 14, 2008 Resolution] filed by Hilario M. Marco, <b>STANDS</b>.<br><br>The Provincial Governor of Aurora is directed to reinstate Marco to his Cooperative Development Specialist II position and pay his back salaries and other benefits from the time that Marco was actually prohibited from reporting for work up to his actual reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>A Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> under Rule 43 with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> was filed before the Court of Appeals. For the first time, the Province argued that Marco was a midnight appointee since Governor Ong appointed him during the last five (5) days of her tenure. Therefore, Marco's appointment was void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In the Decision dated March 2, 2012, the Court of Appeals denied the Petition for Review and affirmed the implementation of the Civil Service Commission's April 14, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the April 14, 2008 Resolution already became final and executory since there was no motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period. Although the Province filed a Petition for Relief before the Civil Service Commission, the Court of Appeals held that the remedy of a petition for relief is not allowed under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Moreover, the Province failed to prove the extrinsic fraud that allegedly prevented it from filing a motion for reconsideration. Thus, the Civil Service Commission correctly denied the Petition for Relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed Marco's appointment. The Province had earlier certified that it had funds to pay for his salary as Cooperative Development Specialist II.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It found that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan even passed a "Supplemental Budget for 2004 appropriating P54,014,127.01 in provincial funds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Therefore, the issuance of the Letter recalling the certification "[did] not change the fact that there [were] funds available for [Marco's] appointment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On the claim that Marco was a midnight appointee, the Court of Appeals said that Marco's case fell within the exception provided under Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 030918.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He was fully qualified for the position and underwent a screening process on February 12 and 13, 2004, long before the election ban.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Therefore, he was validly appointed.<br><br>The Province filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated June 13, 2012.<br><br>The Province filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this court. Marco filed his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> after which the Province filed its Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated January 30, 2013, this court ordered the parties to file their respective memoranda. The Province filed its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> on April 25, 2013, while Marco filed his Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> on May 2, 2013.<br><br>The Province maintains that Marco's appointment was void on the ground that he was a midnight appointee. Marco was appointed by Governor Ong five (5) days before the end of her term, in violation of Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 030918,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> paragraph 2.1 of which provides:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">2.1.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> All appointments issued by elective appointing officials after elections up to June 30 shall be disapproved, except if the appointee is fully qualified for the position and had undergone regular screening processes before the Election Ban as shown in the Promotion and Selection Board (PSB) report or minutes of meeting.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On Marco's claim that he underwent a regular screening process, which exempted his appointment from the prohibition on midnight appointments, the Province counters that Marco failed to present convincing evidence to prove this claim. The Minutes of the Meeting of the Promotion Selection Board showed that Marco was among the 201 applicants allegedly screened by the Board within two (2j days. According to the Province, two days is a period too short for the Personnel Selection Board to have carefully considered all the applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As to the claim that the April 14, 2008 Resolution is final and executory and may no longer be reversed, the Province argues that nothing prevents this court from setting aside this Resolution. It argues that the promulgation of <i><i>Nazareno</i>, et al. v. City of Dumaguete</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> was a supervening event warranting the reversal of the final and executory decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In <i>Nazareno</i>, this court voided 89 appointments made by a city mayor within the month that he left office, ruling that they were mass appointments prohibited under Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 010988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The Province argues that Governor Ong's appointments were analogous to the <i>Nazareno</i> appointments; hence, Governor Ong's appointments should likewise be voided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Province insists that Marco's appointment was void due to lack of funds to pay for the position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In ordering the Province to uphold Marco's appointment despite the lack of funds, the Civil Service Commission allegedly "interfered with [the Province's] prerogative to draw up its own budget and to spend its ... revenues as it deems fit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>For his part, Marco maintains that the Civil Service Commission's Resolution dated April 14, 2008 has long become final and executory. Therefore, the Resolution may no longer be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>On the claim that he was a midnight appointee, Marco pointed out that the Province belatedly raised this claim. The Province never raised it before the Civil Service Commission but only did so before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> By belatedly raising this claim, the Province should be deemed to have "implicitly recognized"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> that he was not a midnight appointee.<br><br>In any case, Marco asserts that he was qualified for the position and that he underwent a selection process as required by Resolution No. 030918. Thus, his appointment was an exception to the prohibition on midnight appointments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>On the alleged interference of the Civil Service Commission with the Province's discretionary power to appoint, Marco argues that it "merely upheld the validity of an existing appointment[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The Civil Service Commission did not "[substitute] its own appointee for the one chosen by the appointing authority."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Therefore, it correctly upheld his appointment.<br><br>Lastly, Marco argues that <i>Nazareno</i> does not apply in this case. This court in <i>Nazareno</i> voided the 89 appointments of the appointing authority based on the criteria set in Resolution No. 010988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> However, <i>Nazareno</i> had been promulgated even before he was appointed in office. Moreover, Resolution No. 010988 did not set any new criteria for appointments made during the last days of the appointing authority in office. Therefore, the promulgation of <i>Nazareno</i> is not a supervening event that can set aside the final and executory April 14, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The issues for this court's resolution are:<br><br>First, whether the Resolution dated July 6, 2010, which ordered the implementation of the April 14, 2008 Resolution, was void for varying the terms of the April 14, 2008 Resolution;<br><br>Second, whether the withdrawal of the certification of sufficiency of funds voided Marco's appointment; and<br><br>Lastly, whether Marco's appointment was void on the ground that he was a midnight appointee.<br><br>This Petition must be denied.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>We note that the Province filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals against the Civil Service Commission's Resolution that ordered the execution of the April 14, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The Province erred in filing an appeal before the Court of Appeals, as no appeal may be taken from an order of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Instead, it should have filed a petition for certiorari — the appropriate special civil action under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, therefore, should have dismissed the Province's appeal outright. Rule 50, Section 1(i) of the Rules of Court allows the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal where the order appealed from is not appealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The rule prohibiting appeals from orders of execution is based on the doctrine of immutability of final judgments. Under this doctrine, a final and executory judgment "is removed from the power and jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to further alter or amend it, much less revoke it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The judgment remains immutable even if it is later on discovered to be erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The doctrine "is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional error, the judgments of the courts must become final at some definite date fixed by law. To allow courts to amend final [and executory] judgments will result in endless litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>The doctrine of immutability of final judgments applies to decisions rendered by the Civil Service Commission. A decision of the Civil Service Commission becomes final and executory if no motion for reconsideration is filed within the 15-day reglementary period under Rule VI, Section 80 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:<br><blockquote>Section 80. <i>Execution of Decision</i>. - The decisions of the Commission Proper or its Regional Offices shall be immediately executory after fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof, unless a motion for reconsideration is seasonably filed, in which case the execution of the decision shall be held in abeyance.<br></blockquote>In <i>Mendiola v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Teodorico Mendiola (Mendiola) occupied the position of Budget Examiner III when the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau terminated his employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> On Mendiola's appeal, the Civil Service Commission ordered his reinstatetment in the resolution dated September 21, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>The Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau failed to file a motion for reconsideration within the 15-day reglementary period. Consequently, Mendiola filed a motion for execution of the September 21, 1988 resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Unknown to Mendiola, the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau belatedly filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Civil Service Commission granted despite having been filed out of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>This court reversed the Civil Service Commission's grant of the motion for reconsideration and ordered Mendiola's reinstatement as the Commission previously ordered in the September 21, 1998 resolution. This court held that the September 21, 1998 resolution had become final and executory when the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau failed to file a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period. Thus, the Civil Service Commission may no longer reverse the resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>In <i>Obiasca v. Basallote</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Jeane O. Basallote (Basallote) was appointed Administrative Officer II by the Department of Education and was assigned to work in Tabaco National High School in Albay. Basallote had assumed the duties of her office as Administrative Officer II when she learned that Arlin B. Obiasca (Obiasca) was subsequently appointed to the same position. Obiasca's appointment was attested to by the Civil Service Commission, while Basallote's appointment papers were not even forwarded to the Civil Service Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Basallote protested Obiasca's appointment before the Civil Service Commission Regional Office V. The Regional Office dismissed the protest.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the Civil Service Commission's Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Obiasca's Petition for Review on certiorari was likewise denied by this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This court held that Obiasca's failure to file a motion for reconsideration rendered the Civil Service Commission's Decision approving Basallote's appointment final and executory. Thus, the Civil Service Commission's Decision may no longer be disturbed:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><blockquote>[Obiasca] did not file a petition for reconsideration of the [Civil Service Commission's resolution] before filing a petition for review in the [Court of Appeals].

Hence, for all intents and purposes, the [Civil Service Commission's resolution] has become immutable and can no longer be amended or modified. <b>A final and definitive judgment can no longer be changed, revised, amended or reversed.</b> Thus, in praying for the reversal of the assailed Court of Appeals decision which affirmed the final and executory [Civil Service Commission resolution], [Obiasca] would want the Court to reverse a final and executory judgment and disregard the doctrine of immutability of final judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In this case, the Province, through its Human Resource Management Office, received a copy of the Civil Service Commission's April 14, 2008 Resolution on May 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Thus, the Province had until June 5, 2008 to file a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>However, the Province failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the April 14, 2008 Resolution within the 15-day reglementary period.

It allegedly had no funds to cover the position. Therefore, the appointment was void, having been issued in violation of Rule V, Section 1(e)(ii) of the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 40-98. The rule states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. In addition to the common requirements and procedures, the following requirements and guidelines shall also be observed and the necessary documents submitted, when applicable.<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">. . . . <br><br></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">e. </div></td><td><div align="justify">LGU Appointment.

Therefore, there was no violation of Rule V, Section 1(e)(ii) of the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 40-98. There was no violation of existing Civil Service Law, rules and regulations. Marco's appointment remains effective.<br><br>That the Province suddenly had no funds to pay for Marco's salaries despite its earlier certification that funds were available under its 2004 Annual Budget does not affect his appointment.<br><br>None of the grounds for disapproval, of an appointment under Rule V, Section 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Civil Service Law exists in this case. The appointment remains effective, and the local government unit remains liable for the salaries of the appointee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the earlier certification, if proven false, constitutes intentional misrepresentation of a material fact concerning a civil service matter.

Clemente and Provincial Accountant Wilfredo C. Saturno for issuing the certification of availability of funds:<br><blockquote>The Commission disapproves of the conduct of the officials of the Provincial Government of Aurora in issuing a certification dated June 25, 2004 that funds are available in the 2004 Annual Budget to support the appointments issued by outgoing Governor Ong and then later [withdrawing] the same when a new governor assumes office.
