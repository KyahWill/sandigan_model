The Commission shall make a determination, within thirty (30) days, whether or not such registration should be revoked.<br><br>And, pursuant to Section 54 of the Code, respondent corporations, SUBIC BAY GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB, INC. and UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL GROUP DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, are hereby fined the amount of P100,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The Corporation Finance Department found that Filart and Villareal invested in the golf course because of SBGCCI and UIGDC's representation that a 27-hole, world-class golf course would be developed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It also found that SBGCCI and UIGDC failed to comply with their commitments and representations as stated in their prospectus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The Corporation Finance Department ordered the return of the purchase price of shares pursuant to Rule 14<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 8799 or the Securities Regulation Code. It explained that the non-completion of the golf course constituted a material amendment in the prospectus. The prospectus had become misleading, tending to work a fraud. This gave the purchasers the right to a refund of their contributions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>SBGCCI and UIGDC filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the Corporation Finance Department's Order before the Securities and Exchange Commission. SBGCCI and UIGDC assailed the Corporation Finance Department's and the Securities and Exchange Commission's authority to order a refund of investments. They also assailed its jurisdiction over the case, which according to SBGCCI and UIGDC involved an intra-corporate dispute. They argued that the Corporation Finance Department's Order was issued without due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On February 10, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission rendered the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> affirming the July 1, 2003 Order of the Corporation Finance Department:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the PETITION is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

It was only conducted to determine if SBGCCI and UIGDC violated the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. While Villareal and Filart's letter-complaint alleged intra-corporate matters, it also alleged matters pertaining to SBGCCI and UIGDC's compliance with the prospectus and registration statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority to investigate possible acts of abuse of franchise and violations of its rules and regulations. It also has the power to impose appropriate administrative sanctions. The Corporation Finance Department only exercised these powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Corporation Finance Department, tasked to oversee securities registration, has the implied power to suspend or revoke registration upon showing of violations of the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. Based on Section 4.6 of the Securities Regulation Code, the Securities and Exchange Commission has the power to delegate some of its functions to any of its departments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On SBGCCI and UIGDC's allegation that they were not given due process, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that suspension of permit to sell securities does not require a full-blown hearing. In any case, SBGCCI and UIGDC were served notice and given an opportunity to present their case. They were even able to file their Comment on the letter-complaint on January 6, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission added that the Corporation Finance Department's directive to return the purchasers' investments was in accordance with the rules. Rule 14 of the Securities Regulation Code allows purchasers to renounce their securities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>SBGCCI and UIGDC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the February 10, 2004 Securities and Exchange Commission Decision, but this was denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated April 6, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>SBGCCI and UIGDC filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of the Securities and Exchange Commission's February 10, 2004 Decision before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> They argued that the letter-complaint filed by Villareal and Filart involved an intra-corporate dispute that was under the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court and not the Securities and Exchange Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> They also argued that the Securities Regulation Code does not grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to order the refund of payment for shares of stock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 2007, the Court of Appeals declared void the February 10, 2004 Decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission insofar as it ordered the refund of the purchase price of Filart's and Villareal's investments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the February 10, 2004 Decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission in CFD-AA-Case No. 08-03-36, affirming the July 1, 2003 Order of the Corporate Finance Department, insofar as it ordered the refund of the purchase price of the shares of stock of petitioner SBGCCI, is hereby declared NULL and VOID for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals found that the case involved an intra-corporate controversy. The Securities and Exchange Commission acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it ordered UIGDC and SBGCCI to refund Villareal and Filart the amount they paid for SBGCCI shares of stock. The authority to exercise powers necessary to carry out the objectives of the Securities and Exchange Commission does not include the authority to refund investments. This power has been transferred to the Regional Trial Court. The Securities and Exchange Commission should have limited its exercise of power to issuing an order imposing a fine, to amend the prospectus, and to suspend the Certificate of Registration and Permit to Sell Securities to the Public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition was filed.<br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission argues that Villareal and Filart's letter-complaint of November 4, 2002 did not only raise matters involving intra-corporate relations. Their letter-complaint also stated serious violations of the Securities Regulation Code, which may require the Securities and Exchange Commission's intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The Commission did not adjudicate private rights or awarded damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It only determined whether SBGCCI and UIGDC committed misrepresentations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> in violation of the Securities Regulation Code and its implementing rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission contends that its Order to return the stock purchasers' contributions is in accordance with Rule 14, Section 1(c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the Implementing Ru|es and Regulations of the Securities Regulation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This provision is within the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule-making power under Section 143<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of the Corporation Code and Section 5(g) and (n)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of the Securities Regulation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Section l(c) is necessary to implement the Securities Regulation Code's mandate "to protect the investing public from unscrupulous corporations taking advantage of every situation[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission points out that Villareal and Filart had been demanding from SBGCCI and UIGDC the return of their investments. Its Corporation Finance Department already directed SBGCCI and UIGDC to amend their prospectus and registration statements to comply with the Securities Regulation Code. However, SBGCCI and UIGDC failed to comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> SBGDCC and UIGDC insist that the case involved an intra-corporate dispute over which only the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The Securities and Exchange Commission has no authority to order the return of payments made by Villareal and Filart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Even assuming that the Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over intra-corporate cases, there should first be a disagreement over prospectus amendments before paid contributions can be refunded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>We determine which between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction over this case. We also determine whether the Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority to order the return of purchase price of securities upon finding that there were fraudulent representations in the prospectus.<br><br>We rule for SBGCCI and UIGDC.<br><br>Under Presidential Decree No. 902-A,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over acts amounting to fraud and misrepresentation by a corporation's board of directors, business associates, and officers. It also provides that it has jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes. Thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS</b>, in line with the government's policy of encouraging investments, both domestic and foreign, and more active public participation in the affairs of private corporations and enterprises through which desirable activities may be pursued for the promotion of economic development; and, to promote a wider and more meaningful equitable distribution of wealth, there is a need for an agency of the government to be invested with ample powers to protect such investment and the public;<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b>SEC. 5.</b> In addition to the regulatory and adjudicative functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission over corporations, partnerships and other forms of associations registered with it as expressly granted under existing laws and decrees, it shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:<br><ol type="a"><li>Devices or schemes employed by or any acts, of the board of directors, business associates, its officers or partners, amounting to fraud and misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholder, partners, members of associations or organizations registered with the Commission;<br><br></li><li>Controversies arising out of intra-corporate or partnership relations, between and among stockholders, members, or associates; between any or all of them and the corporation, partnership or association of which they are stockholders, members or associates, respectively; and between such corporation, partnership or association and the state insofar as it concerns their individual franchise or right to exist as such entity;<br><br></li><li>Controversies in the election or appointments of directors, trustees, officers or managers of such corporations, partnerships or associations.<br></li></ol></blockquote>However, jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes and all other cases enumerated in Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A had already been transferred to designated Regional Trial Courts. Section 5.2 of Republic Act No. 8799 provides:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">5.2. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The Commission's jurisdiction over all cases enumerated under Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A is hereby transferred to the Courts of general jurisdiction or the appropriate Regional Trial Court: <i>Provided</i>, that the Supreme Court in the exercise of its authority may designate the Regional Trial Court branches that shall exercise jurisdiction over these cases. The Commission shall retain jurisdiction over pending cases involving intra-corporate disputes submitted for final resolution which should be resolved within one (1) year from the enactment of this Code. The Commission shall retain jurisdiction over pending suspension of payments/rehabilitation cases filed as of 30 June 2000 until fully disposed.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Hence, actions pertaining to intra-corporate disputes should be filed directly before designated Regional Trial Courts. Intra-corporate disputes brought before other courts or tribunals are dismissible for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>For a dispute to be "intra-corporate," it must satisfy the relationship and nature of controversy tests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The relationship test requires that the dispute be between a corporation/partnership/association&nbsp; and the public; a corporation/partnership/association and the state regarding the entity's franchise, permit, or license to operate; a corporation/partnership/association and its stockholders, partners, members, or officers; and among stockholders, partners, or associates of the entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The nature of the controversy test requires that the action involves the enforcement of corporate rights and obligations.<br><br>Courts and tribunals must consider both the parties' relationship and the nature of the controversy to determine whether they should assume jurisdiction over a case. In <i>Medical Plaza Makati Condominium Corporation v.

In other words, jurisdiction should be determined by considering both the relationship of the parties as well as the nature of the question involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This case is an intra-corporate dispute, over which the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction. It involves a dispute between the corporation, SBGCCI, and its shareholders, Villareal and Filart.<br><br>This case also involves corporate rights and obligations. The nature of the action â whether it involves corporate rights and obligations â is determined by the allegations and reliefs in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Villareal and Filart's right to a refund of the value of their shares was based on SBGCCI and UIGDC's alleged failure to abide by their representations in their prospectus. Specifically, Villareal and Filart alleged in their letter-complaint that the world-class golf course that was promised to them when they purchased shares did not materialize. This is an intra-corporate matter that is under the designated Regional Trial Court's jurisdiction.

It provides the public with basis for relying on the representations of corporations that issue securities or financial instruments.<br><br>Any fraud or misrepresentation in the issuance of securities injures the public. The Securities and Exchange Commission's power to suspend or revoke registrations and to impose fines and other penalties provides the public with a certain level of assurance that the securities contain representations that are true, and that misrepresentations if later found, would be detrimental to the erring corporation. It creates risks to corporations that issue securities and adds cost to errors, misrepresentations, and violations related to the issuance of those securities. This protects the public who will rely on representations of corporations and partnerships regarding financial instruments that they issue. The Securities and Exchange Commission's regulatory power over securities-related activities is tied to the government's duty to protect the investing public from illegal and fraudulent instruments.<br><br>Thus, when Villareal and Filart alleged in their letter-complaint that SBGCCI and UIGDC committed misrepresentations in the sale of their shares, nothing prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking cognizance of it to determine if SBGCCI and UIGDC committed administrative violations and were liable under the Securities Regulation Code. The Securities and Exchange Commission may investigate activities of corporations under its jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the law.<br><br>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulatory power does not include the authority to order the refund of the purchase price of Villareal's and Filart's shares in the golf club. The issue of refund is intra-corporate or civil in nature. Similar to issues such as the existence or inexistence of appraisal rights, pre-emptive rights, and the right to inspect books and corporate records, the issue of refund is an intra-corporate dispute that requires the court to determine and adjudicate the parties' rights based on law or contract. Injuries, rights, and obligations involved in intra-corporate disputes are specific to the parties involved. They do not affect the Securities and Exchange Commission or the public directly.<br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission argues that the power to order a refund is in accordance with the implementing rules of the Securities Regulation Code. Despite orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission to amend their prospectus, SBGCCI and UIGDC failed to comply. Thus, Villareal and Filart were entitled to the refund of the purchase price of their shares. They cite Section 14 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Securities Regulation Code:<br><br><b>SRC Rule 14 - Amendments to the Registration Statement</b><br><br><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><i>If a prospectus filed with the Commission under the Code becomes incomplete or inaccurate</i> in any material respect or if the issuer wants to change any material information therein, the issuer shall:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">a. </div></td><td><div align="justify"><i>file an amendment</i> to the registration statement with the Commission explaining all proposed changes which shall be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with Section 14 of the Code;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">. . . . </div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">c. </div></td><td><div align="justify">where material amendments have been made to the prospectus after the effective date thereof, <i>purchasers may, within thirty (30) days from the date of such notification, renounce their purchase of securities</i>, whereupon the issuer, or any person acting on behalf of the issuer in connection with the distribution of said securities, shall, within ten (10) days from receipt of notification of such election, return the contributions paid by such purchasers without making any deductions.

Provisions giving shareholders rights, however, are not to be interpreted as sources of authority or jurisdiction when there is none. The provisions in the law or in the rules giving Villareal and Filart the right to be refunded the value of their shares are not equivalent to authority for the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue an order for the refund. Such order may not come from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br><br>Neither the provisions of the implementing rules nor the provisions of the Securities Regulation Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> the law being implemented, give the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to order a refund. The Securities and Exchange Commission's power when violations of the Securities Regulation Code are found is limited to issuing regulatory orders such as suspending or revoking registration statements, providing for the terms and conditions for registration, and imposing fines and penalties.<br><br>The implementing rules cannot be interpreted to give the Securities and Exchange Commission the power that is more than what is provided under the Securities Regulation Code. Implementing rules are limited by the laws they implement. The rules cannot be used to amend, expand, or modify the law being implemented. The law shall prevail in case of inconsistency between the law and the rules.<br><br>In <i>United BF Homeowner's Association v. BF Homes, Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><blockquote>As early as 1970, in the case of <i>Teoxon vs. Members of the Board of Administrators (PVA)</i>, we ruled that the power to promulgate rules in the implementation of a statute is necessarily limited to what is provided for in the legislative enactment. Its terms must be followed for an administrative agency cannot amend an Act of Congress. "The rule-making power must be confined to details for regulating the mode or proceedings to carry into effect the law as it has been enacted, and it cannot be extended to amend or expand the statutory requirements or to embrace matters not covered by the statute." If a discrepancy occurs between the basic law and an implementing rule or regulation, it is the former that prevails.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>. . . The rule-making power of a public administrative body is a delegated legislative power, which it may not use either to abridge the authority given it by Congress or the Constitution or to enlarge its power beyond the scope intended. Constitutional and statutory provisions control what rules and regulations may be promulgated by such a body, as well as with respect to what fields are subject to regulation by it. It may not make rules and regulations which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or a statute, particularly the statute it is administering or which created it, or which are in derogation of, or defeat, the purpose of a statute.<br><br>Moreover, where the legislature has delegated to an executive or administrative officers and boards authority to promulgate rules to carry out an express legislative purpose, the rules of administrative officers and boards, which have the effect of extending, or which conflict with the authority-granting statute, do not represent a valid exercise of the rule-nrnking power but constitute an attempt by an administrative body to legislate. "A statutory grant of powers should not be extended by implication beyond what may be necessary for their just and reasonable execution." It is axiomatic that a rule or regulation must bear upon, and be consistent with, the provisions of the enabling statute if such rule or regulation is to be valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (<i>Citations omitted</i>)<br></blockquote>Hence, the issue of refund should be litigated in the appropriate Regional Trial Court.
