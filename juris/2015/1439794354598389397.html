The MOA further clarified that the P260 million bid price proposed by the FEBTC was a premium to be paid as further consideration for the sale of the assets and the assumption of the liabilities of PBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b><i>Lastly</i></b>, the CA erred in relying on the initial findings of the RTC that the disputed fixed assets had been submitted to the Central Bank as collateral and were thus excluded from the purchase under the MOA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b><i>The PDIC Arguments</i></b><br><br>The PDIC countered that <b><i>first</i></b>, the CA was correct when it addressed the issue of whether or not the FEBTC acquired ownership over the disputed PBC fixed assets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the CA was correct in ruling that the PA was the final and absolute repository of the terms of the sale transaction between the parties and not the MOA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The PDIC also adopted the CA's findings that even if the disputed assets had not been mortgaged, still FEBTC did not directly purchase these assets either under the MOA or the PA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br><b>The issue in this case is whether or not the PDIC, as the Liquidator of the PBC, may be compelled to execute the deeds of sale over the nine (9)</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> <b>disputed PBC fixed assets.</b><br><br>We rule in the affirmative, as there was a perfected contract of sale over the disputed fixed assets.<br><br>It is well-established that a contract undergoes various stages that include its negotiation or preparation, its perfection, and finally, its consummation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><b><i>Negotiation</i></b> covers the period <i>from</i> the time the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract <i>to</i> the time the contract is concluded (perfected). The <b><i>perfection</i></b> of the contract takes place upon the concurrence of its essential elements. A contract which is <i>consensual</i> as to perfection is so established upon a mere meeting of minds, <i>i.e.</i>, the concurrence of offer and acceptance, on the object and on the cause or consideration. The <b>consummation</b> stage begins when the parties perform their respective undertakings under the contract, culminating in its extinguishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Specifically, <b>contracts of sale</b> are perfected by mutual consent, when the seller obligates himself, for a price certain, to deliver and transfer ownership of a specified thing or right to the buyer over which the latter agrees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Mutual consent, as a state of mind, may only be inferred from the confluence of two acts of the parties: an offer certain as to the object of the contract and its consideration, and an absolute acceptance of the offer, <i>i.e.</i>, with respect to the exact object and consideration embodied in the offer. While it may not be possible to expect the acceptance to <i>echo</i> every nuance of the offer, it is imperative that it assents to those points in the offer that, under the operative facts of each contract, are not only material but motivating as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Simply put, a contract of sale is perfected upon the meeting of the minds of the parties on the essential elements of the contract, <i>i.e.</i>, consent, object certain, and the consideration of the contract.<br><br>Based on the above well-established principles, the Court rules that the essential elements of a contract of sale are present in the MOA as confirmed by the FEBTC's bid and the provisions of the MOA and the PA.

This RTC ruling was issued when it denied the FEBTCs prayer for preliminary injunction. The CA gave weight to the fact that this RTC ruling was affirmed both by the CA and the Court.<br><br>Again, we disagree with the CA's conclusions.<br><br>The affirmation by the CA and by this Court of the RTC's order denying a preliminary injunction on the ground that the disputed assets were submitted as collaterals <b>does not preclude the RTC from issuing a different ruling after trial on the merits</b>.<br><br>In <i>Olalia, et al. v.

Necessarily, the evidence needs only be a "sampling," and is submitted merely to give the court an idea of the justification for the preliminary injunction pending the decision of the case on the merits. <b>The evidence submitted at the hearing on the motion for the preliminary injunction is not conclusive of the principal action, which has yet to be decided.</b><br><br>The appellate court's review of the trial court's issuance of a preliminary injunction does not include a final determination of the merits of the case; it is only a determination of whether the preliminary injunction has been properly issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Court finds that the RTC's findings after trial on the merits are more credible as opposed to the CA's misguided reliance on the ruling of the RTC in the preliminary injunction.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC ruled that the disputed fixed assets had not been submitted as collaterals to the Central Bank. The findings of the RTC were based on: (1) the testimonies and admissions of Ms. Teresa Salcor, who was then an Account Officer of the Central Bank Board of Liquidators; and (2) the RTC's examination of the purported deeds of real estate mortgage over the disputed fixed assets.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, the RTC found that the FEBTC was not informed that the disputed assets were one of those submitted as collaterals to the Central Bank, as testified to by Ms. Teresa Salcor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>She also admitted during her testimony that there was no annotation of the real estate mortgage on the titles of the disputed assets;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> hence, the RTC correctly ruled that these purported mortgages cannot bind the FEBTC.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the RTC found that there were doubts on the authenticity of the deeds of real estate mortgage involving the disputed fixed assets. The acknowledgment portion of the deeds indicated that this document and its annexes were signed by the parties.<br><br>However, the RTC found that the annexes were not so signed and did not bear any notarial seal. It was therefore easy to insert an entirely different page as an annex of the deeds. Moreover, the integrity of the real estate mortgage was put in question.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, the RTC ruled that the deeds of real estate mortgage were not registered with the Register of Deeds, making it binding only between the Central Bank and the PBC. It cannot bind the FEBTC who was not notified of the alleged mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>In these lights, we find that the disputed fixed assets were not submitted as collaterals to the Central Bank and are thus not excluded from the assets purchased by the FEBTC.<br><br><b><i>Legal consequences</i></b><br><br>As discussed, the contract of sale was perfected upon the execution of the MOA. Hence, the terms and conditions of the contract of sale under the MOA, as confirmed by the PA, are reciprocally demandable from both parties.<br><br>Therefore, the Liquidator and the CB-BOL as the intervenor, must execute the corresponding deeds of sale in favor of the FEBTC; and the FEBTC must pay the purchase price of the disputed fixed assets.

Iloilo City-Central Market<br></blockquote>With respect to the purchase price of these fixed assets, we note that the purchase price and manner of payment were provided under Sections 3(c) and 10(b) of the MOA, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>i. Section 3(c)</i><br><br>Section 3- Valuation of Assets and Liabilities<br><br>c. It is further understood that <b>the BUYER shall purchase on the basis of its sound value less any assigned depreciation accruing thereon from August 1984, up to the valuation date, <u>all the fixed assets</u> of the SELLER as described in the Asian Appraisal's Report of August 1984, which is herein incorporated by way of reference</b>, but shall not purchase fixed assets not yet appraised, equipment, furniture and other fixtures provided that the BUYER within a period of ninety (90) days from the date hereof shall have the first option to buy any of the said assets of the SELLER which shall form part of the assets bought under this Memorandum Agreement, (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br><i>ii.
