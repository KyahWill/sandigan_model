Clarke in the latter's personal capacity; (b) there was no need to wait for the expiration of the MOA because Capt. Clarke performed highly risky works in the leased premises that endangered other aircrafts within the vicinity; and (c) the six (6)-month advance notice of termination was already given in the letters he sent to Capt. Clarke.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On March 25, 2003, the RTC issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> ordering petitioner to: (<i>a</i>) immediately remove all his aircrafts parked within the leased premises; (<i>b</i>) allow entry of respondent by removing the steel gate installed thereat; and (<i>c</i>) desist and refrain from committing further acts of dispossession and/or interference in respondent's occupation of the hangar space.<br><br>For failure of petitioner to comply with the foregoing writ, respondent filed on October 24, 2003 a petition for indirect contempt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 30,030-2003, which was tried jointly with Civil Case No. 29, 292-2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b><center>The RTC Ruling<br></center></b><br>After due trial, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated May 19, 2006 finding petioner: (<i>a</i>) <b>guilty of indirect contempt</b> for contumaciously disregarding its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated March 6, 2003, by not allowing respondent to possess occupy the leased premises pending final decision in the main case; and (<i>b</i>) <b>liable for breach of contract</b> for illegally terminating the MOA even before the expiration of the term thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He was, thus, ordered to pay a fine of P5,000.00, and to pay&nbsp; respondent nominal damages of P100,000.00&nbsp; and attorney's fees of P50,000.00 with legal interest, and costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On the challenge to respondent's juridical personality, the RTC quoted the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated April 11, 2005 of the SEC explaining that respondent was issued a Certificate of Incorporation on September 3, 2001 as <i>New International Environmental Universality, Inc. </i>but that, subsequently, when it amended its Articles of Incorporation on November 14, 2001 and July 11, 2002, the SEC Extension Office in Davao City erroneously used the name <i>New International Environmental University,</i> Inc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The latter name was used by respondent when it filed its amended complaint on September 11, 2002 and the petition for indirect contempt against petitioner on October 24, 2003 believing that it was allowed to do so, as it was only on April 11, 2005 when the SEC directed it to revert to its correct name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The RTC further declared that the MOA, which was "made and executed by and between CAPT. [PRISCILO] B. PAZ, Officer-In-Charge of Aircraft Hangar at Davao International Airport, Davao City, Philippines, hereinafter called as FIRST PARTY [a]nd CAPT. ALLAN J. CLARKE[,] President of INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL UNIVERSITY with office address at LIBERTY AVIATION HANGAR, Davao International Airport, Davao City, Philippines, hereinafter called as SECOND PARTY,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> was executed by the parties not only in their personal capacities but also in representation of their respective corporations or entities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On the issue of the violation of the terms of the MOA, the RTC found respondent to have been <b>effectively evicted</b> from the leased premises between July and August of 2002, or long before the expiration of the term thereof in 2004, when petitioner: (<i>a</i>) placed a gate/fence that prevented ingress to and egress from the leased premises; (<i>b</i>) parked a plane inside and outside the leased premises; (<i>c</i>) disconnected the electrical and telephone connections of respondent; and (<i>d</i>) locked respondent's employees out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Despite the service of the injunctive writ upon petitioner, respondent was not allowed to possess and occupy the leased premises, as in fact, the trial court even had to order on March 8, 2004 the inventory of the items locked inside the bodega of said premises that was kept off-limits to respondent. Hence, petitioner was declared guilty of indirect contempt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner elevated his case on appeal before the CA, arguing that the trial court should have dismissed outright the cases against him for failure of respondent to satisfy the essential requisites of being a party to an action, <i>i.e</i>., legal personality, legal capacity to sue or be sued, and real interest in the subject matter of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>Finding that the errors ascribed by petitioner to the trial court only touched the civil action for breach of contract, the appellate court resolved the appeal against him in a Decision<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[36]</sup></font> dated January 31, 2012, and <b>affirmed</b> the RTC's finding of petitioner's liability for breach of contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The CA ruled that, while there was no corporate entity at the time of the execution of the MOA on March 1, 2000 when Capt. Clarke signed as "President of International Environmental University," petitioner is nonetheless <b>estopped</b> from denying that he had contracted with respondent as a corporation, having recognized the latter as the "Second Party" in the MOA that "will use the hangar space exclusively for <b>company</b> aircraft/helicopter."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Petitioner was likewise found to have issued checks to respondent from May 3, 2000 to October 13, 2000, which belied his claim of contracting with Capt. Clarke in the latter's personal capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for the reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the foregoing Decision, raising as an additional issue the death<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of Capt. Clarke which allegedly warranted the dismissal of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, the motion was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated October 2, 2012 where the CA held that Capt. Clarke was merely an agent of respondent, who is the real party in the case. Thus, Capt. Clarke's death extinguished only the agency between him and respondent, not the appeal against petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioner is now before the Court <i>via</i> the instant petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> claiming that: (<i>a</i>) the CA erred in not settling his appeal for both the breach of contract and indirect contempt cases in a single proceeding and, consequently, the review of said cases before the Court should be consolidated,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the CA should have dismissed the cases against him for (<i>1</i>) lack of jurisdiction of the trial court in view of the failure to implead Capt. Clarke as an indispensable party;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (2) lack of legal capacity and personality on the part of respondent;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and (3) lack of factual and legal bases for the assailed RTC Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>First</i>, on the matter of the consolidation<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[50]</sup></font> of the instant case with G.R. No. 202826 entitled "<i>Priscilo B. Paz v. New International Environmental University</i>,'' the petition for review of the portion of the RTC Decision finding petitioner guilty of indirect contempt,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court had earlier denied said motion in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated July 24, 2013 on the ground that G.R. No. 202826 had already been denied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> with finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, any further elucidation on the issue would be a mere superfluity.<br><br><i>Second</i>, whether or not Capt. Clarke should have been impleaded as an indispensable party was correctly resolved by the CA which held that the former was merely an agent of respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> While Capt. Clarke's name and signature appeared on the MOA, his participation was, nonetheless, limited to being a representative of respondent. As a mere representative, Capt. Clarke acquired no rights whatsoever, nor did he incur any liabilities, arising from the contract between petitioner and respondent. Therefore, he was not an indispensable party to the case at bar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>It should be emphasized, as it has been time and again, that this Court is not a trier of facts, and is thus not duty-bound to analyze again and weigh the evidence introduced in and considered by the tribunals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> When supported by substantial evidence, the findings of fact by the CA are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not reviewable by this Court, unless the case falls under any of the exceptions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> none of which was established herein.<br><br>The CA had correctly pointed out that, from the very language itself of the MOA entered into by petitioner whereby he obligated himself to allow the use of the hangar space "for <b>company</b> aircraft/helicopter," petitioner cannot deny that he contracted with respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Petitioner further acknowledged this fact in his final letter dated July 23, 2002, where he reiterated and strongly demanded the former to immediately vacate the hangar space his "<b>company</b> is occupying/utilizing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Section 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the Corporation Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> explicitly provides that one who assumes an obligation to an ostensible corporation, as such, cannot resist performance thereof on the ground that there was in fact no corporation. Clearly, petitioner is bound by his obligation under the MOA not only on <i>estoppel</i> but by express provision of law. As aptly raised by respondent in its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> to the instant petition, it is futile to insist that petitioner issued the receipts for rental payments in respondent's name and not with Capt. Clarke's, whom petitioner allegedly contracted in the latter's personal capacity, only because it was upon the instruction of an employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Indeed, it is disputably presumed that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and that all private transactions have been fair and regular.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Hence, it is assumed that petitioner, who is a pilot, knew what he was doing with respect to his business with respondent.<br><br>Petitioner's pleadings, however, abound with clear indications of a business relationship gone sour. In his third letter dated July 19, 2002, petitioner lamented the fact that Capt. Clarke's alleged promise to buy an aircraft had not materialized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> He likewise insinuated that Capt. Clarke's real motive in staying in the leased premises was the acquisition of petitioner's right to possess and use the hangar space.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Be that as it may, it is settled that courts have no power to relieve parties from obligations they voluntarily assumed, simply because their contracts turn out to be disastrous deals or unwise investments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The lower courts, therefore, did not err in finding petitioner liable for breach of contract for effectively evicting respondent from the leased premises even before the expiration of the term of the lease. The Court reiterates with approval the ratiocination of the RTC that, if it were true that respondent was violating the terms and conditions of the lease, "[petitioner] should have gone to court to make the [former] refrain from its 'illegal' activities or seek rescission of the [MOA], rather than taking the law into his own hands."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
