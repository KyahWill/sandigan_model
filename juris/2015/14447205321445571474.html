DAR Region V Director Dalugdug in his 2<sup>nd</sup> Indorsement to the DAR Secretary dated September&nbsp;30, 1997, wrote:<br><blockquote><b>This Office, after a careful evaluation of the records of the application, concurs with the findings and recommendations of the RCLUPPI V [Investigation] team for the denial of the application on the ground that the subject property has been [placed] under compulsory coverage and a Notice of Acquisition was already issued by the MARO of Daet, Camarines Norte.</b> Moreover, the contention/justification of the Deputized Zoning Administrator when he was requested to explain why the properties are in the green [color-coded] in the land use map as stated in his July 7, 1997 letter cannot be given credence by this Office. <b>This is due to the fact that we believe that the built-up area for residential areas provided in the right hand portion of the map (from 258 to 556 has.) or another 258 has. between 1978 and 1982) has long been exhausted.</b> If one will take note, the present residential area of Daet is well beyond the 556 has. limit set for 1982. <b>The Ong property, [therefore], can no longer find any room in the built-up area under the 1978 land use plan.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphases ours.)<br></blockquote>Upholding the findings of the Regional Office, then DAR Secretary Horacio R. Morales, Jr. issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated February 2, 2000 denying petitioners' Application for Exemption under DOJ Opinion No. 44, series of 1990, and directing the Director of DAR Region V "to proceed with the acquisition of the subject landholding in accordance with existing agrarian laws." Secretary Morales's Order contained the following discussion, which we quote:<br><blockquote><b>First, the justification made by Jesus L. Fernandez, Jr., Deputized Zoning Administrator of Daet, Camarines Norte, in his letter dated 7 July 1997, is not sufficient to prove that the subject land is classified as built-up area for residential purposes. It is true that the said agency is the proper forum to certify as to the classification of a parcel of land within their jurisdiction. However, the same must be supported by substantial evidence. The findings of the Regional Director reveal that the built-up area for residential purposes provided in the right hand portion of the Official Land Use Plan of 1978 of the Municipality of Daet has long been exhausted.</b> Thus, the present residential area of Daet is well beyond the 556-hectare limit set for 1982. Therefore, the subject landholding cannot be considered as part of the built-up area reserved for residential purposes. The subject landholding remains agricultural based on the original land use plan in 1978. Being an agricultural land, the subject landholding is within the ambit of RA 6657.<br><br>Second, Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 1994, requires that any application for exemption should be accompanied by a Certification from the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) that the pertinent zoning ordinance has been approved by the Board prior to 15 June 1988. In the case at hand, the original land use plan in 1978 shows that the subject landholding was agricultural in nature. The Deputy Zoning Administrator claims that the subject landholdings became part of the residential built-up area by virtue of an authority indicated in the right hand portion of the land use plan to extend the residential area from 258 hectares in 1980 to 556 hectares in 1982. However, <b>it is not shown that the 1982 land use plan had been similarly approved by the HLURB. No proof has ever been presented that the 1982 land use plan had been approved by the HLURB. Since coverage is the general rule, applicant has the burden of proof that subject property is exempt</b>.<br></blockquote>Acting on petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> then DAR Secretary Hernani A. Braganza issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on June 20, 2002 stating that the opinion of the Deputized Zoning Administrator had insufficient basis and could not prevail over the clear findings of the DAR Regional Director.<br><br>Meanwhile, TCT No. T-4202-A (Certificate of Land Ownership Award No. 00538736)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> was issued to "Nicolasa Imperial, <i>et al</i>." covering 253,263 square meters in Barangay Dogongan, Municipality of Daet, Province of Camarines Norte on October 27, 2000.<br><br>Petitioners appealed the DAR Orders dated February 2, 2000 and June 20, 2002 (the questioned DAR Orders) to the Office of the President for review.<br><br>The records from the Office of the President contained a copy of a document entitled Memorandum for the Executive Secretary from DESLA Manuel G. Gaite, Subject: Appeal of Noel Ong in O.P. Case No. 04-L-500 dated July 29, 2005 and we note the following portion of said memorandum:<br><blockquote>The DZA has positively declared that the subject property is within the reclassified built-up residential areas of the municipality. As far as the coverage of the Municipal Ordinance is concerned, the DZA should have the last say, since it is within its mandate to determine the coverage of the zoning ordinance and therefore has exclusive jurisdiction as far as the issue is concerned. Verification likewise of the records show (Rec. p. 12) that the application is accompanied by a corresponding certification of HLURB Region No. 5, Regional Director, Jesse A. Obligacion that the pertinent Municipal Ordinance No. 4 of Daet, Camarines Norte, has been approved by the HLURB on September 21, 1978, prior to June 15, 1988, the effectivity of the CARP law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>The Office of the President rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on September 5, 2005 signed by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita. The Office of the President declared that the main issue was whether or not the subject property had been reclassified as residential so as to exempt it from Comprehensive Agrarian Report Program (CARP) coverage. The Office of the President found that "[a] closer scrutiny of the facts will reveal that the DAR Secretary concurred with the findings of the DAR Regional Director, who in turn relied on his own <b>belief</b> that the land is agricultural and not otherwise." The Office of the President. reversed and set aside the questioned DAR Orders and approved petitioners' application for clearance, "exempting from CARP coverage the 40.5 hectares property with TCT No. T-17045, situated in Barangay Dogongan, Daet, Camarines Norte."<br><br>We quote below relevant portions of the September 5, 2005 Decision of the Office of the President:<br><blockquote>A careful reading of the map would show that what the DAR Secretaries referred to as having been fully exhausted/allocated, are those actual and original residential areas of the municipality totaling 278.465 hectares, as indicated in colored map. It does not refer to those additional built-up residential areas of the Municipality covered by the Ordinance in the total area of 556.93 hectares pointed out by DZA, which includes the property in question.<br><br><b>Thus, as between the findings of the DAR Regional Director and the DZA, we must favor the expertise of the latter. The determination and classification of land areas within their jurisdiction is rightfully vested in the local government unit concerned, in this case, the Deputy Zoning Administrator of Daet, as approved through municipal ordinance.</b><br><br>Under the foregoing circumstances, the denial of the exemption on the ground that the MARO has already issued a NOTICE OF ACQUISITION in 1994 is flawed. The area having already been reclassified as residential prior to June 1988 (as established by the DAR RCLUPPI V), it cannot be the subject of a Notice of Acquisition which covers only agricultural lands. Perforce, the Notice of Acquisition over the subject properly is <i>void ab initio</i>.<br><br>Finally, the ruling of the DAR Secretary that the application for exemption was belatedly filed in order to defeat CARP coverage of the property is untenable. What invalidated CARP coverage over the subject property is not the application for exemption, but the fact the land in question not being anymore agricultural, is beyond the coverage of CARP, pursuant to Section 4 of R.A; 6657 (Natalia Realty vs. Department of Agrarian Reform, supra).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>In a subsequent Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 3, 2006, the Office of the President resolved the Verified Motion for Intervention with Motion for Reconsideration (of the September 5, 2005 Decision of the Office of the President) filed by Nicolasa O. Imperial, Dario R. Echaluce, Roel I. Robelo, Serafin R. Robelo, Efren R. Robelo, Ronilo S. Agno, Lorena Robelo, Romeo O. Imperial, Nanilon I. Cortez, Joven I. Cortez, and Rodelio O. Imperial (respondents), who raised the following as grounds for reconsideration:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The Decision violates their constitutional rights to due process;<br><br></li><li>The opinion of the Municipal Deputy Zoning Administrator (DZA) of Daet cannot prevail over the expert opinion of the Department of Land Reform on the matter;<br><br></li><li>The application for exemption by the applicants-appellants was a mere afterthought intended merely to defeat the CARP coverage; and<br><br></li><li>There is no proof that prior to the alleged reclassification of the subject land, a public hearing was conducted and the required percentage of the total agricultural land area at the time of the passage of the ordinance was considered.<br></li></ol></blockquote>The Office of the President denied the Motion for Intervention and Reconsideration and reaffirmed its earlier Decision, reasoning as follows:<br><blockquote>While it is true that movants were not made parties to the case, this was so because <b>applicants Ong, et al. filed their application for exemption from CARP coverage pursuant to DOJ Opinion No. 44, Series of 1990, as implemented by DAR Administrative Order No. 06, Series of 1994. The application for exemption was premised on the doctrine (as affirmed by DOJ Opinion No. 44) that a land already converted to residential prior to June 15, 1988 cannot be the subject of a Notice of Acquisition since the subject land, being residential and not agricultural, is already beyond the coverage of CARP</b>. (Natalia Realty vs. DAR, 225 SCRA 278) Hence, <b>the application was not adversarial against any other parties, but personal to the landowner-petitioner</b>.<br><br>Nevertheless, the implementation of DAR A.O. No. 6, series of 1994, puts in place a process of application and notice so that all parties concerned are fully aware of the pending application for exemption clearance.<br><br>Upon receipt of an application for exemption pursuant to DOJ Opinion No. 44, the DAR Regional Center for Land Use, Policy, Planning and Implementation (RCLUPPI) field unit conducts an ocular inspection. In that inspection, the field unit interviews and informs the tenants/farmers if any, that such an application is pending.<br><br>Further, the RCLUPPI unit files a detailed report, indicating therein the number of farmer-beneficiaries affected and whether or not a Deed of Undertaking was executed by the landowner to pay disturbance compensation to affected tenants. In this case, appellants Ong et al. executed a Deed of Undertaking dated January 11, 1997, in favor of tenants Nicolasa vda. De Imperial, Efren Robelo and Julio Jamito. The RCLUPPI Region V also reported that there were only three tenants at the time of the inspection. Hence, the rest of the intervenors-movants herein are either children or relatives of the above-named three tenants of the Ong family.<br><br><b>It is therefore incorrect to say that movants-intervenors were totally unaware of the proceedings until they received the questioned Decision on September 26, 2005. Thus, we hold that there was reasonable opportunity to intervene since the application was filed in 1996.</b> During this period, the proceedings were elevated from the Regional to Department level, and finally on appeal to this Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphases added, citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Unsatisfied, respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 seeking to nullify and set aside the Decision dated September 5, 2005 and the Order dated March 3, 2006, both of the Office of the President. This was docketed as CA-G.R. SP. No. 93941.<br><br><b>RULING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS</b><br><br>In its November 30, 2010 Decision, the Court of Appeals ruled "that the Office of the President committed reversible error in reversing the Orders of the DAR Secretaries and in approving [petitioners'] Application for Exemption of their property from the CARP." The Court of Appeals ratiocinated as follows:<br><blockquote>While WE agree with the Office of the President that lands which have been reclassified as residential prior to June 15, 1988 [cannot] be the subject of compulsory acquisition by the DAR for its agrarian reform program, WE are not inclined to sustain its ruling approving the application for clearance of respondents exempting from CARP coverage the subject landholding <b>because of respondents' failure to comply with the requirements for such exemption</b>.<br><br>A careful scrutiny of the record of this case reveals that the Office of the President failed to judiciously examine the supporting documents submitted by respondents in their application for exemption.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As can be gleaned from [DAR Administrative Order No. 6, series of 1994, or the "Guidelines for the Issuance of Exemption Clearances based on Sec. 3(c) of RA 6657 and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion No. 44, Series of 1990"], an application for exemption from the coverage of the CARP must be accompanied by a certification from the HLURB that the pertinent zoning ordinance has been approved by the Board prior to June 15, 1988 (the date of effectivity of the CARL). <b>In the instant case, respondents did file an accompanying Certification from the HLURB. However, a meticulous perusal of the Certification issued by the HLURB as compared with the one issued by the Deputized Zoning Ordinance shows glaring inconsistencies which cast doubt as to the land use classification of respondents' landholding. x x x.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>The glaring inconsistency and discrepancy in the foregoing certifications are readily apparent. According to the Deputized Zoning Administrator of Daet, Camarines Norte, the Zoning Ordinance reclassifying the landholding of respondents into residential land was passed in 1980, however, in the Certification of the HLURB the said "Town Plan and Zoning Ordinance of Daet, Camarines Norte was approved by the Housing and Land Regulatory Board, then Human Settlements Regulatory Commission on September 21, 1978." Obviously, the approved Zoning Ordinance being referred to in the Certification of the HLURB was not Zoning Ordinance No. 4, Series of 1980 mentioned by the Deputized Zoning Administrator in his Certification. For how could the HLURB [approve] on September 21, 1978 a town plan and zoning ordinance still to be passed in 1980. Certainly, the HLURB could not approve a zoning ordinance which was not yet existing at the time of the passage of the approval. The HLURB must have been referring to another town plan and zoning ordinance of Daet, Camarines Norte which was passed in 1978 and not in 1980. This can be inferred from the letter of Deputized Zoning Administrator Jesus L. Fernandez, Jr. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>If what was approved by the HLURB on September 21, 1978 was the 1978 original land use plan of Daet, Camarines Norte [t]hen the inescapable conclusion would be that subject landholding of respondents is not exempt from CARP coverage since the same was classified as agricultural in nature as found by the then DAR Secretary Horacio R. Morales, Jr. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Even assuming for the sake of argument, that a zoning ordinance was enacted after 1978, particularly in 1980 or 1982, reclassifying respondents' landholding from agricultural to non-agricultural or residential, still OUR conclusion would be the same since no proof was ever presented that the later zoning ordinance was approved by the HLURB.

Petitioners contend that Daet, Camarines Norte was among the first' municipalities which formulated its Comprehensive Development Plan approved by NCCTHPZ without a zoning ordinance and that "it was only in 1980 that the Sangguniang Bayan of Daet adopted their zoning ordinance based on their previously approved Land Use Plan."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contend that they are deemed to have substantially complied with the requirements of Administrative Order No. 6, series of 1994, particularly with respect to the HLURB certification that the pertinent zoning ordinance must have been approved by the board prior to June 15, 1988.

Petitioners allege that given the reclassification of the subject property to residential pursuant to Ordinance No. 04, series of 1980, based on the 1978 approved Town Plan, the same can no longer be reverted to agricultural.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals, in giving due course to respondents' intervention, reasoned that this Court has in the past allowed a party to intervene even beyond the period prescribed by the Rules, as "the allowance or disallowance of a motion for intervention rests on the sound discretion of the court after consideration of the appropriate circumstances."

A sound cannon of statutory construction is that a statute operates prospectively only and never retroactively, unless the legislative intent to the contrary is made manifest either by the express terms of the statute or by necessary implication. Article 4 of the Civil Code provides that: "Laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided." Hence, in order that a law may have retroactive effect, it is necessary that an express provision to this effect be made in the law, otherwise nothing should be understood which is not embodied in the law. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that a law is a rule established to guide our actions without no binding effect until it is enacted, wherefore, it has no application to past times but only to future time, and that is why it is said that the law looks to the future only and has no retroactive effect unless the legislator may have formally given that effect to some legal provisions.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Since the subject property had been reclassified as residential land by virtue of Resolution No. 29-A dated July 9, 1972, it is no longer agricultural land by the time the CARL took effect on June 15, 1988 and is, therefore, exempt from the CARP.</b> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>In <i>Buklod</i>, the Court cited previous decisions with the same conclusion, and we quote the relevant points of discussion below:<br><blockquote>This is not the first time that the Court made such a ruling.<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><b>Indeed, lands not devoted to agricultural activity are outside the coverage of CARL.

It was therefore error to include the undeveloped portions of the Antipolo Hills Subdivision within, the coverage of CARL.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Secretary of Justice, responding to a query by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, noted in an Opinion that lands covered by Presidential Proclamation No. 1637, <i>inter alia</i>, of which the NATALIA lands are part, having been reserved for townsite purposes "to be developed as human settlements by the proper land and housing agency," are "not deemed 'agricultural lands' within the meaning and intent of Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 6657." Not being deemed "agricultural lands," they are outside the coverage of CARL. x x x.<br></blockquote>That the land in the <i>Natalia Realty case</i> was reclassified as residential by a presidential proclamation, while the subject property herein was reclassified as residential by a local ordinance, will not preclude the application of the ruling of this Court in the former to the latter. <b>The operative fact that places a parcel of land beyond the ambit of the CARL is its valid reclassification from agricultural to non-agricultural prior to the effectivity of the CARL on June 15, 1988, not by how or whose authority it was reclassified.</b><br><br>In <i>Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (Pasong Bay abas case)</i>, the Court made the following findings:<br><blockquote>Under Section 3(c) of Rep. Act No. 6657, agricultural lands refer to lands devoted to agriculture as conferred in the said law and not classified as industrial land. Agricultural lands are only those lands which are arable or suitable lands that do not include commercial, industrial and residential lands. Section 4(e) of the law provides that it covers all private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that can be raised thereon. Rep. Act No. 6657 took effect only on June 15, 1988. <b>But long before the law tools effect, the property subject of the suit had already been reclassified and converted from agricultural to non-agricultural or residential land by the following administrative agencies:</b> (a) the Bureau of Lands, when it approved the subdivision plan of the property consisting of 728 subdivision lots; (b) the National Planning Commission which approved the subdivision plan subdivided by the LDC/CAI for the development of the property into a low-cost housing project; <b>(c) the Municipal Council of <i>Carmona, Cavite, when it approved Kapasiyahang Blg. 30</i> on May 30, 1976</b>; (d) Agrarian Reform Minister Conrado F. Estrella, on July 3, 1979, when he granted the application of the respondent for the development of the Hakone Housing Project with an area of 35.80 hectares upon the recommendation of the Agrarian Reform Team, Regional Director of Region IV, which found, after verification and investigation, that the property was not covered by P.D. No. 27, it being untenanted and not devoted to the production of <i>palay</i>/or corn and that the property was suitable for conversion to residential subdivision; (e) by the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development; (f) the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission which issued a location clearance, development permit, Certificate of Inspection and License to Sell to the LDC/private respondent; and, (g) the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board which also issued to the respondent CAI/LDC a license to sell the subdivision lots. xxx.<br></blockquote>Noticeably, there were several government agencies which reclassified and converted the property from agricultural to non-agricultural in the <i>Pasong Bayabas case</i>. The CARL though does not specify which specific government agency should have done the reclassification. To be exempt from CARP, all that is needed is one valid reclassification of the land from agricultural to non-agricultural by a duly authorized government agency before June 15, 1988, when the CARL took effect. All similar actions as regards the land subsequently rendered by other government agencies shall merely serve as confirmation of the reclassification. The Court actually recognized in the <i>Pasong Bayabas case</i> the power of the local government to convert or reclassify lands through a zoning ordinance:<br><blockquote>Section 3 of Rep. Act No. 2264, amending the Local Government Code, specifically empowers municipal and/or city councils to adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances or regulations in consultation with the National Planning Commission. A zoning ordinance prescribes, defines, and apportions a given political subdivision into specific land uses as present and future projection of needs. The power of the local government to convert or reclassify lands to residential lands to non-agricultural lands reclassified is not subject to the approval of the Department of Agrarian Reform. Section 65 of Rep. Act No. 6657 relied upon by the petitioner applies only to applications by the landlord or the beneficiary for the conversion of lands previously placed under the agrarian reform law after the lapse of five years from its award. It does not apply to agricultural lands already converted as residential lands prior to the passage of Rep. Act No. 6657. xxx.<br></blockquote>At the very beginning of <i>Junio v. Garilao</i>, the Court already declared that:<br><blockquote>Lands already classified and identified as commercial, industrial or residential before June 15, 1988 — the date of effectivity of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) — are outside the coverage of this law. Therefore, they no longer need any conversion clearance from the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR).<br></blockquote>The Court then proceeded to uphold the authority of the City Council of Bacolod to reclassify as residential a parcel of land through Resolution No. 5153-A, series of 1976. The reclassification was later affirmed by the HSRC. Resultantly, the Court sustained the DAR Order dated September 13, 1994, exempting the same parcel of land from CARP Coverage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Therefore, the Office of the President was correct when it ruled that the DAR's "denial of the exemption on the ground that the MARO [had] already issued a NOTICE OF ACQUISITION in 1994 is flawed" and that "[the] area having already been reclassified as residential prior to June 1988 (as established by the DAR RCLUPPI V), it cannot be the subject of a Notice of Acquisition which covers only agricultural lands." The Office of the President likewise correctly held that "the Notice of Acquisition over the subject property is <i>void ab initio</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition.

Pertinent portions of the letter are quoted below:<br><br>As to your first contention, it is clear in the language of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Luz Farms vs. Hon. Secretary of DAR</i> (G.R. No. 86889, 04 December 1990) that the property must be actually, directly and exclusively used for livestock, poultry and swine raising purposes. Be it noted that you failed to comply with the requirement as provided under A.O. 9 series 1993. Not only that, in your sworn statement on agricultural landholding mandated by E.O. 229 dated February 8, 1988, you voluntarily and freely confirmed to the effect that the entire 40.5645 hectares, its actual land use is for coconut production x x x. If your property is actually utilized for grazing purpose, why failed to check box which correspond to it (<i>sic</i>)? And, this fact is further supported by Tax Declaration No. 017-214 which the Assessor of Daet, Cams. Norte who conducted field investigation in said property evidently classified the same as coconut land rather than a grazing land x x x.<br><br>As to your second contention, my answer is this, the property concerned is definitely covered by [the] CARL program based on the prioritized phasing. Under Section 6 of RA 6657, the retention area for the landowner is 5.0000 hectares. Considering the excess and in consonant to (<i>sic</i>) Phase II-B which started on the 6<sup>th</sup> year from June 15, 1988 and to be completed on the 4<sup>th</sup> year (1994-1998) which I quote: Private agricultural land with area above the retention limit up to 24 hectares. Be it observed that the excess area is 8.5215 hectares, hence, covered.<br><br>And, as to your last contention, my opinion is this, as long as there is no specific provision of law to this effect to support your contention, and there is no clear-cut guidelines from our office to defer its implementation, I may consider your allegation a mere speculation or an assumption. Otherwise, 1 will be liable or answerable to my office. Kindly understand my situation being a subordinate.
