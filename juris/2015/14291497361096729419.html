Then in the evening of June 19, 2008, a team of PDEA officers was formed to conduct a buy-bust operation [against Dela Peña].&nbsp; The team was composed of ten PDEA members including IO2 David Mark Maramba as team leader, [IO1 Kintanar] and [IO1 Rallos].&nbsp; IO1 Kintanar, who was tasked [to act] as poseur-buyer, was given three pieces of one hundred peso (Php100.00) bills as buy-bust money bearing serial numbers PQ242526, YF280219 and TV375522 which were all pre-marked with [IO1] Kintanar’s initials “FK” at the lower right front portion of the bills.&nbsp; IO1 Kintanar then prepared an Authority to Operate [for the conduct of the] operation.<br><br>Thereafter, the buy-bust team, accompanied by their confidential informant, proceeded to Barangay Sawang Calero.&nbsp; Upon their arrival there, the team searched for [Dela Peña] in the area.&nbsp; When they finally found him standing along the road with [Delima], IO1 Kintanar and the confidential informant approached him while the rest of the members strategically positioned themselves where, from their vantage point, they could clearly see the transaction.<br><br>The informant and IO1 Kintanar informed [Dela Peña] of their intention to buy <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; IO1 Kintanar handed the marked money to Dela Pe[ñ]a, who, in turn, handed a small sachet of suspected <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Delima, who was beside [Dela Peña], also showed a sachet of suspected <i>shabu</i> to IO1 Kintanar but the latter ignored him.&nbsp; Immediately, IO1 Kintanar executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his head, indicating that the sale was consummated.<br><br>The rest of the team members immediately approached the group and arrested [Dela Peña and Delima].&nbsp; IO1 Kintanar seized from Dela Pe[ñ]a the buy-bust money and four (4) sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, [IO1 Rallos, who] arrested Delima x x x recovered from [the latter] a small sachet of <i>shabu </i>which he turned over to IO1 Kintanar.&nbsp; The buy-bust team apprised the duo of their constitutional rights and thereafter brought them, together with the confiscated items, to the PDEA-7 office where the said items were marked by IO1 Kintanar.&nbsp; The plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> which was the subject of the sale, was marked “DSDP-BB 6/19/08” whereas the four sachets recovered from Dela Pe[ñ]a were marked as “DSDP-01 6/19/08” to “DSDP-04 6/19/08”, respectively.&nbsp; The one small sachet seized from Delima was likewise marked as “DCD-01 6/19/08”.&nbsp; The confiscated items were photographed, recorded in the blotter and listed in a Certificate of Inventory in the presence of [Dela Peña and Delima] and was duly witnessed and signed by Barangay Captain Jerome B. Lim of Barangay Sta. Cruz and media representative Chito O. Aragon.<br><br>x x x At 1:50 in the afternoon of the following day, IO1 Kintanar delivered the laboratory request and the confiscated plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu </i>to the crime laboratory which was received by PO3 El Abesia.&nbsp; On the same day, Forensic Chemist Rendielyn L. Sahagun issued Chemistry Report No. D-663-2008 stating that the subject six plastic sachets with a total weight of 0.12 gram of white crystalline substance marked as “DSDP-BB 6/19/08”, “DSDP-01 6/19/08”, “DSDP-02 6/19/08”, “DSDP-03 6/19/08”, “DSDP-04 6/19/08” and “DCD-01 6/19/08”, respectively, tested positive for <i>Methamphetamine Hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>The presentation as witness of Rendielyn L.
