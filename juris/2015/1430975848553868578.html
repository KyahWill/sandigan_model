				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To prove serious business losses, employers must present in evidence financial statements showing the net losses suffered by the business within a sufficient period of time.&nbsp; Generally, it cannot be based on a single financial statement showing losses.&nbsp; Absent this proof, employers closing their businesses must pay the dismissed employees separation pay equivalent to one-month pay or to at least one-half-month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals’ Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> granting Ricardo Ambos, Russell Ambos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Benjamin Putian’s Petition for Certiorari.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals found that G.J.T. Rebuilders Machine Shop (G.J.T. Rebuilders) failed to prove its alleged serious business losses.&nbsp; Thus, when it closed its establishment on December 15, 1997, G.J.T. Rebuilders should have paid the affected employees separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>G.J.T. Rebuilders is a single proprietorship owned by the Spouses Godofredo and Juliana Trillana (Trillana spouses).&nbsp; It was engaged in steel works and metal fabrication, employing Ricardo Ambos (Ricardo), Russell Ambos (Russell), and Benjamin Putian (Benjamin) as machinists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>G.J.T. Rebuilders rented space in the Far East Asia (FEA) Building in Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, which served as the site of its machine shop.&nbsp; On September 8, 1996, a fire partially destroyed the FEA Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Due to the damage sustained by the building, its owner notified its tenants to vacate their rented units by the end of September 1996 “to avoid any unforeseen accidents which may arise due to the damage.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Despite the building owner’s notice to vacate, G.J.T. Rebuilders continued its business in the condemned building.&nbsp; When the building owner finally refused to accommodate it, G.J.T. Rebuilders left its rented space and closed the machine shop on December 15, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; It then filed an Affidavit of Closure before the Department of Labor and Employment on February 16, 1998 and a sworn application to retire its business operations before the Mandaluyong City Treasurer’s Office on February 25, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Having lost their employment without receiving separation pay, Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal before the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; They prayed for payment of allowance, separation pay, and attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In their defense, G.J.T. Rebuilders and the Trillana spouses argued that G.J.T. Rebuilders suffered serious business losses and financial reverses, forcing it to close its machine shop.&nbsp; Therefore, Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin were not entitled to separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Labor Arbiter Facundo L. Leda (Labor Arbiter Leda) decided the Complaint, finding no convincing proof of G.J.T. Rebuilders’ alleged serious business losses.&nbsp; Labor Arbiter Leda, in the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated December 28, 1999, found that Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin were entitled to separation pay under Article 283 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, they were awarded attorney’s fees, having been constrained to litigate their claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that G.J.T. Rebuilders’ closure was due to serious business losses, Labor Arbiter Leda held that the employees affected were still entitled to separation pay “based on social justice and equity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>G.J.T. Rebuilders and the Trillana spouses appealed Labor Arbiter Leda’s Decision before the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In contrast with the Labor Arbiter’s finding, the National Labor Relations Commission found G.J.T. Rebuilders to have suffered serious business losses.&nbsp; Because of the fire that destroyed the building where G.J.T. Rebuilders was renting space, the demand for its services allegedly declined as “no same customer would dare to entrust machine works to be done for them in a machine shop lying in a ruined and condemned building.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The National Labor Relations Commission then concluded that the fire “proximately caused”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> G.J.T. Rebuilders’ serious business losses, with its financial statement for the fiscal year 1997 showing a net loss of P316,210.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated January 25, 2001, the National Labor Relations Commission vacated and set aside Labor Arbiter Leda’s Decision and dismissed the Complaint for lack of merit.&nbsp; Since the Commission found that G.J.T. Rebuilders ceased operations due to serious business losses, it held that G.J.T. Rebuilders and the Trillana spouses need not pay Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin separation pay.<br><br>Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the National Labor Relations Commission denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated March 5, 2001.<br><br>Because of the alleged grave abuse of discretion of the National Labor Relations Commission, a Petition for Certiorari was filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals reversed the National Labor Relations Commission’s Decision, agreeing with Labor Arbiter Leda that G.J.T. Rebuilders failed to prove its alleged serious business losses.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals conceded that G.J.T. Rebuilders had to close the machine shop for reasons connected with the fire that partially destroyed the building where it was renting space.&nbsp; Nevertheless, G.J.T. Rebuilders continued its business for more than one year after the fire.&nbsp; Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, G.J.T. Rebuilders did not suffer from serious business losses but closed the machine shop to prevent losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>With respect to G.J.T. Rebuilders’ financial statement showing an alleged net loss in 1997, the Court of Appeals refused to admit it in evidence since it was not subscribed under oath by the Certified Public Accountant who prepared it.&nbsp; According to the Court of Appeals, the financial statement was subscribed under oath only after G.J.T. Rebuilders had submitted it to Labor Arbiter Leda as an annex to its Motion to re-open proceedings and to submit additional evidence.&nbsp; Thus, the Court of Appeals gave G.J.T. Rebuilders’ financial statement “scant consideration.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated January 17, 2006, the Court of Appeals granted the Petition for Certiorari, vacating and setting aside the National Labor Relations Commission’s Decision.&nbsp; It reinstated Labor Arbiter Leda’s Decision dated December 28, 1999.<br><br>G.J.T. Rebuilders and the Trillana spouses filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated August 11, 2006.<br><br>Petitioners G.J.T. Rebuilders and the Trillana spouses filed before this court a Petition for Review on Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents Ricardo, Russell, and Benjamin commented<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> on the Petition, after which petitioners filed a Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In their Petition for Review on Certiorari, petitioners maintain that G.J.T. Rebuilders suffered serious business losses as evidenced by its financial statement covering the years 1996 and 1997.&nbsp; Petitioners admit that the financial statement was belatedly subscribed under oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, “the credibility or veracity of the entries”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> in the financial statement was not affected since the Bureau of Internal Revenue received the same unsubscribed financial statement when G.J.T. Rebuilders allegedly filed its income tax return on April 15, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Considering that petitioners sufficiently proved G.J.T. Rebuilders’ serious business losses, petitioners argue that respondents are not entitled to separation pay.<br><br>As for respondents, they contend that G.J.T. Rebuilders failed to prove its alleged serious business losses.&nbsp; They argue that the financial statement showing a net loss for the year 1997 was not credible, having been belatedly subscribed under oath by the Certified Public Accountant who prepared it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>With no credible proof of G.J.T. Rebuilders’ supposed serious business losses, respondents argue that petitioners must pay them separation pay under Article 283 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The issue for our resolution is whether petitioners sufficiently proved that G.J.T. Rebuilders suffered from serious business losses.<br><br>This petition should be denied.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><b>G.J.T. Rebuilders must pay respondents<br>their separation pay for failure to prove <br>its alleged serious business losses</b><br><br>Article 283 of the Labor Code allows an employer to dismiss an employee due to the cessation of operation or closure of its establishment or undertaking, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 283. Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel</b>. – The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Department of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof.&nbsp; In case of termination due to installation of labor saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or to at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.</blockquote><br>The decision to close one’s business is a management prerogative that courts cannot interfere with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Employers can “lawfully close shop at anytime,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> even for reasons of their own.&nbsp; “Just as no law forces anyone to go into business, no law can compel anybody to continue in it.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Mac Adams Metal Engineering Workers Union-Independent v. Mac Adams Metal Engineering,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>It would indeed be stretching the intent and spirit of the law if [courts] were to unjustly interfere with the management’s prerogative to close or cease its business operations just because [the] business operation or undertaking is not suffering from any loss or simply to provide the workers continued employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>However, despite this management prerogative, employers closing their businesses must pay the affected workers separation pay equivalent to one-month pay or to at least one-half-month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; The reason is that an employee dismissed, even for an authorized cause, loses his or her means of livelihood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The only time employers are not compelled to pay separation pay is when they closed their establishments or undertaking due to serious business losses or financial reverses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Serious business losses are substantial losses, not <i>de minimis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; “Losses” means that the business must have operated at a loss for a period of time for the employer “to [have] perceived objectively and in good faith”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that the business’ financial standing is unlikely to improve in the future.<br><br>The burden of proving serious business losses is with the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The employer must show losses on the basis of financial statements covering a sufficient period of time.&nbsp; The period covered must be sufficient for the National Labor Relations Commission and this court to appreciate the nature and vagaries of the business.<br><br>In <i>North Davao Mining Corporation v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> North Davao Mining Corporation presented in evidence financial statements showing a continuing pattern of loss from 1988 until its closure in 1992.&nbsp; The company suffered net losses averaging P3 billion a year, with an aggregate loss of P20 billion by the time of its closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; This court found that North Davao suffered serious business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In <i>Manatad v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation presented in evidence financial statements showing a continuing pattern of loss from 1995 to 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; By 2000, the corporation suffered an aggregate loss of P2.169 billion, constraining it to retrench some of its employees.&nbsp; This court held that the Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation was “fully justified in implementing a retrenchment program since it was undergoing business reverses, not only for a single fiscal year, but for several years prior to and even after the program.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In <i>LVN Pictures Employees and Workers Association (NLU) v. LVN Pictures, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> a case G.J.T. Rebuilders cited, LVN Pictures, Inc. presented in evidence financial statements showing a continuing pattern of loss from 1957 to 1961.&nbsp; By the time the corporation closed its business, it had suffered an aggregate loss of P1,560,985.14.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; This court found that LVN Pictures, Inc. suffered serious business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Aside from the obligation to pay separation pay, employers must comply with the notice requirement under Article 283 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; Employers must serve a written notice on the affected employees and on the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month before the intended date of closure.&nbsp; Failure to comply with this requirement renders the employer liable for nominal damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>We uphold G.J.T. Rebuilders’ decision to close its establishment as a valid exercise of its management prerogative.&nbsp; G.J.T. Rebuilders closed its machine shop, believing that its “former customers . . . seriously doubted [its] capacity . . . to perform the same quality [of service]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> after the fire had partially damaged the building where it was renting space.<br><br>Nevertheless, we find that G.J.T. Rebuilders failed to sufficiently prove its alleged serious business losses.<br><br>The financial statement G.J.T. Rebuilders submitted in evidence covers the fiscal years 1996 and 1997.&nbsp; Based on the financial statement, G.J.T. Rebuilders earned a net income of P61,157.00 in 1996 and incurred a net loss of P316,210.00 in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>We find the two-year period covered by the financial statement insufficient for G.J.T. Rebuilders to have objectively perceived that the business would not recover from the loss.&nbsp; Unlike in <i>North Davao Mining Corporation, Manatad, and LVN Pictures Employees and Workers Association (NLU)</i>, no continuing pattern of loss within a sufficient period of time is present in this case.&nbsp; In fact, in one of the two fiscal years covered by the financial statement presented in evidence, G.J.T. Rebuilders earned a net income.&nbsp; We, therefore, agree with the Labor Arbiter and the Court of Appeals that G.J.T. Rebuilders closed its machine shop to prevent losses, not because of serious business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Considering that G.J.T. Rebuilders failed to prove its alleged serious business losses, it must pay respondents their separation pay equivalent to one-month pay or at least one-half-month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; In computing the period of service, a fraction of at least six months is considered a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Ricardo began working as a machinist on February 9, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Since he last worked for G.J.T.

Rebuilders on December 15, 1997, he worked a total of five years, three months, and 14 days.&nbsp; This period is rounded off to five years, not six years, since the last three months and 14 days are less than the six months required to be considered a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Russell had a daily salary of P225.00 and worked 13 days a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; His one-month pay, therefore, is equal to P2,925.00.&nbsp; On the other hand, his one-half-month pay for every year of service is equal to P7,312.50.&nbsp; The latter amount being higher, Russell must receive P7,312.50 as separation pay.<br><br>As for Benjamin, he began working as a machinist on February 1, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Since he last worked for G.J.T.
