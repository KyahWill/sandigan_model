The lower courts should have dismissed the case in view of the arbitration clause in the agreement and considering that “[Republic Act No. 876] explicitly confines the court’s authority only to pass upon the issue of whether there is [an] agreement . . . providing for arbitration.&nbsp; In the affirmative, the statute ordains that the court shall issue an order ‘summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Moreover, “the stipulations in said Agreement are part and parcel of the conditions in the bond.&nbsp;
