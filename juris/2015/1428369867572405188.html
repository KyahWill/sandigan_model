Aguilar.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, in the affidavit of Candelaria S. Aguilar (Exhibit 2) she expressly announced under oath that Alfredo and she have no issue and that she is the sole heir to the estate of Alfredo is (sic) concrete proof that plaintiff herein was never a son by consanguinity nor a legally adopted one of the deceased spouses Alfredo and Candelaria Aguilar.<br><br>This being the case, Petitioner is not deemed vested with sufficient interest in this action to be considered qualified or entitled to the issuance of the writ of mandatory injunction and damages prayed for.<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing plaintiff’s complaint with cost.<br><br>The counterclaim of the defendant is likewise dismissed for lack of legal basis.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Petitioner filed an appeal with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Docketed as CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 64229, the appeal essentially argued that petitioner is indeed the Aguilar spouses’ son; that under Article 172 of the Family Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> an admission of legitimate filiation in a public document or a private handwritten instrument signed by the parent concerned constitutes proof of filiation; that through the documentary evidence presented, petitioner has shown that he is the legitimate biological son of the Aguilar spouses and the sole heir to their estate.&nbsp; He argued that he cannot present his Certificate of Live Birth as all the records covering the period 1945-1946<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Local Civil Registry of Bacolod City were destroyed as shown by Exhibits “Q” to “Q-3”; for this reason, he presented the foregoing documentary evidence to prove his relationship to the Aguilar spouses.&nbsp; Petitioner made particular reference to, among others, Alfredo Aguilar’s SSS Form E-1 (Exhibit “G”), arguing that the same was made under oath and thus sufficient under Article 172 of the Family Code to establish that he is a child and heir of the Aguilar spouses.&nbsp; Finally, petitioner questioned the trial court’s reliance upon Candelaria Siasat-Aguilar’s affidavit (Exhibit “2”) attesting that she and Alfredo have no children and that she is the sole heir to the estate of Alfredo, when such piece of evidence has been discarded by the trial court in a previous Order dated April 1, 1998, stating thus:<br><br><blockquote>Except for defendant’s Exhibit “2”, all other Exhibits, Exhibits “1”, “3”, “4” and “5”, together with their submarkings, are all admitted in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>On August 30, 2006, the CA issued the assailed Decision affirming the trial court’s August 17, 1999 Decision, pronouncing thus:<br><br><blockquote>The exhibits relied upon by plaintiff-appellant to establish his filiation with the deceased spouses Aguilar deserve scant consideration by this Court.&nbsp; The Elementary School Permanent Record of plaintiff-appellant cannot be considered as proof of filiation.&nbsp; As enunciated by the Supreme Court in the case of Reyes vs. Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA 439:<br><blockquote>“Student record or other writing not signed by alleged father do not constitute evidence of filiation.”<br></blockquote><br>As regards the Income Tax Return of plaintiff-appellant filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, WE hold that it cannot be considered as evidence of filiation.&nbsp; As stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Labagala vs. Santiago, 371 SCRA 360:<br><br>“A baptismal certificate, a private document is not conclusive proof of filiation.&nbsp; More so are the entries made in an income tax return, which only shows that income tax has been paid and the amount thereof.”<br><br>With respect to the Certificate of Marriage x x x wherein it is shown that the parents of the former are Alfredo and Candelaria Siasat Aguilar does not prove filiation.&nbsp; The Highest Tribunal declared that a marriage contract not signed by the alleged father of bride is not competent evidence of filiation nor is a marriage contract recognition in a public instrument.<br><br>The rest of the exhibits offered x x x, except the Social Security Form E-1 (Exhibit “G”) and the Information Sheet of Employment of Alfredo Aguilar (Exhibit “L”), allegedly tend to establish that plaintiff-appellant has been and is presently known as Rodolfo Siasat Aguilar and he has been bearing the surname of his alleged parents.<br><br>WE cannot sustain plaintiff-appellant’s argument.&nbsp; Use of a family surname certainly does not establish pedigree.<br><br>Insofar as the SSS Form E-1 and Information Sheet of Employment of Alfredo Aguilar are concerned, WE cannot accept them as sufficient proof to establish and prove the filiation of plaintiff-appellant to the deceased Aguilar spouses.&nbsp; While the former is a public instrument and the latter bears the signature of Alfredo Aguilar, they do not constitute clear and convincing evidence to show filiation based on open and continuous possession of the status of a legitimate child.&nbsp; Filiation is a serious matter that must be resolved according to the requirements of the law.<br><br>All told, plaintiff-appellant’s evidence failed to hurdle the “high standard of proof” required for the success of an action to establish one’s legitimate filiation when relying upon the provisions regarding open and continuous possession or any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws.<br><br>Having resolved that plaintiff-appellant is not an heir of the deceased spouses Aguilar, thereby negating his right to demand the delivery of the subject TCTs in his favor, this Court cannot grant the writ of mandatory injunction being prayed for.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the present case, plaintiff-appellant failed to show that he has a clear and unmistakable right that has been violated.&nbsp; Neither had he shown permanent and urgent necessity for the issuance of the writ.<br><br>With respect to the damages prayed for, WE sustain the trial court in denying the same.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that plaintiff-appellant failed to show his clear right over the subject parcels of land so that he has not sustained any damage by reason of the withholding of the TCTs from him, there is no clear testimony on the anguish or anxiety he allegedly suffered as a result thereof.&nbsp; Well entrenched in law and jurisprudence is the principle that the grant of moral damages is expressly allowed by law in instances where proofs of the mental anguish, serious anxiety and moral shock were shown.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, in line with the foregoing disquisition, the appeal is hereby DENIED.&nbsp; The impugned Decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED IN TOTO.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but in a December 20, 2011 Resolution, the CA held its ground.&nbsp; Hence, the present Petition.<br><br><b><center>Issues<br></center></b><br>In an August 28, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> this Court resolved to give due course to the Petition, which raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>In issuing the assailed DECISION affirming in toto the Decision of RTC Branch 49, Bacolod City, and the Resolution denying petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration, the Honorable Court of Appeals committed reversible error [in] not taking into consideration petitioner’s Exhibit “G” (SSS E-1 acknowledged and notarized before a notary public, executed by Alfredo Aguilar, recognizing the petitioner as his son) as public document that satisfies the requirement of Article 172 of the [Family] Code in the establishment of the legitimate filiation of the petitioner with his father, Alfredo Aguilar.<br><br>The herein [P]etition raises the issue of pure question of law with respect to the application of Article 172 of the Family Code particularly [paragraph] 3 thereof in conjunction with Section 19 and Section 23, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court relating to public document which is substantial enough to merit consideration of this Honorable Court as it will enrich jurisprudence and forestall future litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In his Petition and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> seeking to reverse and set aside the assailed CA dispositions and praying that judgment be rendered ordering respondent to surrender the owner’s duplicates of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-25896 and T-(15462) 1070, petitioner argues that Alfredo Aguilar’s SSS Form E-1 (Exhibit “G”) satisfies the requirement for proof of filiation and relationship to the Aguilar spouses under Article 172 of the Family Code.&nbsp; Petitioner contends that said SSS Form E-1 is a declaration under oath by his father, Alfredo Aguilar, of his status as the latter’s son; this recognition should be accorded more weight than the presumption of legitimacy, since Article 172 itself declares that said evidence establishes legitimate filiation without need of court action.&nbsp; He adds that in contemplation of law, recognition in a public instrument such as the SSS Form E-1 is the “highest form of recognition which partake (sic) of the nature of a complete act of recognition bestowed upon” him as the son of the late Alfredo Aguilar; that respondent has no personality to impugn his legitimacy and cannot collaterally attack his legitimacy; that the action to impugn his legitimacy has already prescribed pursuant to Articles 170 and 171 of the Family Code;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and that having proved his filiation, mandatory injunction should issue, and an award of damages is in order.<br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In her Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> respondent simply echoes the pronouncements of the CA, adding that the Petition is a mere rehash of the CA appeal which has been passed upon succinctly by the appellate court.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court grants the Petition.<br><br>This Court, speaking in <i>De Jesus v. Estate of Dizon,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> has held that –<br><br><blockquote>The filiation of illegitimate children, like legitimate children, is established by (1) the record of birth appearing in the civil register or a final judgment; or <b>(2) an admission of legitimate filiation in a public document or a private handwritten instrument and signed by the parent concerned. </b> In the absence thereof, filiation shall be proved by (1) the open and continuous possession of the status of a legitimate child; or (2) any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws.&nbsp; <b>The due recognition of an illegitimate child in a record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record, or in any authentic writing is, in itself, a consummated act of acknowledgment of the child, and no further court action is required.&nbsp; In fact, any authentic writing is treated not just a ground for compulsory recognition; it is in itself a voluntary recognition that does not require a separate action for judicial approval.</b> Where, instead, a claim for recognition is predicated on other evidence merely tending to prove paternity, i.e., outside of a record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record or an authentic writing, judicial action within the applicable statute of limitations is essential in order to establish the child’s acknowledgment.<br><br>A scrutiny of the records would show that petitioners were <b>born during the marriage of their parents.</b>&nbsp; The certificates of live birth would also identify Danilo de Jesus as being their father.<br><br><b>There is perhaps no presumption of the law more firmly established and founded on sounder morality and more convincing reason than the presumption that children born in wedlock are legitimate. </b> This presumption indeed becomes conclusive in the absence of proof that there is physical impossibility of access between the spouses during the first 120 days of the 300 days which immediately precedes the birth of the child due to (a) the physical incapacity of the husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife; (b) the fact that the husband and wife are living separately in such a way that sexual intercourse is not possible; or (c) serious illness of the husband, which absolutely prevents sexual intercourse.&nbsp; Quite remarkably, upon the expiration of the periods set forth in Article 170, and in proper cases Article 171, of the Family Code (which took effect on 03 August 1988), the action to impugn the legitimacy of a child would no longer be legally feasible and the status conferred by the presumption becomes fixed and unassailable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, applying the foregoing pronouncement to the instant case, it must be concluded that petitioner – who was born on March 5, 1945, or during the marriage of Alfredo Aguilar and Candelaria Siasat-Aguilar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and before their respective deaths<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> – has sufficiently proved that he is the legitimate issue of the Aguilar spouses.&nbsp; As petitioner correctly argues, Alfredo Aguilar’s SSS Form E-1 (Exhibit “G”) satisfies the requirement for proof of filiation and relationship to the Aguilar spouses under Article 172 of the Family Code; by itself, said document constitutes an “admission of legitimate filiation in a public document or a private handwritten instrument and signed by the parent concerned.”<br><br>Petitioner has shown that he cannot produce his Certificate of Live Birth since all the records covering the period 1945-1946&nbsp; of the Local Civil Registry of Bacolod City were destroyed, which necessitated the introduction of other documentary evidence – particularly Alfredo Aguilar’s SSS Form E-1 (Exhibit “G”) – to prove filiation.&nbsp; It was erroneous for the CA to treat said document as mere proof of open and continuous possession of the status of a legitimate child under the second paragraph of Article 172 of the Family Code; it is evidence of filiation under the first paragraph thereof, the same being an express recognition in a public instrument.<br><br>To repeat what was stated in <i>De Jesus</i>, filiation may be proved by an admission of legitimate filiation in a public document or a private handwritten instrument and signed by the parent concerned, and such due recognition in any authentic writing is, in itself, a consummated act of acknowledgment of the child, and no further court action is required. And, relative to said form of acknowledgment, the Court has further held that:<br><br><blockquote>In view of the pronouncements herein made, the Court sees it fit to adopt the following rules respecting the requirement of affixing the signature of the acknowledging parent in any private handwritten instrument wherein an admission of filiation of a legitimate or illegitimate child is made:<br><br>1)&nbsp; Where the private handwritten instrument is the lone piece of evidence submitted to prove filiation, there should be strict compliance with the requirement that the same must be signed by the acknowledging parent; and<br><br>2)&nbsp; Where the private handwritten instrument is accompanied by other relevant and competent evidence, it suffices that the claim of filiation therein be shown to have been made and handwritten by the acknowledging parent as it is merely corroborative of such other evidence.<br><br>Our laws instruct that the welfare of the child shall be the “paramount consideration” in resolving questions affecting him. Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child of which the Philippines is a signatory is similarly emphatic:<br><blockquote>Article 3<br><br>1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.<br></blockquote><br>It is thus “(t)he policy of the Family Code to liberalize the rule on the investigation of the paternity and filiation of children, especially of illegitimate children x x x.”&nbsp; Too, “(t)he State as <i>parens patriae </i>affords special protection to children from abuse, exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to their development.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This case should not have been so difficult for petitioner if only he obtained a copy of his Certificate of Live Birth from the National Statistics Office (NSO), since the Bacolod City Civil Registry copy thereof was destroyed.&nbsp; He would not have had to go through the trouble of presenting other documentary evidence; the NSO copy would have sufficed.&nbsp; This fact is not lost on petitioner; the Certification dated January 27, 1996 issued by the Bacolod City Civil Registry (Exhibit “Q”) contained just such an advice for petitioner to proceed to the Office of the Civil Registrar General at the NSO in Manila to secure a copy of his Certificate of Live Birth, since for every registered birth in the country, a copy of the Certificate of Live Birth is submitted to said office.<br><br>As to petitioner’s argument that respondent has no personality to impugn his legitimacy and cannot collaterally attack his legitimacy, and that the action to impugn his legitimacy has already prescribed pursuant to Articles 170 and 171 of the Family Code, the Court has held before that –<br><blockquote>Article 263<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> refers to an action to impugn the legitimacy of a child, to assert and prove that a person is not a man’s child by his wife. However, the present case is not one impugning petitioner’s legitimacy. Respondents are asserting not merely that petitioner is not a legitimate child of Jose, but that she is not a child of Jose at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Finally, if petitioner has shown that he is the legitimate issue of the Aguilar spouses, then he is as well heir to the latter’s estate.&nbsp; Respondent is then left with no right to inherit from her aunt Candelaria Siasat-Aguilar’s estate, since succession pertains, in the first place, to the descending direct line.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The August 30, 2006 Decision and December 20, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
