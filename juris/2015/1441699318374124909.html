SP No. 122501, which (a) denied the motion for extension of time to file petition for <i>certiorari</i> and (b) dismissed outright the petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction filed by petitioner for having been filed out of time.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Petitioner Central Bicol State University of Agriculture (CBSUA) is a government educational institution that primarily provides advanced instruction and research in agriculture and allied sciences. It was established under Batas Pambansa Bilang (BP) 198,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 9717.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Under BP 198,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> then Camarines Sur Agricultural College in Pili, Camarines Sur was converted into a state college, known as Camarines Sur State Agricultural College. Thereafter, it was converted into what is now known as CBSUA under RA 9717.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Section 17 of BP 198 granted several real properties to CBSUA, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 17. All buildings, equipment and facilities owned by the Camarines Sur Agricultural College shall become the property of the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College.<br><br><b>All the parcels of land covered by Original Certificate of Title Nos. 1029, 1057, 872 and 697 in the name of the Province of Camarines Sur which had been appropriated by the said province for the use of then Camarines Sur Agricultural School, are hereby transferred to the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College and the Register of Deeds shall issue to the Camarines Sur State College the corresponding Transfer Certificate of Title for the aforementioned parcels of land.</b><br><br>Likewise, such portions of the public domain embraced in Proclamation No. 568 dated March 30, 1935, and Proclamation No. 626 dated October 18, 1933, which had been reserved by the government for agricultural school purposes are hereby transferred to the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College. The Register of Deeds shall issue to the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College the corresponding Title to such lands.</blockquote><br>The foregoing grant was confirmed in Section 18 of RA 9717, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 18. <i>Assets, Liabilities and Personnel.</i> – All assets, real and personal, personnel and records of the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College, as well as liabilities or obligations, are hereby transferred to the University. The positions, rights and security of tenure of faculty members and personnel therein employed under existing laws prior to the conversion into a University shall be respected.<br><br><b>All parcels of land belonging to the government occupied by the Camarines Sur State Agricultural College are hereby declared to be property of the University and shall be titled under that name:</b> <i>Provided</i>, That should the University cease to exist or be abolished or should such parcels of land aforementioned be no longer needed by the University, the same shall revert to the national government.</blockquote><br>Sometime in 1998, respondent Province of Camarines Sur (Province) sought the reconstitution of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 1029 registered in its name,which covered one of the parcels of land granted to CBSUA under the foregoing laws. By virtue thereof, OCT No. 1029 was reconstituted as OCT RO-917.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>Subsequently, the Province caused the subdivision of one of the lots covered by OCT RO-917 into two lots: Lot 3-P-1, with an area of 561,945 square meters, and Lot 3-P-2, with an area of 63,829 square meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Lot 3-P-1 was thereafter covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 41093.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, or sometime in February 2011, armed personnel deployed by the Province allegedly forcibly entered a portion of Lot 3-P-1 (subject land) being occupied by CBSUA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The said armed personnel purportedly destroyed the fences and other structures erected thereon by CBSUA. As a result, the latter was prevented from further utilizing the subject land as pasture area for large cattle which, in turn, were being used for laboratory experiments by the students enrolled in its science and veterinary courses. CBSUA learned later on that the Province allocated the subject land for the housing project of respondent Gawad Kalinga Foundation, Inc. (GKFI) for rebel returnees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Hence, on April 12, 2011, CBSUA filed a complaint for recovery of ownership, possession and damages, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> against the Province, represented by its Governor Luis Raymond F. Villafuerte, Jr. (Villafuerte) and GKFI, represented by its Executive Director Jose Luis Oquiñena (Oquiñena) and its Chapter Head, Harry Azana (Azana). It prayed that: (1) after due proceedings, a TRO and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction be issued ordering the Province and GKFI and all persons deriving rights under them to observe the <i>status quo</i> ante and/or to vacate the subject land and/or to cease and desist from implementing the housing project of GKFI or from constructing any structure on the subject land; (2) thereafter, to issue judgment (a) declaring CBSUA as true and lawful owner of the subject land and other lands covered by TCT No. 41093; (b) directing the Province and GKFI and all persons claiming rights from them to vacate the subject land and restore possession to CBSUA; and (c) ordering the Province to pay CBSUA damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On April 27, 2011, the Regional Trial Court of Pili, Camarines Sur, Branch 32 (RTC), to which the complaint was raffled, conducted a hearing on CBSUA’s application for the issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b><center>The RTC Order and Subsequent Proceedings</center></b><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated May 12, 2011, the RTC denied CBSUA’s application for the issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, finding that CBSUA failed to show that it had superior right over the subject land as against that of the Province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> While it recognized the existence of the laws which transferred ownership over the subject land, as well as other parcels of land, to CBSUA and that BP 198 in particular directed the Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur to issue the corresponding certificates of title for the said parcels of land in CBSUA’s name, the RTC noted that CBSUA, as transferee, failed to effect the registration of the said properties in its name. Consequently, it ruled that CBSUA failed to show that it was entitled to the relief of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, not having established a better right over the subject land as against the Province, which was the registered owner thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>CBSUA’s motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated October 10, 2011, a copy of which CBSUA received on October 17, 2011, which gave CBSUA sixty (60) days or until December 16, 2011 within which to assail the RTC’s Orders <i>via</i> petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Unfortunately, due to time constraints in securing certified true copies of the RTC’s Orders, as well as other pertinent documents, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), prosecuting this case on behalf of CBSUA, deemed it necessary and prudent to seek an additional period of ten (10) days from December 16, 2011 or until December 26, 2011 within which to file its petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On December 26, 2011, CBSUA filed its petition for <i>certiorari </i>(with prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> before the CA, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in denying its application for the issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated February 2, 2012, the CA denied CBSUA’s motion for extension of time to file petition for<i> certiorari,</i> citing Section 4, paragraph 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>When and where to file the petition</i>. – The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days counted from the notice of the denial of the motion.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The CA explained that as presently worded, the above-quoted rule no longer allows extensions to file petitions for <i>certiorari.</i> Consequently, since CBSUA admittedly received the RTC order denying its motion for reconsideration on October 17, 2011, it only had until December 16, 2011 within which to file its petition for <i>certiorari</i>. As CBSUA filed its petition only on December 26, 2011, or ten (10) days after the expiration of the 60-day reglementary period, the CA ruled the same to have been filed out of time and consequently, dismissed the same outright.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>CBSUA’s motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated July 24, 2012; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The sole issue advanced for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA erred in ruling that under the amendment introduced by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC to Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, extensions for the filing of petitions for <i>certiorari</i> have been completely disallowed.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>As a general rule, a petition for <i>certiorari </i>must be filed strictly within 60 days from notice of judgment or from the order denying a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This is in accordance with the amendment introduced by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> where no provision for the filing of a motion for extension to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> exists, unlike in the previous Section 4, Rule 65<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of the Rules of Court which allowed the filing of such a motion but only for compelling reasons and in no case exceeding 15 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33] </sup>Under exceptional cases, however, the Court has held that the 60-day period may be extended subject to the court’s sound discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Eventually, in <i>Labao v. Flores</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court laid down the following recognized exceptions to the strict observance of the 60-day reglementary period: (1) most persuasive and weighty reasons; (2) to relieve a litigant from an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure; (3) good faith of the defaulting party by immediately paying within a reasonable time from the time of the default; (4) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (5) <b>the merits of the case</b>; (6) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (7) <b>a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory</b>; (8) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby; (9) fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence without appellant’s fault; (10) peculiar legal and equitable circumstances attendant to each case; (11) in the name of substantial justice and fair play; (12) importance of the issues involved; and (13) exercise of sound discretion by the judge guided by all the attendant circumstances. Thus, there should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to advance a reasonable or meritorious explanation for his/her failure to comply with the rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this case, the RTC itself recognized the existence of laws which mandated the transfer of ownership over the subject land, among others, to CBSUA. Were it not for the latter’s failure to have effected the registration of the certificate of title under its name, then there appears to be no standing objection against the enforcement of those laws. In addition, records show that CBSUA has, all the while, been in possession of the subject land. Thus, it would serve the interest of substantial justice for the CA to rule upon the merits of this case rather than dismiss the petition before it on a mere procedural technicality, it being shown, to the satisfaction of the Court, that the above-highlighted grounds to relax the rules obtain.<br><br>Time and again, the Court has held that although procedural rules ought to be strictly enforced by courts in order to impart stability in the legal system, the Court has, nonetheless, relaxed the rigid application of the rules of procedure in several cases to afford the parties the opportunity to fully ventilate their cases on the merits. This is because the ends of justice would be better served if the parties were given the chance to argue their causes and defenses. After all, the general objective of procedure is to facilitate the application of justice to the opposing claims of the competing parties, bearing always in mind the principle that procedure must not hinder but, rather, promote the administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
