CV No. 02895, which affirmed with modification the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated October 20, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court of Guimbal, Iloilo, Branch 67 (RTC) in Cadastral Case Nos. 118 and 122, allowing petitioners-spouses Rodolfo and Marcelina Guevarra (Sps. Guevarra) to exercise their right to repurchase the mortgaged property subject of this case, conditioned upon the payment of the purchase price fixed by respondent The Commoner Lending Corporation, Inc. (TCLC).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>On December 16, 1996,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>Sps. Guevarra obtained a P320,000.00 loan from TCLC, which was secured by a real estate mortgage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> over a 5,532- square meter parcel of land situated in Guimbal, Iloilo, covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. F-31900<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (subject property), emanating from a free patent granted to Sps. Guevarra on February 25, 1986.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Sps. Guevarra, however, defaulted in the payment of their loan, prompting TCLC to extra-judicially foreclose the mortgage on the subject property<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in accordance with Act No. 3135,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> as amended. In the process, TCL Cemerged as the highest bidder at the public auction sale held on June 15, 2000 for the bid amount of P150,000.00,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup>and on August 25, 2000, the certificate of sale was registered with the Registry of Deeds of Iloilo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Eventually, Sps. Guevarra failed to redeem the subject property within the one-year reglementary period, which led to the cancellation of OCT No. F-31900 and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No.T-16187<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in the name of TCLC. Thereafter, TCLC demanded that Sps. Guevarra vacate the property, but to no avail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Proceedings</b><br></center><br>On June 10, 2005, TCLC applied for a writ of possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> before the RTC, docketed as Cadastral Case No. 118. Sps. Guevarra opposed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the same by challenging the validity of the foreclosure proceedings due to the purported failure of TCLC to comply with the notice, posting and publication requirements, and lack of authority, as a corporation,to acquire the subject property. Sps. Guevarra also assailed the issuance by the Sheriff of Iloilo of a Final Deed of Sale<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to be premature, as they were still entitled to redeem the subject property within five (5) years from the expiration of the one-year period to repurchase.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, or on September 8, 2005, Sps. Guevarra filed before the RTC a petition for redemption,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> docketed as Cadastral Case No. 122, maintaining that the redemption period did not expire on August 25, 2001, or one (1) year from the registration of the certificate of sale, but will still expire five (5) years therefrom, or on August 25, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> They further averred that they pleaded to be allowed to redeem the subject property but TCLC unjustifiably refused the same, constraining them to file said petition, offering to redeem the subject property at P150,000.00, plus one percent (1%) interest per month for five (5) years from August 25, 2000, or in the amount of P240,000.00,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which they consigned<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the RTC.<br><br>Cadastral Case Nos. 118 and 122 were later consolidated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated July 12, 2006, the RTC granted TCLC’s petition in Cadastral Case No. 118, resulting in the issuance of the corresponding Writ of Possession<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and Notice to Vacate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which were duly served upon Sps.

Guevarra’s petition in Cadastral Case No. 122. In so doing, the RTC recognized Sps. Guevarra’s right to repurchase the subject property, pointing out that they were able to file their petition within the five-year period provided under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> otherwise known as the Public Land Act (Public Land Act).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As a consequence, the RTC directed TCLC to reconvey the subject property to Sps. Guevarra and execute the corresponding deed of reconveyance upon payment of the purchase price of P150,000.00, plus one percent (1%) interest per month from the date of the auction sale on June 15, 2000 up to August 8, 2006, as well as the corresponding tax assessments and foreclosure expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, TCLC filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated January 6, 2009; thus, it filed an appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Proceedings</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated October 3, 2011, the CA affirmed the RTC’s October 20, 2008 Order, upholding Sps. Guevarra’s right to repurchase the subject property pursuant to Section 119 of the Public Land Act, with modification that the same be conditioned upon the payment of the purchase price fixed by TCLC. It ruled that after the expiration of the redemption period, the present owner,<i> i.e</i>., TCLC, has the discretion to set a higher price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Sps. Guevarra filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated October 17, 2012, hence, this petition.<br><br><b><center>The Issue Before the Court<br></center></b><br>The essential issue in this case is whether or not the CA committed a reversible error in ruling that the repurchase price for the subject property should be fixed by TCLC.<br><br><b><center>The Court’s Ruling<br></center></b><br>In an extra-judicial foreclosure of registered land acquired under a free patent, the mortgagor may redeem the property within two (2) years from the date of foreclosure if the land is mortgaged to a rural bank under Republic Act No. (RA) 720,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> as amended, otherwise known as the Rural Banks Act, or within one (1) year from the registration of the certificate of sale if the land is mortgaged to parties <i>other than</i> rural banks pursuant to Act No. 3135.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> If the mortgagor fails to exercise such right, he or his heirs may still repurchase the property within five (5) years from the expiration of the aforementioned redemption period<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> pursuant to Section 119 of the Public Land Act, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 119. Every conveyance of land acquired under the free patent or homestead provisions, when proper, shall be subject to repurchase by the applicant, his widow, or legal heirs, within a period of five years from the date of the conveyance.</blockquote><br>In this case, the subject property was mortgaged to and foreclosed by TCLC, which is a lending or credit institution, and not a rural bank; hence, the redemption period is one (1) year from the registration of the certificate of sale on August 25, 2000, or until August 25, 2001. Given that Sps. Guevarra failed to redeem the subject property within the aforestated redemption period, TCLC was entitled, as a matter of right, to consolidate its ownership and to possess the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Nonetheless, such right should not negate Sps. Guevarra’s right to repurchase said property within five (5) years from the expiration of the redemption period on August 25, 2001, or until August 25, 2006, in view of Section 119 of the Public Land Act as above-cited.<br><br>In this relation, it is apt to clarify that contrary to TCLC’s claim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the tender of the repurchase price is not necessary for the preservation of the right of repurchase, because the filing of a judicial action for such purpose within the five-year period under Section 119 of the Public Land Act is already equivalent to a formal offer to redeem. On this premise, consignation of the redemption price is equally unnecessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Thus, the RTC and CA both correctly ruled that Sps. Guevarra’s right to repurchase the subject property had not yet expired when Cadastral Case No. 122 was filed on September 8, 2005. That being said, the Court now proceeds to determine the proper amount of the repurchase price.<br><br>Sps. Guevarra insist that the repurchase price should be the purchase price at the auction sale plus interest of one percent (1%) per month and other assessment fees,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> citing the rulings in the cases of <i>Belisario v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (<i>Belisario</i>) and<i> Salenillas v. CA</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Salenillas). On the other hand, TCLC maintains that it is entitled to its total claims under the promissory note and the mortgage contract<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> in accordance with Section 47<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the General Banking Law of 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>TCLC’s argument is <b>partly</b> correct.<br><br>To resolve the matter, it must first be pointed out that case law has equated a right of repurchase of foreclosed properties under Section 119 of the Public Land Act as a “right of redemption”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and the repurchase price as a “redemption price.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, in <i>Salenillas</i>, the Court applied then Section 30, now Section 28, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (Rules) in the redemption of the foreclosed property covered by a free patent:<br><br><blockquote>Now, as regards the redemption price, applying Sec. 30 of Rule 39 of the [Rules], the petitioners should reimburse the private respondent the amount of the <b>purchase price at the public auction plus interest at the rate of one <i>per centum</i> per month</b> up to November 17, 1983, together with the amounts of <b>assessments and taxes</b> on the property that the private respondent might have <b>paid after purchase and interest on the last named amount at the same rate as that on the purchase price</b>. (Emphases supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court has,however, ruled<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that redemptions from lending or <i>credit institutions</i>, like TCLC, are governed by Section 78<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the General Banking Act (now Section 47 of the General Banking Law of 2000), which amended Section 6 of Act No. 3135 in relation to the proper redemption price when the mortgagee is a bank, or a banking or credit institution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court cannot subscribe to TCLC’s contention that it is entitled to its total claims under the <u>promissory note</u> and the mortgage contract<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> in view of the settled rule that <b><i>an action to foreclose must be limited to the amount mentioned in the mortgage</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Hence, amounts not stated therein must be excluded, like the <b>penalty charges of three percent (3%) per month</b> included in TCLC’s claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>A penalty charge is likened to a compensation for damages in case of breach of the obligation. Being penal in nature,it must be specific and fixed by the contracting parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court notes that the <b>stipulated three percent (3%) monthly interest</b> is excessive and unconscionable.In a plethora of cases, the Court has affirmed that <b>stipulated interest rates of three percent (3%) per month and higher are excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable, and exorbitant</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> <b>hence, illegal</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> <b>and void for being contrary to morals.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In <i>Agner v. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule:<br><br><blockquote>Settled is the principle which this Court has affirmed in a number of cases that stipulated interest rates of <b>three percent (3%) per month</b> and higher are excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable, and exorbitant. While Central Bank Circular No. 905-82, which took effect on January 1, 1983, effectively removed the ceiling on interest rates for both secured and unsecured loans, regardless of maturity, nothing in the said circular could possibly be read as granting <i>carte blanche</i> authority to lenders to raise interest rates to levels which would either enslave their borrowers or lead to a hemorrhaging of their assets. <b>Since the stipulation on the interest rate is void for being contrary to morals, if not against the law, it is as if there was no express contract on said interest rate; thus, the interest rate may be reduced as reason and equity demand</b>. (Emphases supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>As such, the stipulated three percent (3%) monthly interest should be equitably reduced to one percent (1%) per month or twelve percent (12%) per annum reckoned from the execution of the real estate mortgage on December 12, 1996,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> until the filing of the petition in Cadastral Case No. 122 on September 8, 2005.<br><br>In addition to the principal and interest, the repurchase price should also include all the expenses of foreclosure,<i> i.e.</i>, Judicial Commission, Publication Fee, and Sheriff’s Fee, in accordance with Section 47<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the General Banking Law of 2000. Considering further that Sps. Guevarra failed to redeem the subject property within the one-year reglementary period, they are liable to reimburse TCLC for the corresponding Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) it paid pursuant to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulations No. 4-99,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> which requires the payment of DST on extra-judicial foreclosure sales of capital assets initiated by banks, finance and insurance companies, as well as CGT in cases of non-redemption. CGT and DST are expenses incident to TCLC’s custody of the subject property, hence, likewise due, under the above provision of law.<br><br>Accordingly, the repurchase price is hereby computed as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Principal </div></td> <td width="27%"><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td width="19%"><div align="RIGHT">P320,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Add: Interest from 12/12/1996 to 09/05/2005</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">from 12/12/1996 to 12/12/2004: (P320,000.00 x 12% x 8 years) </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P307,200.00</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">from 12/13/2004 to 09/08/2005: (P320,000.00 x 12% x 270/365) </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>28,405.48 </u></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>335,605.48</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="3"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Amount due under the mortgage </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P655,605.48</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Add: </div></td> <td width="49%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Capital Gains Tax </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">18,203.17</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Documentary Stamp Tax </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">4,501.46</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Judicial Commission</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">4,150.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Publication Fee</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">4,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Sheriff’s Fee </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,000.00</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><i><b>Repurchase Price </b></i></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P689,460.11</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">==============</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>From this repurchase price shall be deducted the amount consigned to the RTC, or P240,000.00.
