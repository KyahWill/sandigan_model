Metrobank has absolutely and irrevocably sold, assigned and conveyed all its rights, title and interests in and to the loan, including all the security interest, mortgages, reimbursements rights, and similar rights and privileges related to such loan.</i><br><br>Consequently, petitioner and substitute creditor Elite Union Investment Ltd. filed a joint motion to approve compromise agreement and to render partial judgment on compromise on November 3, 2006, which the Court rendered a partial Judgment on Compromise Agreement on November 9, 2006 between petitioners and substitute creditor Elite Union Investment Ltd., based on the aforesaid Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>The Memorandum of Agreement which is made the basis of the partial judgment does not contain any provision on the application of P15 Million that was previously deposited with Metrobank. As a matter of fact, it is admitted by Metrobank in its opposition that said P15 Million was not the subject of the contract transferring of petitioner's loan obligation to Elite Union Investment Ltd., but claims that the bank has the free use of the monies with the obligation of crediting the account for the interest due in favor of the Petitioners.<br><br>Metrobank has not taken any single centavo out of the P15 Million deposit for use in payment of the loan account of Petitioners while still existing at that time prior to its being sold out to Elite Union Investment Ltd.. The claim of Petitioners that they have no longer any existing loan account to Metrobank as the [sic] Metrobank sold their loan account to Elite Union Investment Ltd., is apparently and obviously true and correct. Metrobank has not informed Petitioners until now that they have still [an] existing account not sold out to Elite Union Investment Ltd. Instead it manifested that it did not transfer its alleged rights appertaining to the P15 Million to Elite Union Investment Ltd. (Opposition, January 17, 2007).<br><br><i>On the other hand, to allow Metrobank to retain possession of the P15 million deposit would certainly enrich itself at the expense of Petitioners. The purpose in depositing the money is no longer validly existing as far back September 15, 2006 when Metrobank sold the loan account to Elite Union Investments Ltd which transfer has novated the obligation of the Petitioners to creditor Metrobank by the substitution with the new creditor. Metrobank is therefore liable to return the money together with the interest thereon.<br><br>The P15 Million deposit which is duly receipted by Metrobank under OR No. 0008504 on September 1, 2003 implies that it is a time deposit and since in the agreement that the deposit shall earn an interest, hence, the time deposit which normally bears an interest rate of 5% per annum should be applied and paid by Metrobank. (Receiver's Report, March 27, 2007).</i><br><br>ACCORDINGLY, finding the Motion for the Release of Unapplied Deposit of P15 Million with Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company filed by Petitioners to be meritorious, the same is hereby granted.<br><br>Petitioners are hereby allowed to withdraw the said P15 Million deposited with Metrobank and the said bank is directed to return the money deposited with a time deposit rate of 5% per annum from September 1, 2003.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Metrobank moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the trial court's Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> However, the motion was denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> on October 10, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Metrobank then filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court assailing the April 2, 2007 and October 10, 2007 Orders of the rehabilitation court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the Decision dated November 24, 2008, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the April 2, 2007 Order of the rehabilitation court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> According to the Court of Appeals, G &amp; P has no interest nor personality in asking for the release of the deposit since the loan account was finally sold to Spouses Victor and Lani Paras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> "While the Spouses Victor and Lani Paras may have the same surname as the stockholders of G &amp; P, it does not appear from the records that G &amp; P and Spouses Victor and Lani Paras share the same interest over the Loan Account."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also observed that the Petition should have been dismissed outright since the assailed April 2, 2007 Order was a mere interlocutory order and could not be assailed through a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals found that Metrobank sold the entire obligation of G &amp; P to Elite Union;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> hence, Metrobank was not entitled to the P15,000,000.00 deposit:<br><blockquote>The [August 11, 2003] memorandum [between Metrobank and G &amp; P] never provided for the insisted outright partial payment. What it did provide was that when a Rehabilitation Plan is eventually approved, the proceeds will be principally applied to the outstanding obligation of G &amp; P assuming Metrobank is still the creditor of G &amp; P during such time.<br><br>When Metrobank sold the loan portfolio on August 11, 2006 to Elite Union, the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement stated that:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2.01 Agreement to Sell and Purchase Loan. - Seller agrees to sell and Purchaser agrees to purchase the Loan with an Oustanding Principal Balance of Pesos: Fifty Two Million Ninety Four Thousand Seven Hundred Eleven (Php 52,094,711.00) on a without recourse basis, for the Purchase Price and on such terms subject to such other conditions as are contained in this Agreement. The Seller hereby declares that the aforementioned Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan is the total outstanding obligation of the Obligor of the Loan to the Seller.<br></blockquote>Hence, the entire obligation - the principal amount, the security therefor, which now consisted of eight (8) parcels of land and the P15 Million proceeds in lieu of the four (4) sold parcels of land, were transferred to Elite Union.

It "refers to something between the commencement and end of the suit which decides some point or matter but it is not the final decision on the whole controversy." Conversely, a final order is one which leaves to the court nothing more to do to resolve the case. . . .<br><br>In the present case, the April 10, 1992 Order denied private respondent's Motion to hold in abeyance the delivery of the Certificate of Sale of his Club Filipino share and to declare the sale void. <i>After rendering the Order, the trial court did not need to do anything more to settle the rights of the parties.</i> Upon the affirmation of the validity of the sale, the Certificate of Sale was to be delivered to petitioner as the new owner. Indeed, while appeal does not lie against the execution of a judgment, it is available in case of an irregular implementation of a writ of execution. This was the factual scenario in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>An order is final if "the order or judgment ends the litigation in the lower court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> It is interlocutory if the order simply resolves matters incidental to the main case and still leaves something to be done on the part of the court relating to the merits of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>In this case, the assailed orders of the trial court are interlocutory in nature. The orders pertained to an incidental matter: entitlement to the P15,000,000.00 deposit as proceeds of the sale of properties that secured respondent G &amp; P's loan obligation. In contrast, the main proceeding before the commercial court concerns the approval of the rehabilitation plan under the Interim Rules. To resolve the merits of the case, the trial court, sitting as commercial court, must either approve or disapprove the rehabilitation plan, depending on the feasibility of the proposed plan to rehabilitate the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Petitioner committed a procedural error when it filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals instead of filing a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. The distinction is important because "[t]he remedy against an interlocutory order not subject of an appeal is an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65 [.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> The reason behind the rule is to prevent multiplicity of suits:<br><blockquote>The reason for disallowing an appeal from an interlocutory order is to avoid multiplicity of appeals in a single action, which necessarily suspends the hearing and decision on the merits of the action during the pendency of the appeals. Permitting multiple appeals will necessarily delay the trial on the merits of the case for a considerable length of time, and will compel the adverse party to incur unnecessary expenses, for one of the parties may interpose as many appeals as there are incidental questions raised by him and as there are interlocutory orders rendered or issued by the lower court. An interlocutory order may be the subject of an appeal, but only after a judgment has been rendered, with the ground for appealing the order being included in the appeal of the judgment itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Moreover, in contrast to a final judgment or order, an interlocutory order "may not be questioned on appeal except only as part of an appeal that may eventually be taken from the final judgment rendered in the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals is, thus, correct when it held:<br><blockquote>It should be noted that what is challenged before Us is the court a quo's April 2, 2007 Order granting petitioner's "Motion for Release of Unapplied Deposit with Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company". Considering that the assailed Order merely ordered the release of funds from a depository bank and did not completely dispose of the case but left something else to be done by the court a quo, the order assailed before Us is merely interlocutory.

Nevertheless, to remove all doubts as to the validity of the assailed trial court Orders, we rule on the matter raised.<br><br>Petitioner relies on Rule 4, Section 11 of the Interim Rules, which provides for mandatory periods to approve a rehabilitation plan:<br><blockquote>SECTION 11. Period of the Stay Order. — The stay order shall be effective from the date of its issuance until the dismissal of the petition or the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings.<br><br>The petition shall be dismissed if no rehabilitation plan is approved by the court upon the lapse of <i>one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the initial hearing</i>. The court may grant an extension beyond this period only if it appears by convincing and compelling evidence that the debtor may successfully be rehabilitated. In no instance, however, shall the period for approving or disapproving a rehabilitation plan exceed <i>eighteen (18) months from the date of filing of the petition</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This court, in the recent case of <i>Lexber, Inc. v. Spouses Dalman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> held that the lapse of the periods provided for under Rule 4, Section 11 of the Interim Rules does not automatically result in the dismissal of the petition for corporate rehabilitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> This is in line with the liberal construction given to the rules governing corporate rehabilitation:<br><blockquote>However, while the general rule in statutory construction is that the words "shall," "must," "ought," or "should" are of mandatory character in common parlance, <i>it is also well-recognized in law and equity that this is not an absolute rule or inflexible criterion</i>.<br><br>The records of the present case show that on May 4, 2007, Lexber filed a motion for the extension of the period for the approval of the rehabilitation plan. However, the trial court never issued a resolution on this motion. Instead, on June 12, 2007, it issued an order giving due course to the petition. The records also reveal that after the initial hearing, the trial court had to conduct additional hearings even after the lapse of the 180-day period.<br><br><i>Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Lexber could not be faulted for the non-approval of the rehabilitation plan within the 180-day period. A petitioner-corporation should not be penalized if the trial court needed more time to evaluate the rehabilitation plan. Notably, in the present case, Lexber filed a motion for the extension of the 180-day period. However, the trial court did not issue a resolution on this motion. Instead, it issued an order giving due course to the petition, which also fell within the 18-month limit prescribed under the law.</i><br><br><i>Rule 2, Section 2 of the Interim Rules dictates the courts to liberally construe the rehabilitation rules in order to carry out the objectives of Sections 6(c) of PD 902-A, as amended, and to assist the parties in obtaining a just, expeditious, and inexpensive determination of rehabilitation cases.</i><br><br><i>The trial courts decision to approve or disapprove a rehabilitation plan is not a ministerial function and would require its extensive study and analysis.</i> As it turned out, after careful scrutiny of the rehabilitation petition, and its annexes, the trial court eventually disapproved Lexber's rehabilitation plan and dismissed the rehabilitation petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Asiatrust Development Bank v.

These Rules are to be construed liberally to obtain for the parties a just, expeditious, and inexpensive disposition of the case. To be sure, strict compliance with the rules of procedure is essential to the administration of justice. Nonetheless, technical rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application should be relaxed when they hinder rather than promote substantial justice. Otherwise stated, strict application of technical rules of procedure should be shunned when they hinder rather than promote substantial justice.</i><br><br>In this case, instead of filing its opposition to the petition for rehabilitation at least ten days before the date of the initial hearing as required by the Rules, petitioner filed a Motion for Leave of Court to Admit Opposition to Rehabilitation Petition with the attached Opposition to Petition for Rehabilitation on the date of the initial hearing. Because the pleading was not filed on time, the RTC denied the motion. While the court has the discretion whether or not to admit the opposition belatedly filed by petitioner, it is our considered opinion that the RTC gravely abused its discretion when it refused to grant the motion, <i>even as the factual circumstances of the case require that the Rules be liberally construed in the interest of justice</i>.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><i>Time and again, we have held that cases should, as much as possible, be resolved on the merits, not on mere technicalities. In cases where we dispense with the technicalities, we do not mean to undermine the force and ejfectivity of the periods set by law. In those rare cases where we did not stringently apply the procedural rules, there always existed a clear need to prevent the commission of a grave injustice, as in the present case.</i> Our judicial system and the courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just and proper disposition of his cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In view of the circumstances in this case, we deem that a liberal interpretation of the rules is only proper. The non-approval of the rehabilitation plan within the maximum period prescribed under the Interim Rules cannot be attributed wholly to the trial court. The parties, including Elite Union, entered into multiple agreements in relation to the loan obligation of respondent G &amp; P.

The article reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 1370. If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.<br><br>If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.<br></blockquote>In the recent case of <i>Abad v. Goldloop Properties, Inc.</i>, we explained, thus:<br><blockquote>The cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts is embodied in the first paragraph of Article 1370 of the Civil Code: "<i>[if] the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control</i>." This provision is akin to the "plain meaning rule" applied by Pennsylvania courts, which assumes that the intent of the parties to an instrument is "embodied in the writing itself, and when the words are clear and unambiguous the intent is to be discovered only from the express language of the agreement." It also resembles the "four corners" rule, a principle which allows courts in some cases to search beneath the semantic surface for clues to meaning. A court's purpose in examining a contract is to interpret the intent of the contracting parties, as objectively manifested by them. The process of interpreting a contract requires the court to make a preliminary inquiry as to whether the contract before it is ambiguous. A contract provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible of two reasonable alternative interpretations. Where the written terms of the contract are not ambiguous and can only be read one way, the court will interpret the contract as a matter of law. If the contract is determined to be ambiguous, then the interpretation of the contract is left to the court, to resolve the ambiguity in the light of the intrinsic evidence.<br></blockquote>In our jurisdiction, the rule is thoroughly discussed in <i>Bautista v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><blockquote>The rule is that where the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined A without reference to extrinsic facts or aids. The intention of the parties must be gathered from that language, and from that language alone. Stated differently, <b><i>where the language of a written contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract must be taken to mean that which, on its face, it purports to mean, unless some good reason can be assigned to show that the words should be understood in a different sense. Courts cannot make for the parties better or more equitable agreements than they themselves have been satisfied to make, or rewrite contracts because they operate harshly or inequitably as to one of the parties, or alter them for the benefit of one party and to the detriment of the other, or by construction, relieve one of the parties from the terms which he voluntarily consented to, or impose on him those which he did not</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Furthermore, [w]hen an agreement has been reduced to writing, the parties cannot be permitted to adduce evidence to prove alleged practices [that], to all purposes, would alter the terms of the written agreement.

As held by the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>The memorandum [first MOA] never provided for the insisted outright partial payment. What it did provide was that when a Rehabilitation Plan is eventually approved, the proceeds will be principally applied to the outstanding obligation of G &amp; P assuming Metrobank is still the creditor of G &amp; P during such time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br></blockquote>When petitioner entered into the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement with Elite Union, the entire obligation was transferred to Elite Union.

Contrary to petitioner's argument, nowhere in the first MOA nor in the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement is it mentioned that the P15,000,000.00 deposit would be applied to the interests and penalties of the principal loan balance.<br><br>What was sold to Elite Union under the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement was respondent G &amp; P's total loan obligation of P52,094,711.00, inclusive of the remaining securities and proceeds from the sale of some of the securities as stated in the first MOA.<br><br>As held by the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>[T]he entire obligation - the principal amount, the security therefor, which now consisted of eight (8) parcels of land and the P15 Million proceeds in lieu of the four (4) sold parcels of land, were transferred to Elite Union.

The first MOA is clear that the P15,000,000.00 deposit shall be applied to respondent G &amp; P's obligation with petitioner, as secured by several real properties:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">3.b. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">That in the application of the deposit pursuant to the Court approved Rehabilitation Plan, the aggregate sum shall be <i>exclusively applied to the obligation of Petitioners with the creditor MetroBank, where the corresponding real properties formed part of the loan collateral</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Second, if it were petitioner's intention to remain a creditor of respondent G &amp; P with respect to the P15,000,000.00 deposit, then it should have provided unequivocally so in the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement it entered into with Elite Union. Nowhere in this Agreement did petitioner reserve its right to the P15,000,000.00 deposit. Instead, it declared that the "Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan is the total outstanding obligation of the Obligor [respondent G &amp; P] of the Loan to the Seller [petitioner]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup><br><br>Also, petitioner's reliance on Article II, Section 2.02<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> of the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement is of no moment.<br><br>Petitioner cannot vary the terms of the first MOA in relation to the status of the P15,000,000.00 deposit through its interpretation of the Loan Sale and Purchase Agreement. The first MOA was judicially approved by the trial court as a compromise agreement between petitioner and respondent G &amp; P. Hence, the terms of the first MOA, as the applicable law, governs the parties and their assigns and/or heirs:<br><blockquote>A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions in order to resolve their differences and thus avoid litigation or to put an end to one already commenced. Once stamped with judicial <i>imprimatur</i>, it becomes more than a mere contract binding upon the parties; having the sanction of the court and entered as its determination of the controversy, it has the force and effect of any other judgment. It has the effect and authority of <i>res judicata</i>, although no execution may issue until it would have received the corresponding approval of the court where the litigation pends and its compliance with the terms of the agreement is thereupon decreed.<br><br>A compromise agreement once approved by final order of the court has the force of <i>res judicata</i> between the parties and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery. Hence, a decision on a compromise agreement is final and executory; it has the force of law and is conclusive between the parties. It transcends its identity as a mere contract binding only upon the parties thereto, as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>To reiterate, the compromise judgment approved petitioner's priority or preference as to the deposit. However, petitioner assigned this priority or preference in favor of Elite Union.<br><br>This court cannot speculate as to the reasons why petitioner sold all its rights and interests over respondent G &amp; P's loan account for a lower price. Without sufficient evidence, legal basis, and compelling reasons, we cannot read beyond the written agreements between the parties. As observed by the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>This Court can only speculate on Metrobank's omission to zealously protect its interest. It cannot even begin to fathom how a banking giant could have committed such a colossal blunder. The records however, clearly disclose that while Metrobank was already in possession of the P15 Million proceeds, it still opted to sell ALL ITS INTEREST, TITLES, and CLAIM over a P52,094,711.00 receivable account for only P10.419 Million. By doing so, it has only itself to blame for its loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup><br></blockquote>We cannot further assume that petitioner, being a large commercial bank possessing huge financial and legal resources, cannot adequately and clearly reflect its interests in its own contracts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review filed by Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Company is <b>DENIED</b>.
