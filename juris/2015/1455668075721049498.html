				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The notation "in trust for" or "for escrow" that comes with deposited funds indicates that the deposit is for the benefit of a third party. In this case, Asset Privatization Trust deposited funds "in trust for" Pantranco North Express, Inc., (Pantranco) a corporation under the management of Asset Privatization Trust. These funds belong to Pantranco. Further, in the absence of evidence that Asset Privatization Trust is authorized to collect Pantranco's indebtedness to Philippine National Bank, the subject funds can be garnished to satisfy the claims of Pantranco's creditors.<br><br>Through this Petition for Review, the Asset Privatization Trust<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> challenges the Decision of the Court of Appeals denying it relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Court of Appeals reversed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City and held that the subject funds are private funds and can be garnished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Pantranco was formerly a government-owned and controlled corporation without original charter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Sometime in 1972, Pantranco suffered financial losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> One of Pantranco's creditors was Philippine National Bank.

Pantranco requested Asset Privatization Trust to return the funds. However, Asset Privatization Trust did not do so. The Imexco case was dismissed in 1992, due to "failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The P20 million deposit earned interest, and as of January 31, 1993, the deposit increased to P29,533,072.69.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Domingo P.

There is hereby created a public trust to be known as the Asset Privatization Trust, hereinafter referred to as the Trust, which shall, for the benefit of the National Government, take title to and possession of, conserve, provisionally manage and dispose of assets as defined in Section 2 herein which have been identified for privatization or disposition and transferred to the Trust for the purpose, pursuant to Section 23 of this Proclamation.<br></blockquote>The trial court also cited Section 33 of Proclamation No. 50, which states:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 33.</b> <i>PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS</i>. All proceeds from the sale or other disposition of assets net of fees, commissions and other reimbursable expenses of the Trust <i>shall form part of the General Fund of the National Government and be remitted to the National Treasury immediately upon receipt of such proceeds</i>: Provided, however, that the Trust shall be entitled to retain, upon approval by the Committee, such portion of the proceeds as may be necessary to maintain a revolving fund to be utilized for the payment of fees and reimbursable expenses and meeting the costs and expenses incurred by the Trust in the conservation and disposition of the assets held by it, or otherwise in the performance of its responsibilities under this Proclamation, including such amounts as may be required to serve borrowings incurred by the Trust pursuant to the authority and for the purposes provided in this Proclamation.<br><br>In respect of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of corporate subsidiaries of parent government corporations, such proceeds shall accrue to the parent corporation. The proceeds shall be net of fees, commissions and other reimbursable expenses of the Trust as approved by the Committee, where the disposition was undertaken by or through the Trust. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The trial court explained that since Section 33 of Proclamation No. 50 provides that proceeds from the sale of assets form part of the general fund of national government, the assets in this case, which are in cash, should automatically be considered as part of the general fund. Also, Section 29(1), Book IV, Title II, Chapter 4 of the Administrative Code states that the Bureau of Treasury shall "act as the principal custodian of all the national government funds." It does not state that the Bureau of Treasury is allowed to take custody of private funds. The phrases "in trust for APT-Pantranco North Express, Inc." and "for the account of Pantranco North Express, Inc." do not indicate that the funds belong to Pantranco but merely point "to the account where such funds are to be applied and nothing more."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Hence, the funds deposited by Asset Privatization Trust are public funds that cannot be garnished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court Decision reads:<br><blockquote>A. <u>Civil Case No. 93-2858</u><br><ol><li>Ordering defendants Domingo P.

Under Section 23, the transfer of assets must be identified "in an appropriate instrument describing such assets or identifying the loan or other transactions giving rise to the receivables, obligations and other property constituting assets to be transferred."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In this case, Asset Privatization Trust did not present any Deed of Assignment to prove that Pantranco's loan with the Philippine National Bank was assigned to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Also, the terms of the loan agreement between Philippine National Bank and Pantranco were not sufficient bases to rule that the subject funds are public funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Portions of the loan agreement provide:<br><blockquote>Section 8.08. The Borrower [referring to Pantranco] hereby gives the Lender [referring to Philippine National Bank] the right to apply amounts on deposits or otherwise with the Lender, or its branches, subsidiaries or affiliates, in payment or reduction of amounts past due hereunder.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Section 8.10. Whenever the Borrower is carried with or indebted to the Lender for more than one account, the Lender shall have the right to apply to any account it chooses, regardless of whether one account is more onerous than the others, any and all payments that shall be made by or shall be received from the Borrower or from other sources for and in behalf of the Borrower, that shall come into possession of the Lender in any manner. This condition shall prevail over all provisions or agreements contained in this Agreement or in other documents or contracts executed or which may hereafter be executed by the Borrower, unless expressly waived by the Lender in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals also held that Asset Privatization Trust had the burden to prove that the subject funds are public funds, but failed to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In contrast, Guillermo P. Uy, Domingo P. Uy, and Hinosan Motors were able to show the source of the funds with the Bureau of Treasury<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>The fund was withdrawn by PNEI for the exclusive purpose of complying with the bond requirement imposed by the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 147, in Civil Case No. 88-969, entitled "Imexco Enterprises, Inc. vs. PNEI, et al."....<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The Board of Directors thus issued a Board Resolution, authorizing the withdrawal of P20 million to satisfy IMEXCO's claim, instead of merely posting a bond in the amount of P1 million pesos....<br><br>. . . .<br><br>A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] duly received the amount as evidenced by Check Voucher No. 9872 dated March 6, 1990. In a Memorandum dated February 28, 1991, the President and General Manager of PNEI requested the Board of Directors to issue another Board Resolution, this time to recover the P20 million earlier advanced to A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] "as there was no necessity for A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] to hold in trust the amount of P20 Million but merely to put up a bond of P1 Million to comply with aforesaid condition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, the Court of Appeals considered Tatlonghari's testimony where he explained why the funds were not public funds:<br><blockquote>These precepts testified to by Tatlonghari were never controverted by plaintiff-appellee, nor were they alleged as contrary to any law or the rules and procedures of the Bureau of Treasury. In fact, the competence, expertise, experience and informed judgment of Tatlonghari, as the Treasurer, as well as the officials of the T[reasury] M[iscellaneous] A[ccounting] D[ivision], must be given great weight, as they are the ones who are in actual custody of the subject fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>In addition, the Court of Appeals held that the phrases "for escrow" and "in trust for" should be construed in their ordinary meaning. Clearly, that the funds were held "for escrow" and "in trust for" meant that Asset Privatization Trust was holding the funds for Pantranco. Moreover, if the funds were indeed government funds, there would be "no need to specify the nature of the deposit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the instant appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 133, in Civil Cases No. 93-2358, 93-2859 and 93-2860, is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote>On January 6, 2006, Asset Privatization Trust, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed this Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In the Resolution dated March 20, 2006, this court required Tatlonghari, Domingo P.

Bureau of Treasury. - The Bureau of Treasury, which shall be headed by and subject to the supervision and control of the National Treasurer who shall be appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary, shall have the following functions:<br><br>(1) Act as the principal custodian of all national government funds;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(4) Maintain accounts of the financial transactions of all national secretaries, bureaus, agencies and instrumentalities[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></blockquote>Asset Privatization Trust argues that Tatlonghari, Domingo P. Uy, Guillermo P. Uy, Hinosan Motors, and Western Guaranty Corporation admitted that the subject funds were deposited by Asset Privatization Trust with the Central Bank. This proves that the funds are public in nature because the transfer of funds between government depositories usually involves public funds. Tatlonghari, Domingo P. Uy, Guillermo P. Uy, Hinosan Motors, and Western Guaranty Corporation are now estopped from claiming otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Asset Privatization Trust cites <i>Pacific Products, Inc. v.

Uy, Guillermo P.

In the books of TMAD, this deposit was recorded as a trust liability account (8-84-300) of BTR not as an income of the National Government. As such, we personally believe that the deposit cannot as yet be considered as N[ational] G[overnment] money.

Neither will this Treasury be aggrieved by the release of the said amount to the plaintiffs, nor could we appeal the case because we are not a party in interest over the subject matter of this litigation.<br><br>Furthermore, the orders and execution are final and executory, hence, the delivery of the amount demanded is ministerial on the part of this Treasury and for failure to comply therewith, the Treasury may be called upon by the above-mentioned courts for interrogation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote>Tatlonghari argues that the Bureau of Treasury's opinion should be given credence because it is the government agency tasked to take custody of funds. Therefore, it has the expertise to determine the nature of funds. Asset Privatization Trust was unable to prove by preponderance of evidence that the funds are public in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Western Guaranty Corporation raises the same argument<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> and adds that the opinion of the Bureau of Treasury that the funds are not public funds should be respected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Guillermo P.

It was thus an error on the part of the trial court to accept, hook, line and sinker, A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust]'s allegation that the loan was already assigned to A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] in the absence of the very document required by Section 23. It must be pointed out that the trial court itself relied on Section 23 in its assailed decision, but it seemed that it concentrated on the phrase "for the benefit of the National Government," without realizing that there must first be an operative act for A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] to lawfully collect from P[antranco] "for the benefit of the National Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br></blockquote>Western Guaranty Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> and Guillermo P.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Guillermo P. Uy also cites Section 12(6) of Proclamation No. 50, which provides that the Asset Privatization Trust has the power to settle liabilities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> while Section 23<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> provides that:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 23.</b> <i>MECHANICS OF TRANSFER OF ASSETS</i>.

Assuming that Asset Privatization Trust is, indeed, a creditor of Pantranco, then it has undue advantage over the other creditors as it is Pantranco's manager/conservator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>Guillermo P.

In addition, the officers of the Bureau of Treasury were of the opinion that the funds belong to Pantranco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>The issues in this case are:<br><br>First, whether the funds belong to Pantranco North Express, Inc. and are in the nature of private funds, or whether they belong to petitioner Asset Privatization Trust, in which case the subject funds are public funds; and<br><br>Second, whether the funds can be garnished.<br><br>We rule that the subject funds belong to Pantranco and are in the nature of private funds. Hence, the subject funds can be garnished and be used to satisfy the claims of respondents Tatlonghari, Domingo P. Uy, Guillermo P. Uy, Hinosan Motors, and Western Guaranty Corporation.<br><br>The definition of "government funds" is provided under the Revised Administrative Code and Presidential Decree No. 1445:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><blockquote>"Government funds" includes public moneys of every sort and other resources pertaining to any agency of the Government.<br></blockquote>The phrase "pertaining to any agency of the Government" distinguishes government funds from private funds. The definition of "government funds" indicates that for funds to be considered government funds or public funds, it must be shown that the funds properly belong to a government agency. To determine whether an entity is a government agency, we are also guided by the definition provided under the Revised Administrative Code and Presidential Decree No. 1445:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><blockquote>"Government agency" or "agency of the government," or "agency" refers to any department, bureau or office of the National Government, or any of its branches and instrumentalities, or any policitical subdivision, as well as any government-owned or controlled corporation, including its subsidiaries, or other self-governing board of commission of the Government.<br></blockquote>The determination of the nature of funds is important especially in cases where there are allegations that the funds involved are government funds. The general rule is that government funds cannot be garnished. The reason for this rule is explained in <i>City of Caloocan v. Allarde</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> <i>City of Caloocan</i> involved the garnishment of the funds of the City of Caloocan in order to satisfy the claim for backwages of Delfma Hernandez Santiago. The City of Caloocan raised the defense that its funds are public funds and cannot be garnished. In resolving the case, this court cited <i>Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> and discussed why public funds are not subject to garnishment:<br><blockquote>The rule is and has always been that all government funds deposited in PNB or any other official depositary of the Philippine Government by any of its agencies or instrumentalities, whether by general or special deposit remain government funds and may not be subject to garnishment or levy, in the absence of a corresponding appropriation as required by law.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The rule is based on obvious considerations of public policy. The functions and public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Pacific Products v. Ong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> as cited by petitioner, is not applicable because it does not involve the issue of whether the garnished funds are private funds or public funds. In <i>Pacific Products</i>, the funds garnished belonged to the Bureau of Telecommunications and was for payment of the bluestone copper sulfate it purchased from BML Trading and Supply. At the time the funds were garnished, the funds had not yet been released to BML Trading and Supply. It was clear that the garnished funds were still government funds.<br><br>However, there are government entities whose funds may be garnished even without an appropriation law. <i>National Housing Authority v. Heirs of Guivelondo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> involved an action for eminent domain. The computation of just compensation for the property belonging to the Heirs of Guivelondo was P11,200.00 per square meter. Subsequently, the National Housing Authority moved to dismiss its Complaint for eminent domain, claiming that the amount of just compensation was too high. The Motion to Dismiss was denied by the trial court. A Notice of Levy was served by the trial court's Sheriff. This court held that the funds of the National Housing Authority are not exempt from garnishment and explained that:<br><blockquote>Generally, funds and properties of the government cannot be the object of garnishment proceedings even if the consent to be sued had been previously granted and the state liability adjudged.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>However, if the funds belong to a public corporation or a government-owned or controlled corporation which is clothed with a personality of its own, separate and distinct from that of the government, then its funds are not exempt from garnishment. This is so because when the government enters into commercial business, it abandons its sovereign capacity and is to be treated like any other corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, petitioner has not shown that Pantranco is a government entity. As the history of Pantranco shows, it was originally a government corporation, was foreclosed by Philippine National Bank, and was later sold and incorporated as a private corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> Pantranco was sequestered, but the sequestration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> did not have the effect of transferring ownership to the national government. Sequestration is defined as:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Definition -<br><br>(B) "Sequestration" means taking into custody or placing under the Commission's control or possession any asset, fund or other property, as well as relevant records, papers and documents, in order to prevent their concealment, destruction, impairment or dissipation pending determination of the question whether the said asset, fund or property is ill-gotten wealth under Executive Orders Nos. 1 and 2.<br><br>In the sequestration of an on-going enterprise, the Commission shall appoint a fiscal agent therein to prevent the transfer, siphoning or dissipation of funds and assets and to audit transactions. Sequestration shall not result in the take-over of the operations of the business, unless otherwise warranted by the exigencies of the situation or required in the national interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Co., Inc. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> this court discussed that <b>sequestration</b> is a provisional remedy and stated that:<br><blockquote>By the clear terms of the law, the power of the PCGG to sequester property claimed to be "ill-gotten" means to place or cause to be placed under its possession or control said property, or any building or office wherein any such property and any records pertaining thereto may be found, including "business enterprises and entities," — <i>for the purpose of preventing the destruction, concealment or dissipation of, and otherwise conserving and preserving, the same — until it can be determined, through appropriate judicial proceedings, whether the property was in truth "ill-gotten</i>," i.e., acquired through or as a result of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of funds belonging to the Government or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence, resulting in unjust enrichment of the ostensible owner and grave damage and prejudice to the State. And this, too, is the sense in which the term is commonly understood in other jurisdictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This court also clarified that <b>sequestration</b> does not have the effect of transferring title to the Presidential Commission on Good Government:<br><blockquote>One thing is certain, and should be stated at the outset: the PCGG <i>cannot exercise acts of dominion</i> over property sequestered, frozen or provisionally taken over. As already earlier stressed with no little insistence, the act of sequestration; freezing or provisional takeover of property does not import or bring about a divestment of title over said property; does not make the PCGG the owner thereof. In relation to the property sequestered, frozen or provisionally taken over, the <i>PCGG is a conservator, not an owner</i>. Therefore, it can not perform acts of strict ownership; and this is specially true in the situations contemplated by the sequestration rules where, unlike cases of receivership, for example, no court exercises effective supervision or can upon due application and hearing, grant authority for the performance of acts of dominion.<br><br>Equally evident is that the resort to the provisional remedies in question should entail the least possible interference with business operations or activities so that, in the event that the accusation of the business enterprise being "ill-gotten" be not proven, it may be returned to its rightful owner as far as possible in the same condition as it was at the time of sequestration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, when Pantranco was under sequestration, it remained to be a private corporation, and its funds also remained to be private. Although the Presidential Commission on Good Government is a government agency, it does not follow that Pantranco's funds were converted into public funds by the mere fact that its conservator was a government agency.<br><br>The effect of sequestration was also discussed in <i>Pacific Basin Securities Co., Inc. v. Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corporation</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Pacific Basin purchased shares of stock of Oriental Petroleum through a brokerage firm. It was found out later that the shares purchased by Pacific Basin were owned by Piedras Petroleum Mining Corporation, a sequestered corporation. Pacific Basin filed a Petition for Mandamus before the Securities and Exchange Commission because Oriental Petroleum, through its stock and transfer agent, would not transfer the shares to Pacific Basin. Oriental Petroleum argued that the shares were government-owned and could only be sold through public bidding under Proclamation No. 50.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> This court held that the sequestration of Piedras Petroleum did not automatically change the nature of the shares of stock from private property to government property. It further discussed that:<br><blockquote>A sequestration order is similar to the provisional remedy of Receivership under Rule 59 of the Rules of Court. The PCGG may thus exercise only powers of administration over the property or business sequestered or provisionally taken over so as to bring and defend actions in its own name; receive rents; collect debts due; pay outstanding debts; and generally do such other acts and things as may be necessary to fulfill its mission as conservator and administrator.<br><br>The PCGG, as a mere conservator, does not automatically become the owner of a sequestered property in behalf of the government. <i>There must be a final determination by the courts if the property is in fact "ill-gotten" and was acquired by using government funds. Thus, Ofriental] P[etroleum] and Minerals] Corporation] cannot conclusively claim that the subject shares are government property by virtue of a sequestration order on Piedras Petroleum</i>. Such conclusion is non sequitur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This court also held that the requirement of public bidding under Proclamation No. 50 does not apply because the shares of stock owned by Piedras Petroleum are privately owned. The assets required to undergo public bidding refer to assets that are government-owned. It was reiterated that:<br><blockquote>To repeat, the O[riental] P[etroleum] and M[inerals] C[orporation] shares originally owned by Piedras Petroleum, a sequestered corporation controlled by the nominees of PCGG, remain to be privately owned until such time when the court declares that the subject shares were acquired through government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br></blockquote>The sequestration of Pantranco was subsequently lifted and Pantranco was then placed under the management of Asset Privatization Trust. One of the powers of the Asset Privatization Trust is:<br><blockquote>Section 12. Powers. -<br><br>. . . .&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">To take title to and possession of and to take such steps as may be necessary to conserve assets transferred to it by the Committee, including, without limitation, to oversee the management and operation of corporations or other businesses constituting such assets, and to file suits and institute proceedings on behalf of and in the name of National Government for the recovery and protection of such assets[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Before the Asset Privatization Trust can "take title to and possession of assets, a deed of assignment must be executed, evidencing the transfer of assets in favor of national government. This requirement is provided under Section 24 of Proclamation No. 50, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 24.</b> <i>DEEDS OF ASSIGNMENT. Each government institution from which assets are to be transferred pursuant to this Proclamation shall and is hereby directed to execute, promptly and in no event later than thirty days after the issuance by the President of the relevant instrument referred to in Section 23 hereof a deed of assignment in favor of the National Government,</i> which shall, in annexes thereto, describe, account by account, the nature and extent of such assets and to deliver to the Committee such agreements, instruments, records and other papers in respect of such assets as may be deemed by the Committee to be reasonably necessary or appropriate. Each such deed of assignment shall constitute the Minister of Finance in representation of the National Government as attorney-in-fact of the government institution empowered to take such action and do such things as may be necessary or desirable to consolidate and perfect the title of the National Government to such assets, exercising for the purpose, any and all such rights and privileges appertaining to the transferor-government institution, pursuant to the provisions of applicable law or contract.<br><br>A copy of such deed of assignment, together with excerpts from its annexes describing particular property to be transferred, duly certified to be true by the appropriate official before a notary public or other official authorized by law to administer oaths, shall provide sufficient basis to registers of deeds, transfer agents of corporations and other persons authorized to issue certificates of titles, shares of stock and other evidence of title to issue new certificates, shares of stock or other instruments evidencing title to the assets so described to and in the name of the National Government or its duly authorized agent.<br><br>The transfer of any asset of government institutions directly to the national government as mandated herein shall be for the purpose of disposition, liquidation and/or privatization only, any import in the covering deed of assignment to the contrary notwithstanding. <i>Such transfer, therefore, shall not operate to revert such assets automatically to the general fund or the national patrimony, and shall not require specific enabling legislation to authorize their subsequent disposition</i>, but shall remain as duly appropriated public properties earmarked for assignment, transfer or conveyance under the signature of the Minister of Finance or his duly authorized representative, who is hereby authorized for this purpose, to any disposition entity approved by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Proclamation. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, petitioner did not present the Deed of Assignment that would show that Pantranco or its assets had been transferred to national government. Hence, while petitioner acts as the manager of Pantranco, it has not necessarily acquired ownership over Pantranco's assets. To rule that all assets under the management of petitioner are automatically converted to government property is dangerous because it may affect the rights of creditors. As held by this court, a private corporation remains to be private unless there is a final determination by the courts that it was acquired through the use of ill-gotten wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>Forfeiture is another mode where ownership of a private corporation is transferred to government. In <i>Major General Garcia v. Sandiganabayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> it was discussed that the effect of forfeiture "is to transfer the title to the specific thing from the owner to the sovereign power."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> In this case, there was no mention of whether Pantranco was forfeited. Thus, in the absence of evidence that Pantranco and its assets are ill-gotten, or that it has been forfeited, Pantranco remains to be a private corporation.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents presented enough evidence to prove the private character of the funds. They were able to show the source of the subject funds and how the amount of P29,816,225.91<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> was deposited in trust for Pantranco. As found by the Court of Appeals, the amount of P20 million was transferred by Pantranco to petitioner to comply with the bond requirement in the Imexco case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> The principal amount earned interest and increased to P29,816,225.91. Petitioner did not refute this fact. Instead, it argued that Pantranco was indebted to Philippine National Bank, and Philippine National Bank assigned Pantranco's indebtedness to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>During a hearing, Atty. Jose Sison, then Associate Trustee and Chief Legal Officer of petitioner, testified:<br><blockquote>Q: Mr. Witness, during your direct testimony, you presented and identified a Loan Agreement between Pantranco North Express, Inc. and Philippine National Bank.

Among collections undertaken by A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] are the deposits of borrowers particularly deposits to the Philippine National Bank which has been assigned to the National Government. This particular deposit was collected by A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] from the Philippine National Bank for the account of Pantranco North Express, Inc.

Sison in his testimony, which would prove that petitioner was authorized to collect Pantranco's debt to Philippine National Bank, was never presented. The Court of Appeals discussed that under Section 23 of Proclamation No. 50, petitioner must first identify the assets to be divested or collected in an appropriate instrument before it can actually proceed with the divestment or collection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> Since no deed of assignment was presented, the argument of petitioner that it could collect Pantranco's indebtedness cannot be given merit.<br><br>Also, Atty.

An alias writ of execution was issued and a notice of garnishment was served upon the Land Bank of the Philippines, stating that the garnishment was "upon all credits, interest, bank deposits belonging to respondent Pantranco North Express, Inc. or the respondent Asset Privatization Trust."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> Land Bank replied that since Asset Privatization Trust is a government agency, its funds is not subject to garnishment:<br><blockquote>A matter that must not be overlooked is the fact that the inclusion of A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] as a respondent in the monetary claims against PNEI is merely the consequence, of its being a conservator of assets, a role that A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] normally plays in, or the relationship that ordinarily it maintains with, corporations identified for and while under privatization. The liability of A[sset] P[rivatization] T[rust] under this particular arrangement, nothing else having been shown, should be co­extensive with the amount of assets taken over from the privatized firm. <i>PNEI's assets obviously remain to be subject to execution by judgment creditors of PNEI.

A Notice of Garnishment was served upon Philippine National Bank, being the depository of the funds belonging to the Bureau of Public Highways. The amount garnished was released by the Philippine National bank to the estate of Tomas N. Hashim. Thus, the Commissioner of Public Highways, through then Solicitor General Felix V.
