De Ocampo likewise did not leave any property as certified by the provincial and city assessors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>We resolve the following issues:<br><br>First, whether respondents Oscar Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation are entitled to an award of damages from the Assurance Fund under Section 95 of Presidential Decree No. 1529; and<br><br>Second, whether respondents Oscar Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation should have impleaded Alfredo de Ocampo in their Complaint for recovery of damages from the Assurance Fund.<br><br>We grant the Petition.<br><br>Respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation do not meet the criteria set to recover damages from the Assurance Fund.<br><br>We rule that respondent Anglo, Sr. in the sale transaction on January 6, 1966 acted in good faith. However, he no longer had an interest over the lots after he had transferred these to respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation in exchange for shares of stock. Hence, he no longer has a claim from the Assurance Fund. On the other hand, respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation cannot be considered a transferee in good faith, considering it was aware of the title's notices of lis pendens. Hence, it also has no right to claim damages from the Assurance Fund.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>A certificate of title or a Torrens<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> title has special characteristics:<br><blockquote>Under the Land Registration Act, title to the property covered by a Torrens title becomes <i>indefeasible</i> after the expiration of one year from the entry of the decree of registration. The decree is <i>incontrovertible</i> and becomes <i>binding on all persons</i> whether or not they were notified of, or participated in, the in rem registration process. . . <i>A Torrens title is the best evidence of ownership of registered land</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Every certificate of title contains an attestation that the person named is the owner of the property described in the certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Hence, "every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued therefor and the law will in no way oblige him to go behind the certificate to determine the condition of the property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> When a certificate of title is clean and free from any encumbrance, potential purchasers have every right to rely on such certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Individuals who rely on a clean certificate of title in making the decision to purchase the real property are often referred to as "innocent purchasers for value"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and "in good faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In addition, this court has recognized the rule of caveat emptor, which translates to "buyer beware."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In order to exercise the diligence required by the rule, every potential purchaser must inspect the real property's certificate of title. "The rule of caveat emptor requires the purchaser to be aware of the supposed title of the vendor and one who buys without checking the vendor's title takes all the risks and losses consequent to such failure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>In cases involving caveat emptor, this court reminds purchasers that their rights are always limited by the rights of the seller as stated in the certificates of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The limitations to ownership over the property, such as additional liens and mortgages, should be ascertained by the purchaser.<br><br>It is not enough that interested purchasers rely on the copy of the certificate of title presented by the seller. In the exercise of caveat emptor, interested purchasers must check if the seller's certificate of title corresponds to the public record of the certificate in the Registry of Deeds.<br><br>Business transactions are facilitated by government's guarantees made through the Torrens system. Every interested buyer of real property presumes that the seller may not be providing him or her complete information. In economics, this problem is called information asymmetry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Hence, prospective buyers need a reliable system to assess the validity of the information communicated by their sellers.<br><br>Our property registration system corrects the information asymmetry by making sure pertinent information about the property, such as its registered owner, or any encumbrances made over the property, are of public record. Laws such as Presidential Decree No. 1529 and its predecessor, Act No. 496, ensure that the registration of property goes through a vetting process that is <i>in rem</i> and binds not only government but the whole world.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Without the indefeasibility of titles, purchasers will be forced to conduct meticulous due diligence over every real property they are about to buy. This will require them to hire lawyers and private investigators just to ensure that the property is free from adverse claims. Hence, transaction costs of purchasing real property will increase, which will be detrimental to commerce.<br><br>However, the Torrens system is not infallible. It is possible that through fraud or error, a person who is not the owner acquires a certificate of title over property. The law thus created an Assurance Fund to address this possibility.<br><br>Under Presidential Decree No. 1529, for every certificate of title issued to a registered owner of the property, building, or other improvements, the registered owner contributes "one-fourth of one per cent of the assessed value of the real estate on the basis of the last assessment for taxation purposes, as contribution to the Assurance Fund."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> If the property has not yet been assessed for taxation purposes, the contribution will be based on the value determined by two disinterested persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> These collections are pooled together under the custody of the National Treasurer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Estrellado and Alcantara v. Martinez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> this court explained the purpose of the Assurance Fund as created under Act No. 496, the predecessor of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><blockquote>The authors of the Torrens system also wisely included provisions intended to safeguard the rights of prejudiced parties rightfully entitled to an interest in land but shut off from obtaining titles thereto. As suppletory to the registration of titles, pecuniary compensation by way of damages was provided for in certain cases for persons who had lost their property. For this purpose, an assurance fund was created. But the assurance fund was not intended to block any right which a person might have against another for the loss of his land. Damages were not to be recoverable from the assurance fund when they could be recovered from the person who caused the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote>This court further explained that "[t]he Assurance Fund is intended to relieve innocent persons from the harshness of the doctrine that a certificate is conclusive evidence of an indefeasible title to land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>An individual who relied on the validity of a certificate of title should not be prejudiced by fraud committed during the original registration, nor should he or she be prejudiced by the error, omission, mistake, or misdescription in the certificate of title caused by court personnel or the Register of Deeds, his or her deputy, or other employees of the Registry. Hence, under Section 95 of Presidential Decree No. 1529:<br><blockquote>SEC. 95. <i>Action for compensation from funds</i>.â€”A person who, without negligence on his part, sustains loss or damage, or is deprived of land or any estate or interest therein in consequence of the bringing of the land under the operation of the Torrens system of arising after original registration of land, through fraud or in consequence of any error, omission, mistake or misdescription in any certificate of title or in any entry or memorandum in the registration book, and who by the provisions of this Decree is barred or otherwise precluded under the provision of any law from bringing an action for the recovery of such land or the estate or interest therein, may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of damages to be paid out of the Assurance Fund.<br></blockquote>In <i>Spouses De Guzman, Jr. v.

For reference, the provision on the Assurance Fund under Act No. 496 states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 101. Any person who without negligence on his part sustains loss or damage through any omission, mistake, or misfeasance of the clerk, or register of deeds, or of any examiner of titles, or of any deputy or clerk of the register of deeds in the performance of their respective duties under the provisions of this Act, and any person who is wrongfully deprived of any land or any interest therein, without negligence on his part, through the bringing of the same under the provisions of this Act or by the registration of any other person as owner of such land, or by any mistake, omission, or misdescription in any certificate or owner's duplicate, or in any entry or memorandum in the register or other official book, or by any cancellation, and who by the provisions of this Act is barred or in any way precluded from bringing an action for the recovery of such land or interest therein, or claim upon the same, may bring in any court of competent jurisdiction an action against the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago for the recovery of damages to be paid out of the assurance fund.<br></blockquote>The governing law at the time of the transactions in this case is Presidential Decree No. 1529. Based solely on Section 95 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the following conditions must be met: First, the individual must sustain loss or damage, or the individual is deprived of land or any estate or interest. Second, the individual must not be negligent. Third, the loss, damage, or deprivation is the consequence of either (a) fraudulent registration under the Torrens system after the land's original registration, or (b) any error, omission, mistake, or misdescription in any certificate of title or in any entry or memorandum in the registration book. Fourth, the individual must be barred or otherwise precluded under the provision of any law from bringing an action for the recovery of such land or the estate or interest therein.<br><br>In the earliest case of <i>La Urbana v.

In <i>Treasurer of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> the seller was not the real owner of the property. The seller found a way to judicially reconstitute the title and pretended to be the owner of the property described in the title. The seller found a buyer for the property. However, two years after, the real owner discovered the sale and sued to have the sale made by the impostor declared null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>In Treasurer of the Philippines, this court denied the claim from the Assurance Fund because the "sale conveyed no title or any interest at all to [the buyers] for the simple reason that the supposed vendor had no title or interest to transfer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br><i>Treasurer of the Philippines</i> and a similar case, <i>Spouses De Guzman, Jr.</i>, do not apply squarely to this case. In this case, there are two different certificates of title, one in favor of de Ocampo and the other in favor of the Bureau of Education, covering the same lots. In <i>Treasurer of the Philippines</i> and <i>Spouses De Guzman, Jr.</i>, the spurious titles involve the same certificate of title.<br><br>In addition, we need to depart from the rule in <i>Treasurer of the Philippines</i> and <i>Spouses De Guzman, Jr.</i> that the sale conveyed no interest to the buyer because the vendor did not have title. We emphasize that certificates of title, especially if in their original form and backed by the Register of Deeds, may be relied upon by purchasers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> Innocent purchasers should not be prejudiced by individuals who only appear to be owners but are not the actual owners. However, there should be complete compliance with the requirements of Section 95.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation appear to have similar interests. However, in evaluating compliance with Section 95, they have to be treated as separate entities with different legal personalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals' Decisions treated respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation as a single party.<br><br>Respondent Anglo, Sr. meets the second requirement of claiming from the Assurance Fund. He was a buyer in good faith, and negligence cannot be attributed to him when he bought the lots. The encumbrances on de Ocampo's original certificate of title did not include the claims of the Republic at the time respondent Anglo, Sr. purchased the lots. The other encumbrances pointed out by the Republic may co-exist with the peaceful ownership of respondent Anglo, Sr. over the lots. In the annotations on de Ocampo's original certificate of title, the claims of a certain Alfred Maranon were only with respect to 35% of de Ocampo's lots,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> while respondent Anglo, Sr. purchased only 65% of the lots. The other claims were attorney's liens of de Ocampo's lawyer and another claim from another lawyer, and these liens covered only part of the value of the lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Despite buying the properties in good faith and for value, respondent Anglo, Sr. does not meet the first and third requirements under Section 95. It is clear that there is no error, omission, mistake, or misdescription in de Ocampo's certificate of title. We also find that the fraudulent registration is not the cause of the loss suffered by respondent Anglo, Sr.<br><br>On May 17, 1976, respondent Anglo, Sr. conveyed the lots to respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation and, in exchange, he received 3,150 shares with par value of P100.00 each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> He could not have suffered loss because he was able to obtain P315,000.00 for the lots. Even when his son, as First Vice President of respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> testified that his "father lost [the] land,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> it is not clear if that meant respondent Anglo, Sr. incurred a liability with respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation due to an agreement that he would be liable for any adverse decision of the court.<br><br>Respondent Anglo, Sr. only suffered loss because of the subsequent agreement between him and respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation. In the Board Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> dated June 7, 1976, respondent Anglo, Sr. agreed "to solely assume whatever liabilities that may arise from the adverse decision finally rendered over the property conveyed[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> This undertaking caused the loss for respondent Anglo, Sr., and not de Ocampo's fraudulent registration of the lots. Respondent Anglo, Sr. shed his rights as an innocent purchaser for value but, instead, acted as a surety to respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation. He may have sustained a loss, but it was under a different capacity.<br><br>Whatever good faith that had attached during respondent Anglo, Sr.'s transaction with de Ocampo no longer existed by the time he took the undertaking with respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation. On June 7, 1976, the adverse claim of the Republic was already known to the world because of the notices of lis pendens on respondent Anglo, Sr.'s transfer certificate of title. When respondent Anglo, Sr. transferred the lots to respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation, he already knew of the conflicting claims of ownership over the lots.<br><br><center>III<br><br></center>Respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation is presumed to have taken cognizance of the notices of lis pendens as well. Its act of entering into a Deed of Conveyance with respondent Anglo, Sr. is an act of negligence on the part of respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation; hence, this act fails to comply with the second requirement under Section 95 of Presidential Decree a No. 1529.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Leyson v. Hon. TaÃ±ada, et al.</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> the certificate of title had also contained a notice of lis pendens before the property was sold at a public auction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> This court ruled that the purchaser at the public auction was "bound by the outcome of the [pending litigation.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Similarly, respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation's awareness of the notices of lis pendens makes it bound to the Court of Appeals' decision that the lots belong to the Bureau of Education.<br><br>Respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation also does not meet the first requisite of a loss because it no longer suffered a loss due to respondent Anglo, Sr.'s undertaking to assume all liability in the agreement dated June 7, 1976.<br><br>Respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation is not precluded by law from bringing an action against respondent Anglo, Sr. for the loss it sustained. On the other hand, respondent Anglo, Sr. is barred from recovering the land because its current owner, the Bureau of Education, holds a valid certificate of title over the lots. Respondent Anglo, Sr. meets the last requisite for a claim from the Assurance Fund. However, due to non-compliance with all the requirements under Section 95, respondent Anglo, Sr. is barred from his claim.<br><br>Respondent Anglo, Sr. would have met the requirements for claims from the Assurance Fund had he not conveyed the properties to respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation. The purpose of the Assurance Fund would be fulfilled because respondent Anglo, Sr. purchased the properties in good faith, not knowing that there was another titleholder over the same properties. Eventually, respondent Anglo, Sr. would realize that the business transaction involved properties whose title had severe defects. However, instead of going after his rights under the Assurance Fund, respondent Anglo, Sr. made the conscious choice of recovering the value of the properties he purchased by selling the properties to another buyer. This bars respondent Anglo, Sr. from making a subsequent claim from the Assurance Fund because that will be tantamount to unjust enrichment.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Anglo Agricultural Corporation was aware of the properties' defects when respondent Anglo, Sr. conveyed the properties to the corporation. The Deed of Conveyance even recognized the notices of lis pendens in the title. The law does not protect parties who knowingly enter into risky business transactions. It is part of the freedom to contract, and the state is not mandated to insure parties who enter into risky business transactions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> As this court has stated in <i>La Urbana</i>:<br><blockquote>Plaintiffs negligence is manifest in the instant case because with its knowledge of the pending litigations and of the notices of <i>lis pendens</i> it should not have taken the risk of purchasing the property if it had acted prudently. As it chose to run the risk, it must suffer the consequences of its own acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>With respect to compliance with the procedural requirement under Presidential Decree No. 1529, respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation were able to substantially comply with the need to implead the person causing the fraud.<br><br>Section 96,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> in relation to Section 97,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> requires that the person causing the fraud, in this case, de Ocampo, should be impleaded in the claim for damages. Respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation did not include de Ocampo as a party when they filed for their claims from the Assurance Fund.<br><br>However, in the proceedings before the Regional Trial Court, respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation presented evidence with respect to the death of de Ocampo and the absence of properties that could constitute his estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> The Republic did not present countervailing evidence to show that de Ocampo or his estate was still a viable party. Using preponderance of evidence, the Regional Trial Court could reasonably conclude that de Ocampo can no longer be impleaded.<br><br>The Assurance Fund is only liable in the last resort, as suggested under Section 97 of Presidential Decree No. 1529. The person causing the fraud or the error should be liable first. However, if the judgment cannot be executed, the Assurance Fund is the insurance to the innocent purchaser for value who relied on the validity of the real property's certificate of title. In showing that the person causing the fraud passed away and did not leave property, it meant that the state cannot execute a judgment granting the innocent purchaser's claim from such person. It excuses the claimant from impleading the person causing the fraud or his estate in the Petition because in this situation, the judgment may only be enforced against the Assurance Fund.<br><br>Despite substantial compliance with the requirement to implead the person who caused the fraud, this does not cure the non-conformity of respondents Anglo, Sr. and Anglo Agricultural Corporation's claim with the requirements set in Section 95 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
