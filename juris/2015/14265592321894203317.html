Dayo’s claim for death benefits.<br><br>To support her claim for death benefits, petitioner cites Section 20(A), paragraphs (1) and (4) of the 2000 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA SEC)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which state that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 20.

Petitioner also argues that:<br><br><blockquote>[she] was not merely faking [her] husband’s disability.&nbsp; The Medical Records cannot lie and he was seen by a doctor abroad regarding his illness which eventually [brought] about his death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner cites Section 20(A), paragraphs (1) and (4) to support her claim for death benefits.&nbsp; She also cites the second paragraph of Section 20(B) to support her claim for reimbursement of medical and transportation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The 2000 POEA SEC defines work-related illness as “any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this contract with the conditions set therein satisfied.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The facts of this case indicate that the physician in Barbados diagnosed Eduardo with hypertension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; He underwent 2D echocardiogram at the Lucena United Doctors Hospital, and the results were interpreted by Dr. Olitoquit as normal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; When Eduardo was examined by the company-designated physician, he admitted that he had been suffering from diabetes mellitus and hypertension since the 1990s.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; This shows that his illness was pre-existing.&nbsp; His cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The 2000 POEA SEC recognizes that the list of illnesses under Section 32 is not exhaustive.&nbsp; In <i>Sea Power Shipping Enterprises, Inc. v. Salazar,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> this court explained that:<br><br><blockquote>[u]nlike Section 20(A), Section 32-A of the POEA Contract considers the possibility of compensation for the death of the seafarer occurring after the termination of the employment contract on account of a work-related illness.&nbsp; But, for death under this provision to be compensable, the claimant must fulfill the following:<br><br><ol><li>The seafarer’s work must involve the risks describe herein;<br><br></li><li>The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer’s exposure to the described risks;<br><br></li><li>The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it;<br><br></li><li>There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><i>Magsaysay Maritime Services v. Laurel</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> also recognized that the nature of employment can possibly aggravate a pre-existing illness.&nbsp; However, the causation between the nature of employment and the aggravation of the illness must still be proven before compensation may be granted.<br><br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that for illness to be compensable, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer.&nbsp; It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Petitioner was unable to fulfill these requirements.&nbsp; She did not allege how the nature of Eduardo’s work as a bosun<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> contributed to the development or the aggravation of his illness.&nbsp; Further, he himself admitted that he had diabetes and hypertension prior to his embarkation.&nbsp; Considering that diabetes mellitus is not listed as an occupational disease under the 2000 POEA SEC and considering that petitioner did not prove how Eduardo’s occupation contributed to the development of his illness, no error can be attributed to the Court of Appeals when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission’s Decision and Resolution.<br><br>Petitioner further argues that respondents should not be absolved from any liability simply because Eduardo died after the term of his contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Indeed, it is quite possible that a work-related illness may progress at a slow pace such that a seafarer’s death will happen beyond the term of the employment contract.&nbsp; In such cases, the provisions of the POEA SEC should not limit the rights of seafarers to be compensated.<br><br>The concurring opinion in <i>Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Creer III</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> discussed that:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he Philippine Overseas Employment Administration or POEA regulations require certain provisions to be put in the employment contract.&nbsp; Necessarily, it prescribes a procedure that finds a balance of interest in both the amount and the process for recovery of compensation as a result of occupational hazards suffered by the seafarer.&nbsp; The cause of action in such recovery is based on contract inclusive of both statutory and regulatory provisions impliedly included in it.<br><br>While this may be the theory pursued in practice, substantive law still allows recovery of damages for injuries suffered by the seafarer as a result of a tortious violation on the part of the employer.&nbsp; This may be on the basis of the provisions of the Civil Code as well as special laws.&nbsp; These special laws may relate, among others, to environmental regulations and requirements to ensure the reduction of risks to occupational hazards both for the seafarer and the public in general.&nbsp; In such cases, the process for recovery should not be constrained by contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br>However, petitioner did not allege facts that would sway this court to grant the Petition.&nbsp; She did not present evidence to show how Eduardo’s diabetes mellitus was aggravated by his work and how his illness caused his death.&nbsp; On the contrary, petitioner’s allegations further convinced this court that the Court of Appeals did not err in its Decision.&nbsp; A portion of the Petition for Review reads:<br><br><blockquote>12.3 In the case at bar, it bears to stress that Mr. Dayo was certified as “fit to work” based on a pre-employment medical examination.&nbsp; He was deployed on 8 June 2008 and was repatriated on 7 September 2008 due to HYPERTENSION.&nbsp; Upon his arrival in the Philippines, respondents refused to provide Mr. Dayo medical assistance.&nbsp; But due to his critical condition, Mr. Dayo went to Lucena United Doctors Hospital for medical evaluations.&nbsp; He was advi[sed] to undergo [a] series of medical and laboratory tests.&nbsp; Thereafter, Dr. Olitoquit, Mr. Dayo’s attending physician, came up with a conclusion that: “NORMAL LEFT VENT[R]ICULAR&nbsp; DIMENSION WITH ADEQUATE WALL MOTION AND CONTRACTILITY; NORMAL LEFT AND RIGHT ATRIA, RIGHT VENTRICLE, MAIN PULMONARY ARTERY AND AORTIC ROOT DIMENSION’S [sic]. STRUCTURALLY NORMAL TRICUSPID, PULMONIC, MITRAL AND AORTIC VALVE. CONCLUSION: NORMAL 2D ECHO-CARDIOGRAM STUDY.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote><br>From petitioner’s allegations, it is clear that Eduardo’s physician found him to have a “normal 2D echocardiogram study.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; This disproves petitioner’s allegation that Eduardo’s illness and death were work-related.<br><br>Regarding Eduardo’s “fit to work” certification, this court has previously ruled that the pre-employment medical examination (PEME) is not exploratory and while:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he PEME merely determines whether one is “fit to work” at sea or “fit for sea service,” it does not state the real state of health of an applicant.&nbsp; In short, the “fit to work” declaration in the respondent’s PEME cannot be a conclusive proof to show that he was free from any ailment prior to his deployment.&nbsp; Thus we held in <i>NYK-F[il] Ship Management, Inc. v. NLRC</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>While a PEME may reveal enough for the petitioner (vessel) to decide whether a seafarer is fit for overseas employment, it may not be relied upon to inform petitioners of a seafarer’s true state of health.&nbsp; The PEME could not have divulged respondent’s illness considering that the examinations were not exploratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>While we commiserate with petitioner, this petition must be denied for failure to show any reversible error on the part of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It is true that labor contracts are construed in favor of the employee.&nbsp; However, the facts of this case and the applicable laws show that the grant of death benefits cannot be justified.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this court resolves to deny the Petition.&nbsp; The assailed Court of Appeals Decision and Resolution are hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>*</sup></font> Del Castillo,</i> and <i>Mendoza, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated acting member per S.O.
