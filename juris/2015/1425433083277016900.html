Desuasido (SPO1 Desuasido).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; From their testimonies, the following version emerged:<br><br>The Chief of Police of Tabaco City instructed PO2 Martirez and SPO4 Bonavente to conduct a buy-bust operation on appellant after receiving information that he was selling illegal drugs.&nbsp; Thus, on October 21, 2002, PO2 Martirez arranged for Borlagdan, a police asset, to act as a poseur-buyer and gave him four P100 bills as marked money.&nbsp; PO2 Martirez, SPO4 Bonavente and Borlagdan proceeded to <i>Purok</i> 4, Sto. Cristo, Tabaco City to entrap appellant.<br><br>Upon their arrival, Borlagdan walked towards a house which is under construction. PO2 Martirez and SPO4 Bonavente, on the other hand, hid behind houses which were about seven meters away from where Borlagdan was.&nbsp; Borlagdan approached appellant who was then working at the construction site and asked if he could purchase <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; When an agreement was reached, Borlagdan handed over the marked money to the appellant while the latter, in turn, gave him two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; After the transaction, Borlagdan walked towards the place where PO2 Martirez and SPO4 Bonavente were hiding.&nbsp; When he passed by them, Borlagdan nodded his head as a signal that the sale was already consummated and gave the sachets to PO2 Martirez.&nbsp; Thereupon, the police officers came out of hiding. They immediately approached appellant who threw something on the ground.&nbsp; PO2 Martirez arrested appellant and brought him to the police station.&nbsp; SPO4 Bonavente who was left behind searched the place where he saw appellant throw something and found therein a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; He also summoned for the owner of the house being constructed and asked for appellant’s belongings.&nbsp; He was given a backpack which he brought to the police station.<br><br>Meanwhile at the police station, PO2 Martirez ordered appellant to empty his pockets and recovered from him one of the four P100 bills used as marked money.&nbsp; PO2 Martirez then turned over the said marked money and the two plastic sachets to the police investigator.&nbsp; When SPO4 Bonavente arrived, he likewise gave appellant’s backpack to the police investigator, who, in turn, searched the same.&nbsp; Found therein were more sachets containing white crystalline substance.<br><br>Two days later, five sachets with white crystalline substance were referred and delivered to the crime laboratory for examination which all tested positive for <i>shabu, viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>Five (5) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets marked as “A” through “E” each with white crystalline substance having the following markings and recorded net weights:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="33%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A = 3.7240 gram[s] </div></td> <td width="31%"><div align="JUSTIFY">B = 0.8642 gram</div></td> <td width="36%"><div align="JUSTIFY">C = 0.0513 gram<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">D = 0.0336 gram</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">E = 0.0313 gram</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant and two others, namely, Lourdes Benavides and Elsa San Buenaventura, both residents of <i>Purok</i> 4, Sto. Cristo, Tabaco who claimed to have witnessed appellant’s arrest, testified for the defense.&nbsp; Their version of the incident is as follows:<br><br>While appellant was working at the construction site, Robert Sierra (Sierra) arrived and asked if there is a vacancy.&nbsp; When appellant said that he had to ask the owner first, Sierra departed.&nbsp; A few minutes later, PO2 Martirez and SPO4 Bonavente arrived and arrested appellant.&nbsp; They took him to the police station.&nbsp; Thereat, PO2 Martirez opened appellant’s bag which was brought to the station by SPO4 Bonavente.&nbsp; After asking him to identify the same, PO2 Martirez placed something inside the bag and then closed it.&nbsp; Appellant was then ordered to open the bag.&nbsp; When he complied, pictures of him holding the bag and the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance were taken.&nbsp; PO2 Martirez also inserted a P100 bill into the back pocket of his pants and thereafter presented him to the Chief of Police.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>The RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses.&nbsp; It convicted appellant of the offense charged and disposed of the case in its December 3, 2007 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, from the foregoing, accused Jomer Butial is hereby found GUILTY of Violation of Section 5, Article II, Republic Act [No.] 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.&nbsp; Costs against accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant filed a notice of appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which was approved by the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the records of the case were transmitted to the CA where the appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03170.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Finding the RTC’s conviction of appellant to be well-supported by evidence, the CA, in its February 26, 2010 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DISMISSED for lack of merit and the challenged Decision dated December 3, 2007 in Criminal Case No. T-3864 is AFFIRMED in TOTO.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>For the first time in this appeal, appellant questions his warrantless arrest.&nbsp; He posits that his arrest was illegal since he was not arrested in <i>flagrante delicto</i>.&nbsp; The police officers did not have personal knowledge that he was committing a crime as they were hiding behind houses seven meters away from the place where the alleged transaction took place and did not actually see the whole incident.&nbsp; This being the case, the sachets allegedly seized from him cannot be used in evidence against him being “fruits of a poisonous tree.”&nbsp; Appellant also contends that the prosecution was unable to prove all the elements of the offense of illegal sale of drugs.&nbsp; He likewise points to the failure of the police officers to properly observe the procedure outlined in Section 21, RA 9165 and argues that the same constitutes a break in the chain of custody.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal must be granted.<br><br><i>The prosecution failed to show that the<br>identity and integrity of the corpus delicti <br>have been preserved.</i><br><br>There is merit in appellant’s contention that not all elements of the offense of illegal sale of shabu were proven and that there were unexplained gaps and irregularities in the chain of custody of the seized items.<br><br>In a successful prosecution for the illegal sale of drugs, there must be evidence of the following elements: “(1) the identities of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The evidence of <i>corpus delicti</i> must also be established beyond doubt.&nbsp; In this case, the <i>shabu</i> “constitutes the very<i> corpus delicti </i>of the offense and in sustaining a conviction under [RA 9165], the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> must definitely be shown to have been preserved.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> “The chain of custody requirement performs this function in buy-bust operations as it ensures that doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The initial link in the chain of custody starts with the seizure of the plastic sachets from appellant and their marking by the apprehending officer.&nbsp; “Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link, thus it is vital that the seized contraband is immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference.&nbsp; The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the<i> corpus</i> of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed at the end of criminal proceedings, obviating switching, ‘planting,’ or contamination of evidence.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; A review of the records, however, reveals that the confiscated sachets subject of the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> were not marked.&nbsp; PO2 Martirez, himself, admitted that he did not put any markings on the two plastic sachets that were handed to him by Borlagdan after the latter’s purchase of the same from appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; While he mentioned that the police investigator to whom he turned over the items wrote something down or made some initials thereon, he nevertheless could not remember who wrote the initials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; And albeit later, PO2 Martirez identified the police investigator as SPO1 Desuasido,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the latter, however, when called to the witness stand, did not testify that he made any markings on the said sachets or, at the very least, that he received the same from PO2 Martirez.&nbsp; His testimony merely focused on the fact that he prepared the affidavit of a certain Baltazar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>While SPO4 Bonavente testified that he put markings on several sachets of <i>shabu</i> allegedly seized from appellant, it cannot be gathered from his testimony that the ones he marked were those sachets subject of this case.&nbsp; Instead, what it suggests is that those he marked were the sachets belonging to appellant which he subsequently recovered, <i>i.e.</i>, the one allegedly thrown away by appellant and picked up by SPO4 Bonavente from the ground, and those found inside appellant’s bag, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="25%"><div align="JUSTIFY">[PROS.

Only the heat-sealed transparent plastic supposedly containing them has the marking letter “I,” which holds no significance as the making of the said marking is also not supported by any testimony during trial.<br><br>Clearly, the absence of markings creates an uncertainty that the two sachets seized during the buy-bust operation were part of the five sachets submitted to the police crime laboratory.&nbsp; The prosecution’s evidence failed to establish the marking of the two sachets of <i>shabu</i> subject of this case, which is the first link in the chain of custody and which would have shown that the shabu presented in evidence was the same specimen bought from appellant during the buy-bust operation.&nbsp; The lack of certainty therefore on a crucial element of the crime <i>i.e.,</i> the identity of the <i>corpus delicti, </i>warrants the reversal of the judgment of conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The failure of the prosecution to identify the <i>corpus delicti </i>is more glaring after considering that none of the five sachets submitted to the police crime laboratory for qualitative examination and turned out positive for <i>shabu</i> weighed close to the two plastic sachets that had an approximate weight of 0.1 gram each as stated in the Information.&nbsp; As previously mentioned, the police officers sent five sachets that were marked and given corresponding weights, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="33%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A = 3.7240 gram[s] </div></td> <td width="31%"><div align="JUSTIFY">B = 0.8642 gram</div></td> <td width="36%"><div align="JUSTIFY">C = 0.0513 gram<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">D = 0.0336 gram</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">E = 0.0313 gram</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>It therefore appears that the sachets of <i>shabu</i> confiscated during the buy-bust operation are totally different from the sachets forwarded to the police crime laboratory and thereafter presented in evidence.<br><br>As a final note, it does not escape the Court’s attention that there was also no testimony from the police officers that they conducted a physical inventory and took photographs of the sachets of<i> shabu</i> confiscated from appellant pursuant to Section 21(1)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of Article II of RA 9165.&nbsp; Their sworn statements did not mention any inventory-taking or photographing of the same.&nbsp; They also did not bother to offer any justification for this omission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; At this point, it is apt to restate the Court’s pronouncement in <i>People v.

However, it is of paramount importance that the procedures laid down by law be complied with, especially those that involve the chain of custody of the illegal drugs.
