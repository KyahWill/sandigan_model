				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 04533 dated 25 May 2012 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lagawe, Ifugao, Branch 14, in Criminal Cases No. 1146-A and No. 1146-B, finding accused-appellant Henry Caladcadan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified rape.<br><br>Accused-appellant was charged with two counts of rape in two Informations which read:<br><blockquote>Criminal Case No. 1146-A<br><br>That on or about the evening of June 21, 1999, at Tinoc, Ifugao Province[,] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, the father of herein victim, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously by means offeree and intimidation, have carnal knowledge of his own daughter [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a minor[,] 16 years of age, against her will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Criminal Case No. 1146-B<br><br>That on or about the evening of June 23, 1999, at Tinoc, Ifugao Province[,] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, the father of herein victim, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously by means of force and intimidation, have carnal knowledge of his own daughter [AAA], a minor[,] 16 years of age, against her will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon filing his counter-affidavit in December 1999, accused-appellant disappeared. The case was archived until he was arrested on 20 March 2009. On arraignment, accused-appellant entered a "not guilty" plea to the offense charged. During the pre-trial, accused-appellant admitted that AAA is his daughter. The case went through a full trial.<br><br>The prosecution presented AAA, her mother BBB, and psychologist Claire Baliaga (Baliaga) as an expert witness who testified on the following facts:<br><br>AAA, then 16 years old, lived in a two-storey house with her parents and two siblings. On the night of 21 June 1999, she was sleeping in one of the two rooms on the second floor when accused-appellant suddenly entered her room and forcibly removed her pants and her underwear. AAA tried to resist but accused-appellant was too strong. Accused-appellant managed to insert his penis into AAA's vagina while covering her mouth to prevent her from shouting. Two days later, AAA was sleeping in her parents' bedroom when accused-appellant again crept into bed with her and mounted her. On both occasions, AAA's siblings were sleeping in the other room, while BBB was in Baguio City. AAA did not tell her mother what had happened because accused-appellant had threatened to burn the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sometime in October 1999, BBB observed something unusual in AAA's body. She asked AAA to lie down in bed while she examined the latter's stomach. BBB realized that AAA was pregnant. She immediately asked AAA who got her impregnated and the latter answered that it was accused-appellant, her father. BBB then went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) office-to ask for help. The DSWD referred her to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). The NBI took AAA's statement. She was also examined by a medico-legal officer from the NBI. AAA gave birth on 27 March 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Baliaga testified that she conducted a mental evaluation on AAA, and tests revealed that AAA was suffering from mild retardation and could not give intelligent consent to the act complained about.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant denied that he raped AAA. In his defense, accused-appellant testified that on the date when the first rape took place, he was in their house sleeping; and on the date of the second rape incident, he was in the boarding house of a certain Ricardo Mayomes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> During the cross-examination, accused-appellant stated that AAA had a boyfriend, Accused-appellant explained that he disappeared for nine years because he was trying to save money so he could hire his own counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 5 May 2010, accused-appellant was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the [c]ourt finds accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified rape and hereby imposes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without the benefit of xxx parole. The [c]ourt further orders accused to pay the sum of Seventy Five Thousand (Php75,000.00) Pesos as indemnity, another Seventy Five Thousand (Php75,000.00) Pesos as moral damages and exemplary damages in the amount of Thirty Thousand (Php30,000.00) Pesos. He is further ordered to recognize the child begotten as a result of the crime of rape named CCC as his illegitimate child and to give support to the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 25 June 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 25 May 2012, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed decision affirming with modification the trial court's decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <i>Appeal</i> is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. The <i>Decision</i> of conviction dated 5 May 2010 of the Regional Trial Court, Second Judicial Region, Lagawe, Ifugao, Branch 14, in Criminal Case Nos. 1146-A and 1146-B, is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> in that accused-appellant Hehry Caladcadan is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i><i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole</i>, and to pay P75,000 as civil indemnity, P75,000 as moral damages, and P30,000 as exemplary damages, for two counts of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant filed the instant appeal. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 1 April 2013, accused-appellant and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) were required to; file their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired. Both parties manifested that they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In his Brief, accused-appellant maintains that AAA's testimony is incredible. First accused-appellant reveals that AAA had a boyfriend who could have impregnated her. Second, accused-appellant claims that at the time of the supposed rape, two of his children were sleeping with him so it was impossible for him to have raped his daughter in the presence of his two other children who could have witnessed it. Third, accused-appellant argues that he was not in his house when the second rape incident allegedly took place. Fourth, accused-appellant avers that he spent the night of 23 June 1999 at a friend's boarding house.<br><br>On the other hand, the OSG vouches for the credibility of AAA, relying on the adage that a daughter would not concoct a story of rape against her father, taking to mind the reverence and respect for elders that is too deeply ingrained in Filipino children. Furthermore, the OSG believes that AAA's positive and categorical assertions prevail over accused-appellant's bare denials.<br><br>The basic issue is whether or not accused-appellant is guilty for two counts-of rape beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The applicable provisions related to the crime of rape are Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), which provide:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape; <i>When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed -<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Article 266-B. Penalties. - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim[.]<br></blockquote>Rape is qualified when the following elements of the offense charged are present:<br><blockquote>(a) the victim is a female over 12 years but under 18 years of age;<br><br>(b) the offender is a parent, [an] ascendant, [a] step-parent, [a] guardian, [a] relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; and<br><br>(c) the offender has carnal knowledge of the victim either through force, threat or intimidation; or when [the victim] is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; or by means of fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC and the Court of Appeals agree on the finding that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of qualified rape. We agree.<br><br>We see no reason to depart from the findings of the lower courts. In upholding AAA's credibility, the Court of Appeals observed:<br><blockquote>Despite the passage of years, the horrendous images of the nights of abuse were immortalized in AAA's mind. She was emphatic, frank and straightforward as she excruciatingly recalled her ghastly experience.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The lurid incidents of rape left an ineradicable mark in AAA's mind. Her guileless account bears the hallmarks of truth. The fact that AAA's testimony was able to withstand scrutiny during cross-examination bolsters her credibility and makes her statements more credible. Invariably, the court <i>a quo</i> did not falter in according weight to AAA's narration as she remained steadfast and unyielding amidst grilling examination[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, AAA was straightforward and unequivocal in the recollection of her horrendous experience:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

She positively identified accused-appellant as the perpetrator. Accused-appellant could not even come up with a plausible explanation why AAA would fabricate a story of rape. If indeed AAA had a boyfriend at that time, it would have been relatively easier to identify her boyfriend as the perpetrator rather than go through the ordeal and shame of accusing her own flesh of rape.<br><br>Accused-appellant's argument that rape was impossible due to the presence of AAA's siblings is also bereft of merit. Rape is not a respecter of place or time. "It is not necessary that the place where the rape .is committed be isolated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> "There have been too many instances when rape was committed under circumstances as indiscreet and audacious as a room full of family members sleeping side by side."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Since AAA's testimony withstood the rigors of a cross-examination, this, in itself, is sufficient to sustain a conviction. The medico-legal report prepared by the medico-legal officer bolsters the occurrence of rape. Moreover, BBB corroborates AAA's testimony in open court with the following declaration:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[PROSECUTOR] TUMAPANG ON DIRECT-EXAMINATION:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Madam Witness, how are you related to the private complainant [AAA]? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">My daughter, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">And how are you also related to the accused Henry Caladcadan? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td> <div align="justify">He is my husband, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Were you legally married to the accused Henry Caladcadan? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Do you recall sometime in 1999 any information you received from your daughter regarding any incident of sexual abuse committed on her?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td> <div align="justify">That was on the month of October 1999 and it was very cold in Tinoc, she usually wears jacket.
