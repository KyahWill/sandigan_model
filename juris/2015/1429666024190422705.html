Yet, its former legal counsel filed and signed CLUFEA’s Memorandum of Appeal to the NLRC.&nbsp; The Memorandum of Appeal, therefore, was filed without authority of CLUFEA.<br><br>Thus, in the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated September 30, 2002, the NLRC denied the Appeal filed on December 20, 2001 for lack of merit.<br><br>Club Filipino, Inc. filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration, while Bautista, Caluag, Sualog, and Calida filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the NLRC’s Decision dated September 30, 2002.&nbsp; Johnny Arinto (Arinto), Roberto de Guzman (de Guzman), and Laureno Fegalquin (Fegalquin), all directors and officers of CLUFEA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> joined Bautista, Caluag, Sualog, and Calida in filing the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The NLRC denied the Motions in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated July 15, 2003.<br><br>On September 22, 2003, Bautista, Sualog, Calida, Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; However, Caluag no longer joined his colleagues.&nbsp; Instead, Carlito Presentacion (Presentacion), a CLUFEA member, joined in the filing of the Petition for Certiorari.<br><br>The Court of Appeals first resolved whether Bautista, Sualog, Calida, Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin had legal personality to appeal before the NLRC.&nbsp; On this issue, the Court of Appeals ruled that “a worker ordered dismissed under a tribunal’s decision has every right to question his or her dismissal especially if he [or she] had not been properly impleaded in the case and in the decision that decreed his or her dismissal.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Being officers of CLUFEA, Bautista, et al. had the right to appeal the loss of their employment with the NLRC.<br><br>With respect to Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin, the Court of Appeals further ruled that they were not granted “the full hearing that the due process requirements of the Philippine Constitution impose.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin participated only during the Motion for Reconsideration stage with the NLRC.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter’s Decision, therefore, did not bind Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin.<br><br>On the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the Labor Arbiter gravely abused his discretion in declaring CLUFEA’s strike illegal.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled that the requirements under Rule XXII, Section 4 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code “[do] not appear to be absolute.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Rule XXII, Section 4 only requires that the proposals and counterproposals be attached to the Notice of Strike “as far as practicable.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Since CLUFEA had already filed a Notice of Strike when Club Filipino, Inc. submitted its counterproposals, it was not practicable for CLUFEA to attach Club Filipino, Inc.’s counterproposals to the Notice of Strike.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the Labor Arbiter “disregarded”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the law on the status of employees who participated in an illegal strike.&nbsp; Under the law, union officers may be dismissed for participating in an illegal strike only if they knowingly participated in it.&nbsp; According to the Court of Appeals, the Labor Arbiter erred in ordering all the officers of CLUFEA dismissed from the service without even naming these officers and specifying the acts these officers committed that rendered the strike illegal.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, however, found that Bautista and Fegalquin had already resigned during the pendency of the case and had received separation benefits from Club Filipino, Inc.&nbsp; Bautista and Fegalquin, therefore, “no longer [had] any legal interest [in filing the petition for certiorari].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As for Presentacion, the Court of Appeals found that he was not an officer of CLUFEA and was not dismissed by virtue of the Labor Arbiter’s Decision.&nbsp; He, therefore, had no personality to join Bautista, Sualog, Calida, Arinto, de Guzman, and Fegalquin in filing the Petition for Certiorari.<br><br>As for Sualog, Calida, Arinto, and de Guzman, the Court of Appeals ruled that the Labor Arbiter’s Decision was void.<br><br>Thus, in the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated May 31, 2005, the Court of Appeals granted the Petition for Certiorari with respect to Sualog, Calida, Arinto, and de Guzman.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals set aside the Labor Arbiter’s Decision for being null and void and ordered the payment of full backwages and benefits to them from the time of their dismissal up to the finality of the Court of Appeals’ Decision.&nbsp; In lieu of reinstatement, the Court of Appeals ordered Club Filipino, Inc. to pay Sualog, Calida, Arinto, and de Guzman separation pay computed at one (1) month salary per year of service from the time of their hiring up to the finality of the Decision less any amount Sualog, Calida, Arinto, and de Guzman may have received pursuant to the Labor Arbiter’s Decision.<br><br>As for Bautista, Fegalquin, and Presentacion, the Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On June 23, 2005, Club Filipino, Inc. filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> with this court.&nbsp; Bautista, Sualog, Calida, Arinto, Presentacion, and de Guzman filed their Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to which Club Filipino, Inc. replied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>After the parties had filed their respective memoranda,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this court considered this case submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This court agreed with the Court of Appeals’ Decision.&nbsp; This court ruled that CLUFEA could not have attached Club Filipino, Inc.’s counterproposals in the Notice of Strike since Club Filipino, Inc. submitted it only after CLUFEA had filed the Notice of Strike.&nbsp; It was, therefore, “not practicable”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> for CLUFEA to attach Club Filipino, Inc.’s counterproposal to the Notice of Strike.&nbsp; CLUFEA did not violate Rule XXII, Section 4 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code.<br><br>This court sustained the Court of Appeals’ finding that the Labor Arbiter gravely abused his discretion in ordering the “wholesale dismissal”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of CLUFEA’s officers.&nbsp; According to this court, the law requires “‘knowledge’ [of the illegality of the strike] as a condition sine qua non before a union officer can be dismissed . . . for participating in an illegal strike.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; However, “[n]owhere in the ruling of the labor arbiter can [there be found] any discussion of how respondents, as union officers, knowingly participated in the alleged illegal strike.&nbsp; Thus, even assuming . . . that the strike was illegal, [the] automatic dismissal [of CLUFEA’s officers] had no basis.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated July 13, 2009, this court denied Club Filipino, Inc.’s Petition for Review on Certiorari.<br><br>On August 17, 2009, Club Filipino, Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which this court denied with finality in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated September 9, 2009.&nbsp;

This is because the issuance of the entry of judgment is reckoned from the time the parties received a copy of the resolution denying the first motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The filing by P&amp;G of several pleadings after receipt of the resolution denying its first motion for reconsideration does not in any way bar the finality or entry of judgment.&nbsp; <i>Besides, to reckon the finality of a judgment from receipt of the denial of the <u>second</u> motion for reconsideration would be absurd.&nbsp; First, the Rules of Court and the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court prohibit the filing of a second motion for reconsideration.&nbsp;

Entry of Judgment, therefore, was in order.<br><br>Since this court did not issue any temporary restraining order to enjoin the execution of the Court of Appeals’ Decision, the NLRC correctly proceeded in implementing the Court of Appeals’ Decision in the illegal strike case.<br><br><b><center>II</center><br>The NLRC’s Decision on the illegal <br>dismissal case was not <i>res judicata</i><br>on the illegal strike case.</b><br><br><i>Res judicata</i> “literally means ‘a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; [or] a thing or matter settled by judgment.’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Res judicata</i> “lays the rule that an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the first suit.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><i>Res judicata </i>has two (2) aspects.&nbsp; The first is bar by prior judgment that precludes the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand or cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>&nbsp; The second aspect is conclusiveness of judgment, which states that “issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties involving a different cause of action.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>The elements of <i>res judicata</i> are:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final;<br><br>(2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;<br><br>(3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and<br><br>(4) there must be as between the first and second action identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br>The first three (3) elements of <i>res judicata</i> are present in this case.<br><br>The NLRC’s judgment on the illegal dismissal case is already final with respondents not having appealed the Decision within the reglementary period.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter, who has the exclusive original jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide illegal dismissal cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> decided the case.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter’s Decision was heard on appeal by the NLRC, which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter’s judgment was on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; Based on the facts presented by the parties, the Labor Arbiter ruled that petitioner Club Filipino, Inc.’s retrenchment program was valid.<br><br>The fourth element of<i> res judicata</i>, however, is absent.&nbsp; Although the cases have substantially identical parties and subject matter of the dismissal of respondents, the cause of action for declaration of illegal strike and the cause of action for illegal dismissal are different.<br><br>A cause of action is “the act or omission by which a party violates the rights of another.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>&nbsp; Its elements are:<br><br><blockquote>1) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created;<br><br>2) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; and<br><br>3) act or omission on the part of such defendant in violation of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter may maintain an action for recovery of damages or other appropriate relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></blockquote><br>In an action for declaration of illegal strike, the cause of action is premised on a union or a labor organization’s conduct of a strike without compliance with the statutory requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in an action for illegal dismissal, the cause of action is premised on an employer’s alleged dismissal of an employee without a just or authorized cause as provided under Articles 282, 283, and 284 of the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>There is no <i>res judicata</i> in the present case.&nbsp; Petitioner Club Filipino, Inc. filed the illegal strike because members of CLUFEA allegedly disrupted petitioner Club Filipino, Inc.’s business when they staged a strike without complying with the requirements of the law.&nbsp; For their part, respondents filed the illegal dismissal case to question the validity of petitioner Club Filipino, Inc.’s retrenchment program.<br><br>Although there is no <i>res judicata</i>, the actions have the same subject matter.&nbsp; The subject matter of an action is “the matter or thing from which the dispute has arisen.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>&nbsp; Both the illegal strike and illegal dismissal cases involve the dismissal of respondents.&nbsp; In respondents’ action for illegal dismissal, respondents were found to have been dismissed by virtue of a valid retrenchment program.&nbsp; The NLRC then ordered that they be paid separation pay based on the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>In petitioner Club Filipino, Inc.’s action for declaration of illegal strike, the Labor Arbiter’s finding that respondents conducted an illegal strike resulted in their dismissal.&nbsp; Respondents were ordered to receive separation pay “similar in terms with those offered to the employees affected by the retrenchment program of the club.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, however, found that the Labor Arbiter gravely abused his discretion in declaring the strike illegal.&nbsp; It then reversed the Labor Arbiter’s Decision and awarded some of the respondents full backwages, benefits, and separation pay.<br><br>Because of the cases’ similar subject matter, it was possible that an employee who had already availed of the benefits under the retrenchment program would be declared entitled to separation benefits under the illegal strike case.&nbsp; This is true especially if the retrenched employee did not execute a valid quitclaim upon receiving the benefits under the retrenchment program.<br><br>Thus, to prevent double compensation, the Court of Appeals ordered that those who already retired and received their benefits may no longer claim full backwages, benefits, and separation pay under the decision in the illegal strike case.&nbsp; This is with respect to respondents Benjamin Bautista and Laureno Fegalquin who already executed their quitclaims.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals said:<br><br><blockquote>We agree in theory with the petitioners’ position that workers’ releases and quitclaims are frowned upon and cannot simply be accepted at face value.&nbsp; Jurisprudence however provides us guidance on when to accept and when to reject workers’ releases and quitclaims.&nbsp; In the present case where the recipients are responsible union officers who have regularly acted in behalf of their members in the discharge of their union duties and where there is no direct evidence of coercion or vitiation of consent, we believe we can safely conclude that the petitioners Bautista and Fegalquin fully knew that they entered into when they accepted their retirement benefits and when they executed their quitclaims.&nbsp; The Club (as well as the NLRC) is therefore correct in their position that these petitioners no longer have any interest that can serve as basis for their participation in the present petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>With respect to respondent Carlito Presentacion who was not a union officer and, therefore, could not have been dismissed under the illegal strike case, the Court of Appeals held that he cannot receive benefits under Court of Appeals’ Decision:<br><br><blockquote>The same is true with respect to petitioner Carlito Presentacion who does not appear to be covered by the assailed Labor Arbiter and NLRC decisions because he was not a union officer and was not dismissed under the assailed decisions, and who had sought redress through a separately-filed case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote><br>For respondents who were not found to have executed a quitclaim with respect to the benefits under the retrenchment program, the Court of Appeals ruled that any benefits received “as a result of the decisions [of the Labor Arbiter]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> must be deducted from the separation pay received under the illegal strike case.&nbsp; This is with respect to Ronie Sualog, Joel Calida, Roberto de Guzman, and Johnny Arinto:<br><br><blockquote>We grant the petition and declare the assailed decision null and void with respect to petitioners Ronie Sualog, Joel Calida, Roberto de Guzman and Johnny Arinto as the decision to dismiss them had been attended by grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC as discussed above.&nbsp; In the exercise of our discretion, however, we stop short of ordering the reinstatement of these petitioners’ [sic] in light of their obviously strained relationship with the Club resulting from the strike and in light as well of the restructuring of the Club’s workforce since then.&nbsp; We confine our order therefore to the payment of the petitioners’ full backwages and benefits from the time of their dismissal up the finality of this Decision, and to the payment of petitioners’ separation pay computed at one (1) month salary per year of service from the time they were hired up to the finality of this Decision.&nbsp; Any amount they might have received from the Club as a result of the decisions below can be deducted from the payments we hereby find to be due them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></blockquote><br>Since the Court of Appeals ordered that any benefit received from the illegal dismissal case be deducted from any benefit receivable under the Court of Appeals’ Decision, there was no “double compensation” as petitioner Club Filipino, Inc. claims.<br><br>All told, the Decision in the illegal dismissal case was not<i> res judicata </i>on the illegal strike case.&nbsp; The NLRC correctly executed the Court of Appeals’ Decision in the illegal strike case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; No further pleadings shall be entertained in this case.&nbsp;
