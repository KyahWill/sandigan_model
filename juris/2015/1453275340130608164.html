The price quotation provided that full payment should be made upon the units' complete installation.

He testified that they suffered losses for nine days as a result of the enforcement of the writ of preliminary attachment. The lost profits purportedly amounted to P227,280.00. To support this claim, RCJ Lines adduced as evidence the summary of the daily cash collections<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> from the buses that were not attached, on various dates in August and September 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, the CA sustained the award of attorney's fees for PI 00,000.00 in favor of RCJ lines for having been compelled to litigate.<br><br><u><center><b>The Petition</b><br></center></u><br><i>First</i>, Phil-Air argues that the doctrine of laches is not applicable when the action is filed within the prescriptive period.

Assuming it breached its warranty, Phil-Air submits that the action to enforce the warranty had already prescribed.<br><br>Third, Phil-Air rejects the CA's order that it must reimburse the premium payment for the counter-bond and the alleged losses suffered by RCJ Lines. The attachment bond should be answerable for damages, if any.<br><br><u><center><b>Respondent's Comment</b><br></center></u><br>RCJ Lines reiterates all the arguments it raised in its counterclaim. It admits that it did not pay the balance of the purchase price.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[37]</sup></font> It maintains, however, that it was justified in doing so because Phil-Air breached its warranty. It insists that Phil-Air was guilty of laches because it waited for eight years to file the collection case.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[38]</sup></font><br><br><div align="center"><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Based on the foregoing, the Court resolves the following issues:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether the claim of Phil-Air was barred by laches;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether Phil-Air should reimburse RCJ Lines for the counter- bond premium and its alleged unrealized profits;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether RCJ Lines proved its alleged unrealized profits arising from the enforcement of the preliminary writ of attachment; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether RCJ Lines proved that Phil-Air breached its warranty.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><u><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center></u><br>We grant the petition.<br><br><b>Phil-Air's claim is not<br>barred by laches.</b><br><br>In general, there is no room to apply the concept of laches when the law provides the period within which to enforce a claim or file an action in court. Phil-Air's complaint for sum of money is based on a written contract of sale. The ten-year prescriptive period under Article 1144 of the Civil Code thus applies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the present case, both parties admit the existence and validity of the contract of sale. They recognize that the <i>price quotation</i> dated August 4, 1989, contained the terms and conditions of the sale contract. They also agree that the price and description of the units were indicated on the <i>sales invoice</i> dated November 5, 1990. The sales were in fact consummated on various dates between March 5, 1990 and August 29, 1990, as proved by several <i>delivery receipts.</i><br><br>The Court therefore can resolve whether Phil-Air's action to enforce the contract was timely filed even in the apparent absence of a formal or notarized deed of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> More significantly, Rolando Abadilla, Jr., admitted under oath that the sale was in writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We note that Phil-Air filed the complaint with the RTC on April 1, 1998. Counting from the date of the sales invoice, or from the date of the delivery receipts, or even from the date of the price quotation, it is clear that the complaint was filed within the ten-year prescriptive period. Contrary to the CA's ruling, laches does not apply.<br><br>Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>While the CA correctly held that prescription and estoppel by laches are two different concepts, it failed to appreciate the marked distinctions between the two concepts.<br><br>On the one hand, the question of laches is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The court resolves whether the claimant asserted its claim <b>within a reasonable time</b> and whether its failure to do so warrants the presumption that it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it. The court determines the claimant's intent to assert its claim based on its past actions or lack of action. After all, what is invoked in instances where a party raises laches as a defense is the equity jurisdiction of the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, if the law gives the period within which to enforce a claim or file an action in court, the court confirms whether the claim is asserted or the action is filed in court <b>within the prescriptive period</b>. The court determines the claimant's intent to assert its claim by simply measuring the time elapsed from the proper reckoning point (e.g., the date of the written contract) to the filing of the action or assertion of the claim.<br><br>In sum, where the law provides the period within which to assert a claim or file an action in court, <b>the assertion of the claim or the filing of the action in court at <i>any time</i> within the prescriptive period is generally deemed reasonable,</b> and thus, does not call for the application of laches. As we held in one case, <i><b> unless reasons of inequitable proportions are adduced</b></i>, any imputed delay within the prescriptive period is not delay in law that would bar relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In <i>Agra, et al. v. Philippine National Bank</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> we held that "[l]aches is a <b>recourse in equity</b> [and] is applied only in the absence, never in contravention, of statutory law. Thus, laches cannot, <b>as a rule</b>, abate a collection suit filed within the prescriptive period mandated by the Civil Code."<br><br><i>Agra</i> involved an action for collection of a sum of money arising from an unpaid loan. In resisting payment, the sureties invoked laches and maintained that the creditor-bank with full knowledge of the deteriorating financial condition of the principal debtor did not take steps to collect from the latter while still solvent. The sureties thus argued that the creditor-bank's action was barred by laches.<br><br>We found that the sureties failed to prove all the elements of laches, namely:<br><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">conduct on the part of the defendant or one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which the complainant seeks a remedy;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">delay in asserting the complainant's right, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of defendant's conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute a suit;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would assert the right on which he bases his claim; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant, or the suit is not held barred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Examining these elements, we found that only the first element was present. There was no delay (<i>second element</i>) because the creditor-bank filed the action within the ten-year prescriptive period. Since the claim was timely filed, the defendants did not lack notice that the creditor-bank would assert its claim (<i>third element</i>). Nor was the assertion of the right deemed injurious to the defendants (<i>fourth element</i>); the creditor-bank could assert its claim at any time within the prescriptive period.<br><br>The same conclusion holds true in the present case; not all the elements of laches are present. To repeat, Phil-Air filed the complaint with the RTC on April 1, 1998. The time elapsed from August 4, 1989 (the date of the price quotation, which is the earliest possible reckoning point), is eight years and eight months, well within the ten-year prescriptive period. There was simply no delay (<i>second element of laches</i>) where Phil-Air can be said to have negligently slept on its rights.<br><br>More significantly, there is no basis for laches as the facts of the present case do not give rise to an inequitable situation that calls for the application of equity and the principle of laches.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b><i>Phil-Air is not directly liable<br>for the counter-bond premium and<br>RCJ Lines' alleged unrealized profits.</i></b><br><br>The CA and the RTC erred when it held Phil-Air directly liable for the counter-bond premium and RCJ Lines' alleged unrealized profits. Granting that RCJ Lines suffered losses, the judgment award should have been first executed on the attachment bond. Only if the attachment bond is insufficient to cover the judgment award can Phil-Air be held liable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We explain below the purpose of a preliminary attachment, the procedure in obtaining it, and the manner of having it lifted.<br><br>A writ of preliminary attachment is a provisional remedy issued by the court where an action is pending to be levied upon the property or properties of the defendant. The property is held by the sheriff as security for the satisfaction of whatever judgment that might be secured by the attaching party against the defendant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The grant of the writ is conditioned not only on the finding of the court that there exists a valid ground for its issuance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The Rules also require the applicant to post a bond.<br><br>Section 4 of Rule 57 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (<i>Rules</i>) provides that "the party applying for the order must...give a bond executed to the adverse party in the amount fixed by the court, in its order granting the issuance of the writ, <b>conditioned that the latter will pay <u>all the costs</u> that may be adjudged to the adverse party and <u>all damages</u> that he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto."<br></b><br>The enforcement of the writ notwithstanding, the party whose property is attached is afforded relief to have the attachment lifted.<br><br>There are various modes of discharging an attachment under Rule 57, <i>viz</i>.: (1) by depositing cash or posting a counter-bond under Section 12;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (2) by proving that the attachment bond was improperly or irregularly issued or enforced, or that the bond is insufficient under Section 13;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (3) by showing that the attachment is excessive under Section 13; and (4) by claiming that the property is exempt from execution under Section 2.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>RCJ Lines availed of the first mode by posting a counter-bond.<br><br>Under the first mode, the court will order the discharge of the attachment after (1) the movant makes a cash deposit or posts a counter-bond and (2) the court hears the motion to discharge the attachment with due notice to the adverse party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The amount of the cash deposit or counter-bond must be equal to that fixed by the court in the order of attachment, exclusive of costs. The cash deposit or counter-bond shall secure the payment of any judgment that the attaching party may recover in the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The filing of a counter-bond to discharge the attachment applies when there has already been a seizure of property by the sheriff and all that is entailed is the presentation of a motion to the proper court, seeking approval of a cash or surety bond in an amount equivalent to the value of the property seized and the lifting of the attachment on the basis thereof. <b>The counter-bond stands in place of the property so released.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>To be clear, the discharge of the attachment by depositing cash or posting a counter-bond under Section 12 should not be confused with the discharge sanctioned under Section 13. Section 13 speaks of discharge on the ground that the writ was improperly or irregularly issued or enforced, or that the attachment bond is insufficient, or that the attachment is excessive.<br><br>To reiterate, the discharge under Section 12 takes effect upon posting of a counter-bond or depositing cash, and after hearing to determine the sufficiency of the cash deposit or counter-bond. On the other hand, the discharge under Section 13 takes effect only upon showing that the plaintiffs attachment bond was improperly or irregularly issued, or that the bond is insufficient. The discharge of the attachment under Section 13 must be made only after hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>These differences notwithstanding, the discharge of the preliminary attachment either through Section 12 or Section 13 has no effect on and does not discharge the attachment bond. <b>The dissolution of the preliminary attachment does not result in the dissolution of the attachment bond.</b> Justice Narvasa, writing his separate opinion in one case, explained:<br><br><blockquote><b>The dissolution of the preliminary attachment upon security given</b> [Section 12], or a showing of its irregular or improper issuance [Section 13], <b>does not of course operate to discharge the sureties on plaintiffs own attachment bond</b>. The reason is simple. That bond is executed to the adverse party,. . . conditioned that the ... (applicant) will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto." Hence, until that determination is made, as to the applicant's entitlement to the attachment, his <u><b>bond must stand and cannot be withdrawn</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring supplied, citations omitted]</blockquote><br>In the present case, the RTC lifted the preliminary attachment after it heard RCJ Lines' urgent motion to discharge attachment and the latter posted a counter-bond. The RTC found that there was no fraud and Phil-Air had no sufficient cause of action for the issuance of the writ of the attachment. As a consequence, it ordered Phil-Air to refund the premium payment for the counter-bond and the losses suffered by RCJ Lines resulting from the enforcement of the writ. The CA affirmed the RTC ruling <i>in toto.</i><br><br>We reverse the CA and RTC rulings.<br><br>As discussed above, it is patent that under the Rules, the attachment bond answers for all damages incurred by the party against whom the attachment was issued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Thus, Phil-Air cannot be held directly liable for the costs adjudged to and the damages sustained by RCJ Lines because of the attachment. Section 4 of Rule 57 positively lays down the rule that the attachment bond will pay "<b><u>all the costs</u> which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all <u>damages</u> which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto.</b>"<br><br>The RTC, instead of declaring Phil-Air liable for the alleged unrealized profits and counter-bond premium, should have ordered the execution of the judgment award on the attachment bond. To impose direct liability to Phil-Air would defeat the purpose of the attachment bond, which was not dissolved despite the lifting of the writ of preliminary attachment.<br><br>The order to refund the counter-bond premium is likewise erroneous. The premium payment may be deemed a cost incurred by RCJ Lines to lift the attachment. Such cost may be charged against the attachment bond.<br><br><i><b>RCJ Lines failed to prove its <br>alleged unrealized profits.</b></i><br><br>In finding that RCJ Lines suffered damages because of the attachment, the RTC and the CA gave complete credence to the testimony of Rolando Abadilla, Jr. He claimed that RCJ Lines lost P216,000.00 in unrealized profits for nine days when the buses were wrongfully seized.<br><br>To arrive at this amount, RCJ Lines alleged that a bus travelling from Manila to Ilocos and vice versa earned an average daily income of P12,000.00. To back this claim, RCJ Lines prepared a summary of the daily cash collections of its nine buses on certain days of August and September 2000.<br><br>The summary of daily cash collections apparently prepared by one RCJ Lines employee was in turn based on the reports of the dispatchers indicating the number of passengers and the amount of fare collected on a particular trip. Except for one bus which travelled round-trip on August 22-23, 2000, the daily cash collections all pertained to the round-trip of eight buses on September 2-3, 2000.<br><br>These documents are insufficient to prove actual damages.<br><br>In <i>Spouses Yu v. Ngo Yet Te,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> we held that if the claim for actual damages covers unrealized profits, the amount of unrealized profits must be established and supported by independent evidence of the mean income of the business undertaking interrupted by the illegal seizure.<br><br>We explained in <i>Spouses Yu </i>that to merit an award of actual damages arising from a wrongful attachment, the attachment defendant must prove, with the best evidence obtainable, the fact of loss or injury suffered and the amount thereof. Such loss or injury must be of the kind which is not only capable of proof but must actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty. As to its amount, the same must be measurable based on specific facts, and not on guesswork or speculation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><i>Spouses Yu</i> is on all fours with the present dispute because it also involved a claim for actual damages arising from the illegal attachment of the claimant's properties, one of which was a passenger bus.<br><br>The claimants in that case attempted to prove actual damages by computing the daily average income of its bus operation based on the value of three ticket stubs sold over five separate days. The claimants likewise cited unused ticket stubs as proof of income foregone when the bus was wrongfully seized.<br><br>We found the claimant's evidence insufficient to prove actual damages. While we recognized that they suffered some damages, we held that "[b]y no stretch of the imagination can we consider ticket sales for five days sufficient evidence of the average daily income of the passenger bus, much less its mean income. Not even the unrebutted testimony of [the claimant] can add credence to such evidence for the testimony itself lacks corroboration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the evidence adduced by RCJ Lines to show actual damages fell short of the required proof. Its average daily income cannot be derived from the summary of daily cash collections from only two separate occasions, <i>i.e</i>., August 22-23 and September 2-3, 2000. The data submitted is too meager and insignificant to conclude that the buses were indeed earning an average daily income of P12,000.00.<br><br>More significant, the person who prepared the unsigned summary of daily cash collections was not presented before the RTC to verify and explain how she arrived at the computation. The dispatchers who prepared the collection reports were likewise not presented; some of the reports were also unsigned. While the summary was approved by Rolando Abadilla, Jr., his testimony on the alleged unrealized profits was uncorroborated and self-serving.<br><br>Nonetheless, we recognize that RCJ Lines suffered some form of pecuniary loss when two of its buses were wrongfully seized, although the amount cannot be determined with certainty.<br><br>We note that in its prayer for the issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment, Phil-Air alleged that RCJ Lines was guilty of fraud in entering into the sale transaction. A perusal of the record, however, would show that Phil-Air failed to prove this bare assertion. This justifies an award of temperate or moderate damages in the amount of Php 50,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><i><b>The allegation of breach<br>of express warranty was <br>notproved.</b></i><br><br>We are not convinced that Phil-Air breached its express warranty. RCJ Lines had no right to recoupment in diminution of the price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The Civil Code defines an express warranty as any affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the thing if the natural tendency of such affirmation or promise is to induce the buyer to purchase the same, and if the buyer purchases the thing relying thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The question whether there was a breach of warranty is factual. Consequently, the Court should rely on the factual findings of the CA and RTC, which are <i>generally</i> deemed binding and conclusive to the Court. More so in a Rule 45 petition where only questions of law can be raised. Further, factual findings of the RTC, when affirmed by the CA, are conclusive on the Court when supported by the evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The evidence on record does not support the findings of the CA and RTC.<br><br>We emphasize that there are recognized cases where the Court can disregard the factual findings of the RTC and CA.

Although Article 1586 does not require that the notice to the seller be in writing, we cannot accept the claim of Rolando Abadilla, Jr. that his late father verbally notified Phil-Air of the defects, without violating the rule on hearsay.<br><br>Also, the testimonies of the two RCJ Lines employees that they experienced firsthand the insufficient cooling of the units were self-serving and uncorroborated by a disinterested party.<br><br>Further, the reliance of the CA and the RTC on the testimony<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[82]</sup></font> of the general manager of Carrier Philippines was misplaced and unwarranted.
