				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b>THE CASE</b><br></center><br>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Former Seventh Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated August 23, 2006, which held respondent entitled to liquidated damages equivalent to 70 days of delay, 10% retention fee, and payment for expenses for repainting job arising from a construction dispute.<br><br><center><b>FACTS</b><br></center><br>Petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> find respondent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> entered into a Construction Agreement, under which petitioner would construct for respondent a three-story building housing a meat processing plant and a showroom office in Yakal Street, Makati City. The parties agreed on a contract price of Php 43,800,000.00 and a completion and delivery date of April 7, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Due to several delays, however, petitioner turned over the building only on August 15, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Respondent did not accept the building, asserting it had many deficiencies. Respondent paid petitioner only Php 38,088,445.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, petitioner filed a complaint for sum of money against respondent before the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC) for the balance of Php 4,771,221.59.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In addition, petitioner prayed for the payment of Php 141,944.93 representing expenses incurred due to work on respondent's changes or additional orders, and for a judgment that the liquidated damages claimed by respondent in the amount of Php 3,066,000.00 was without basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Petitioner enumerated in its complaint the following reasons why the project was delayed:<br><ol><li>At the start of the excavation phase, petitioner had to remove two to three layers of concrete slabs over the construction site, instead of only 1 layer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The soil was also found to be extra soft and had to be filled with boulders. Respondent granted petitioner an extension of only 7 days, but the remedial work required in the removal of the extra layers of concrete slabs, and in stabilizing the condition of the soil, took 30 - 40 days to finish.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br></li><li>Respondent and another corporation, Sinclair Paints, engaged in a boundary dispute. Respondent ordered petitioner to suspend the excavation works until the dispute was resolved. The suspension took 6 days, yet petitioner was not credited with an extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br></li><li>The building permit was not secured on time. The application for the building permit was not initially processed by the Building Official of Makati City because respondent failed to timely secure the required Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br></li><li>Respondent informed petitioner that the building plan will be revised, such that the locations of the columns, beams and walls to be put up were to be determined only through the verbal instructions of respondent's construction manager.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br></li><li>On February 20, 1995, the City Building Office served petitioner with an order to stop all construction works until a building permit is secured. Despite this "stop work order," respondent ordered petitioner to continue with the construction discreetly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br></li><li>It was only on March 23, 1995 or after the lapse of 31 days from the "stop work order" when the building permit was secured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></li></ol>Thus, while the demolition, excavation, and initial construction works started on November 26, 1994, regular construction works began only 113 days after, or on March 24, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further alleged that even after the original completion date of April 7, 1995, construction works continued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Respondent even ordered substantial changes and additional works after April 7, 1995, which took 130 days to complete, or until August 14, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In total, petitioner claimed it was entitled to an extension of 243 days, yet asked for only 130 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Respondent, however, granted petitioner with a mere 60-day extension and held it in default for the remaining 70 days. Consequently, petitioner was charged with liquidated damages computed at Php 43,800.00 for every day of delay, or a total of Php 3,066,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In its defense, respondent attributed the delays to the fault of petitioner. Respondent denied suppressing information about the existence of the extra layer of concrete slabs and the extra soft condition of the soil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It alleged that petitioner was given this information during the pre-bidding conference, and that petitioner inspected the site and was present during soil testing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Respondent averred that petitioner was responsible for securing the required permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As to the changes and additional works, respondent asserted it gave petitioner a 60-day extension, even if these works were merely linear, meaning they may be performed without interrupting the normal pace of the construction work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In sum, respondent blamed petitioner's poor workmanship, persistent inaction in satisfying respondent's complaints, and lack of, or defective equipment, for the delays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Respondent claimed that due to petitioner's poor workmanship, the turnover in August 1995 was merely partial because there were several works that needed to be adjusted and corrected, to which petitioner agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This poor workmanship on the part of petitioner pushed the actual turnover to October 15, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Nevertheless, respondent maintained that out of benevolence, it computed delay only from June 6, 1995 to August 15, 1995 (70 days) instead of up to October 15, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Even then, after the turnover, respondent had to hire another contractor to do corrective and repainting works because of the same poor workmanship of petitioner. Respondent allegedly incurred additional expenses worth Php 1,202,888.50 for the repainting work of the other contractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>After trial, the RTC ruled in favor of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It duly noted the causes of delay petitioner outlined and concluded that the 60-day credit respondent allowed for delay was not commensurate to the total allowable or justifiable delay. Instead, the RTC ruled that petitioner was entitled to a 130-day extension it requested. Thus, the liquidated damages respondent deducted from the agreed contract price was baseless and unjustified. The dispositive portion of the RTC's Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of plaintiff <b>BF CORPORATION</b> and against defendant <b>WERDENBERG INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION</b> and hereby orders defendant to pay plaintiff the following amounts, to wit:<br><ol><li>Four Million Seven Hundred Seventy One Thousand Two Hundred Twenty One Pesos and 59/100 (P4,771,221.59) corresponding to the unpaid balance of the contract price, inclusive of the retention fee and net of electric/water billings.

The dispositive portion of the CA Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby <b><i>MODIFIED</i></b> and We deem it reasonable to render a decision imposing, as We do hereby impose, upon the defendant-appellant Werdenberg to pay BF Corporation the amount of P1,847,167.52 to complete the payment of its professional fee under their Construction Agreement based on the following computation:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="19%"><div align="right">P4,771,222.59</div></td><td width="3%"><div align="center">-</div></td><td width="78%"> unpaid balance under the Agreement</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>+ 141,944.93</u> </div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>unpaid balance for change orders</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P4,913,167.52</div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>total amount due to BFC</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>Less:_P3,066,000.00</u></div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>liquidated damages by BFC</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P1,847,167.52 </div></td><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td> amount due to BFC</td></tr></tbody></table><br>the total sum being payable upon the finality of this decision.

The CA also granted respondent's claim for a retention fee of 10%. The CA's new computation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="19%"><div align="right">P4,771,222.59</div></td><td width="3%"><div align="center">-</div></td><td width="78%"> unpaid balance under the Agreement</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>+ 141,944.93</u> </div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>unpaid balance for change orders</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P4,913,167.52</div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>total amount due to BFC</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>Less:_P3,066,000.00</u></div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>liquidated damages by BFC</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P1,847,167.52 </div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>Less: 1,050,000.00</u></div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td> expenses for painting job due to Werdenberg</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P797,167.52</div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td> amount due to BFC</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right"><u>Less: 79,716.75</u></div></td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>10% retention fee by Werdenberg </td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">P717,450.75</div></td><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td> amount due to BFC </td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Hence, this petition, which argues in the main that the CA misappreciated relevant facts and prays that the decision of the RTC be reinstated.<br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br>Petitioner raises questions of fact, which generally, we cannot entertain in a Rule 45 petition. We are not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the courts below. Of course, the general rule admits of exceptions, such as where the factual findings of the CA and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This exception is present here.<br><br>The RTC ruled in favor of petitioner, finding that the delay in the construction was not its fault. The RTC found the extension of the delivery date of 60 days granted by respondent incommensurate to the total number of days of justifiable delay. The CA, on the other hand, did not find all the grounds raised by petitioner as causes for justifiable delay to be meritorious. The CA held petitioner at fault when it did not adopt measures to arrest soil deterioration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The CA also held that petitioner should have notified respondent that it (petitioner) would stop work until the required building permit was secured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Neither did petitioner inform respondent that the revision of the building plan will cause delay. Thus, such revision merely required a reorientation of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This was also true with the change orders and additional works. The CA gave more credence to the testimony of respondent's witness, Engr. Antonio Aliño, an engineer of 37 years' experience. Engr. Aliño testified that the change orders and additional works merely required linear activities that did not affect the construction time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The CA then deferred to the approximation of respondent that petitioner is, under the facts, entitled to only 60 days of extension of the contracted completion date of April 7, 1995. This meant that the new completion date can be moved to June 6, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Since, however, the turnover was made only on August 15, 1995, petitioner incurred delay for 70 days. For this, the CA found petitioner liable for liquidated damages for 70 days of delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On reconsideration, the CA also noted that the defects on the painting job, which petitioner acknowledged and tried to rectify, were not solved at all. In a letter dated May 31, 1996, respondent informed petitioner that it (respondent) would hire another contractor to do the repainting job. Thus, the CA found respondent entitled to liquidated damages, retention fee, and reimbursement for the expenses in the repainting job.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>To recall, petitioner originally claimed it was entitled to a 113 day extension of the contracted delivery date because of various delays that moved the regular construction date from November 26, 1004 to March 24, 1995. These various delays were broken down as follows:<br><ul><li>Removal of layers of unforeseen concrete slabs, which took 30-40 days;<br><br></li><li>Rectification of the extra soft condition of the soil, which took 14 days;<br><br></li><li>Revision of the building plan, which affected the petitioner's conduct of work for a month, or 30 days;<br><br></li><li>One month "stop work order" from the City Hall of Makati due to lack of construction permit, or 30 days.</li></ul>Petitioner argues that respondent concealed the existence of the concrete slabs and the condition of the soil, which necessitated additional work, expense, and use of sophisticated equipment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The building plan also had to be revised in an attempt to avoid the necessity of submitting an ECC as a measure to facilitate the approval of the application for a building permit. At the same time, however, the revised building plan was needed as supporting document to the application for a building permit, such that without it, the application was put on hold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The revision also called for a 180-degree reorientation of the building floor plan, which stalled the progress of construction for a month because petitioner had to rely on and await mere verbal instructions from respondent's representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> When the revised building plan was finally submitted to petitioner in January 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the building permit application was further delayed because the city hall officials questioned the provisions on the parking area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, due to the lack of building permit, the city hall issued and served a "stop work order" in the construction premises on February 20, 1995. This caused work to stop for a month, or until March 23, 1995, when the building permit was finally secured.<br><br>Petitioner also claimed it was entitled to a 130-day extension corresponding to various additional works and change orders from April 7, 1995 to August 14, 1995. The total number of days for extension, therefore, was 243 days. Petitioner settled for 130 days instead.<br><br>In reply to petitioner's request for extension, respondent initially granted 34 days, which were broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><ul><li>7 days for the removal of concrete slabs<br><br></li><li>7 days for the delay in the construction permit<br><br></li><li>14 days for the construction of shear walls<br><br></li><li>6 days for holidays</li></ul></blockquote>According to respondent, it granted only 7 days for the removal of concrete slabs because the delay was caused by the frequent breakdown of petitioner's equipment. Respondent also granted only 7 days for the delay in the construction permit because it did not prevent petitioner from continuing with the construction. As for the construction of shear walls, a part of the additional works which petitioner claimed took 30-40 days to finish, respondent granted only 14 days because the work was gradual. The rest of the additional works and change orders were categorized by respondent as either linear activities that can be executed simultaneously with the main work or repeat jobs due to petitioner's poor workmanship and thus, did not merit any extension. On re-evaluation, respondent granted an additional 26 day extension, for a total extension of 60 days.<br><br>We stress at the outset that in its decision, the CA found petitioner entitled to extensions of 35 days for the removal of concrete slabs, and 7 days for the work stoppage brought by a boundary dispute with Sinclair Paints. The CA then upheld respondent's total grant of a 60 day extension. The computation, however does not add up. Petitioner would be entitled to a 42 day extension for the concrete slabs and the boundary dispute alone, leaving an additional extension of 18 days for other causes of delay. While the CA found petitioner not entitled to any extension for the supposed delay in the building permit, it ignored the extensions of 14 days for the construction of the shear walls, and 6 days for the holidays which respondent already granted in favor of petitioner. These would have totalled to an additional extension of 20 days. In effect, the CA's computation would not jibe with that of the respondent's.<br><br>At any rate, in determining whether respondent is entitled to liquidated damages and how much it is entitled to, we reach a different conclusion than those of the lower courts.<br><br><i>Petitioner is entitled to an extension of 21 days for the delay during the excavation stage</i><br><br>The daily reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of respondent's project manager, Engr. Arnulfo Delima, show that petitioner performed earth and demolition works involving excavation, boulders and gravel filling, and soil poisoning from December 9, 1994 to February 14, 1995. But in the construction schedule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> petitioner submitted to respondent, the duration of the earth and demolition works should have only been from and until mid-December 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Petitioner accuses respondent of suppressing information about the existence of the concrete slabs and the extra soft condition of the soil, which were material in petitioner's determination of the time and cost required by the works. Thus, petitioner asks for a total extension of approximately 1 and 1/2 months equivalent to the actual period it took petitioner to perform these earthworks.<br><br>We disagree that petitioner is entitled to a full extension of its request (30-40 days for the removal of the concrete slabs and 14 days for arresting the soil condition). We hold that for these excavation works, it is fair to grant petitioner with a total extension of only 21 days or three weeks.<br><br>The existence of the layers of concrete slabs and the extra soft condition of the soil was not easily determinable upon site inspection. In fact, these were not included in the Construction Agreement or in the Minutes of the Pre-Bid Conferences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Petitioner would have considered in its bid plan and proposal the attendant time and costs the measures required to address these conditions had it known about them from the beginning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In <i>Advanced Foundation Construction Systems Corporation v. New World Properties and Ventures, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> we deferred to the expert opinion of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission that in practice, removal of underground obstructions is a "major item of work" that needs to be included in the contractor's scope of work. It cannot be understood as being merely subsumed under the general heading "miscellaneous."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Mere, the CA agreed with petitioner that the concrete slabs were unforeseen and their removal caused delay in the construction phase. The CA also acknowledged that the extra soft condition of the soil cannot be easily seen with the naked eye. The CA thus held "it is understandable that BFC could not be expected, upon ocular inspection, to immediately determine the soil condition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>We rule, however, that the removal of the concrete slabs and the filling of boulders may have taken two or three more times in effort to accomplish than usual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The removal also took time because of the frequent breakdown of the heavy equipment petitioner used in the process, and petitioner's failure to provide enough manpower. The daily reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> support this and Engr. Delima also convincingly testified:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Can you describe to us the progress of the work by BF?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">When I supervised the work, our schedules have not been met, we have some delays in the excavations, madam.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">In the excavation stage, what delays were incurred if any?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Their equipments [sic] were always not functioning.

Under Section 5 of the Construction Agreement, "[a]ll materials and labor of every grade and equipment necessary for the prosecution and termination of the work shall be of the best grade of their respective kind and the quality of workmanship shall be in accordance with the requirements of the contract and its Annexes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Petitioner was, therefore, obliged to provide the appropriate equipment in good running condition. Failing on this, petitioner is not entitled to the full extension of 30 - 40 days it requested.<br><br>We also disagree that petitioner is entitled to a full extension of 14 days it requested for the delay caused by the extra soft condition of the soil.<br><br>Firstly, we defer to the testimony of Arch. Orencio Sare, Jr., the designer of the building, that the soil investigation report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> dated September 1994 was not crucial for the contractor's work. Arch. Sare testified that the report was only instrumental for the designer's work and not for the contractor's because it was intended to determine the soil bearing capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Hence, we agree that there was no malicious intention to suppress the soil investigation report from petitioner, even if it was only furnished to petitioner alter the contract was awarded in November 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This is not to say, however, that the contractor should not be apprised of the actual condition of the soil <u>before</u> bidding. The soil report could have assisted petitioner in estimating the extent of its excavation works. As Mr. Gerardo Apoderado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> testified, the extra soft condition of the soil spelled problems because the area cannot be excavated to the required elevation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In its letter dated December 9, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> petitioner proposed to respondent that since the actual soil condition is very soft, thicker boulders and a thicker gravel base should be used. Petitioner then informed respondent that these changes, on top of the demolition of unforeseen concrete slabs and arresting the soil condition, would result in additional working time and cost. Respondent did not object to or refute this letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Respondent claims, however, that petitioner was responsible for the delay caused by the soil condition because it failed to immediately provide remedies when water from a broken drainage nearby seeped in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, in a letter dated January 16, 1995, respondent reminded petitioner of the required bottom elevation and noted that petitioner's latest excavation was undercut. Respondent also brought to petitioner's attention the muddy condition of the excavated area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>We agree with the CA that petitioner should have taken measures to address the problem with the broken drainage. We note that as of January 16, 1995, petitioner had failed to properly stabilize the soil and obtain the required elevation of the area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> This is a lapse which merits a reduction on petitioner's estimate for extension. We merely reduce the extension on the finding that at most, the broken drainage only aggravated the soil condition, but doesn't change the fact that it had been extra soft from the start. It was not even shown when the drainage broke and leaked and whether its effects were visible or known to petitioner from the beginning. Furthermore, in the same manner that petitioner should answer for the faulty equipment used in the removal of the concrete slabs, petitioner should also answer for the delay in the deliveries of the boulders used for filling in the excavated area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>All told, both parties were responsible for the delay caused by the excavation and earthworks. Thus, even if petitioner may be held liable for negligence in the performance of its obligation, Article 1172 of the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> provides that such liability may be regulated by the courts according to the circumstances of the case. Here, the existence of concrete slabs and the extra soft soil remained a condition beyond the control of petitioner. Since these caused an unforeseen delay in the excavation stage, petitioner should be credited accordingly. We find that a reduced extension of 21 days for the earth and demolition works is commensurate and fair.<br><br><i>Petitioner is entitled to an extension of 38 days for the delay in securing the building permit and for the stop work order issued by the Makati City Hall.</i><br><br>The Construction Agreement provides that the agreed period of completion shall be automatically and correspondingly extended if the works are suspended to comply with any rule or order of public or government authorities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>.

Contracts constitute the law between the parties, and they are bound by its stipulations. For as long as they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, the contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>In a letter dated December 13, 1994, petitioner informed respondent that it has applied for the building permit, but that respondent, in turn, has to secure the ECC, which is "vital in the application for [the] building permit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Petitioner reminded respondent that as the owner, it (respondent) was in a better position to know the process flow of the meat processing plant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Thus, it was only logical that respondent should be the one to file and secure the ECC. The CA has also acknowledged this much, saying that it was appropriate and understandable that the duty to secure the ECC should devolve upon respondent because the nature of the business is highly technical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> However, the CA held that petitioner should have notified respondent that it (petitioner) would stop construction work until the required building permit was in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>We disagree with the CA that petitioner was not vigilant enough. The December 13, 1994 letter was, effectively, a reminder from which respondent should have taken its cue. Petitioner stated in the letter that it has already done its part in the filing of the building permit as required in the contract. But due to the unavailability of an ECC and other permits, petitioner informed respondent it is losing precious time. Without a building permit, petitioner cautioned respondent that its works will be limited to those covered by its existing excavation permit, which were excavation and fencing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Despite this reminder, respondent secured an ECC only on February 22, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Respondent should, therefore, bear the effect of the delay caused by the stop work order from the city hall. This is but fair because it failed in its obligation to initiate the building permit application.<br><br>Respondent should further bear the effect of the delay because its revision of the building plan contributed to delaying the building permit application.<br><br>The building plan, for reasons unclear, had to be revised during the excavation stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Respondent insists petitioner suggested the idea so the building would be converted from a meat processing plant to a regular office, thus dispensing with the requirement for an ECC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The ECC, however, continued to be required and was eventually secured and submitted for the building permit application. Petitioner claims the revision delayed its work for a month because petitioner had to rely mainly on the verbal instructions of respondent's representatives. Respondent, on the other hand, maintains there was no complete work stoppage. The lack of building plan did not materially hamper the construction because the revision only called for a reorientation of the floor plan. Thus, respondent only gave petitioner an extension of 7 days.<br><br>We agree with the CA that the revisions merely involved a reorientation of the project, such that petitioner only had to implement a mirror image of the original plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Engr. Aliño persuasively testified that there was not much effect in the construction schedule because it was still during the excavation for the foundation. As such, work can be done through the guidance of the project engineer. Respondent also gave petitioner a preliminary sketch to guide it on how to continue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Arch. Sare corroborated Engr. Aliño's testimony. According to Arch. Sare, the revised building plan is only a mirror image of the original one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Mr. Apoderado, on the other hand, failed to specify how drastically different the revised plan is from the original. During his cross-examination, Mr. Apoderado admitted that "not much" had been changed with the plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> We, therefore, uphold the original grant of an extension of 7 days.<br><br>However, the revision of the. building plan also affected the building permit application because the building plan was one of its supporting documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The lack of a building permit affected the work of petitioner in such a way that even though there was no complete work stoppage, the work was done surreptitiously and intermittently. Petitioner was wary of getting caught for working without a permit and be penalized accordingly. We find these concerns of petitioner genuine. As early as December 3, 1994, petitioner reminded respondent, about the revised plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> In its subsequent letter dated December 13, 1994, petitioner stressed that "at present, [its] work permit covers only the excavation and fencing of the work area as authorized by the Municipality of Makati."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Petitioner further informed respondent that without the plan and the building permit, its work would be limited to excavation and gravel fill. Respondent gave petitioner the revised building plan only on January 3, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> When it was submitted with the building permit application, the city hall officials questioned petitioner anew on the provisions for the parking area. It was finally re-submitted on February 27, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> when the stop work order was already in force. Thus, it may be true that even without a building permit, petitioner kept working, albeit discreetly, under respondent's instructions. But it cannot be denied as well that the lack of building permit prevented petitioner from carrying out its work freely and efficiently. The admission of Engr. Delima is telling:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Do you know for a fact also that the plaintiff in this case as early as December 13, 1994 wrote the defendant a letter, through you, informing the defendant that because of the lack of building permit the [timetable] or construction time will be considerably affected?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">In fact, the construction time was really affected, right?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As such, it is only fair that respondent bear the consequences of the 31 - day stop work order of the city hall because it failed in its duty of securing the building permit. Thus, for the delay in securing the building permit, we find that petitioner is entitled to a total extension of 38 days.<br><br><i>Petitioner is entitled to an extension of 40 days for the change orders and extra works.</i><br><br>The CA gave more credence to the testimony of Engr. Alifio that the change orders and extra works petitioner requested extensions for were mere linear activities that did not affect the construction time. The CA also held that contrary to Section 16 of the Construction Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> these change orders and extra works were done without the written mutual agreement of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>However, out of the 34-day extension respondent initially granted petitioner, 14 days were allocated for the construction of shear walls, which was one of the change orders and additional works respondent allegedly requested from petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> When petitioner requested for re-evaluation, respondent granted an additional extension of 26 days, which appear to cover for the alleged change orders and extra works.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> In its Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> dated October 10, 1997, respondent countered that "[petitioner] should be grateful for the grant of a [60-day] extension credit because most of [these] change orders/[revisions] consist of linear activities, <i>i.e.</i>, they can be performed simultaneously or without interrupting the normal pace of the construction work.

Notwithstanding the nonconformity with the literal terms of Section 16 of the Construction Agreement, respondent liberally granted extensions for the change orders and extra works.
