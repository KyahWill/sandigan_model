The Sandiganbayan then directed Atty. Mendoza to immediately proceed with his motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Atty. Mendoza thus orally presented his arguments for the reconsideration of the denial of Enrile’s <i>motion for bill of particulars</i>. The Sandiganbayan again declared a recess to deliberate on the motion. After five (5) minutes, PJ Cabotaje-Tang announced the Sandiganbayan’s denial of the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan reduced its rulings into writing on Enrile’s written and oral motions. The pertinent portion of this ruling reads:<br><blockquote><center>x x x x<br></center><br>In today’s consideration of accused Juan Ponce Enrile’s Motion for Bill of Particulars, the Court heard the parties on oral arguments in relation thereto.

The Court then declared another ten-minute recess to deliberate on the said motion for reconsideration.

Mendoza subsequently moved for the deferment of Enrile’s arraignment. The Sandiganbayan responded by directing the doctors present to determine whether he was physically fit to be arraigned. After he was declared fit, the Sandiganbayan proceeded with Enrile’s arraignment. Enrile entered a “no plea,” prompting the Sandiganbayan to enter a “not guilty” plea on his behalf.<br><br><center><b>II.<br><br><u>THE PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i></u></b><br></center><br>Enrile claims in this petition that the Sandiganbayan acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied his <i>motion for bill of particulars</i> despite the ambiguity and insufficiency of the Information filed against him. Enrile maintains that the denial was a serious violation of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<br><br>Enrile further alleges that he was left to speculate on what his specific participation in the crime of plunder had been. He posits that the Information should have stated the details of the particular acts that allegedly constituted the imputed series or combination of overt acts that led to the charge of plunder.

He maintains that the resolution of the probable cause issue was interlocutory and did “not bar the submission of the same issue in subsequent proceedings especially in the context of a different proceeding.”<br><br>Enrile thus prays that: “(a) the Court <i>en banc</i> act on the present petition; (b) by way of an interim measure, the Court issue a TRO or writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the Sandiganbayan from holding the pre-trial and subsequent proceedings against him in Criminal Case No. SB-14-CRM-0238 during the pendency of the present petition; (c) the Court expedite the proceedings and set the case for oral arguments; and (d) at the conclusion of the proceedings, the Court annul and set aside the Sandiganbayan’s July 11, 2014 resolution and his arraignment.”<br><br><b>A. <u>The People’s Comment</u></b><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the People of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> counters that the Sandiganbayan did not exercise its discretionary power in an arbitrary or despotic manner. Even assuming that the Sandiganbayan’s denial of Enrile’s motion for bill of particulars was erroneous, the error did not amount to lack or excess or jurisdiction. It further maintains that the assailed Sandiganbayan rulings were arrived at based on the procedures prescribed under Section 2, Rule VII of the Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The <i>People</i> also argues that the Information already contained the ultimate facts; matters of evidence do not need to be averred.<br><br><b>B. <u>Enrile’s Reply</u></b><br><br>In his Reply, Enrile essentially claims that the right to move for a bill of particulars is “ancillary to and in implementation” of an accused’s rights to due process, to be heard, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. He maintains that the Sandiganbayan’s denial of his motion for bill of particulars is not “a mere denial of a procedural right under the Rules of Court, but of rights vested in an accused under the Constitution to ensure fairness in the trial of the offense charged.” Enrile also adds that there could only be a fair trial if he could properly plead to the Information and prepare for trial.<br><br>Enrile further argues that the People’s Comment did not dispute the relevance of the details sought in the motion for bill of particulars. He likewise claims that <b><i>the “desired details” could not be found in the bundle of documents marked by the prosecution during the preliminary conference</i></b>. Finally, Enrile maintains that his motion for bill of particulars was not dilatory.<br><br><center><b>III.<br><br><u>THE COURT’S RULING</u></b><br></center><br><b>After due consideration, we resolve to partially GRANT the petition under the terms outlined below.</b><br><br><b>A. <u>The constitutional right of the accused to be informed</u></b><br><br>Under the Constitution, a person who stands charged of a criminal offense has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This right has long been established in English law, and is the same right expressly guaranteed in our 1987 Constitution. This right requires that the offense charged be stated with clarity and with certainty to inform the accused of the crime he is facing in sufficient detail to enable him to prepare his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the 1904 case of <i>United States v. Karelsen</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court explained the purpose of informing an accused in writing of the charges against him from the perspective of his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him:<br><blockquote>The object of this written accusation was – First. To furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defense; and second, to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause; and third, to inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction, if one should be had. (United States vs. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542.) In order that this requirement may be satisfied, <b>facts must be stated, not conclusions of law</b>. Every crime is made up of certain acts and intent; these must be set forth in the complaint with reasonable particularity of time, place, names (plaintiff and defendant), and circumstances. In short, the complaint must contain a specific allegation of every fact and circumstances necessary to constitute the crime charged. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>The objective, in short, is to describe the act with sufficient certainty to fully appraise the accused of the nature of the charge against him and to avoid possible surprises that may lead to injustice. Otherwise, the accused would be left speculating on why he has been charged at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Hon. Mencias, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court further explained that a person’s constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him signifies that an accused should be given the necessary data on why he is the subject of a criminal proceeding. The Court added that the act or conduct imputed to a person must be described with sufficient particularity to enable the accused to defend himself properly.<br><br>The general grant and recognition of a protected right emanates from Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution which states that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The purpose of the guaranty is to prevent governmental encroachment against the life, liberty, and property of individuals; to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of the government, unrestrained by the established principles of private rights and distributive justice x x x; and to secure to all persons equal and impartial justice and the benefit of the general law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Separately from Section 1, Article III is the specific and direct underlying root of the right to information in criminal proceedings – Section 14(1), Article III – which provides that “<i>No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law</i>.” Thus, no doubt exists that the right to be informed of the cause of the accusation in a criminal case has deep constitutional roots that, rather than being cavalierly disregarded, should be carefully protected.<br><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Sandiganbayan</i> (<i>2nd Division</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court, in sustaining the Sandiganbayan’s grant of the motion for bill of particulars of Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., held that “the facile verbosity with which the legal counsel for the government flaunted the accusation of excesses against the Marcoses in general terms must be soonest refurbished by a bill of particulars, so that respondent can properly prepare an intelligent responsive pleading and so that trial in this case will proceed as expeditiously as possible.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Court additionally stated that:<br><blockquote>This Court has been liberal in giving the lower courts the widest latitude of discretion in setting aside default orders justified under the right to due process principle. Plain justice demands and the law requires no less that defendants must know what the complaint against them is all about.<br><br>x x x In the interest of justice, we need to dispel the impression in the individual respondents' minds that they are being railroaded out of their rights and properties without due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><b>B. <u>Procedural Sufficiency of the Information</u></b><br><br>An Information is an accusation in writing charging a person with an offense, signed by the prosecutor and filed with the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, in implementing the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, specifically require certain matters to be stated in the Information for its sufficiency. <b><i>The requirement aims to enable the accused to properly prepare for his defense since <u>he is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts constituting the offense charged</u>.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>To be considered as sufficient and valid, an information must state the name of the accused; the designation of the offense given by the statute; the acts or omissions constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute penalizing it. The acts or omissions constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances alleged must be stated in ordinary and concise language; they do not necessarily need to be in the language of the statute, and should be in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is charged and what qualifying and aggravating circumstances are alleged, so that the court can pronounce judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Rules do not require the Information to exactly allege the date and place of the commission of the offense, unless the date and the place are material ingredients or essential elements of the offense, or are necessary for its identification.<br><br><b>B.1. <u>Ultimate facts versus Evidentiary facts</u></b><br><br>An Information only needs to state the ultimate facts constituting the offense; the evidentiary and other details (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the facts supporting the ultimate facts) can be provided during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>Ultimate facts</b> is defined as “those facts which the expected evidence will support.

Neither is it necessary to describe conspiracy with the same degree of particularity required in describing a substantive offense. It is enough that the indictment contains a statement of the facts relied upon to be constitutive of the offense in ordinary and concise language, with as much certainty as the nature of the case will admit, in a manner that can enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended, and with such precision that the accused may plead his acquittal or conviction to a subsequent indictment based on the same facts. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote><b>D.1.b. <u>The Requested Details of Enrile’s PDAF</u></b><br><br>We similarly rule that the petitioner is <b>not entitled to a bill of particulars</b> for specifics sought under the questions –<br><blockquote><b><i>For each of the years 2004-2010, under what law or official document is a portion of the “Priority Development Assistance Fund” identified as that of a member of Congress, in this instance, as ENRILE’s, to be found?

Whether a discretionary fund (in the form of PDAF) had indeed been made available to Enrile as a member of the Philippine Congress and in what amounts are evidentiary matters that do not need to be reflected with particularity in the Information, and may be passed upon at the full-blown trial on the merits of the case.<br><br><b>D.1.b(i) <u>The yearly PDAF Allocations</u></b><br><br>Specifically, we believe that the exact amounts of Enrile’s yearly PDAF allocations, if any, from 2004 to 2010 need not be pleaded with specific particularity to enable him to properly plead and prepare for his defense. In fact, Enrile may be in a better position to know these details than the prosecution and thus cannot claim that he would be taken by surprise during trial by the omission in the Information of his annual PDAF allocations.<br><br>Thus, whether the amounts of Enrile’s PDAF allocations have been specified or not, Enrile has been sufficiently informed that he stands charged of endorsing Napoles’ non-government organizations to implement spurious or fictitious projects, in exchange for a percentage of his PDAF.<br><br><b>D.1.b(ii) <u>The details of the COA Audits</u></b><br><br>The details of the “<i>COA audits or field investigations</i>” only support the ultimate fact that the projects implemented by Napoles’ NGOs, and funded by Enrile’s PDAF, were nonexisting or fictitious. Thus, they are evidentiary in nature and do not need to be spelled out with particularity in the Information.<br><br>To require more details on these matters from the prosecution would amount to asking for evidentiary information that the latter intends to present at the trial; it would be a compulsion on the prosecution to disclose in advance of the trial the evidence it will use in proving the charges alleged in the indictment.<br><br><b>D.1.c. <u>Other Sources of Kickbacks and Commissions</u></b><br><br>We also <b>deny Enrile’s plea for details <i>on who “the others”</i></b> were (aside from Napoles, Lim and De Asis) from whom he allegedly received kickbacks and commissions. These other persons do not stand charged of conspiring with Enrile and need not therefore be stated with particularly, either as specific individuals or as John Does. The Court cannot second-guess the prosecution’s reason for not divulging the identity of these “others” who may potentially be witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>What the Constitution guarantees the accused is simply the right to meet and examine the prosecution witnesses.

What are the particular overt acts which constitute the “series”? Who committed those acts?</u></i></b> [Emphasis ours.]<br></blockquote><b>D.2.a. <u>Reason for Requirement for Particulars of Overt Acts</u></b><br><br>Plunder is the crime committed by public officers when they amass wealth involving at least P50 million by means of a combination or series of overt acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Under these terms, it is not sufficient to simply allege that the amount of ill-gotten wealth amassed amounted to at least P50 million; the manner of amassing the ill-gotten wealth – whether <b><i>through a combination or series of overt acts under Section 1(d) of R.A. No. 7080</i></b> – is an important element that must be alleged.<br><br>When the Plunder Law speaks of “<b><i>combination</i></b>,” it refers to at least two (2) acts falling under <u>different</u> categories listed in Section 1, paragraph (d) of R.A. No. 7080 [<i>for example</i>, raids on the public treasury under Section 1, paragraph (d), subparagraph (1), and fraudulent conveyance of assets belonging to the National Government under Section 1, paragraph (d), subparagraph (3)].<br><br>On the other hand, to constitute a “<b><i>series</i></b>” there must be two (2) or more overt or criminal acts falling under the <u>same</u> category of enumeration found in Section 1, paragraph (d) [<i>for example</i>, misappropriation, malversation and raids on the public treasury, all of which fall under Section 1, paragraph (d), subparagraph (1)].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>With respect to paragraph (a) of the Information –<br><blockquote>[(<i>i.e., by repeatedly receiving from NAPOLES and/or her representatives LIM, DE ASIS, and others, kickbacks or commissions under the following circumstances: before, during and/or after the project identification, NAPOLES gave, and ENRILE and/or REYES received, a percentage of the cost of a project to be funded from ENRILE’S Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), in consideration of ENRILE’S endorsement, directly or through REYES, to the appropriate government agencies, of NAPOLES’ non-government organizations which became the recipients and/or target implementers of ENRILE’S PDAF projects, which duly funded projects turned out to be ghosts or fictitious, thus enabling NAPOLES to misappropriate the PDAF proceeds for her personal gain x x x</i>)] –<br></blockquote>we hold that the prosecution employed a generalized or <b>shotgun approach</b> in alleging the criminal overt acts allegedly committed by Enrile. This approach rendered the allegations of the paragraph uncertain to the point of ambiguity <b><i>for purposes of enabling Enrile to respond and prepare for his defense</i></b>. These points are explained in greater detail below.<br><br>The heart of the Plunder Law lies in the phrase “combination or series of overt or criminal acts.” Hence, <b><i>even if the accumulated ill-gotten wealth amounts to at least P50 million, a person cannot be prosecuted for the crime of plunder if this resulted from a single criminal act</i></b>. This interpretation of the Plunder Law is very clear from the congressional deliberations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Considering that without a number of overt or criminal acts, there can be no crime of plunder, the various overt acts that constitute the “combination” and “series” the Information alleged, are material facts that should not only be alleged, but must be stated with sufficient definiteness so that the accused would know what he is specifically charged of and why he stands charged, so that he could properly defend himself against the charge.<br><br>Thus, the <b>several</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, at least 2) acts which are indicative of the overall scheme or conspiracy must not be <i>generally</i> stated; they should be stated with <i>enough particularity</i> for Enrile (and his co-accused) to be able to prepare the corresponding refuting evidence to meet these alleged overt acts.<br><br>It is insufficient, too, to merely allege that a set of acts had been <i>repeatedly</i> done (although this may constitute a series if averred with sufficient definiteness), and aver that these acts resulted in the accumulation or acquisition of ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least P172,834,500.00, as in this case. The Information should reflect with particularity <i>the predicate acts</i> that underlie the crime of plunder, based on the enumeration in Section 1(d) of R.A. No. 7080.<br><br>A reading of the Information filed against Enrile in the present case shows that <b><i>the prosecution made little or no effort to particularize the transactions that would constitute the required series or combination of overt acts</i></b>.<br><br>In fact, it <b><i>clustered under paragraph (a) of the Information its recital of the manner Enrile and his co-accused allegedly operated, thus describing its general view of the series or combination of overt criminal acts that constituted the crime of plunder</i></b>.<br><br>Without any specification of the basic transactions where kickbacks or commissions amounting to at least P172,834,500.00 had been allegedly received, Enrile’s preparation for trial is obviously hampered. This defect is not cured by mere reference to the prosecution’s attachment, as <b><i>Enrile already stated in his Reply that the “desired details” could not be found in the bundle of documents marked by the prosecution, which documents are not integral parts of the Information</i></b>. Hence, the prosecution does not discharge its burden of informing Enrile what these overt acts were by simply pointing to these documents.<br><br>In providing the particulars of the overt acts that constitute the “combination” or “series” of transactions constituting plunder, it stands to reason that the <b><i>amounts involved, or at their ball park figures</i></b>, should be stated; these transactions are not necessarily uniform in amount, and cannot simply collectively be described as amounting to P172,834,500.00 without hampering Enrile’s right to respond after receiving the right information.<br><br>To stress, this final sum is <b>not a general ball park figure</b> but a very <b>specific sum based on a number of different acts</b> and hence must have a breakdown. Providing this breakdown reinforces the required specificity in describing the different overt acts.<br><br>Negatively stated, unless Enrile is given the particulars and is later given the chance to object to unalleged details, he stands to be surprised at the trial at the same time that the prosecution is given the opportunity to play fast and loose with its evidence to satisfy the more than P50 Million requirement of law.<br><br><b>D.2.b. <u>Approximate Dates of Commissions or Kickbacks</u></b><br><br>Enrile should likewise know the <u><i>approximate</i> dates, at least, of the receipt of the kickbacks and commissions</u>, so that he could prepare the necessary pieces of evidence, documentary or otherwise, to disprove the allegations against him. We point out that the period covered by the indictment extends from “<i>2004 to 2010 or thereabout</i>,” of which, we again stress that different overt acts constituting of the elements of Plunder took place during this period.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the length of time involved – <b><i>six years</i></b> – will pose difficulties to Enrile in the preparation of his defense and will render him susceptible to surprises. Enrile should <i>not be left guessing and speculating</i> which one/s from among the numerous transactions involving his discretionary PDAF funds from 2004 to 2010, are covered by the indictment.<br><br><b>D.2.c. <u>The Projects Funded and NGOs Involved</u></b><br><br>Enrile is also <b>entitled to particulars</b> specifying the project that Enrile allegedly funded <b><i>coupled with the name of Napoles’ NGO</i></b> (<i>e.g.</i>, Pangkabuhayan Foundation, Inc.), to sufficiently inform Enrile of the particular transactions referred to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Be it remembered that the <b><u>core of the indictment</u></b> is:<br><br><b>(1) the funding of nonexisting projects using Enrile’s PDAF;<br><br>(2) Enrile’s endorsement of Napoles’ NGOs to the government agencies to implement these projects; and<br><br>(3) Enrile’s receipt of kickbacks or commissions in exchange for his endorsement.</b><br><br>Under the elaborate scheme alleged to have been committed by Enrile and his co-accused, the <b><u>project identification</u></b> was what started the totality of acts constituting plunder: only after a project has been identified could Enrile have endorsed Napoles’ NGO to the appropriate government agency that, in turn, would implement the supposed project using Enrile’s PDAF. Note that without the project identification, no justification existed to release Enrile’s PDAF to Napoles’ allegedly bogus NGO.<br><br>In these lights, the “<b><i><u>identified project</u></i></b>” and “<b><i><u>Napoles’ NGO</u></i></b>” are material facts that should be clearly and definitely stated in the Information to allow Enrile to adequately prepare his defense evidence on the specific transaction pointed to. The omission of these details will necessarily leave Enrile guessing on what transaction/s he will have to defend against, since he may have funded other projects with his PDAF. Specification will also allow him to object to evidence not referred to or covered by the Information’s ultimate facts.<br><br><b>D.2.d. <u>The Government Agencies Serving as Conduits</u></b><br><br>The <b><i>government agencies</i></b> to whom Enrile endorsed Napoles’ NGOs are also material facts that must be specified, since they served a <b><u>necessary role</u></b> in the crime charged – <b>the alleged conduits between Enrile and Napoles’ NGOs</b>. They were indispensable participants in the elaborate scheme alleged to have been committed.<br><br>The particular person/s in each government agency who facilitated the transactions, need not anymore be named in the Information, as these are already evidentiary matters. The identification of the particular agency vis-à-vis Napoles’ NGO and the identified project, will already inform Enrile of the transaction referred to.<br><br>In <i>Tantuico v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the Republic filed a case for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution, and damages before the Sandiganbayan against former President Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos, Benjamin Romualdez, and Francisco Tantuico, Jr. Tantuico filed a motion for bill of particulars essentially alleging that the complaint was couched in general terms and did not have the parti­culars that would inform him of the alleged factual and legal bases. The Sandiganbayan denied his motion on the ground that the particulars sought are evidentiary in nature. Tantuico moved to reconsider this decision, but the Sandiganbayan again denied his motion.<br><br>The Court overturned the Sandiganbayan’s ruling and directed the prosecution to prepare and file a bill of particulars. Significantly, the Court held that <b>the particulars prayed for, such as: names of persons, names of corporations, dates, amounts involved, a specification of property for identification purposes, the particular transactions involving withdrawals and disbursements, and a statement of other material facts as would support the conclusions and inferences in the complaint, are not evidentiary in nature</b>. The Court explained that those particulars are material facts that should be clearly and definitely averred in the complaint so that the defendant may be fairly informed of the claims made against him and be prepared to meet the issues at the trial.<br><br>To be sure, the differences between ultimate and evidentiary matters are not easy to distinguish. While <i>Tantuico</i> was a civil case and did not involve the crime of plunder, the Court’s ruling nonetheless serves as a useful guide in the determination of what matters are indispensable and what matters may be omitted in the Information, in relation with the constitutional right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<br><br>In the present case, the particulars on the:<br><blockquote>(1) projects involved;<br><br>(2) Napoles’ participating NGOs; and<br><br>(3) the government agency involved in each transaction<br></blockquote>will undoubtedly provide Enrile with sufficient data to know the specific transactions involved, and thus enable him to prepare adequately and intelligently whatever defense or defenses he may have.<br><br>We reiterate that the purpose of a bill of particular is to clarify allegations in the Information that are indefinite, vague, or are conclusions of law <b><i>to enable the accused to properly plead and prepare for trial, not simply to inform him of the crime of which he stands accused</i></b>. Verily, an accused cannot intelligently respond to the charge laid if the allegations are incomplete or are unclear to him.<br><br>We are aware that in a prosecution for plunder, what is sought to be established is the commission of the criminal acts in furtherance of the acquisition of ill-gotten wealth. In the language of Section 4 of R.A. No. 7080, for purposes of establishing the crime of plunder, it is sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt a <b><i>pattern of overt or criminal acts</i></b> indicative of the overall unlawful scheme or conspiracy to amass, accumulate, or acquire ill-gotten wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The term “<b><i>overall unlawful scheme</i></b>” indicates a general plan of action or method that the principal accused and public officer and others conniving with him follow to achieve their common criminal goal. In the alternative, if no overall scheme can be found or where the schemes or methods used by the multiple accused vary, the overt or criminal acts must form part of a conspiracy to attain a common criminal goal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Lest Section 4 be misunderstood as allowing the prosecution to allege that a set of acts has been <i>repeatedly</i> done (thereby showing a ‘pattern’ of overt criminal acts), as has been done in the present case, we point out that this section does not dispense with the requirement of stating the essential or material facts of each component or predicate act of plunder; <b><i>it merely prescribes a rule of procedure for the prosecution of plunder</i></b>.<br><br>In <i>Estrada v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> we construed this procedural rule to mean that [w]hat the prosecution needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt was only the number of acts sufficient to form a combination or series that would constitute a pattern involving an amount of at least P50,000,000.00. There was no need to prove each and every other act alleged in the Information to have been committed by the accused in furtherance of the overall unlawful scheme or conspiracy to amass, accumulate, or acquire ill-gotten wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>If, for example, the accused is charged in the Information of malversing public funds on twenty different (20) occasions, the prosecution does not need to prove all 20 transactions; it suffices if a number of these acts of malversation can be proven with moral certainty, provided only that the series or combination of transaction would amount to at least P50,000,000.00. Nonetheless, <b><i>each of the twenty transactions should be averred with particularity, more so if the circumstances surrounding each transaction are not the same</i></b>. This is the only way that the accused can properly prepare for his defense during trial.<br><br><b>D.3. <u>Paragraph (b) of the Information</u></b><br><br>As his last requested point, Enrile wants the prosecution to provide the details of the allegation under paragraph (b) of the Information (<i>i.e., x x x by taking undue advantage, on several occasions, of their official position, authority, relationships, connections, and influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice, of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines</i>) in the following manner:<br><blockquote>Provide the details of <i>how</i> Enrile took undue advantage, on several occasions, of his official positions, authority, relationships, connections, and influence to unjustly enrich himself at the expense and to the damage and prejudice, of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines. Was this because he <i>received any money</i> from the government? <i>From whom</i> and <i>for what</i> reason did he receive any money or property from the government through which he “unjustly enriched himself”? State the details from whom each <i>amount</i> was received, the <i>place</i> and the <i>time</i>.<br></blockquote>Our ruling on Enrile’s desired details – specifically, the particular overt act/s alleged to constitute the “combination” and “series” charged in the Information; a breakdown of the amounts of the kickbacks and commissions allegedly received, stating how the amount of P172,834,500.00 was arrived at; a brief description of the ‘identified’ projects where kickbacks and commissions were received; the <i>approximate</i> dates of receipt of the alleged kickbacks and commissions from the identified projects; the name of Napoles’ non-government organizations (NGOs) which were the alleged “recipients and/or target implementors of Enrile’s PDAF projects;” and the government agencies to whom Enrile allegedly endorsed Napoles’ NGOs – <b>renders it unnecessary to require the prosecution to submit further particulars on the allegations contained under paragraph (b) of the Information</b>.<br><br>Simply put, the particular overt acts alleged to constitute the combination or series required by the crime of plunder, coupled with a specification of the other non-evidentiary details stated above, already answer the question of how Enrile took undue advantage of his position, authority, relationships, connections and influence as Senator to unjustly enrich himself.<br><br>We also point out that the PDAF is a discretionary fund intended solely for public purposes. Since the Information stated that Enrile, as “Philippine Senator,” committed the offense “in relation to his office,” by “repeatedly receiving kickbacks or commissions” from Napoles and/or her representatives through projects funded by his (Enrile’s) PDAF, then it already alleged how undue advantage had been taken and how the Filipino people and the Republic had been prejudiced. These points are fairly deducible from the allegations in the Information as supplemented by the required particulars.<br><br><b>E. <u>The Grave Abuse of Discretion</u></b><br><br>In the light of all these considerations, we hold that the <b><i>Sandiganbayan’s denial of the petitioner’s motion for a bill of particulars, on the ground that the details sought to be itemized or specified are all evidentiary – without any explanation supporting this conclusion – constitutes grave abuse of discretion</i></b>.<br><br>As discussed above, some of the desired details are material facts that must be alleged to enable the petitioner to properly plead and prepare his defense. The Sandiganbayan should have diligently sifted through each detail sought to be specified, and made the necessary determination of whether each detail was an ultimate or evidentiary fact, particularly after Enrile stated in his Reply that the “desired details” could not be found in the bundle of documents marked by the prosecution. We cannot insist or speculate that he is feigning ignorance of the presence of these desired details; neither can we put on him the burden of unearthing from these voluminous documents what the desired details are. The remedy of a bill of particulars is precisely made available by the Rules to enable an accused to positively respond and make an intelligent defense.<br><br>Justice Carpio’s reference to the voluminous 144-page Ombudsman’s resolution (which found probable cause to indict the petitioner and his co-accused not only of the crime of plunder, but also for violations of several counts of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practice Act) to justify his argument that Enrile was already aware of the details he seeks in his motion for a bill of particulars, all the more strengthens our conclusive position that the Information for plunder filed against Enrile was ambiguous and glaringly insufficient to enable him to make a proper plea and to prepare for trial. We reiterate, to the point of being repetitive, that the purpose of the bill of particulars in criminal cases is to supply vague facts or allegations in the complaint or information to enable the accused to properly plead and prepare for trial.<br><br>Moreover, a resolution arising from a preliminary investigation does not amount to nor does it serve the purpose of a bill of particulars.<br><br>A bill of particulars guards against the taking of an accused by surprise by <b>restricting the scope of the proof</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> <b>it limits the evidence to be presented by the parties to the matters alleged in the Information as supplemented by the bill</b>. It is for this reason that the failure of an accused to move for a bill of particulars deprives him of the right to object to evidence which could be lawfully introduced and admitted under an information of more or less general terms which sufficiently charges the defendants with a definite crime.<br><br>The record on preliminary investigation, in comparison, serves as the written account of the inquisitorial process when the fiscal determined the existence of <i>prima facie</i> evidence to indict a person for a particular crime. The record of the preliminary investigation, as a general rule, does not even form part of the records of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> These features of the record of investigation are significantly different from the bill of particulars that serves as basis, together with the Information, in specifying the overt acts constituting the offense that the accused pleaded to during arraignment.<br><br>Notably, <b>plunder is a crime composed of several predicate criminal acts</b>. To prove plunder, <b>the prosecution must weave a web out of the six ways of illegally amassing wealth and show how the various acts reveal a combination or series of means or schemes that reveal a pattern of criminality</b>. The interrelationship of the separate acts must be shown and be established as a scheme to accumulate ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least P50 million.<br><br>Plunder thus involves intricate predicate criminal acts and numerous transactions and schemes that span a period of time. Naturally, in its prosecution, the State possesses an “<b>effective flexibility</b>” of proving a predicate criminal act or transaction, not originally contemplated in the Information, but is otherwise included in the broad statutory definition, in light of subsequently discovered evidence. The unwarranted use of the flexibility is what the bill of particulars guards against.<br><br><b>Justice Carpio further argues that the <i>ponencia</i> transformed the nature of an action from an accusation in writing charging a person with an offense to an initiatory pleading alleging a cause of action.</b><br><br>We see nothing wrong with such treatment, for a motion for a bill of particulars in criminal cases is designed to achieve the same purpose as the motion for a bill of particulars in civil cases. In fact, certainty, to a reasonable extent, is an essential attribute of all pleadings, both civil and criminal, and is more especially needed in the latter where conviction is followed by penal consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>Thus, even if the Information employs the statutory words does not mean that it is unnecessary to allege such facts in connection with the commission of the offense as will certainly put the accused on full notice of what he is called upon to defend, and establish such a record as will effectually bar a subsequent prosecution for that identical offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br><b>Notably, conviction for plunder carries with it the penalty of capital punishment; for this reason, more process is due, not less.</b> When a person’s life interest – protected by the life, liberty, and property language recognized in the due process clause – is at stake in the proceeding, all measures must be taken to ensure the protection of those fundamental rights.<br><br>As we emphasized in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> “the administration of justice is not a matter of guesswork. <b><i>The name of the game is fair play, not foul play.</i></b> We cannot allow a legal skirmish where, from the start, one of the protagonists enters the arena with one arm tied to his back.”<br><br>Finally, we find no significance in Justice Carpio’s argument that Atty. Estelito Mendoza did not previously find vague the Information for plunder filed against President Joseph Estrada in 2001.<br><br>Under the amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> against Estrada, et al., each overt act that constituted the series or combination and corresponding to the predicate acts under Section 1(d) had been averred with sufficient particularity <b>so that there was no doubt what particular transaction was referred to</b>.<br><br>We point out that unlike in the Information against Enrile, the following matters had been averred with sufficient definiteness, <i>viz</i>: the predicate acts that constitute the crime of plunder; the breakdown of how the alleged amount of P4,097,804,173.17, more or less, had been arrived at; the participants involved in each transaction; and the specific sources of the illegal wealth amassed.<br><br>At any rate, that Atty. Mendoza did not previously question the indictment of President Estrada <i>via</i> a motion for bill of particulars does not <i>ipso facto</i> mean that the present Information for plunder filed against Enrile is not vague and ambiguous.<br><br><center><b>Sandiganbayan Ground #2:<br><br><u>That Enrile’s cited grounds are reiterations of the grounds previously raised</u></b><br></center><br>Enrile does not deny that the arguments he raised in his <i>supplemental opposition to issuance of a warrant of arrest and for dismissal of information</i> and in his <i>motion for bill of particulars</i> were identical. He argues, however, that the mere reiteration of these grounds should not be a ground for the denial of his motion for bill of particulars, since “<b><i>the context in which those questions were raised was entirely different</i></b>.”<br><br>While both the motion to dismiss the Information and the motion for bill of particulars involved the right of an accused to due process, the enumeration of the details desired in Enrile’s <i>supplemental opposition to issuance of a warrant of arrest and for dismissal of information</i> and in his <i>motion for bill of particulars</i> are different viewed particularly <b>from the prism of their respective objectives</b>.<br><br>In the <b><u>former</u></b>, Enrile took the position that the Information did not state a crime for which he can be convicted; thus, the Information is void; he alleged a defect of substance. In the <b><u>latter</u></b>, he already impliedly admits that the Information sufficiently alleged a crime but is unclear and lacking in details that would allow him to properly plead and prepare his defense; he essentially alleged here a defect of form.<br><br>Note that in the <b><u>former</u></b>, the purpose is to dismiss the Information for its failure to state the nature and cause of the accusation against Enrile; while the details desired in the <b><u>latter</u></b> (the motion for bill of particulars) are required to be specified in sufficient detail because the allegations in the Information are vague, indefinite, or in the form of conclusions and will not allow Enrile to adequately prepare his defense unless specifications are made.<br><br><b><i>That every element constituting the offense had been alleged in the Information does not preclude the accused from requesting for more specific details of the various acts or omissions he is alleged to have committed. <u>The request for details is precisely the function of a bill of particulars.</u></i></b><br><br>Hence, while the information may be sufficient for purposes of stating the cause and the crime an accused is charged, the allegations may still be inadequate for purposes of enabling him to properly plead and prepare for trial.<br><br>We likewise find no complete congruence between the grounds invoked and the details sought by Enrile in his motion for bill of particulars, and the grounds invoked in opposing the warrant for his arrest issued, so that the Sandiganbayan’s action in one would bar Enrile from essentially invoking the same grounds.<br><br>The judicial determination of probable cause is one made by the judge to ascertain whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused. The judge must satisfy himself that based on the evidence submitted, there is necessity for placing the accused under custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Simply put, the judge determines whether the necessity exists to place the accused under immediate custody to avoid frustrating the ends of justice.<br><br>On the other hand, the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the accused the remedy of a bill of particulars to better inform himself of the specifics or particulars concerning facts or matters that had not been averred in the Information with the necessary clarity for purposes of his defense.<br><br>Its purpose is to better acquaint the accused of the specific acts and/or omissions in relation with the crime charged, to limit the matters and the evidence that the prosecution may otherwise be allowed to use against him under a more or less general averment, and to meet the charges head on and timely object to evidence whose inadmissibility may otherwise be deemed waived.<br><br>Based on these considerations, the question of whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant of arrest against an accused, is separate and distinct from the issue of whether the allegations in the Information have been worded with sufficient definiteness to enable the accused to properly plead and prepare his defense. While the grounds cited for each may seemingly be the same, they are submitted for different purposes and should be appreciated from different perspectives, so that the insufficiency of these grounds for one does not necessarily translate to insufficiency for the other. Thus, the resolution of the issue of probable cause should not bar Enrile from seeking a more detailed averment of the allegations in the Information.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan grossly missed these legal points and thus gravely abused its discretion: <b>it used wrong and completely inapplicable considerations to support its conclusion</b>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing:<br><br>a.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>We PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the Sandiganbayan’s resolutions dated July 11, 2014, which denied Enrile’s motion for bill of particulars and his motion for reconsideration of this denial.<br><br>b. We <b>DIRECT</b> the <i>People of the Philippines</i> to <b>SUBMIT</b>, within a <b>non-extendible period of fifteen (15) days from finality</b> of this Decision, with copy furnished to Enrile, a bill of particulars containing the facts sought that we herein rule to be material and necessary.

The <i>approximate</i> dates of receipt, “in 2004 to 2010 or thereabout,” of the alleged kickbacks and commissions from the identified projects. At the very least, the prosecution should state the year when the kickbacks and transactions from the identified projects were received.<br><br>5. The name of Napoles’ non-government organizations (<i>NGOs</i>) which were the alleged “recipients and/or target implementors of Enrile’s PDAF projects.”<br><br>6.

We rejected such claim, noting that the allegation in question “was merely a continuation of the prior allegation of the acts”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of petitioner and following the rule that “[t]he test of the [I]nformation’s sufficiency is x x x whether <i>the material facts alleged in the complaint or information shall establish the essential elements of the offense charged as defined in the law</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>We applied the same rule to reject the claim of the accused in Go, on trial for violation of Republic Act No. 337 (General Banking Act), that the allegations in the Information filed against him were vague, a result of the prosecution’s “shotgun approach” in framing the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> We found the Information sufficient, as it complied with the rule that “an Information only needs to state the ultimate facts constituting the offense, <i>not the finer details of why and how the illegal acts alleged amounted to undue injury or damage</i> x x x,” adding that “[t]he facts and circumstances necessary to be included in the Information are determined by reference to the definition and elements of the specific crimes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The accused in <i>Romualdez</i>, like the accused in Miguel, also questioned the sufficiency of the allegations in the Information filed against him for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, contending that it failed to indicate how his holding of dual positions caused “undue injury” to the government. We dismissed the claim, noting that “<i>[t]he allegation of ‘undue injury’ in the Information</i>, consisting of the extent of the injury and how it was caused, <i>is complete</i>” and that the details behind such element of the offense are “matters that are appropriate for the trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We based this conclusion by reiterating that “an Information only needs to state the ultimate facts constituting the offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>During the same decade, we applied the rule in question in <i>People v.

The accused in <i>Sanico</i> was charged with acts of lasciviousness as penalized under the Revised Penal Code (RPC), although the allegations in the Information covered the elements for acts of lasciviousness as penalized under Republic Act No. 7610 (RA 7610). In sustaining the Court of Appeals’ imposition of the penalty under RA 7610, we ruled that the failure of the prosecution to allege violation of RA 7610 is not fatal as “[t]he character of the crime is not determined by the caption or preamble of the information nor by the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, but by the <i>recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances in the complaint or information</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In contrast with the facts in <i>Sanico</i>, the accused in <i>Banzuela</i> stood charged with acts of lasciviousness in violation of RA 7610 but the Information failed to allege the element under Section 5 of that law that the victim is a “child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.” Thus, we held that the accused can only be made to suffer the penalty provided for acts of lasciviousness as penalized under the RPC because “the character of the crime is determined neither by the caption or preamble of the information[,] nor by the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated x x x but by the <i>recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances in the information</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We applied the same rule in Abello to hold the accused liable for acts of lasciviousness as penalized under the RPC even though the Information filed against him charged him with acts of lasciviousness as penalized under RA 7610 on the ground that the prosecution failed to allege and prove the element of coercion or intimidation as required under Section 5(b) of the latter law.<br><br>In <i>Pielago</i>, we held that the amendment of the Information against the accused changing the designation of the crime alleged from “acts of lasciviousness in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610” to “the crime of rape by sexual assault penalized under Article 266-A(2)”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the RPC is not prejudicial to the accused because the original Information already alleged the elements of the latter felony and the “character of the crime is not determined by the caption or preamble of the information nor from the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, but by the <i>recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances in the complaint or information</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> We arrived at the same conclusion in Subesa where the accused was charged with acts of lasciviousness under RA 7610 but was held liable for rape under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC.<br><br>The Court again applied the rule in question in Rayon which presented a variance between the crime designated and the acts alleged in the Information.

It alleged that petitioner, a public official, conspiring with his co-accused Napoles, received from the latter, on several occasions, kickbacks of more than P50 million from fictitious projects he funded with his legislative discretionary fund through conduit NGOs controlled by Napoles, unjustly enriching himself. <b>These allegations state the basic, ultimate facts constituting the elements of plunder as defined under RA 7080.</b> As aptly observed by the Sandiganbayan:<br><blockquote>An objective and judicious reading of the x x x <i>Information shows that <u>there is nothing ambiguous or confusing</u> in the allegations therein</i>. The Information clearly alleges that accused Enrile and Reyes committed the offense in relation to their respective public offices and that they conspired with each other and with accused Napoles, Lim and De Asis, to amass, accumulate, and/or acquire ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least PhP172,834,500.00. <i>The combination or series of overt criminal acts that the said accused performed include the following circumstances: before, during and/or after the project identification, Napoles gave, and accused Enrile and/or Reyes received, a percentage of the cost of a project to be funded from Enrile’s PDAF, in consideration of Enrile’s endorsement, directly or through Reyes, to the appropriate government agencies, of Napoles’ non-government organizations (NGOs).</i> These NGOs became the recipients and/or target implementors of Enrile’s PDAF projects, which duly-funded projects turned out to be ghosts or fictitious, thus enabling Napoles to misappropriate the PDAF proceeds for her personal gain. <i>Sub-paragraph (b), on the other hand, alleges the predicate act that said accused Enrile and Reyes took undue advantage, on several occasions, of their official positions, authority, relationships, connections, and influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice, of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.</i><br><br>The Court finds that the allegations in the subject Information sufficiently comply with the requirements of Sections 6, 8 and 9 of Rule 10 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. <i>These allegations adequately apprise the herein accused of the nature and cause of the accusations against them.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Interestingly, the lack of allegations in an Information for plunder through receipt of kickbacks (among others) on the (1) the breakdown of the total amount of kickbacks received; (2) dates of receipt of such; (3) the names of the persons who gave the kickbacks; (4) the names of the persons who received them; and (5) the combination or series of acts involving the receipt of such kickbacks, did not elicit any complaint of vagueness from an accused whom petitioner’s counsel also represented in the Sandiganbayan. The Information for plunder filed against former President Joseph Estrada in 2001, then represented by Atty. Estelito Mendoza as lead counsel, alleged that the former received kickbacks breaching the plunder threshold of P50 million <i>without stating the details in question</i>. The Information reads in relevant parts:<br><blockquote><b><i>That during the period from June, 1998 to January, 2001</i></b>, in the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Joseph Ejercito Estrada, then a public officer, being then the President of the Republic of the Philippines, by himself and/or in connivance/conspiracy with his co-accused, who are members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates and/or other persons, <b><i>by taking undue advantage of his official position</i></b>, x x x did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and criminally amass, accumulate and acquire by himself, directly or indirectly, ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of four billion ninety seven million eight hundred four thousand one hundred seventy three pesos and seventeen centavos [P4,097,804,173.17], more or less, <b><i>thereby unjustly enriching himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage of the Filipino people</i></b> and the Republic of the Philippines, <b><i>through any or a combination or a series of overt or criminal acts, or similar schemes or means, described as follows:</i></b><br><br>(a) by <b><i>receiving</i></b> or collecting, directly or indirectly, <b><i>on several instances</i></b>, money in the aggregate amount of five hundred forty-five million pesos <b><i>(P545,000,000.00), more or less, from illegal gambling in the form</i></b> of gift, share, percentage, <b><i><u>kickback</u></i></b> or any form of pecuniary benefit, <b><i>by himself and/or in connivance with co-accused Charlie “Atong” Ang, Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, Yolanda T.

On the contrary, Estrada’s decision not to seek a bill of particulars can only mean that he considered such allegations clear enough to allow him, with the aid of his counsel, now petitioner’s counsel, to “properly x x x plead and prepare for trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b><i>Information Considered Together With the Preliminary Investigation Resolution</i></b><br><br>The basis of petitioner’s indictment before the Sandiganbayan is a 144-page Resolution, dated 28 March 2014, of the Office of the Ombudsman (Resolution, see Annex “A”), attached to the Information and furnished to petitioner, finding probable cause to charge him for the offense of plunder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <b><i>The Resolution contains all the details petitioner sought in his motion for a bill of particulars and which the ponencia grants</i></b> (see comparative table in Annex “B”). Thus, the “combination” or “series” of acts committed by petitioner and his co-accused constituting the offense of plunder, the form of kickbacks received by petitioner, the breakdown of the total amount of kickbacks petitioner received, the names of persons who gave and received the kickbacks, the names of the projects funded by petitioner’s pork barrel funds, their description, beneficiaries, costs, implementing agencies and partner organizations controlled by petitioner’s co-accused Janet Napoles, and the names of the government agencies to which such projects were endorsed <b><i>are all found and discussed in the Resolution</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Petitioner also had access to the documents supporting the Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Resolution, already in petitioner’s possession, taken together with the allegations in the Information, provide petitioner with the details and information he needs to “enable him properly to plead and prepare for trial.” As an inseparable complement to the Information, the Resolution must be read together with the allegations in the Information to determine whether the allegations in the Information are vague. It is only when the allegations in the Information, taken together with the Resolution, leave ambiguities in the basic facts constituting the elements of the offense of plunder that a bill of particulars should issue.</i></b> If, as here, the allegations in the Information, taken together with the Resolution, clearly make out the ultimate facts constituting the elements of plunder, a bill of particulars is not only unnecessary but also improper.<br><br>It will not do for petitioner to feign ignorance of the fact that the Resolution contains the details he seeks from the prosecution in his motion for a bill of particulars. The Resolution is based on the affidavits of witnesses and other public documents <i>which petitioner thoroughly parsed and attacked in his Omnibus Motion, dated 10 June 2014, filed before the Sandiganbayan, to dismiss the case against him</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For the same reason, petitioner’s demonstrated familiarity with the details relating to the allegations in the Information filed against him overcomes the presumption that he has no “independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of which he is charged.<br><br>Considering the ultimate facts alleged in the Information together with the relevant facts alleged in the Resolution indisputably involves a procedural matter, which does not encompass any constitutional right of an accused. It is an act which every accused expectedly undertakes in order to inform himself of the charges against him and intelligently prepare his defense. In short, it deals precisely with how the accused should defend himself.<br><br>Since reading the Information together with the Resolution concerns a procedural rule, and in fact is actually practiced at all times by every accused, there is no basis to require such practice to be conducted prospectively, that is, only after the promulgation of the decision in the case at bar, absent any clear showing of impairment of substantive rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Generally, rules of procedure can be given retroactive effect. “It is axiomatic that the retroactive application of procedural laws does not violate any right of a person who may feel that he is adversely affected, nor is it constitutionally objectionable. The reason for this is that, as a general rule, no vested right may attach to, nor arise from, procedural laws.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Further, requiring the accused to consider the allegations in the Information together with the allegations in the Resolution does not in any way prejudice any constitutional or substantive rights of the accused. On the contrary, such act benefits immensely the accused insofar as it adequately apprises him of the charges against him and clarifies the allegations in the Information.<br><br><center><b><i>Jurisprudence Cited by the Ponencia Inapplicable</i></b><br></center><br>The cases invoked by the <i>ponencia</i> as precedents for granting a bill of particulars to petitioner – <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> <i>Tantuico v. Republic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and <i>Virata v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> among others – are not in point because none of them involved an accused who, like petitioner, underwent preliminary investigation where he was afforded access to documents supporting the charge against him. All those cases involved <i>civil proceedings</i> for the forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth where the respondents had no way of knowing the details of the government’s case against them until after they were served a copy of the forfeiture complaints. The ambiguities in the allegations of the complaints filed against the respondents in those cases cannot be clarified by reference to other documents akin to a preliminary investigation resolution. They were left with no other recourse but to seek clarification through a bill of particulars in order to adequately prepare their responsive pleadings.<br><br><center><b><i>Plunder Charge Not Unique</i></b><br></center><br>According to the <i>ponencia</i>, “conviction for plunder carries with it the penalty of capital punishment, for this reason, more process is due, not less.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The <i>ponencia</i> seeks to impress that those accused of the crime of plunder must be extended special treatment, requiring evidentiary matters to be alleged in the Information, in view of the penalty involved, which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is not imposable exclusively to those accused and found guilty of plunder. This punishment likewise attaches to the crimes of murder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> serious illegal detention,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> among others. Meanwhile, syndicated estafa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> qualified trafficking in persons,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> possession of prohibited drugs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and illegal recruitment in large scale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> carry with it the penalty of life imprisonment, which is a <b>penalty harsher than <i>reclusion perpetua</i></b>.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> gravely implies that a plunder charge uniquely places an accused in a more protective mantle, by requiring the prosecution to allege in the Information very specific details of evidentiary nature, due to the stiff penalty involved. In contrast, the Informations for other crimes, which do not even involve pilfering of public funds but likewise carry the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or even, life imprisonment, are merely required to contain allegations of ultimate facts.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> exaggerates the crime of plunder by implying that it is a very complex crime involving “intricate predicate criminal acts and numerous transactions and schemes that span a period of time.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The <i>ponencia</i> unreasonably classifies plunder as a crime more complicated to commit than other crimes similarly punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or with the more severe penalty of life imprisonment. As a consequence, the <i>ponencia</i> unjustifiably treats those accused of plunder extraordinarily. There is plainly no basis for such special treatment.<br><br>Suffice it to state, plunder is no more complex than murder or syndicated estafa, or any other crime. For instance, there is plunder if the accused public officer acquired ill-gotten wealth by committing two acts of malversation of public funds with a total amount of at least P50,000,000. Murder, on the other hand, involves killing another person attended by any of the qualifying circumstances in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Meanwhile, syndicated estafa is committed by five or more persons formed with the intention of defrauding members of associations and misappropriating the latter's money. Simply put, the rule requiring merely the ultimate facts to be alleged in the Information applies equally to all types of crimes or offenses, regardless of the nature thereof. Otherwise, to accord those accused with plunder an exceptional treatment, by requiring the prosecution to allege in the Information all the unnecessary finer details in the commission of plunder, denies those charged with similarly serious or more serious crimes the equal protection of the law.<br><br><center><b><i>Pernicious Consequences in Granting the Petition</i></b><br></center><br>The <i>ponencia</i>’s disposition of this case to (1) set aside the ruling of the Sandiganbayan as having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion even though the Sandiganbayan merely followed existing law in the proper exercise of its discretion; (2) order the prosecution to provide petitioner with most of the details listed in his motion for a bill of particulars even though petitioner had access to and possess such details; and (3) direct the prosecution to amend the Information filed against petitioner in light of its finding that the allegations in the Information are vague even though they are clear, throws in disarray the orderly application of remedial rules in criminal proceedings. The <i>ponencia</i> turns on its head the purpose of remedial rules of “securing a just x x x disposition of every action x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>More alarmingly, the ruling unwittingly opens the door for persons presently facing prosecution to seek re-arraignment and new trial. By mutating the nature of an Information to require allegation not only of the ultimate facts constituting the elements of the offense charged but also <b><i>all the details substantiating them</i></b>, ostensibly to satisfy the procedural due process right of the accused, the <i>ponencia</i> not only repeals Rules of Court provisions on the nature and content of an Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> but also vastly expands the breadth of the procedural due process right of the accused to a degree unheard of since the advent of criminal procedure in this jurisdiction. As a new doctrine favoring the accused, the ruling hands to any person facing criminal prosecution today a new doctrinal basis to demand re-arraignment and re-trial on the ground of denial of due process. The Informations filed against these persons alleged only the ultimate facts, devoid of supporting details, following the Rules of Court and relevant jurisprudence.<br><br>The Court foresaw and prevented a similar scenario from unfolding in the recent case of <i>Estrada v. Ombudsman</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> where the petitioner, also a public official undergoing prosecution for plunder, sought to redefine the nature of preliminary investigation to make it comparable to administrative proceedings. We rejected such theory, cognizant of the nightmarish chaos it would unleash on the country’s criminal justice system:<br><blockquote>[T]o x x x declare that the guidelines in <i>Ang Tibay</i>, as amplified in <i>GSIS</i>, are fundamental and essential requirements in preliminary investigations <i>will render all past and present preliminary investigations invalid for violation of constitutional due process.

THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b><br><br>On March 22, 2013, agents of the NBI, acting on a complaint from the parents of Benhur Luy (Luy) that Luy had been illegally detained, swooped down on the South Wing Gardens of the Pacific Plaza Tower in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City and rescued Luy. A criminal case for Serious Illegal Detention was soon after filed against Reynald Lim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and his sister, Janet Lim Napoles<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Napoles), before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City where it remains pending.<br><br>Before the NBI, Luy claimed that he was detained in connection with the discharge of his responsibilities as the “lead employee” of the JANET LIM NAPOLES Corporation (JLN) which, by his account, had been involved in overseeing anomalous implementation of several government-funded projects sourced from, among others, the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of several congressmen and senators of the Republic. The NBI thus focused on what appeared to be misuse and irregularities attending the utilization and implementation of the PDAF of certain lawmakers, in connivance with other government employees, private individuals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which had been set up by JLN employees, upon the instructions of Napoles.<br><br>In the course of the NBI investigation which included conduct of interviews and taking of sworn statements of <u>Luy</u> along with several other JLN employees including Marina <u>Sula</u> (Sula) and Merlina <u>Suñas</u> (Suñas)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (the whistleblowers), the NBI uncovered the “scheme” employed in what has now been commonly referred to as the PDAF or Pork Barrel Scam, outlined in general as follows:<br><ol><li>Either the lawmaker or Napoles would commence negotiations on the utilization of the lawmaker's PDAF;<br><br></li><li>The lawmaker and Napoles then discuss, and later approve, the list of projects chosen by the lawmaker, the corresponding Implementing Agency (IA), namely the National Agribusiness Corporation (NABCOR), the National Livelihood Development Corporation (NLDC), and the Technology Resource Center (TRC [formerly Technology and Livelihood Resource Center]), through which the projects would be coursed, and the project cost, as well as the lawmaker's "commission" which would range between 40%-60% of either the project cost or the amount stated in the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO);<br><br></li><li>After the negotiations and upon instructions from Napoles, Luy prepares the so-called “listing” which contains the list of projects allocated by the lawmaker to Napoles and her NGOs, the name of the IA, and the project cost; <br><br></li><li>The lawmaker would then adopt the “listing” and write to the Senate President and the Finance Committee Chairperson, in the case of a Senator, and to the House Speaker and Chair of the Appropriations Committee, in the case of a Congressman, requesting Budget and Management (DBM);<br><br></li><li>The DBM soon issues a SARO addressed to the chosen IA indicating the amount deducted from the lawmaker’s PDAF allocation, and later issues a Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) to the IA which would thereafter issue a check to the Napoles-controlled NGO listed in the lawmaker’s endorsement;<br><br></li><li>Napoles, who recommends to the lawmaker the NGO which would implement the project, directs her employee to prepare a letter for the lawmaker’s signature endorsing the selected NGO to the IA. The IA later prepares a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) covering the project to be executed by the lawmaker or his/her authorized staff member, the IA and the chosen NGO;<br><br></li><li>The Head of the IA, in exchange for a 10% share in the project cost, subsequently releases the check/s to the Napoles-controlled NGO from whose bank accounts Napoles withdraws the proceeds thereof;<br><br></li><li>Succeeding tranche payments are released by the IA upon compliance and submission by the NGO of the required documents.<br></li></ol>From 2004 to 2010, Senator Enrile, then and presently a senator of the Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> continuously indorsed the implementation of his PDAF-funded livelihood and agricultural production projects in different parts of the country to NGOs associated with, or controlled by, private respondent Napoles.<br><br>From 2007 to 2009, a total of Php345,000,000.00 covered by nine (9) SAROs was taken from his PDAF, to wit: <br><blockquote>1.

It appears that the documents submitted by the NGOs/project partners to the IAs such as Disbursement, Progress, Accomplishment, Fund Utilization, Inspection, and Delivery Reports, as well as Certificates of Acceptance, were all fabricated.<br><br>The livelihood and agricultural production kits/packages <u>never reached the intended beneficiaries</u>, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, either <u>there were no projects or goods were never delivered</u>. The mayors and the municipal agriculturists, who had reportedly received the livelihood assistance kits/packages for their respective municipalities, never received anything from the Office of Senator Enrile, the IA, or any of the project partners. <u>None of the mayors or municipal agriculturists were even aware of the projects.</u><br><br>As reflected above, <u>the signatures on the Certificates of Acceptance or Delivery Reports</u> were forged, and the farmer-recipients enumerated on the lists of purported beneficiaries denied having received any livelihood assistance kits/packages. In fact, many of the names appearing on the lists as farmer-recipients were neither residents nor registered voters of the place where they were listed as beneficiaries, were fictitious, or had jumbled surnames while others were already deceased. In other words, these livelihood projects were “<u>ghost projects</u>.”<br><br>The Commission on Audit (COA), through its Special Audits Office, conducted an audit of the PDAF allocations and disbursements covering the period 2007-2009 subject of these complaints, its findings of which are found in the COA Special Audits Office Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> (the “2007-2009 COA Report”).<br><br>Among the observations of the COA were: (a) the implementing agencies, including NABCOR, NLDC and TRC, did not actually implement the PDAF-funded projects; instead, the agencies released the funds to the NGOs, albeit charging a "management fee" therefor; (b) the direct releases of PDAF disbursements to NGOs contravened the DBM's regulations considering that the same were not preceded by endorsements from the executive departments exercising supervisory powers over the IAs; (c) worse, <b><i><u>the releases were made essentially at the behest of the sponsoring legislator</u></i></b>; (d) almost all of the NGOs that received PDAF releases did not have a track record on the implementation of government projects, and their addresses were dubious; (e) the selection of the NGOs, as well as the procurement of the goods for distribution to the beneficiaries, did not undergo public bidding; and (f) some of the suppliers who allegedly provided the goods to the NGOs denied ever having dealt with these NGOs, contrary to the NGOs’ claims.<br><br>The COA also found that the selections of the NGO were not compliant with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2007-001 and GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007; the suppliers and reported beneficiaries were unknown or cannot be located at their given address; the NGOs had provided non-existent addresses or their addresses were traced to mere shanties or high-end residential units without any signage; and the NGOs submitted questionable documents, or failed to liquidate or fully document the ultilization of funds.<br><br>Verily, <u>the findings in the 2007-2009 COA Report jibe with the whistle blowers testimonies and are validated by the results of the FIO’s on-site field verification</u>.<br><br>IN FINE, the PDAF-funded projects of Senator Enrile were “ghost” or inexistent.<br><br>Complainants contend that the amount of Php345,000,000.00 allotted for livelihood and agricultural production projects was instead <i>misappropriated</i> and <i>converted</i> to the personal use and benefit of Senator Enrile in conspiracy with Napoles and the rest of respondents.<br><br>Witnesses Luy, Sula, and Suñas claim that the six foundation-NGOs endorsed by Senator Enrile were all <i>dummies</i> of Napoles, who operated them from her JLN office at Unit 2502, Discovery Center Suites, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, and were created for the purpose of funnelling the PDAF through NABCOR, NLDC, and TRC/TLRC; the majority of the incorporators, officers, and members of these NGOs are household helpers, relatives, employees and friends of Napoles; some incorporators/corporators of the NGOs were aware of their involvement in the creation thereof while others were not; and the signatures in the Articles of Incorporation of the NGOs of those unaware of their involvement were forged.<br><br>Luy, Sula and Suñas add that the pre-selected President of each of the pre-selected NGOs, in addition to being required to furnish the names of at least 5 persons to complete the list of incorporators, were obliged to sign an application for opening bank accounts in the name of the NGO, and to <u>pre-sign blank withdrawal slips</u>; these NGOs maintained bank accounts with either METROBANK Magdalena Branch or LANDBANK EDSA-Greenhills Branch, from which Napoles would withdraw and/or cause the withdrawal of the proceeds of checks paid by the IAs to the NGOs involved.<br><br>Per Luy’s records, Senator Enrile received, through respondents Reyes and Tuason, total commissions, rebates, or kickbacks amounting to <u>at least Php172,834,500.00</u> from his PDAF-funded projects from 2004 to 2010: Php1,500,000.00 for 2004; Php14,622,000.00 for 2005; Php13,300,000.00 for 2006; Php27,112,500.00 for 2007; Php62,550,000.00 for 2008; Php23,750,000.00 for 2009; and Php30,000,000.00 for 2010. The “payoffs” usually took place at the JLN office in Ortigas. In fact, Luy, Sula and Suñas often heard Napoles refer to Senator Enrile by his code name “<i>Tanda</i>” and <u>saw Napoles hand over the money meant for the Senator to Tuason</u> at the premises of JLN. The cash would come either from Luy’s vault or from Napoles herself.<br><br>On the other hand, Napoles’ share of the money from Senator Enrile’s PDAF was by the claim of witnesses Luy, Sula, Suñas, delivered in cash by them, along with respondents Encarnacion and De Asis, either at the JLN office or at Napoles’ residence at 18B, 18th Floor, North Wing Pacific Plaza Tower Condominium, Taguig City. In the event of space constraints at her residence, Napoles would deposit some of the cash to the bank accounts of the following companies which she owned:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="center"><strong>Registered Owner of the Account</strong></div></td><td width="30%"><div align="center"><strong>Bank</strong></div></td><td width="30%"><div align="center"><strong>Account Number</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JO-CHRIS Trading</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td><div align="center">7255-50955-8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JO-CHRIS Trading</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td><div align="center">007-026-51152-2<br>(Checking Account)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JO-CHRIS Trading</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td><div align="center">3600024885</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JLN Corporation</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td><div align="center">073-3-07352390-8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JLN Corporation</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td> <div align="center">007-073-50928-5<br>(Checking Account) </div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">JCLN Global Properties Development Corporation</div></td><td><div align="center">Metrobank</div></td><td><div align="center">007-035-52543-9</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><b>II.

It was for this reason that this Office ordered said public respondents to submit their counter-affidavits so that they may shed light on their supposed involvement in the so-called PDAF scam. After all, preliminary investigation is merely inquisitorial, and it is often the only means of discovering whether a person may be reasonably charged with a crime, and to enable the prosecutor to prepare his complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br>Notably, respondents Relampagos, Bare, Nuñez and Paule did not categorically deny witness Luy’s claims of follow-ups made with the DBM.

(<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Based on the above provision, the complainant or initiating party is duty-bound only to disclose the existence of an earlier action or claim <u>filed by him or her</u>, and which involves the same issues. He or she is not required to disclose the existence of pending suits or complaints previously <u>filed by another party</u>.<br><br>In this case, the FIO had no obligation to disclose the existence of OMB-C-C-13-0318 for the simple reason that it was not the initiating party of this complaint. Rather, as Sevidal himself admits, the NBI, and not the FIO, is the complainant in OMB-C-C-13-0318. The FIO is not even a party to OMB-C-C-13-0318. Thus, this Office fails to see why the FIO should be faulted for not mentioning the existence of this particular complaint.<br><br><b><i>The filing of the complaints was not premature</i></b><br><br>Sevidal and Ordoñez proceed to argue that the filing of the criminal charges against them and their co-respondents is premature because the COA had yet to issue notices of disallowances (NDs) on disbursements drawn from the PDAF.<br><br>The above contention, however, has been rendered moot by the well-publicized fact that the COA had already issued several NDs covering disbursements relating to PDAF-funded projects of respondent Enrile, among other persons, from the period 2007 to 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>They, however, insist that the filing of the complaint remains premature even if the COA did issue NDs. According to them, the NDs are still appealable under the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure (the 2009 COA Rules) and no administrative or criminal complaint arising from the NDs may be instituted until and unless the issuances have become final and executory. In other words, Sevidal and Ordoñez assume that the NDs, at the very least, give rise to a prejudicial question warranting the suspension of the instant preliminary investigation.<br><br>This argument cannot be sustained.<br><br>Under Rule 111, Section 7 of the Rules of Court, a prejudicial question exists when the following elements are present:<br><blockquote>The elements of a prejudicial question are: (a) the <u>previously instituted civil action</u> involves an <u>issue similar or intimately related to the issue raised in the subsequent criminal action</u> and (b) the resolution of such issue <u>determines whether or not the criminal action may proceed</u>. (<i>underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>As reflected in the above elements, the concept of a prejudicial question involves both a <b><i>civil</i></b> and a <b><i>criminal</i></b> case. There can be no prejudicial question to speak of if, technically, <u>no civil case is pending</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>Proceedings under the 2009 COA Rules, including those pertaining to the NDs, are <i><u>administrative</u></i> in nature. Consequently, any appeal or review sought by any of herein respondents with the COA in relation to the NDs will not give rise to a prejudicial question.<br><br>Significantly, <i>Reyna and Soria v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> teaches that an administrative proceeding pertaining to a COA disallowance is <i>distinct</i> and <i>separate</i> from a preliminary investigation in a criminal case which may have arisen from the same set of facts. Both proceedings may proceed independently of each another. Thus, <i>Reyna and Soria</i> declares:<br><blockquote>On a final note, it bears to point out that a cursory reading of the Ombudsman's resolution will show that the complaint against petitioners was dismissed not because of a finding of good faith but because of a finding of lack of sufficient evidence. While the evidence presented before the Ombudsman may not have been sufficient to overcome the burden in criminal cases of proof beyond reasonable doubt, it does not, however, necessarily follow, that the administrative proceedings will suffer the same fate as only substantial evidence is required, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<br><br><u>An absolution from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative prosecution or vice versa. <b><i>The criminal case filed before the Office of the Ombudsman is distinct and separate from the proceedings on the disallowance before the COA.</i></b></u> So also, the dismissal by Margarito P. Gervacio, Jr., Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao, of the criminal charges against petitioners does not necessarily foreclose the matter of their possible liability as warranted by the findings of the COA. (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Moreover, nothing in existing laws or rules expressly state that a disallowance by the COA is a pre-requisite for the filing of a criminal complaint for Plunder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Malversation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> or violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. In fact, an audit disallowance is not even an element of any of these offenses.<br><br>Sevidal and Ordoñez’s reference to Rule XIII, Section 6 of the 2009 COA Rules also fails to impress. This provision reads: <br><blockquote><i>Referral to the Ombudsman</i>. - The Auditor shall report to his Director all instances of failure or refusal to comply with the decisions or orders of the Commission contemplated in the preceding sections. The COA Director shall see to it that the report is supported by the sworn statement of the Auditor concerned, identifying among others, the persons liable and describing the participation of each. He shall then <b><i><u>refer the matter to the Legal Service Sector who shall refer the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman or other appropriate office for the possible filing of appropriate administrative or criminal action</u></i></b>. (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Evidently, this immediately-quoted COA Rule pertains to the <i><u>possible</u></i> filing of administrative or criminal action in relation to audit disallowance. Note that the tenor of the provision is permissive, not mandatory. As such, an audit disallowance may not necessarily result in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions or criminal prosecution of the responsible persons. Conversely, therefore, an administrative or criminal case may prosper even without an audit disallowance. Verily, Rule XIII, Section 6 is consistent with the ruling in <i>Reyna and Soria</i> that a proceeding involving an audit disallowance is distinct and separate from a preliminary investigation or a disciplinary complaint.<br><br>AT ALL EVENTS, Rule XIII, Section 6 pertains to the <u>COA’s</u> filing of administrative and/or criminal cases against the concerned parties. It has no bearing on any legal action taken by other agencies not subject of the 2009 COA Rules, such as the NBI or the FIO.<br><br><b><u>SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES</u></b><br><br><b><i>The diversion or misuse of the PDAF was coursed through a complex scheme involving participants from the legislator’s office, the DBM, IAs and NGOs controlled by respondent Janet Napoles.</i></b><br><br>Based on the testimonial and documentary evidence presented, the widespread misuse of the subject PDAF allotted to a legislator was coursed through a complex scheme basically involving projects supposed to have been funded by said PDAF which turned out to be inexistent or “ghost” projects. The funds intended for the implementation of the PDAF-funded project are, with the imprimatur of the legislator, the IAs and NGOs, diverted to the possession and control of Napoles and her cohorts.<br><br><i><u>The Modus Operandi</u></i><br><br>Basically, the scheme commences when Napoles first meets with a legislator and offers to “acquire” his or her PDAF allocation in exchange for a “commission” or kickback amounting to a certain percentage of the PDAF. <br><br>Once an agreement is reached, Napoles would then advance to the legislator a down payment representing a portion of his or her kickback. The legislator would then request the Senate President or the House Speaker as the case may be for the immediate release of his or her PDAF. The Senate President or Speaker would then indorse the request to the DBM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> This initial letter-request to the DBM contains a program or list of IAs and the amount of PDAF to be released in order to guide the DBM in its preparation and release of the corresponding SARO. <br><br>The kickbacks, around 50% of the PDAF amount involved, are received by legislators personally or through their representatives, in the form of cash, fund transfer, manager’s check or personal check issued by Napoles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> <br><br>After the DBM issues the SARO representing the legislator’s PDAF allocation, the legislator would forward a copy of said issuance to Napoles. She, in turn, would remit the remaining portion of the kickback due the legislator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> <br><br>The legislator would then write another letter addressed to the IAs which would identify his or her preferred NGO to undertake the PDAF-funded project. However, the NGO chosen by the legislator would be one of those organized and controlled by Napoles. These NGOs were, in fact, specifically set up by Napoles for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>Upon receipt of the SARO, Napoles would direct her staff, at the time material to the cases, including witnesses Luy, Sula and Suñas, to prepare the PDAF documents for the approval of the legislator. These documents reflect, among other things, the preferred NGO to implement the undertaking, the project proposals by the identified NGO/s, and indorsement letters to be signed by the legislator and/or his staff.

After the SARO and/or NCA is released, Janet Napoles would give me the full payment for delivery to Senator Enrile through Atty. Gigi Reyes.<br><br>15. Sometimes Janet Napoles would have the money for Senator Enrile delivered to my house by her employees. At other times, I would get it from her condominium in Pacific Plaza or from Benhur Luy in Discovery Suites. When Benhur Luy gives me the money, he would make me scribble on some of their vouchers of even sign under the name “Andrea Reyes,” Napoles’ codename for me. This is the money that I would deliver to Senator Enrile through Atty. Gigi Reyes.<br><br>16. I don’t count the money I receive for delivery to Senator Enrile. I just receive whatever was given to me. The money was all wrapped and ready for delivery when I get it from Janet Napoles or Benhur Luy.

Senator Enrile later indorsed NGOs affiliated with/controlled by Napoles to implement his PDAF-funded projects. Respondents Jo Napoles, James Napoles, De Leon, Piorato, Lim, Ramirez, Cabilao, Ogerio, Fabian, Ditchon, Galay, Uy, Fernando, De Asis, Encarnacion, Palama, Ornopia, Castillo and Macha were all working for Napoles and served as officers of her NGOs which were selected and endorsed by Senator Enrile to implement his projects. They executed MOAs relative to these undertakings in behalf of the organizations and acknowledged receipt of the checks issued by NLDC, NABCOR and TRC representing the PDAF releases.<br><br><i><u>Second</u></i>, Senator Enrile and respondent-public officers of the IAs were manifestly partial to Napoles, her staff and the affiliated NGOs she controlled.<br><br><i>Sison v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> teaches that:<br><blockquote>“Partiality” is synonymous with “bias,” which “excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are.”<br></blockquote>To be actionable under Section 3 (e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, partiality must be manifest. There must be a clear, notorious and plain inclination or predilection to favor one side rather than the other. Simply put, the public officer or employee’s predisposition towards a particular person should be intentional and evident.<br><br>That Napoles and the NGOs affiliated with/controlled by her were extended undue favor is manifest.<br><br>Senator Enrile <i>repeatedly</i> and <i>directly</i> indorsed the NGOs headed or controlled by Napoles and her cohorts to implement his projects <u>without the benefit of a public bidding</u>.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the FIO, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 states that <u>an NGO may be contracted only when so authorized by an appropriation law or ordinance</u>:<br><blockquote>53.11. <i>NGO Participation</i>. When an appropriation law or ordinance earmarks an amount to be specifically contracted out to Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), the procuring entity may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement in the NGO, subject to guidelines to be issued by the GPPB.<br></blockquote>National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 476,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> as amended by NBC No. 479, provides that PDAF allocations should be directly released only to those government agencies identified in the project menu of the pertinent General Appropriations Act (GAAs). The GAAs in effect at the time material to the charges, however, <u>did not authorize the direct release of funds to NGOs</u>, let alone the direct contracting of NGOs to implement government projects. This, however, did not appear to have impeded Senator Enrile’s direct selection of the Napoles-affiliated or controlled NGOs, and which choice was accepted <i>in toto</i> by the IAs.<br><br>Even assuming arguendo that the GAAs allowed the engagement of NGOs to implement PDAF-funded projects, such engagements remain <u>subject to <b><i>public bidding</i></b> requirements</u>. Consider GPPB Resolution No. 012-2007:<br><blockquote>4.1 When an appropriation law or ordinance specifically earmarks an amount for projects to be specifically contracted out to NGOs, <b><i>the procuring entity may select an NGO through <u>competitive bidding or negotiated procurement</u> under Section 53.11 of the IRR</i></b>. (emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The aforementioned laws and rules, however, were disregarded by public respondents, Senator Enrile having just chosen the Napoles-founded NGOs. Such blatant disregard of public bidding requirements is highly suspect, especially in light of the ruling in <i>Alvarez v. People</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><blockquote>The essence of competition in public bidding is that the bidders are placed on equal footing. In the award of government contracts, the law requires a competitive public bidding.

Napoles or Luy would then prepare a listing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> of the projects available where Luy would specifically indicate the implementing agencies.

The collective acts of Senator Enrile, Napoles, et al. allowed the illegal diversion of public funds to their own personal use.<br><br>It cannot be gainsaid that the sums of money received by Senator Enrile amount to “kickbacks” or “commissions” from a government project within the purview of Sec. 1 (d) (2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> of RA 7080.

Jessica Lucila G. Reyes’ on one hand, and the standard signatures of Atty. Jessica Lucila G. Reyes on the other hand</i>;” and in his opinion, the signatures allegedly belonging to Reyes and appearing in the PDAF documents are forgeries.<br><br>Respondents Reyes and Evangelista's claim fails to convince.<br><br>Forgery is not presumed; it must be proved by clear, positive and convincing evidence and the burden of proof lies on the party alleging forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing that Senator Enrile, in his <u>Letter dated 21 March 2012</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> <u>confirmed</u> to the COA that: (a) he authorized respondents Reyes and Evangelista to sign letters, MOAs and other PDAF documents in his behalf; and (b) the signatures appearing in the PDAF documents as belonging to respondents Reyes and Evangelista are authentic. The pertinent portion of the Senator’s letter reads:<br><blockquote><b><i><u>I confirm that Atty. Jessica L. G. Reyes, Chief of Staff, Office of the Senate President, and Mr. Jose A. V.

That the Senator readily authenticated Reyes and Evangelista’s signatures is not difficult to understand, the two having been members of his confidential staff for many years.<br><br>Nonetheless, Reyes and Evangelista strongly deny having signed the PDAF documents and insist that they did not participate in the preparation or execution thereof. Mere denial is insufficient, however, to disprove the authenticity of their signatures appearing in the PDAF documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> This holds true especially in Evangelista’s case. The MOAs bearing his questioned signatures are <i>notarized</i> documents that enjoy the presumption of regularity and can be overturned only by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup><br><br>Besides, respondent Evangelista, in his <u>Letter dated 2 August 2012</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> to the COA, <i>admitted</i> the authenticity of his signatures appearing in the PDAF documents, save for those found in documents relating to PDAF disbursements of another legislator. His letter reads, in part:<br><blockquote>As confirmed in the letter of the Senate President dated 21 March 2012, <b><i><u>Atty. Jessica L. G.

As <i>Rivera v. Turiano</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> teaches:<br><blockquote>This Court has held that an allegation of forgery and a perfunctory comparison of the signatures by themselves cannot support the claim of forgery, as forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved by clear, positive and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof lies in the party alleging forgery. <u><b><i>Even in cases where the alleged forged signature was compared to samples of genuine signatures to show its variance therefrom, this Court still found such evidence insufficient.</i></b></u> It must be stressed that the <b><i><u>mere variance of the signatures cannot be considered as conclusive proof that the same were forged</u></i></b>. (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Moreover, the observations of affiant Azores in his Affidavit and <u>Examination Report dated 10 October 2013</u> do not meet the criteria for identification of forgery as enunciated in <i>Ladignon v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup><br><blockquote>The process of identification, therefore, must include the determination of the extent, kind, and significance of this resemblance as well as of the variation. It then becomes <u>necessary to determine whether the variation is due to the operation of a different personality, or is only the expected and inevitable variation found in the genuine writing of the same writer. It is also necessary to decide whether the resemblance is the result of a more or less skillful imitation, or is the habitual and characteristic resemblance</u> which naturally appears in a genuine writing. When these two questions are correctly answered the whole problem of identification is solved. (underlining supplied)<br></blockquote>In his Affidavit and Examination Report, affiant Azores simply concluded that the signatures in the PDAF documents and Reyes’ sample signatures “<i>were not written by one and the same person</i>.”<br><br>AT ALL EVENTS, this Office, after a <i>prima facie</i> comparison with the naked eyes of the members of the Panel of Investigators between the signatures appearing in the PDAF documents that are attributed to respondents Senator Enrile, Reyes and Evangelista and their signatures found in their respective counter-affidavits, opines that both sets of signatures appear to have been affixed by one and the same respective hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> In the absence of clear and convincing evidence, this Office thus finds that the questioned signatures on the relevant documents belong to respondents Enrile, Reyes and Evangelista.<br><br><b><i>The Arias doctrine is not applicable to these proceedings.</i></b><br><br>Javellana argues that he cannot be held accountable for approving the PDAF releases pertaining to those projects assigned to NABCOR because he only issued such approval after his subordinates, namely, respondents Mendoza, Cacal, Relevo and other NABCOR officials involved in the processing and/or implementation of PDAF-funded projects, examined the supporting documents, assured him of the availability of funds and recommended the approval of the disbursements.<br><br>Similarly, Cunanan claims that he approved the PDAF releases relating to projects assigned to TRC only after his subordinates at the agency recommended such approval.<br><br>Simply put, Javellana and Cunanan invoke the ruling in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> Reliance thereon is misplaced.<br><br><i>Arias</i> squarely applies in cases where, in the performance of his official duties, the head of an office is being held to answer for his act of relying on the acts of his subordinate:<br><blockquote>We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of office plagued by all too common problems - dishonest or negligent subordinates, overwork, multiple assignments or positions, or plain incompetence - is suddenly swept into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not personally examine every single detail, painstakingly trace every step from inception, and investigate the motives of every person involved in a transaction before affixing his signature as the final approving authority.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed records, inspected documents, received procedures, and questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office could personally do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the impossible. <b><i><u>All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations.</u></i></b> x x x There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail. Any executive head of even small government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.<br><br><b><i><u>There should be other grounds than the mere signature or approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction.</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>The above pronouncement readily shows that the <i>Arias</i> doctrine does not help the cause of Javellana and Cunanan.<br><br><i><u>First</u></i>, the <i>Arias</i> doctrine applies only if it is undisputed that the head of the agency was the <u>last person to sign</u> the vouchers, which would show that he was merely relying on the prior certifications and recommendations of his subordinates. It will not apply if there is evidence showing that the head of agency, before a recommendation or certification can be made by a superior, performs any act that would signify his approval of the transaction. In other words, the <i>Arias</i> doctrine is inapplicable in cases where <u>it is the head of agency himself or herself</u> who influences, pressures, coerces or otherwise convinces the subordinate to sign the voucher or recommend the approval of the transaction.<br><br>In Javellana’s case, Cacal stated in his Counter-Affidavit that he signed the disbursement vouchers pertaining to PDAF disbursements because Javellana directed him to do so. In support of his claim, Cacal submitted a document entitled “Authorization” issued and signed by respondent Javellana which states:<br><blockquote>In order <u>to facilitate processing of payments</u> and in the exigency of the service, MR. VICTOR ROMAN CACAL, Paralegal, this Office is hereby authorized to sign BOX A of the Disbursement Vouchers of all transactions related to PDAF Project.<br><br>This authorization takes effect starting August 20, 2008. (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Cacal, in his Supplemental Affidavit, also claimed that Javellana, among others, already signed the checks and other documents <u>even before he (Cacal) could sign Box “A” of the disbursement vouchers</u>:<br><blockquote>15. In most instances, Boxes “B” and “C” were already signed wherein the herein Respondent was required to sing (sic) Box “A” of the Disbursement Vouchers. <b><i><u>Most of the times the Box “B” and/or Box “C” of the Disbursement Vouchers were already signed ahead by</u></i></b> Niñez Guanizo and/or Rhodora B. Mendoza and <b><i><u>ALAN A. JAVELLANA</u></i></b> respectively.<br><br>16. In other instances, <b><i><u>the checks for PDAF releases were already prepared and signed by NABCOR President ALAN A.

MENDOZA <b><i><u>attached to the Disbursement Voucher before the herein Respondent were made signs Box “A” of the said Disbursement Vouchers</u></i></b>. This indicative of the target5 (sic) Municipalities and immediately stern instructions of herein Respondent’s superiors to sign the Disbursement Voucher immediately for reasons that it is being followed up by the concerned NGO. Furthermore, the herein Respondent relied on the duly executed Memorandum of Agreement by and between NABCOR, NGO and the Office of the Legislator. According to the said MOA, initial release of funds will be undertaken by NABCOR upon signing thereof. Hence, payment and/or release of fund to the NGO became a lawful obligation of NABCOR.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>18. On many instances, <b><i><u>sternly ordered [sic] the NABCOR VP for Admin. and Finance RHODORA B. MENDOZA to herein Respondent to immediately sign Box “A” of the Disbursement Voucher even if the NGOs have not yet complied with the other documentary requirements to be attached to the said Disbursement Voucher</u></i></b> on the basis on [sic] the commitment of the NGO to submit the other required documents (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Cacal added that he was constrained to sign the disbursement vouchers due to pressure exerted by his superiors: <br><blockquote>19. In many instances <b><i><u>wherein the Respondent questioned the attachments/documents in the said vouchers</u></i></b> regarding the disbursements of the PDAF of legislators <b><i><u>the respondent was herein threatened and/or coerced by his superiors</u></i></b>. (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Since the subordinate himself vehemently disputes having recommended the approval of the fund release to his superior, this Office in not inclined to apply the <i>Arias</i> doctrine. Note that the <i>Arias</i> doctrine is only applied in cases where it is <i>undisputed</i> that the recommendation of the subordinate preceded the superior’s approval, and not in situations where it is the superior who persuades or pressures the subordinate to favorably recommend approval.<br><br><u><i>Second</i></u>, the Arias doctrine, even assuming that it is applicable, does not <i>ipso facto</i> free the heads of agencies from criminal, civil or administrative liability. The ruling merely holds that the head of agency cannot be deemed to be a co- conspirator in a criminal offense simply because he signed and/or approved a voucher or document that facilitated the release of public funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup><br><br>In the present cases, the liability of Javellana and Cunanan is not based <i>solely</i> on their approval of the vouchers and other papers relating to PDAF projects implemented by NABCOR and/or TRC, but on their own overt acts showing their undue interest in the release of PDAF funds. In short, Javellana and Cunanan’s actions indicate that they wanted the funds released as soon as possible, regardless of whether applicable laws or rules governing the disbursements had been observed or complied with. <br><br>As discussed above, Javellana’s own subordinate stated that the latter actually <u>pre-signed</u> the checks pertaining to PDAF releases even before the DVs were duly accomplished and signed.<br><br>Figura declared in his Counter-Affidavit that Cunanan constantly followed up with him (Figura) the expedited processing of PDAF documents:<br><blockquote>b) In the course of my review of PDAF documents, <b><i><u>DDG Dennis L.

He would come down to my office in the third floor and tell me that he had a dinner meeting with the First Gentleman and some legislators so much that <b><i><u>he requested me to fast track processing of the PDAF papers</u></i></b>. Though I hate name-dropping, I did not show any disrespect to him but instead told him that if the papers are in order, I would release them before the end of working hours of the same day. <b><i><u>This was done by DDG many times, but I stood my ground when the papers on PDAF he’s following up had d eficiencies</u></i></b> x x x (<i>emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Likewise, witness Luy in his <u>Sworn Statement dated 12 September 2013</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> stated that Javellana and Cunanan were among those he saw receive a percentage of the diverted PDAF sums from Napoles:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">126.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">T: May nabanggit ka na may 10% na napupunta sa president o head ng agency, sino itong tinutukoy mo? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify">S: Ang alam ko nakita kong tumanggap ay sila <u><em><strong>Allan Javellana</strong></em></u> ng NABCOR, <u><em><strong>DENNIS CUNANAN</strong></em></u> at ANTONIO Y.

(d), e.g., raids on the public treasury in Sec. 1, par. (d), subpar. (1), and fraudulent conveyance of assets belonging to the National Government under Sec. 1, par. (d), subpar. (3).<br><br>On the other hand, to constitute a "series" there must be two (2) or more overt or criminal acts falling under the same category of enumeration found in Sec. 1, par. (d), say, misappropriation, malversation and raids on the public treasury, all of which fall under Sec. 1, par. (d), subpar. (1). Verily, had the legislature intended a technical or distinctive meaning for "combination" and "series," it would have taken greater pains in specifically providing for it in the law.<br><br>As for "pattern," we agree with the observations of the Sandiganbayan 9 that this term is sufficiently defined in Sec. 4, in relation to Sec. 1, par. (d), and Sec. 2 —<br><blockquote>“. . . . under Sec. 1 (d) of the law, a 'pattern' consists of at least a combination or series of overt or criminal acts enumerated in subsections (1) to (6) of Sec. 1 (d). Secondly, pursuant to Sec. 2 of the law, the pattern of overt or criminal acts is directed towards a common purpose or goal which is to&nbsp; enable the public officer to a mass, accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth.

(1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.<br><br>(2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf. However, after arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the absence of the accused provided that he has been duly notified and his failure to appear is unjustifiable.<br></blockquote>The remedy against an insufficient Information in that it fails to allege the acts or omissions complained of as constitutingthe offense is a motion to quash on the ground that the allegations of the Information do not constitute the offense charged, or any offense for that matter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Section 3 (a), Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. Its civil case counterpart is a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>Note that when the rules speak of “the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense,” they actuallypertain to the ultimate facts that comprise the alleged crime’s component elements. In civil procedure, the term “ultimate facts” means the essential facts constituting the plaintiff’s cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> A fact is essential if it cannot be stricken out without leaving the statement of the cause of action insufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4] </sup>Ultimate facts are important and substantial facts which either directly form the basis of the primary right and duty, or which directly make up the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Ultimate facts should be distinguished from evidentiary facts. In <i>Bautista v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> a criminal case that involved a violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Court distinguished an ultimate fact from an evidentiary fact as follows:<br><blockquote>The distinction between the elements of the offense and the evidence of these elements is analogous or akin to the difference between ultimate facts and evidentiary facts in civil cases. <b>Ultimate facts are the essential and substantial facts which either form the basis of the primary right and duty or which directly make up the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendant, while evidentiary facts are those which tend to prove or establish said ultimate facts.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In order to give full meaning to the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, not only should the Information state the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense (or the ultimate facts that comprise the crime’s component elements), the rules also require certain facts to be stated in the Information to be deemed sufficient, namely, the name of the accused, the designation of the offense given by the statute, the name of the offended party, the approximate date of the commission of the offense, and the place where the offense was committed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (other requisite facts).Absent any of these essential facts, then the accused’s right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him would be violated.<br><br>While not necessary to preserve said constitutional right, for as long as there is compliance with the above-stated bare minimums, the accused is given <b><u>the procedural option</u></b> to file a motion for bill of particulars to specify the vague allegations in the Information. In <i>State v. Collett</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the office of a bill of particulars in criminal cases was described as follows:<br><blockquote>That it contemplates something <b><u>over and beyond the mere essentials of the averments necessary to state an offense</u></b> is, in our judgment, ascertainable from the statute itself, which requires that the bill set up specifically the nature of the offense charged. xxx. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 9, Rule 116 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure explicitly states the motion’s two-fold objective:<br><blockquote>Section 9.Bill of particulars. – The accused may, before arraignment, move for a bill of particulars <b>to enable him properly to plead and prepare for trial</b>. The motion shall specify the alleged defects of the complaint or information and the details desired. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Note that a motion under the foregoing rule is different from a motion for bill of particulars filed in a civil case under Rule 12 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which purpose is for a party (whether plaintiff or defendant) to properly prepare his responsive pleading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In a <b>criminal case</b>, there is no need to file a responsive pleading since the accused is, at the onset, already presumed innocent, and thus it is the prosecution which has the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The plea entered by the accused during his arraignment is not the criminal case counterpart of a responsive pleading in a civil case. Arraignment is a peculiar phase of a criminal case which formally ensures the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. Thus, before arraignment, a motion for bill of particulars is available so that the accused can properly enter his plea, and also to later prepare his defense. On the other hand, in a civil case, which operates under the evidentiary threshold of preponderance of evidence, a motion for bill of particulars is available so that the defendant can intelligently refute the allegations in the complaint in his responsive pleading.<br><br>In a <b>civil case</b>, the bill later becomes relevant because, as a general rule, the trial therein will only be based on the allegations stated in the pleadings submitted by the parties. Meanwhile, in a <b>criminal case</b>, because of the standing presumption of innocence, the delimitation of what is to be pleaded to during arraignment and proved during trial is based on the allegations in the Information and thus operates only against the prosecution. If the Information is vague (albeit sufficient), then the accused has the remedy of a motion for bill of particulars to delimit the allegations of the Information through the bill’s function of specification and, in so doing may be able to properly enter his plea and later prepare his defense.<br><br>However, in both criminal and civil cases, it is a truism that it is not the office or function of a bill of particulars to furnish evidential information, whether such information consists of evidence which the pleader proposes to introduce or of facts which constitute a defense or offset for the other party or which will enable the opposite party to establish an affirmative defense not yet pleaded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Thus, in dealing with a motion for a bill of particulars in a criminal case, judges should observe that: <b><i>(a)</i></b> the remedy is distinct from a motion to quash in the sense that it presupposes that the acts or offenses constituting the offense (or the ultimate facts that comprise the crime’s component elements) are already stated in the Information, albeit may be couched in vague language; <b><i>(b)</i></b> the remedy is, as mentioned, not meant to supply evidential information (or evidentiary facts); and <b><i>(c)</i></b> the particulars to be allowed are only those details that would allow a man of ordinary intelligence, as may be reasonable under the circumstances, to, again, properly plead during his arraignment and to prepare his defense for trial. Accordingly, the analysis involved in motion for bill of particulars should go beyond a simple ultimate facts-evidentiary facts dichotomy.<br><br>Also, it is significant to point out that in a situation where the accused has moved for a bill of particulars, but such motion is denied by the trial court, absent any restraining order from the propercourt,<b><u>the arraignment of the accused should still proceed</u></b>; otherwise, it would be fairly easy for every accused to delay the proceedings against him by the mere expedient of filing a motion for a bill of particulars. Thus, the accused, on the scheduled date of arraignment, must enter a plea, and if he refuses upon his insistence for a bill of particulars, then, in accordance with Section 1 (c),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rule 116 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial court shall enter a plea of not guilty for him.However, if the trial court’s denial of such motion is later reversed by a higher court, then the accused may manifest that he is changing his plea upon consideration of the bill of particulars submitted, which,by suppletory application of the Rules of Civil Procedure, forms part of the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It should be stressed that since a motion for bill of particulars is not an objection on the sufficiency but on the vagueness of the Information, then the Information remains valid. As there is no objection on the validity of the Information, <b><u>then the arraignment and the plea entered during the proceedings whether by the court or the accused should equally be deemed valid and therefore, not set aside</u></b>.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>Enrile is charged with Plunder specifically in relation to the anomalous scheme behind the utilization of his Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Statutorily defined, Plunder is committed bya “<b>public officer</b> who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, <b>amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth</b> through a <b>combination or series of overt criminal acts</b> as described in Section 1 (d) [of Republic Act No. 7080,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> or the Plunder Law], in the aggregate amount or total value of <b>at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00)</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It is comprised of the following elements:<br><blockquote><b><u>First</u></b>, that the offender is a <b>public officer</b>;<br><br><b><u>Second</u></b>, that he <b>amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth</b> through a <b>combination or series</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <b>of overt or criminal acts</b> described in Section 1(d); and<br><br><b><u>Third</u></b>, that the aggregate amount or total <b>value of the ill-gotten wealth is at least P50,000,000.00</b>.<br></blockquote>Plunder’s peculiar nature as a composite scheme employed by a public officer to loot the coffers of the government translates into the proposition that the accused should be able to “dissect” the parts which make up the whole. Thus, only by affording the accused a reasonable opportunity to intelligently refute <b><u>each component criminal act</u></b> would he then be able to disprove that there exists a combination or series thereof or, if so existing, the combination or series of acts did not allow him to amass or accumulate the total amount of at least P50,000,000.00.<br><br>A Plunder charge takes on a more complicated complexion when made in the context of the PDAF. In such an instance, each predicate overt act would pertain to the transaction wherein the kickback or commission has been acquiredby the accused (PDAF transaction). Due to its complexity, an Information for a Plunder PDAF charge should contain the following details so that the accused may properly plead and prepare his defense thereto: <b><u>(a)</u></b> the ghost or fictitious project which was supposedly funded by the PDAF; <b><u>(b)</u></b> the amount (or a reasonable approximate thereof) of the kickback or commission supposedly involved in the PDAF transaction; <b><u>(c)</u></b> the date or approximate date on which the PDAF transaction had transpired; <b><u>(d)</u></b> if coursed through an NGO, the name of the NGO through which the PDAF kickbacks were furtively facilitated; and <b><u>(e)</u></b> if so involving another government agency, the name of the agency to whom the PDAF was endorsed.<br><br>As an alternative, the Information may also make explicit reference to the Prosecutor’s Resolution finding probable cause against the accused. However, the Prosecution must cite in the Information the specific portions of its Resolution referred to so as not to confuse the accused on what details are being alluded to when the Information is read to him in open court, to which he bases his plea during arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While it is recognized that the accused, who participates in a preliminary investigation, cannot feign ignorance of the finer details stated in the Prosecutor’s Resolution, courts cannot assume that said details are automatically integrated in the Information. This is because the Prosecutor’s Resolution is a product of a preliminary investigation proceeding meant only to determine if probable cause exists and thusly, if the Prosecution should file the corresponding Information before the court. Besides, the filing of an Informationis an executive function; thus, it is up to the Prosecution to incorporate thereto the details for which it desires to proceed its case against the accused.<br><br><center><b>III.</b><br></center><br>The Information against Enrile reads:<br><blockquote>In 2004 to 2010 or thereabout, in the Philippines, and within this Honorable Court’s jurisdiction, above-named accused JUAN PONCE ENRILE, then a Philippine Senator, JESSICA LUCILA G.

Each “overt act” pertains to each PDAF transaction which particulars are sought for in the more specific statements below.<br><blockquote>2. “<b>A breakdown of the amounts of the kickbacks and commissions allegedly received</b> stating how the amount of P172,834,500.00 was arrived at.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The amountof kickbacks and commissions isessentialto each PDAF transaction, which, in turn, forms part of the whole Plunder scheme allegedby the prosecution. In order for the accused to identify the PDAF transaction attributed to him, for which he bases his plea during arraignment, he must be informed of the amount involved in each transaction. Because a Plunder conviction necessitates that the total PDAF transactions breach the P50,000,000.00 threshold, knowledge of such amounts is vital to thedefense. It also guides the trial court to render the proper judgment.<br><br>There is no need to specify the nature of the ill-gotten wealth the accused allegedly amassed, accumulated, or acquired. As I see it, the type of ill-gotten wealth is only an evidentiary fact which supports the ultimate fact that the accused had amassed, accumulated, or acquired more than P50,000,000.00 in kickbacks and commissions. What is essential is that the ill-gotten wealth, regardless of its form, breaches the P50,000,000.00 threshold, the necessary details of which may be sufficiently supplied by the breakdown above- discussed.<br><blockquote>3. “<b>The <i>approximate</i> dates of receipt of the alleged kickbacks and commissions since the overt acts to which the kickbacks and commissions relate, allegedly took place from 2004 to 2010.</b> At the very least, the prosecution should state the year when the kickbacks and transactions had been received.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Similar to the <i>ponencia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> I find that it is insufficient for the Information to just provide a broad time frame of six (6) years, more or less, to situate the occurrence of all the alleged PDAF transactions. In <i>Rocaberte v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court ruled that the Theft Information against the accused therein was seriously defective, for “[i]t places on him and his co-accused the unfair and unreasonable burden of having to recall their activities over a span of more than 2,500 days [(or 6 years)]. It is a burden nobody should be made to bear.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The same logic obtains here.<br><br>The year of the launching of each PDAF project need not be specified, as the <i>ponencia</i> now agrees. The year of launching of the PDAF project may not necessarily be the same as the year in which the PDAF is diverted. A project may last for several years from launching and the PDAF kickbacks may have been sporadically diverted throughout its course. It must be recalled that the charge here involves the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth by receiving a portion of the PDAF as commission and kickbacks. Thus, what is relevant is the year when the PDAF is diverted, not the year when the “cover project” is launched.<br><blockquote>4. “<b>A brief description of the ‘identified’ projects where kickbacks and commissions were received.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Project identification stands at the core of every PDAF transaction: it is the preliminary and necessary step to cast a veil of ostensible legitimacy to the scheme. Because it is the transaction’s primary identifier, it is essential that the accused, during his arraignment, be informed of what project the PDAF transaction he is charged of is connected to. In this regard, it is also obvious that the name of the project is significant in the preparation of his defense.<br><br>Only the project name should be stated. There is no need to go beyond this and providea brief description of the project (its nature, <i>e.g.</i>, farm inputs, equipment, and the year it was launched), and the intended beneficiaries, to which the <i>ponencia</i>accedes. At best, these are evidentiary facts which support the conclusions from which the ultimate fact, <i>i.e.</i>, the name of the project, is premised on.<br><blockquote>5. “<b>The name of Napoles’ NGOs which were the alleged recipients and target implementors of Enrile’s PDAF projects.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The Napoles’ NGOs were used basically as shell entities to which the PDAF kickbacks were fraudulently funneled. As such, they figure into a significantrole in each PDAF transaction. Stating the vehicle of facilitation provides the accused basic information of the means by which the PDAF transaction in which he was supposedly involved was employed. The <i>ponencia</i> correctly pointed out that “only after a project has been identified could Enrile endorse Napoles’ NGOs to the appropriate government agency that, in turn, would implement the supposed project using Enrile’s PDAF.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The alleged interplay of Enrile’s office and Napoles’ NGO’s was taken judicial notice by the Court in <i>Belgica v. Ochoa, Jr.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><blockquote>Recently, or in July of the present year [(<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, 2013)], the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) began its probe into allegations that "the government has been defrauded of some P10 Billion over the past 10 years by a syndicate using funds from the pork barrel of lawmakers and various government agencies for scores of ghost projects." The investigation was spawned by sworn affidavits of six (6) whistle-blowers who declared that JLN Corporation – "JLN" standing for Janet <b>Lim Napoles</b> (Napoles) – had swindled billions of pesos from the public coffers for “ghost projects” using no fewer than 20 dummy <b>NGOs</b> for an entire decade. While the NGOs were supposedly the ultimate recipients of PDAF funds, the whistle-blowers declared that the money was diverted into Napoles' private accounts. Thus, after its investigation on the Napoles controversy, criminal complaints were filed before the Office of the Ombudsman, charging five (5) lawmakers for Plunder [(<b>among others, Enrile</b>)], and three (3) other lawmakers for Malversation, Direct Bribery, and Violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Also recommended to be charged in the complaints are some of the lawmakers' chiefs-of-staff or representatives, the heads and other officials of three (3) implementing agencies, and the several presidents of the NGOs set up by Napoles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphases and words in brackets supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, an identification of the NGOs (and, as below discussed, the government agencies) involved in each PDAF transaction is therefore integral to the defense.<br><blockquote>6. “<b>The government agencies to whomEnrile allegedly endorsed Napoles’ NGOs.</b> We reiterate that the particular person/s in each government agency who facilitated the transactions need not anymore be named in the Information.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>As aptly observed by the <i>ponencia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> government agencies have been allegedly used as conduits between Enrile and the Napoles’ NGOs. The justification behind their inclusion is the same as that of the above.<br><br>The names of the public officer’s agents or employees through which he courses through the “groundwork” of his scheme, <i>i.e.</i>, the actual exchange of money, need not be provided. These involve mere evidentiary facts that only tend to prove the ultimate fact that the public officer concerned indeed received kickbacks and commissions. In this case, what remains paramount is that the Information state that Enrile received kickbacks from Napoles, <i>et al.</i> in connection with the ghost projects wherein the former’s PDAF was disbursed through the facility of his office. Regardless of who delivered and received the actual amounts, it is clear from the Information that Enrile’s office as Philippine Senator was used to operate the scheme.<br><br><center><b>IV.</b><br></center><br>As a final point, it should be elucidated that “<b>[t]he factual premises for the allegation that Enrile took undue advantage of his official position in order to enrich himself to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines</b> x xx”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> should not be provided by the prosecution.<br><br>The facts already alleged in the Information and the particulars granted are already sufficient to make out how Enrile took undue advantage of his official position. It will be recalled that the Information already alleges that Enrile, in his capacity as Senator from 2004-2010, conspired with Reyes, Napoles, Lim and De Asisin accumulating, amassing or acquiring P172,834,500.00 in ill-gotten wealth by receiving kickbacks and commission from projects funded by his PDAF, by endorsing Napoles-controlled NGOs to government agencies. From these allegations alone, the charge already conveys how Enrile supposedly took undue advantage of his office (for how else is he alleged to have diverted the funds) to the damage of the Filipino people (by depriving them of the public funds). In other words, it is fairly deducible from the allegations in the Information that Enrile must have taken undue advantage of his official position as Philippine Senator in order to manipulate the disposition of his PDAF and to obtain numerous kickbacks from Napoles. The damage and prejudice to the Filipino people and the Republic are also self-evident from the context of the Plunder charge, more so, one specifically on the PDAF scheme.<br><br>While the prosecution may have indeed quoted Section 1(d) (6) of the Plunder Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup>the language of the phrase “[b]y taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> is – according to its natural import – fully descriptive of the Plunder PDAF charge. It is common understanding that such an offense pertains to the act of taking undue advantage of a member of Congress of his PDAF, through his post-enactment authority. Since public funds are misappropriated, damage and prejudice has been obviously caused to the Filipino People. Therefore, it is unnecessary to split hairs on what this phrase means.As instructed in <i>Potter v. U.S.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><blockquote>The offense charged is a statutory one, and while it is doubtless true that it is not always sufficient to use simply the language of the statute in describing such an offense, x xx yet if such language is, according to the natural import of the words, fully descriptive of the offense, then ordinarily it is sufficient.<br></blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, subject to the qualifications herein made, I vote to <b>PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> “As a general proposition, a motion to quash on the ground that the allegations of the information do not constitute the offense charged, or any offense for that matter, should be resolved on the basis alone of said allegations whose truth and veracity are hypothetically admitted.

I join his view that the text of the Information, in the context of the entire process participated in by petitioner (accused in the Sandiganbayan), sufficiently provides him with the notice required so that he can enter his plea. When he entered his plea, the details of the facts that would lead to proof of his culpability could be further specified in pre-trial or during the trial itself. Furthermore, I see no impediment for petitioner to avail himself of discovery procedures.<br><br>Therefore, the Petition should be denied, there being no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The ponencia initially enumerated ten (10) matters, sufficient particulars on which “the prosecution must provide [petitioner] with . . . to allow him to properly enter his plea and prepare for his defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe, in her Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, agreed with the first five (5) items of these enumerated matters, partly agreed with the sixth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and disagreed with the others.<br><br>The revised ponencia then adopted Justice Perlas-Bernabe’s position except for the last item<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in the original ten (10) matters.

Further clarity in the facts would have been desirable but not necessary for due process requirements.<br><br>In particular, it was not necessary for the prosecution to state the approximate dates or the exact year when the alleged kickbacks were received. Plunder, unlike ordinary crimes, is not committed through one isolated act, but rather, through a <i>combination</i> or <i>series</i> of overt acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Informations for plunder should be treated differently from informations for other crimes like murder. Murder is only committed once. A person accused of the crime may have a credible alibi, and in order to adequately prepare for his or her defense, the information must state with particularity the approximate date and time of the commission of the offense.<br><br>By its nature, plunder is committed in increments over time. It may be committed by amassing, accumulating, or acquiring ill-gotten wealth every year from the start of the first commission or kickback. The statement of a range of years in the Information, such as “2004 to 2010,” is sufficient to inform the accused that the series of overt or criminal acts were committed within this period of time.<br><br>I dissent from the majority position requiring the last matter of fact as this is already evidentiary. Thus, this is not allowed by the Rules. Upholding petitioner’s request will make it more difficult for prosecutions of public officers charged with offenses that imply betrayal of public trust.<br><br>Even the ponente, at one point, agreed that a relaxation of technical rules may be necessary to enforce accountability among public officers who hold the public’s trust. In his Separate Concurring Opinion in <i>Re: Allegations Made Under Oath at the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Hearing Held on September 26, 2013 Against Associate Justice Gregory S. Ong, Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Justice Arturo Brion states that the strict application of the hearsay rule was detrimental to this court’s sworn duty to discipline its ranks:<br><blockquote>[T]he unnecessarily strict application of hearsay in administrative proceedings of judges has crippled this Court’s capability to discipline its ranks. An examination of bribery cases involving judges show our extreme wariness in declaring that a judge had in fact been bribed, often using the hearsay rule to conclude that insufficiency of evidence prevents us from finding the judge liable for bribery. We would, however, still penalize these judges and dismiss them from office because of acts constituting gross misconduct.<br><br>I cannot help but think that we so acted because, at the back of our minds, we might have believed that the respondent judge had indeed been guilty of bribery, but our over-attachment to the hearsay rule compelled us to shy away from this reason to support our conclusion. Hence, we try to find other ways to penalize the erring judge or justice.<br><br>While this indirect approach may ultimately arrive at the desired goal of penalizing erring judges and removing the corrupt from our roster, we should realize that this approach surrenders the strong signal that a finding of guilt for bribery makes.<br><br><i>It must not be lost on us that we send out a message to the public, to the members of the judiciary, and to the members of the bar, every time we decide a case involving the discipline of judges: we broadcast, by our actions, that we do not tolerate the acts for which we found the erring judge guilty. This message is lost when we penalize judges and justices for gross misconduct other than bribery, when bribery was the real root cause for the disciplinary action</i>.<br><br><i>I believe that the time has come for this Court to start calling a spade a spade, and make the conclusion that bribery had taken place if and when the circumstances sufficiently prove its occurrence. In making this conclusion, we should not be unduly hindered by technical rules of evidence, including hearsay, as we have the resources and experience to interpret and evaluate the evidence before us and the information it conveys.<br><br>We must not likewise get lost as we wander in our search for the proper degree of supporting evidence in administrative proceedings. This quantum of evidence should be substantial evidence because this standard provides the necessary balance and flexibility in determining the truth behind the accusations against a respondent judge, without sacrificing the necessary fairness that due process accords him and without sacrificing what is due to the institution we serve and the Filipino people.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In addition, I am of the view that the nature of the privileges that petitioner enjoyed while allegedly committing the offense puts him in a different class from other accused.<br><br>The Constitution is a document that necessarily contains the fundamental norms in our legal order. These norms are articulated in various provisions. These provisions are not separate from each other. They all contribute to an ideal, which is our duty to articulate in interpretations occasioned by actual controversies properly brought before us. These provisions cannot be disembodied from each other.<br><br>Section 1 of Article III of the Constitution enshrines the right to due process:<br><blockquote><i>Section 1</i>. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>At the same time, Section 1 of Article XI of the Constitution unequivocally mandates:<br><blockquote><i>Section 1</i>.

Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>This is a unique feature of our Constitution. These words are not empty rhetoric.<br><br>Those who qualify for public office hold their title in trust. Their tenure is defined but not inherently entrenched in their person. Their temporary occupation of these offices is not a right vested in them but a privilege from the sovereign.<br><br>Public officers carry this privilege with an additional burden. “At all times[,]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> they are required “to be accountable to the people.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They are to serve in their position with “utmost”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> integrity.<br><br>The interpretation and application of the constitutionally guaranteed individual right to due process must also be read alongside the constitutional duty of public accountability and utmost integrity.<br><br>Public officers who hold powerful offices can potentially provide opportunities to enrich themselves at the expense of the taxpaying public. They are not in the same class as individuals charged with common offenses. The impact of the malfeasances of government officers is far-reaching and long-lasting. Plunder of the public coffers deprives the poor, destitute, and vulnerable from the succor they deserve from their government. Economic resources that are diverted to private gain do not contribute to the public welfare. Plunder weakens and corrupts governance, thus resulting in incalculable costs for future generations. It contributes to the denial of the very basis of government—the same government that is supposed to ensure that all laws are enforced fairly and efficiently.<br><br>There is no question that all elements of the offense have been pleaded. The question is whether the language in the Information is specific enough. All words are open-textured, and there is always a hierarchy of specificity required by the context of the author and the reader.<br><br>I would have readily joined my colleagues who would advocate a stricter scrutiny—and, therefore, a restriction of a trial court’s discretion—in assessing whether the language of the Information representing ultimate facts is specific enough if this were a common crime.<br><br>For instance, if this were the usual crime charging an unlettered member of our urban slums with selling less than one-tenth of a gram of <i>shabu</i>, or the sordid offense in informal settlements of rape committed by fathers on their daughters, or even the usual crime of snatching a mobile phone by a desperate accused, I would have agreed to more specificity in the language contained in the Information.<br><br>But this is a different offense, one allegedly committed by a sitting public officer. The offense, if true, as well as his participation, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, is the probable contributing cause for the destitution of millions of Filipinos.<br><br>Public officers are also entitled to the constitutional guarantee of due process. In my view, the language in the Information in question sufficiently lists the ultimate facts constitutive of the offense for petitioner. Its level of specificity and the amount of discretion we should give the Sandiganbayan should be commensurate with his right to due process and with his duties as a public officer, which are mandated in the Constitution.<br><br>We can choose to narrow our vision and exact the strictest rigors of notice on a narrow and specific part of the criminal procedure’s process. Alternately, we can view the entire context for petitioner who comes before us to assess whether he has been fairly given the opportunity to know the charges against him. The constitutional requirement favoring petitioner should not be read as requiring an inordinate burden and exacting cost on the prosecution, such that it becomes a deterrent to move against erring public officials with powerful titles. After all, the People, represented by the prosecution, is also entitled to fairness and reasonability. The prosecution is also entitled to due process. Our doctrines should thrive on the realities of present needs.<br><br>Rightly so, we should be concerned with technical rules. Also as important is that we do not lose sight of the context of these technical rules.<br><br>In this case, petitioner was properly informed. He was given sufficient information to enter his plea.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to dismiss the Petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Ponencia, p. 38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 38–39.
