				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Questioned in the present notice of appeal is the Decision dated November 11, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04389,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which affirmed with modifications the Decision dated November 13, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15, Malolos City, in Criminal Case No. 680-M-06,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> finding accused-appellant Rodelio Llobera<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>y</i> Ofiza<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> and ordering him to pay the heirs of the victim P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as temperate damages.<br><br>In an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated February 20, 2006 and filed on March 7, 2006, accused-appellant was changed with the murder of Cristituto Biona, Jr., as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of March, 2005, in San Jose del Monte City, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with an improvised shotgun (sumpak) and with intent to kill one Cristituto Biona, Jr. y Billones, with evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot with the use of an improvised shotgun the said Cristituto Biona, Jr. y Billones, hitting him on his abdomen, thereby inflicting upon him mortal wound which caused his death.<br><br>Contrary to law.<br></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, accused-appellant, assisted by counsel <i>de oficio,</i> leaded not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The prosecution, in presenting its case, offered the testimonies of Betty dela Cruz (Betty)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Rosebert Biona (Rosebert), relatives of the victim who witnessed the shooting incident firsthand.<br><br>Betty, an aunt by affinity of the victim, testified that on March 22, 2005, at around 11:00 p.m., a commotion took place in front of her house as certain persons threw stones at each other ("<i>nagbatuhan</i>").<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> When the commotion was over, she and her kin, including the victim, went out of the house to find out what happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It was then that accused-appellant, who suddenly emerged from a nearby house armed with an improvised shotgun, shot the victim on the left side of his body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Betty testified that she is familiar with accused-appellant as the latter is her <i>barangaymate</i> and she always sees him when she passes by his house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Rosebert, a cousin of the victim, corroborated Betty's testimony. He recounted that, at the time in question, he was beside the victim as they were talking to each other when accused-appellant suddenly appeared and shot the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He testified that he was able to positively identify accusedÂ­ appellant at the time of the shooting because the place where the shooting occurred was illuminated by the moon, the lights from the neighbors' houses, and the lamp <i>gasera</i> at his uncle's house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The defense, for its part, presented accused-appellant who testified that on March 22, 2005, at around 10:00 p.m., he, his wife, their children, and certain visitors, one of whom was his cousin, Roderick Soriano (Roderick), were in their house in Barangay Mojon, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, planning a swimming event.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> His visitors left at around 11:15 p.m., and, thereafter, he and his family slept.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Accused-appellant maintained that it takes one and a half hours to reach the scene of the crime from his house; thus, he could not have been at the scene of the crime at the time the crime supposedly happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> These statements were corroborated by Roderick when he testified.<br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a judgment of conviction, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this court finds the accused Rodelio Llobrera y Otiaza GUlLTY beyond reasonable doubt of <b>Murder</b> under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of the deceased Cristituto Biona, Jr. y Billones the following sums of money[,] to wit:<br><blockquote>1.) P60,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br><br>2.) P50,000.00 as moral damages; and<br><br>3.) P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC reasoned that accused-appellant's denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of Betty and Rosebert.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Besides, according to the RTC, accused-appellant's claim of physical impossibility has no basis because, as attested to by accused-appellant himself, it takes only one and a half hours to reach the scene of the crime coming from accused-appellant's house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The RTC also ruled that treachery attended the killing of the victim for the prosecution's evidence shows that accused-appellant suddenly and unexpectedly appeared and shot the victim who did not sense any danger upon him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant appealed before the Court of Appeals, assigning the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>THE COURT <i><u>A QUO</u></i> GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE COURT <u><i>A QUO</i></u> GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S VERSION.<br><br><center>III.</center><br><br>THE COURT <i><u>A QUO</u></i> GRAVELY ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>After a review of the case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and merely modified the award of damages. The appellate court gave full credence to the positive identification of Betty and Rosebert, especially in the absence of any ulterior motives on their part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moreover, a review of Roderick's testimony showed that while it took an hour and a half to reach the scene of the crime from accused-appellant's house, that is by public transportation. Should one travel by private car, it would only take about fifteen minutes to traverse said distance. The appellate court then rejected accused-appellant's claim of physical impossibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The appellate court also affirmed the finding of treachery. It held that accused-appellant's mode of attack was such that the victim appeared not to have seen him prior to, during, or after the attack, leaving him no chance to defend himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals held:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit. The Decision dated 13 November 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Branch 15, in Criminal Case No. 680-M-06, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the following <b>MODIFICATIONS</b>: (1) the award of civil indemnity is increased to P75,000.00, (2) temperate damages is awarded in the amount of P25,000.00, and (3) the award of exemplary damages is deleted.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Accused-appellant is now before the Court, adopting the arguments he raised before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Specifically, accused-appellant questions his conviction despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the disregard of his version of events, and the appreciation of treachery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant avers that Betty and Rosebert probably misidentified him. For one, contrary to Betty's claim, he and Betty were not <i>barangaymates</i>, as he resides in Barangay Mojon, while Betty resides in Barangay Minuyan. While accused-appellant admits that he used to visit Barangay Minuyan every Sunday, the probability that Betty would chance upon him as to make her familiar with his identity and physical characteristics is very low. For another, Rosebert was merely vacationing in Barangay Minuyan when the shooting incident transpired. Not being a resident of Barangay Minuyan, Rosebert is not familiar with the locals residing in Barangay Minuyan and in the nearby <i>barangays</i> as to enable him to pinpoint accused-appellant as the one who shot the victim. All in all, accused-appellant argues that Betty and Rosebert probably misidentified him as the perpetrator of the crime, especially since there were other suspects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also questions the appreciation of treachery in the case at bar. He claims that while the prosecution alleged that the victim was suddenly shot by accused-appellant, it failed to establish that accused Â­appellant contemplated on the means or method to ensure the victim's killing without affording the latter a chance to defend himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>We dismiss the appeal.<br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Section 6 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, defines the crime of Murder -<br><br><blockquote>ART. 248. <i>Murder</i>.- Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua, to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><blockquote>1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.</blockquote></blockquote><br>"The elements of murder that the prosecution must establish are[:] (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the [RPC]; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>All these elements have been proven in the case at bar. The death of Cristituto Biona, Jr. is evidenced by a certificate of death duly presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Also, accused-appellant and the victim not being related to each other and the victim not being an infant, the killing here does not come within the definition of parricide or of infanticide.<br><br>As to accused-appellant's culpability, the clear and categorical testimonies of the prosecution witnesses obviate any doubt that on March 22, 2005, accused-appellant shot the victim with a shotgun, causing the latter a fatal wound which brought about his untimely death.<br><br>Betty resoundingly identified accused-appellant in open court as the one who shot the victim, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">This Cristituto Biona, where is he now?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">[H]e is already dead.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">What was the caused (sic) of his death?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He was shot, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">[W]ho shot him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td>&nbsp; <div align="JUSTIFY">Rodel, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">This Rodel, for how long have you known him prior to March 22, 2005?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">More than a year, sir, because I always passed his house and I used to see him.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Is he your barangaymate?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">If present in Court today[,] could you point this Rodel whom you claimed shot Cristituto Biona, Jr.[?]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">INTERPRETER:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Witness pointing to a detention prisoner who when asked of his name answered Rodel Llobrera.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Betty and Rosebert, both eyewitnesses to the shooting incident, categorically identified accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.

"On this point, the Court has consistently abided by the rule that the trial court is in a better position to adjudge the credibility of witnesses, especially if its decision is affirmed by the [Court of Appeals], unless there is a showing that it had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact[s] or circumstance[s] of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the case. The Court finds no reason to depart from the assessment of the RTC, as affirmed by the [Court of Appeals], as this is supported by the records of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's contention that Betty and Rosebert merely misidentified him is specious. Although Betty resides in Barangay Minuyan and accused-appellant resides in Barangay Mojon and they are, strictly speaking, not <i>barangaymates</i>, the fact is that accused-appellant goes to Barangay Minuyan every Sunday to visit his parents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Accused-appellant's constant presence in Barangay Minuyan might have prompted Betty to inaccurately conclude that accused-appellant resides in the same barangay, but what is apparent is that, on a number of occasions prior to the shooting incident, Betty was already familiar with accused-appellant and his physical appearance.<br><br>As to Rosebert's familiarity with accused-appellant, although the former was merely a visitor in Barangay Minuyan, the antecedent events show that he had a good glimpse of accused-appellant prior to the shooting incident.

"The rule is that where there is no evidence that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full credence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Additionally, accused-appellant's defense of denial is unconvincing. "[D]enial is intrinsically a weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. To be sure, it is negative, self-serving evidence that cannot be given evidentiary weight greater than that of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters. Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the negative averments of the accused, the former indisputably deserves more credence and evidentiary weight."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Moreover, accused-appellant's defense of alibi is also unconvincing. "For the defense of alibi to prosper, 'the accused must prove[:] (a) that he was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime[;] and (b) that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime' during its commission. 'Physical impossibility refers to distance and the facility of access between the <i>situs criminis</i> and the location of the accused when the crime was committed. He must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the scene of the crime and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As testified to by Roderick and even by accused-appellant himself, the commute time from accused-appellant's house to the scene of the crime is only an hour and a half by means of public transport or fifteen minutes by means of private transport. Thus, there is no physical impossibility in the case at bar.<br><br>As to the finding of treachery, we affirm the rulings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals. The RPC, in Article 14(16), defines treachery as the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<br><br>"There are two (2) conditions that must concur for treachery to exist, to wit: (a) the employment of means of execution gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (b) the means or method of execution was deliberately and consciously adopted. 'The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim [with] no chance to resist or escape."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>"The mere suddenness of the attack does not amount to treachery. The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning and is done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim with no chance to resist or escape. Thus, even frontal attack can be treacherous when it is sudden and unexpected[,] and the victim is unarmed.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, treachery is evident. For one, "[t]he use of a xxx shotgun against [an] unarmed [victim] is undoubtedly treacherous, as it denies the [victim] the chance to fend off the offender."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> For another, the fact that accused-appellant hid first and then blindsided the victim shows his conscious effort to adopt a deliberate attack which affords no warning to the victim.<br><br>As narrated by Betty:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">You said in your statement that Rodel Llobrera suddenly appear[ed] "bigla nalang sumulpot[,]" where did you come from when you said "bigla nalang sumulpot?"</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He was hiding behind the house, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whose house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Our neighbor, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How did you know that he was hiding in that house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Because he came behind that house when he shot Cristituto.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What was the exact position of Cristituto when he was shot by Rodel Llobrera?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He was standing sideways.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">In relation to his body "na nakatagilid[,]" what was the relative position of RodeI Llobrera when [he] fired his shotgun directed to Cristituto Biona?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">He was facing the victim and when he shot the victim[,] the victim turned side (sic), sir "tagilid."</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Madam witness, just for clarification, you said that Llobrera was hiding in a house[,] where did he come from, from what direction, at the side of the victim, in front of the victim [or] at the back of the victim before he delivered the shot?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">At the side of the victim sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The penalty for murder is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances attendant to the crime, the trial court and the appellate court correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, following Article 63(2) of the RPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Such shall be without eligibility for parole pursuant to Section 3 of R.A.
