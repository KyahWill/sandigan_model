It is a VAT-registered entity with Tax Identification No./VAT Registration No.000-110-659-000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>As such, it filed its quarterly VAT returns for the second quarter of calendar year 2001 up to the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, covering the period April 1, 2001 to February 28, 2003, which showed an overpayment of P44,920,350.92 and, later, its quarterly VAT returns for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, covering the period March 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004 which reflected an overpayment of P31,915,642.26.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Cargill maintained that said overpayments were due to its export sales of coconut oil, the proceeds of which were paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentralng Pilipinas and, thus, are zero-rated for VAT purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b>On June 27, 2003</b>, Cargill filed an administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT in the amount of P26,122,965.81 for the period of <u>April 1, 2001 to February 28, 2003</u> (<b>first refund claim</b>) before the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).

To be specific, it highlighted that Cargill’s petition in CTA Case No. 6714 was filed on June 30, 2003, or after the lapse of three (3) days from the time it filed its administrative claim with the BIR; while its petition in CTA Case No. 7672 was filed on the same date it filed its administrative claim with the BIR, <i>i.e</i>., on May 31, 2005. As such, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> ruled that Cargill’s judicial claims were correctly dismissed for being filed prematurely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Cargill moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which was, however, denied by the CTA <i>En Banc</i> in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated September 27, 2012, hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue in this case is whether or not the CTA <i>En Banc </i>correctly affirmed the CTA Division’s outright dismissal of Cargill’s claims for refund of unutilized input VAT on the ground of prematurity.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>Allowing the refund or credit of unutilized input VAT finds its genesis in Executive Order No. 273,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> series of 1987, which is recognized as the “Original VAT Law.” Thereafter, it was amended through the passage of Republic Act No. (RA)&nbsp; 7716,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> RA 8424,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and, finally by RA 9337,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which took effect on November 1, 2005. Considering that Cargill’s claims for refund covered periods before the effectivity of RA 9337, Section 112 of the NIRC, as amended by RA 8424, should, therefore, be the governing law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>the pertinent portions of which read:<br><br><blockquote>Section 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. </i>–<br><br>(A)<i> Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales.</i> – any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <b><u>within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made</u></b>, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(D) <i>Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made</i>. – In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b><u>within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents</u></b> in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof.<br><br>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, <b><u>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.</u></b> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>In the landmark case of <i>Aichi</i>, it was held that the observance of the 120-day period is a mandatory and jurisdictional requisite to the filing of a judicial claim for refund before the CTA. As such, its non-observance would warrant the dismissal of the judicial claim for lack of jurisdiction. It was, withal, delineated in <i>Aichi</i> that the two (2)-year prescriptive period would only apply to administrative claims, and not to judicial claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Accordingly, once the administrative claim is filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period, the taxpayer-claimant must wait for the lapse of the 120-day period and, thereafter, he has a 30-day period within which to file his judicial claim before the CTA, even if said 120-day and 30-day periods would exceed the aforementioned two (2)-year prescriptive period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the Court, in the case of <i>CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (<i>San Roque</i>), recognized an exception to the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period. <i>San Roque</i> enunciated that BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 dated December 10, 2003, which expressly declared that the “taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of petition for review,” provided a valid claim for equitable estoppel under Section 246<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the NIRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the more recent case of <i>Taganito Mining Corporation v. CIR</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court reconciled the pronouncements in <i>Aichi</i> and<i> San Roque</i>, holding that from <b>December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010</b> which refers to the interregnum when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued until the date of promulgation of <i>Aichi</i>, taxpayer-claimants need not observe the stringent 120-day period; but before and aftersaid window period, the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period remained in force, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Reconciling the pronouncements in the <i>Aichi</i> and <i>San Roque</i> cases, the rule must therefore be that <b><u>during the period December 10, 2003</u></b> (when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued) to October 6, 2010 (when the <i>Aichi</i> case was promulgated), <b><u>taxpayers-claimants need not observe the 120-day period</u></b> before it could file a judicial claim for refund of excess input VAT before the CTA. <b><u>Before and after the aforementioned period (<i>i.e</i>., December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010), the observance of the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional to the filing of such claim</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In this case, records disclose that anent Cargill’s first refund claim, it filed its administrative claim with the BIR on June 27, 2003, and its judicial claim before the CTA on June 30, 2003, or <b>before the period when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was in effect,</b> <i>i.e.</i>, from December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010. As such, it was incumbent upon Cargill to wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before seeking relief with the CTA, and considering that its judicial claim was filed only after three (3) days later, the CTA <i>En Banc,</i> thus, correctly dismissed Cargill’s petition in CTA Case No. 6714for being prematurely filed.<br><br>In contrast, records show that with respect to Cargill’s second refund claim, its administrative and judicial claims were both filed on May 31, 2005, or <b>during the period of effectivity of BIR Ruling NO. DA-489-03</b>, and, thus, fell within the exemption window period contemplated in <i>San Roque, i.e.</i>, when taxpayer-claimants need not wait for the expiration of the 120-day period before seeking judicial relief. Verily, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred when it outrightly dismissed CTA Case No. 7262on the ground of prematurity.<br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court finds that Cargill’s second refund claim in the amount of P22,194,446.67 which allegedly represented unutilized input VAT covering the period March 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004 should not be instantly granted. This is because the determination of Cargill’s entitlement to such claim, if any, would necessarily involve factual issues and, thus, are evidentiary in nature which are beyond the pale of judicial review under a Rule 45 petition where only pure questions of law, not of fact, may be resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Accordingly, the prudent course of action is to remand CTA Case No. 7262 to the CTA Division for resolution on the merits, consistent with the Court’s ruling in <i>Panay Power Corporation v. CIR.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, the Decision dated June 18, 2012 and the Resolution dated September 27, 2012 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) <i>En Banc</i> in CTA EB Case No. 779 are hereby<b> AFFIRMED</b> only insofar as it dismissed CTA Case No. 6714.
