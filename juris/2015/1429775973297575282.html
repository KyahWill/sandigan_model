Lourdeliza G. Cejes (PSI Cejes), the Forensic Chemist of the Eastern Police District (EPD) Crime Laboratory Office, was dispensed with after the prosecution and the defense stipulated on the following:<br><br><ol><li>That in relation to the arrest of appellant, a request for laboratory examination was made on October 14, 2006 by P/Sr. Insp.

The substance with the corresponding marking “Exh-A RCD/DG 10/13/06” on its plastic sachet was received by PSI Cejes in the morning of October 14, 2006.&nbsp; Per Physical Sciences Report No. D-452-2006E issued by PSI Cejes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the substance weighing 0.02 gram was found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or<i> shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied the charge and interposed the defenses of denial and frame-up/extortion.&nbsp; He alleged that after eating dinner on October 13, 2006, he was watching a bingo game when three men arrived and held him by both hands.&nbsp; They introduced themselves as policemen and told him that they have a warrant for his arrest.&nbsp; They then handcuffed and frisked him and took away his wallet and cellphone.&nbsp; The men brought him to a police station where PO2 Familara threatened to file a case against him unless he gives the police P50,000.00 as settlement.&nbsp; He failed to give the said amount.<br><br>Another witness for the defense, Genedina Guevarra Ignacio, testified that she was outside her house between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. of October 13, 2006 when she noticed three men passed by her in haste.&nbsp; The men approached appellant who was then watching a bingo game across the street and suddenly handcuffed him.&nbsp; She heard appellant asking the reason for his arrest.&nbsp; She did not know what happened next since she already went inside her house.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its July 1, 2009 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the trial court adjudged appellant guilty of the crime charged, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Rafael Cunanan y David alias “Paeng Putol” GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php500,000.00) with the accessory penalties provided for under Section 35 of said R.A. 9165.<br><br>The plastic sachet containing shabu (Exhibit “I”) is hereby ordered confiscated in favor of the government and turned over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for destruction.<br><br>With costs against the accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed appellant’s conviction in its January 27, 2011 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, there being no reversible error committed by the trial court, the appeal is dismissed.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated July 1, 2009 of the RTC, Branch 164, Pasig City, in Criminal Case No. 15143-D, is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal where appellant points out that: (1) there was no <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest as he was not committing any crime at the time he was apprehended but was merely watching a bingo game; (2) it was inconceivable for him to openly sell illegal drugs as PO1 Gunda himself testified that at the time of the alleged sale transaction there were many people around the target area; (3) the apprehending officers failed to comply with the guidelines on the proper custody of&nbsp; the seized dangerous drug, specifically with respect to its inventory and taking of photograph, and this casts doubt on whether the plastic sachet with white crystalline substance identified in court was the same item allegedly seized and confiscated from him; and (4)&nbsp; the testimonies of PO1 Gunda and PO2 Familara as to who was in possession of the seized item from the target area up to the police station were conflicting.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal is without merit.<br><br><i>Appellant was lawfully arrested after he<br>was caught in flagrante delicto selling an <br>illegal drug in a buy-bust operation; contrary <br>to his contention, it was not inconceivable <br>that he would openly sell an illegal drug <br>in public.</i><br><br>Appellant assails the legality of his arrest contending that he was not caught<i> in flagrante delicto.</i>&nbsp; Appellant’s contention fails to convince.&nbsp; The testimony of PO1 Gunda who acted as the poseur-buyer in the buy-bust operation clearly recounts how the sale transaction between him and appellant transpired, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q-</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">After you were introduced by this confidential informant to Paeng Putol that you are user of illegal drugs, what was the reaction of the target person, this Paeng Putol?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A-&nbsp;</div></td> <td>&nbsp;

Besides, “[t]he integrity of the evidence is presumed to have been preserved unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will or proof that the evidence has been tampered with.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the defense failed to prove ill motive on the part of the apprehending officers that would have impelled them to fabricate a serious crime against appellant.&nbsp; Also, the alleged inconsistency in the testimonies of PO1 Gunda and PO2 Familara as to who was in possession of the item from the police station to the EPD crime laboratory did not create any doubt that what was submitted for laboratory examination and later presented in court as evidence was the same drug actually sold by the appellant.<br><br><i>Appellant’s defenses of denial and<br>frame-up/extortion must fail.</i><br><br>Appellant’s defenses of denial and frame-up/extortion must fail in light of the positive testimony of PO1 Gunda, the poseur-buyer, that appellant sold to him the illegal drug. Moreover, it was not shown that appellant filed any criminal or administrative charges against the apprehending officers, thus clearly belying his claim of frame-up/extortion against them.<br><br>All told, appellant’s violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 was duly established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.&nbsp; Hence, the Court affirms his conviction.<br><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>Under RA 9165, the unauthorized sale of <i>shabu</i>, regardless of its quantity and purity, carries with it the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10 million.&nbsp; Here, the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 imposed upon appellant by the RTC and affirmed by the CA are in order.&nbsp; It must be added, however, that appellant shall not be eligible for parole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the January 27, 2011 Decision of the Court of Appeals in&nbsp; CA-G.R.
