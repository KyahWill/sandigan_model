On March 1, 2003, a customer wanted to renew a loan. As part of the Pawnshop’s practice, before the Pawnshop could approve the loan renewal, the item pledged would be shown to the customer as proof that the item was still intact. This time, however, contrary to the Pawnshop’s practice, the item was not shown to the customer because when Boquecosa tried to retrieve the pieces of jewelry from the vault, she was not able to find them. Nevertheless, the Pawnshop still approved the loan renewal.<br><br>As a sales clerk, Boquecosa was also in-charge of receiving orders for class rings and for their payments. However, upon conducting an inventory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Pawnshop discovered that Boquecosa failed to remit the proceeds from the class ring orders. As to the pieces of the pawned jewelry, these were nowhere to be found in spite of a thorough search. Because of the incident, the management conducted an inventory. Based on the findings, P457,258.80 worth of pieces of jewelry, unremitted class ring collections, and cell card sales was missing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The management summoned Boquecosa to explain about the missing pieces of jewelry, and the unremitted class ring collections and cell card sales. Upon inquiry, Boquecosa broke down and cried, and admitted that she used the missing class ring collections and cell card sales for her own personal gain. Boquecosa also admitted that she took the missing pieces of jewelry (necklace and bracelet), and pawned them at M. Lhuiller Pawnshop and H. Villarica Pawnshop using fictitious names. To redeem the pieces of jewelry, Mark Yu, the Pawnshop’s proprietor, used the letter of authority executed by Boquecosa.<br><br>Version of the Defense:<br><br>When a customer requested for a loan renewal, Tirso Gaña, the attending sales clerk, asked Boquecosa to retrieve the customer’s pledged pieces of jewelry from the vault. However, Boquecosa only found the necklace and could not find the bracelet.<br><br>Apprehensive of the missing pieces of jewelry, the Pawnshop’s management conducted an inventory. Boquecosa was summoned to answer for the missing pieces of jewelry, and for the unremitted class ring collections and cell card sales, but she denied having anything to do with the matter. Boquecosa averred that she was not the only one who had access to the vault because a certain Arlene, her co-employee, also had such access to the vault.<br><br>On arraignment, Boquecosa pleaded not guilty.<br><br>The RTC conducted a joint trial on the two (2) sets of Information. During trial, the prosecution presented the following witnesses, Charlo Baron, Mark Yu, Juanita Colina, Gina Pelenio, Gina Yu, Melissa Mendoza, and Tirso Gania.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On the other hand, the defense presented Boquecosa as its sole witness.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Lower Courts</b><br></center><br>The RTC found Boquecosa guilty of the crime of qualified theft based on the pieces of evidence presented, together with Boquecosa’s admission in open court, which is bolstered by the latter’s admission that she had sole access to the vault. The RTC Joint Judgment reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the court finds accused CAROLINA BOQUECOSA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Theft and hereby sentences her to suffer RECLUSION PERPETUA. The court also orders her to indemnify or return to the private offended party the amount of P457,258.80, but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC Joint Judgment <i>in toto</i>. The Court of Appeals rejected Boquecosa’s contention that her guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt because the pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution were merely circumstantial evidence. According to the Court of Appeals, “an accused can be convicted even if no eyewitness is available, as long as sufficient circumstantial evidence [has been] presented by the prosecution to prove beyond [reasonable] doubt that the accused committed the crime.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The defense raised the lone assigned error that the trial court erred in convicting Boquecosa for the crime charged despite the fact that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt because nobody was able to directly identify her as the one who stole the pieces of jewelry, unremitted class ring collections, and cell card sales.<br><br>According to the defense, the prosecution witnesses failed to sufficiently establish the culpability of Boquecosa because their testimonies were unacceptable and unworthy of belief, without any particular evidence to prove that it was really Boquecosa who took all the missing items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Stated otherwise, there was no evidence, even circumstantial, that would prove that it was Boquecosa who took all the missing items. Boquecosa further averred that anyone could have taken the missing items because almost everyone had access to the vault. “The position of [Boquecosa] as a vault custodian cannot by itself hold her accountable [for] all the losses especially since all the other employees have access to the vault.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Further, Boquecosa’s admission referred only to the necklace and bracelet, collectively valued at P56,600.00, and not to those which were covered in Criminal Case No. CBU-66829 in the amount of P400,658.80.<br><br>The defense’s arguments fail to impress.<br><br>For the prosecution of the crime of theft as punishable under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code, the prosecution must be able to establish the presence of the following elements: “(1) there was a taking of personal property; (2) the property belongs to another; (3) the taking was without the consent of the owner; (4) the taking was done with intent to gain; and (5) the taking was accomplished without violence or intimidation against the person or force upon things.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>To qualify the crime of simple theft to qualified theft, the crime of theft must be committed with grave abuse of confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> All of the elements for qualified theft are present in this case. Proceeding from the fact that Boquecosa was, on the dates of the crime, a sales clerk and vault custodian of the Pawnshop, she admitted having pawned the missing pieces of jewelry. The act, of course, presupposes a previous taking of the items.<br><br>So that even if the prosecution witnesses’ testimonies and pieces of evidence were discredited, Boquecosa had already bound herself to the theft. Boquecosa admitted that after she took the pieces of jewelry from the vault, she pawned the same to M. Lhuiller and H.

Further, the party who judicially admits a fact is precluded from challenging her former judicial admissions. A party cannot subsequently retract a former statement that is inconsistent with the previous admission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, this rule is not without exceptions. The exceptions are when (1) it is shown that the admission was made through palpable mistake, and (2) it is shown that no such admission was in fact made. The present case does not fall within any of the exceptions. Hence, Boquecosa’s admission shall be binding upon her, which she cannot subsequently retract. By Boquecosa’s judicial admission, the trial court could have adjudged the case <i>sans</i> the prosecution’s presentation of evidence. In effect, Boquecosa’s contention that there is no direct evidence, which may prove her guilt, is irrelevant.<br><br>The presence of all the first four (4) elements is clear. Boquecosa took the pieces of jewelry, class ring collections, and cell card sales, without the consent of the Pawnshop’s owner and the owner of the pieces of jewelry, and with intent to gain.<br><br>With regard to the intent to gain, it is “presumed to be alleged in an information, in which it is charged that there was unlawful taking (<i>apoderamiento</i>) and appropriation by the offender of the things subject of asportation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Indeed, Boquecosa’s claims that she was not the only employee who had sole access to the vault and that a certain Arlene, a co-employee, also had that opportunity were sufficiently clarified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Everytime you were absent were you required to file a leave of absence or application for leave of absence?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">So, during those times xxx that you were absent who usually took over your function as a vault custodian?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">None, they will just pick up another employee from the accounting department, there was no vault custodian who will replace, she is my co-worker… upstairs.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="3"><div align="justify">COURT TO WITNESS:</div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">What about Arlene?

As such custodian, Boquecosa was entrusted with the vault combination. Boquecosa gravely abused that trust and confidence, which her employer reposed upon her.<br><br>The penalty for qualified theft is based on the value of the property stolen, which, in this case, is P457,258.80. The basic penalty is <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods to be imposed in the maximum period, that is, eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i>. To determine the additional years of imprisonment to be added to the basic penalty, the amount of P22,000.00 is deducted from P457,258.80, which leaves a difference of P435,258.80. This amount is then divided by P10,000.00, disregarding any amount less than P10,000.00. The resulting quotient of 43 is equivalent to 43 years, which is added to the basic penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Because Boquecosa committed qualified theft, her penalty is two degrees higher than the penalty for simple theft. However, contrary to the maximum penalty imposable in simple theft, which cannot exceed twenty (20) years, the penalty for qualified theft has no such limitation.
