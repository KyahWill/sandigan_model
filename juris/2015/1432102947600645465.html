Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen.

The dispositive portion of the Decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>In G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders — namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 — and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued — namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 — are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.<br><br>In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.<br><br>Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty.

Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or "revived" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>As to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise.

Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.<br><br>In order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup><br></blockquote>The ruling in <i>Crespo</i> was clarified in <i>Chan v. Formaran III, et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup><br><blockquote>In subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Chan v. Formaran III</i>, et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> It was further discussed that:<br><blockquote>[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.<br><br>In any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).<br><br>Chief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City "to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V.

Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup><br></blockquote>Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:<br><blockquote>After an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup><br></blockquote>Chief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>This court reminds Molina of the discussion in <i>Punzalan v. Plata</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup><br><br>[T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup><br><br><i>G.R. No. 128911</i><br><br>In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:<br><blockquote>In its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:<br><blockquote>"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.<br><br>(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others — namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 — and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 — are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.<br><br>In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision"<br></blockquote>The case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 — that "said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision" — is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.<br><br>Now, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.<br><br>Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):<br><br>(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and<br><br>(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;<br><br>The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:<br><br>(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup><br></blockquote>TMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup><br><br>Molina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup> in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution.

The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon.

Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled <i>Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V.

Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>In G. R.

No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.<br><br>Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V.

Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.<br><br>Forum shopping is defined as:<br><blockquote>[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup><br></blockquote>Forum shopping consists of the following elements:<br><blockquote>(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;<br><br>(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and<br><br>(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup><br></blockquote>All the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.<br><br>For the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:<br><blockquote>ascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup><br><br>Molina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.<br><br>Further, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.<br><br>The elements of res judicata are:<br><blockquote>(a) the former judgment must be final;<br><br>(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;<br><br>(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and<br><br>(d) there must be between the first and the second actions <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) identity of parties,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) identity of subject matter, and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) identity of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup><br></blockquote>These requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, <i>Ortigas &amp; Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.<br><br>This court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup><br><br>This court held that:<br><blockquote>[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 — in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that "<i>no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed</i> x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.<br><br>Apart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that <i>no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed</i> in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.<br><br>Evidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.<br><br>Evidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's "Comment/Answer" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.<br><br>Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been <i>repeatedly</i> directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.<br><br><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Regarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty.
