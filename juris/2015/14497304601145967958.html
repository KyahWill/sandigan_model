Moreover, contrary to the limitation imposed by DAR AO 6-92 - <i>i.e.</i>, that the computed value using the applicable formula shall not exceed the landowner's offer to sell - the CA found that the amount as recomputed by the RTC was way beyond the landowner's offer of P1,750,000.00 <u>as stated in the Claims Valuation and Processing Form</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Consequently, it gave more credence to the report submitted by Commissioner Corcuera which made use of the DAR formula derived from the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657.

Further, it argues that unless there is a final and executory decision, it is under no obligation to pay interests since there could be no delay as of yet in the payment of just compensation. Besides, it maintains that RA 6657 did not provide for the payment of such interests.<br><br>In <b>G.R. Nos. 172387-88</b>, the Hababag Heirs contend that the CA erred in setting aside the just compensation fixed by the RTC which was in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 of RA 6657 and the final decision of the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 66824 directing its re-computation.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petitions lack merit.<br><br>In the landmark case of <i>Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Hon. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court defined the term "just compensation" as follows:<br><blockquote>Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. It has been repeatedly -stressed by this Court that the measure is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to intensify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea that the equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full [and] ample.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>In this relation, the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has been conferred with the original and exclusive power to determine just compensation for parcels of land acquired by the State pursuant to the agrarian reform program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> To guide the RTC in this function, Section 17<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of RA 6657 enumerates the factors which must be taken into consideration to accurately determine the amount of just compensation to be awarded in a particular case. They are: (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land; (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties; (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property, and the income therefrom; (<i>d</i>) the owner's sworn valuation; (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations; (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors; (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property; and (<i>h</i>) the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Corollarily, pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of the same law, the DAR translated these factors into a basic formula,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which courts have often referred to and applied, as the CA did in this case. It, however, bears stressing that courts are not constrained to adopt the said formula in every case since the determination of the amount of just compensation essentially partakes the nature of a judicial function. In this accord, courts may either adopt the DAR formula or proceed with its own application for as long as the factors listed in Section 17 of RA 6657 have been duly considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In keeping with these considerations, the Court finds the CA's valuation - which made use of the DAR formula - as reflective of the factors set forth in Section 17 of RA 6657. Records disclose that the CA's computation, as adopted from the LBP's own computation, is based on: (<i>a</i>) actual production data; (<i>b</i>) the appropriate industry selling prices of the products from the Philippine Coconut Authority and the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics of Sorsogon; and (<i>c</i>) the actual uses of the property. Likewise, the (<i>a</i>) income from the coconut fruit-bearing trees, as well as the unirrigated riceland, (<i>b</i>) cumulative cost of the non-fruit-bearing trees; and (<i>c</i>) market value of the cogonal land have been duly considered. The Court observes that the holistic data gathered therefrom adequately consider the factors set forth in Section 17 of RA 6657, as well as the DAR formula. As such, the CA's computation, which was derived from the same, must be sustained. Lest it be misunderstood, the ascertainment of just compensation on the basis of the landholdings' nature, location, and market value, as well as the volume and value of the produce is valid and accords with Section 17 of RA 6657<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the DAR formula, as in this case.<br><br>On the contrary, the Court finds the RTC's valuation to be improper, as it contradicts the definition of "market value" as crafted by established jurisprudence on expropriation.<br><br>To elucidate, in determining the amount of just compensation for the subject lands, the RTC applied the Income Productivity Approach which approximated the income for the remaining productive life of the crops therein, without considering the fortuitous events and plant diseases, and with the expectation that they would be compensated by developments which could be made by the property owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The Court has repeatedly ruled that the constitutional limitation of just compensation is considered to be the sum equivalent of the market value of the property, which is, in turn, defined as the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition, or the fair value of the property as between one who receives and one who desires to sell it, <i>fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this accord, therefore, the Court cannot sustain the formula used by the RTC which was "based on the principle of <b>anticipation</b> which implies that the value of a property is dependent on the potential net benefit that may be derived from its ownership."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Clearly, this approach, which is largely characterized by the element of futurity, is inconsistent with the idea of valuing the expropriated property at the time of the taking.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court also observes that the Income Productivity Approach, as applied by the RTC, adopts an investor's point of view which is actually off-tangent with the governmental purpose behind the acquisition of agricultural lands. On this score, case law states that agricultural lands are not acquired for investment purposes but for redistribution to landless farmers in order to lift their economic status<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> by enabling them to own directly or collectively the lands they till or to receive a just share of the fruits thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this regard, farmer-beneficiaries are not given those lands so they can live there but so that they can till them. Since they generally live on a hand-to-mouth existence, their source of repaying the just compensation is but derived out of their income from their cultivation of the land. Hence, in order to be just, the compensation for the land must be what the farmer-beneficiaries can reasonably afford to pay based on what the land can produce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It would therefore be highly inequitable that in the 30-year allowable period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> to pay the annual amortizations for the lands, farmer-beneficiaries would be required to pay for the same income they expect to earn therefrom on top of the computed market value of the landholdings. Such could not have been the intent of the State's agrarian reform program. In fine, the Court cannot sustain the RTC's application of the Income Productivity Approach used as one of its bases in arriving at its decreed valuation. Not only is the same aversive to the jurisprudential concept of "market value," but it also deviates from the factors laid down in Section 17 of RA 6657 and thus, remains legally baseless and unfounded.<br><br>On the issue of interests, suffice it to state that the just compensation due to the landowners for their expropriated property is treated as an effective forbearance on the part of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The rationale therefor, as enunciated in the case of <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. LBP</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> is to compensate the landowners for the income they would have made had they been properly compensated for their properties at the time of the taking.
