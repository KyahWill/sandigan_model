				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i> is an extraordinary remedy adopted to address the special concerns of extra-legal killings and enforced disappearances. Accordingly, the remedy ought to be resorted to and granted judiciously, lest the ideal sought by the <i>Amparo</i> Rule be diluted and undermined by the indiscriminate filing of <i>amparo</i> petitions for purposes less than the desire to secure <i>amparo</i> reliefs and protection and/or on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>For the consideration of the Court are three consolidated petitions assailing the Orders dated 28 January 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 29 January 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and 18 February 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as well as the Resolution dated 14 March 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> all issued by respondent Presiding Judge Paulino Gallegos (Judge Gallegos) of the Regional Trial Court-Manila, Branch 47 in SP.

No. 211403.<br><br>On 25 February 2014, Ku filed an appeal memorandum on his deportation order addressed to the Office of the President (OP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On 14 March 2014, Judge Gallegos issued the assailed Resolution granting the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the privilege of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. [Ku] is ordered immediately released from [petitioner’s] custody without prejudice to the institution of the proper remedy to extradition. Moreover, the [petitioner] and/or agents are ordered to cease and desist from further violating the right to liberty of [Ku] and the members of his family by filing cases to legitimize his detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, in the Resolution dated 18 March 2014 in G.R. No. 211403, the Court issued a TRO enjoining the RTC from enforcing the Order dated 18 February 2014 and from further proceeding with the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On 19 March 2014, the OP granted Ku provisional liberty only until 31 August 2014 or until his appeal was resolved, whichever came first.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Ku then moved for the release of his passport before the RTC, which petitioner opposed and to which he filed a counter-motion for the RTC to release said passport to the BI, given that such was one of the conditions for the OP’s grant of provisional liberty to Ku.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In the Order dated 26 March 2014, however, Judge Gallegos merely noted petitioner’s motion for being moot, considering that he already released Ku’s passport on 20 March 2014, upon the personal request of Ku.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Due to the complexities involved, petitioner filed the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> in G.R. No. 211590, essentially assailing the Resolution dated 14 March 2014.<br><br>Condensing the various issues raised in these petitions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we come to the central question of whether or not the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i> was properly granted in the case at bar.<br><br>We rule in the negative.<br><br>Section 1 of the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> (<i>Amparo</i> Rule)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Petition</i>. – The petition for a writ of <i>amparo</i> is a remedy available to any person whose right to life, liberty and security is violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity.<br><br>The writ shall cover extralegal killings and enforced disappearances or threats thereof.<br></blockquote>On 25 September 2007, the Court promulgated the <i>Amparo</i> Rule “in light of the prevalence of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances.” It was an exercise for the first time of the Court’s expanded power to promulgate rules to protect our people’s constitutional rights, which made its maiden appearance in the 1987 Constitution in response to the Filipino experience of the martial law regime. As the <i>Amparo</i> Rule was intended to address the intractable problem of “extralegal killings” and “enforced disappearances,” its coverage, in its present form, is confined to these two instances or to threats thereof. “Extralegal killings” are “killings committed without due process of law, i.e., without legal safeguards or judicial proceedings.” On the other hand, “enforced disappearances” are “attended by the following characteristics: an arrest, detention or abduction of a person by a government official or organized groups or private individuals acting with the direct or indirect acquiescence of the government; the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty which places such persons outside the protection of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>This pronouncement on the coverage of the writ was further cemented in the latter case of <i>Lozada, Jr. v. Macapagal-Arroyo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> where this Court explicitly declared that as it stands, the writ of <i>amparo</i> is confined only to cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, or to threats thereof. As to what constitutes “enforced disappearance,” the Court in <i>Navia v. Pardico</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> enumerated the elements constituting “enforced disappearances” as the term is statutorily defined in Section 3(g) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9851,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> that there be an arrest, detention, abduction or any form of deprivation of liberty;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> that it be carried out by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, the State or a political organization;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> that it be followed by the State or political organization’s refusal to acknowledge or give information on the fate or whereabouts of the person subject of the <i>amparo</i> petition; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> that the intention for such refusal is to remove the subject person from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As clarified in <i>Navia</i>, with the enactment of R.A. No. 9851, the <i>Amparo</i> Rule is now a procedural law anchored, not only on the constitutional rights to life, liberty and security, but on a concrete statutory definition as well of what an ‘enforced or involuntary disappearance’ is. Therefore, A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC’s reference to enforced disappearances should be construed to mean the enforced or involuntary disappearance of persons contemplated in Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 9851. Meaning, in probing enforced disappearance cases, courts should read A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC in relation to R.A. No. 9851.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Guided by the parameters of R.A. No. 9851, we can readily discern that Ku’s circumstance does not come under the statutory definition of an enforced or involuntary disappearance. Indeed, Ku was arrested by agents of the BI, but there was no refusal on the part of the BI to acknowledge such arrest nor was there any refusal to give information on the whereabouts of Ku. Neither can it be said that the BI had any intention to remove Ku from the protection of the law for a prolonged time.<br><br>Although Ku claims that he was arbitrarily arrested and detained by agents of the BI, that he was not read his rights under the constitution and was not informed of the reason for his arrest, nor provided a copy of any document leading to his arrest and detention,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the arresting officers are all consistent in testifying that, upon Ku’s arrest, they introduced themselves as agents of the BI, presented to Ku the Warrant of Deportation, and informed him of his constitutional rights as well as the expiration of his visa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>More importantly, there was no attempt on the part of the BI to conceal Ku or his whereabouts. Within the Bureau, Ku’s arrest and the fact that he was in their custody was not obscured as, in fact, these were well-documented as evidenced by the Return of Warrant of Deportation dated 20 January 2014<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the After-Mission Report dated 17 January 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> More importantly, in the Return of the Writ, petitioner readily disclosed to the trial court that Ku was in the custody of the BI pursuant to a Warrant of Deportation and a Summary Deportation Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>These documents and pleading show that there was never any intention on the part of the BI to remove Ku from the protection of the law for a prolonged time. Besides, when Ku was arrested at 9:30 p.m. on 16 January 2014, and received at the BI Detention Center at 11:30 p.m. also on 16 January 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the following day or on 17 January 2014, Ku’s counsel was immediately able to file his Entry of Appearance with Motion for Reconsideration before the BI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> thereby showing that Ku’s legal rights were amply guarded and that he was never removed from the protection of the law.<br><br>Section 5 of the <i>Amparo</i> Rule enumerates what an <i>amparo</i> petition should contain, among which is the right to life, liberty and security of the aggrieved party violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of the respondent, and how such threat or violation is committed with the attendant circumstances detailed in supporting affidavits, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Contents of Petition</i>. – The petition shall be signed and verified and shall allege the following:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> The personal circumstances of the petitioner;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The name and personal circumstances of the respondent responsible for the threat, act or omission, or, if the name is unknown or uncertain, the respondent may be described by an assumed appellation;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The right to life, liberty and security of the aggrieved party violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of the respondent, and how such threat or violation is committed with the attendant circumstances detailed in supporting affidavits;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The investigation conducted, if any, specifying the names, personal circumstances, and addresses of the investigating authority or individuals, as well as the manner and conduct of the investigation, together with any report;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(e)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The actions and recourses taken by the petitioner to determine the fate or whereabouts of the aggrieved party and the identity of the person responsible for the threat, act or omission; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(f) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The relief prayed for.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The petition may include a general prayer for other just and equitable reliefs.<br></blockquote>Ku claims that he fears for his life and feels the serious danger of being detained for a long period of time without any cause, and that he fears that the BI will fabricate criminal cases against him to hold him under detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> According to Ku, what he seeks to obtain in filing an <i>amparo</i> petition is the protection it will give to his person against the actions of some government officials who will likely take advantage of their positions and use the power of the government at their command. Ku adds that the longer he stays in confinement the more he is exposed to life-threatening situations and the further the violation of his guaranteed rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The allegations of Ku, though, are specious. It is to be noted that the <i>Amparo</i> Rule requires the parties to establish their claims by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Other than making unfounded claims, however, Ku was not able to present evidence that he was exposed to “life-threatening situations” while confined at the BI Detention Center. On the contrary, the records show that he is afforded visitorial rights and that he has access to his counsel.<br><br>Moreover, his primary fear, which prompted him to file the <i>amparo</i> petition, was that the BI would trump up charges against him so as to justify his detention. The fact remains, however, that even before his arrest, deportation charges against him were already duly filed and ruled upon by the BI.<br><br>As such, it can readily be discerned that the RTC’s grant of the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i> was improper in this case as Ku and his whereabouts were never concealed, and as the alleged threats to his life, liberty and security were unfounded and unsubstantiated. It is to be emphasized that the fundamental function of the writ of <i>amparo</i> is to cause the disclosure of details concerning the extrajudicial killing or the enforced disappearance of an aggrieved party. As Ku and his whereabouts were never hidden, there was no need for the issuance of the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i> in the case at bar.<br><br>It is to be additionally observed that Ku is guilty of forum shopping. Being the subject of a Warrant of Deportation and a Summary Deportation Order, Ku’s proper recourse is with the BI and, thereafter, with the DOJ and the OP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Ku knows this and, in fact, he filed a Motion for Reconsideration before the BI and an Appeal before the OP. When Ku, however, injudiciously filed a Petition and a Supplemental Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, he committed forum shopping by seeking a remedy which he had already solicited from another tribunal.<br><br>In <i>Kiani v. BID</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> where petitioner therein filed before the trial court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to have the detention of her husband declared as illegal and to order the latter’s release, and where her husband filed before the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID) an omnibus motion seeking to question the summary deportation order issued against him, the Court held that petitioner indulged in forum shopping.<br><br>The Court clarified that under Section 8, Chapter 3, Title I, Book III of Executive Order No. 292, the power to deport aliens is vested in the President of the Philippines, subject to the requirements of due process. The Immigration Commissioner is vested with authority to deport aliens under Section 37 of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended. Thus, a party aggrieved by a Deportation Order issued by the BOC is proscribed from assailing said Order in the RTC even via a petition for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Conformably with ruling of the Court in <i>Domingo v. Scheer</i>, such party may file a motion for the reconsideration thereof before the BOC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Citing <i>Balite v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court held that there is forum shopping when a party seeks to obtain remedies in an action in one court, which had already been solicited, and in other courts and other proceedings in other tribunals. While a party may avail of the remedies prescribed by the Rules of Court, such party is not free to resort to them simultaneously or at his/her pleasure or caprice. A party should not be allowed to present simultaneous remedies in two different forums, for it degrades and wreaks havoc to the rule on orderly procedure. A party must follow the sequence and hierarchical order in availing of such remedies and not resort to shortcuts in procedure or playing fast and loose with the said rules. Forum shopping, an act of malpractice, is considered as trifling with the courts and abusing their processes. It is improper conduct and degrades the administration of justice.<br><br>On a final note, the Court observes that Judge Gallegos knowingly disregarded the Court’s directives as regards this case. The records show that the Court’s Resolution dated 4 February 2014, wherein we issued a TRO enjoining the enforcement of the Orders dated 28 and 29 January 2014 and intimated the impropriety of the <i>amparo</i> petition, was received by the RTC on 5 February 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> This should have alerted Judge Gallegos to proceed with caution and restraint in granting the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i>. And yet, despite having knowledge of the Court’s pronouncements, Judge Gallegos proceeded to grant the said privilege.<br><br>Also, the records show that the Court’s Resolution dated 18 March 2014, wherein we issued a TRO enjoining the enforcement of the Order dated 18 February 2014 and enjoining the RTC from further proceeding with the case, was received by the RTC on 20 March 2014 at 9:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Although by then, Judge Gallegos already issued the Resolution dated 14 March 2014 which granted the privilege of the writ of <i>amparo</i>, his receipt of the Court’s Resolution dated 18 March 2014 should have forewarned him against releasing Ku’s passport. That he did so demonstrates his resistance and unwillingness to follow the Court’s edicts.<br><br>It is well to note that a resolution of the Supreme Court should not be construed as a mere request, and should be complied with promptly and completely. Such failure to comply accordingly betrays not only a recalcitrant streak in character, but also disrespect for the Court’s lawful order and directive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Judge Gallegos should know that judges must respect the orders and decisions of higher tribunals, especially the Supreme Court from which all other courts take their bearings. A resolution of the Supreme Court is not to be construed as a mere request nor should it be complied with partially, inadequately or selectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In the Judiciary, moral integrity is more than a cardinal virtue, it is a necessity. The exacting standards of conduct demanded from judges are designed to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. When the judge himself becomes the transgressor of the law which he is sworn to apply, he places his office in disrepute, encourages disrespect for the law and impairs public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court hereby resolves to:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><b>GRANT</b> the present petitions, and <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the Resolution dated 14 March 2014 of the Regional Trial Court which granted the privilege of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"><b>DENY</b> the privilege of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> sought via the Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of <i>Amparo</i> and the Supplemental Petition for the Issuance of Writ of <i>Amparo</i> in SP.
