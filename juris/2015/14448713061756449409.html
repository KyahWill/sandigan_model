				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is a notice of appeal assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 28, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03651, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 21, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City, Branch 123, in Criminal Cases No. C-74987 and No. C-74988, finding accused-appellant Edgar Bolo y Franco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale and illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 or the <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i>.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. C-74987, accused-appellant was charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 1st day of April, 2006 in Caloocan City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver to PO1 ROLLY JONES MONTEFRIO who pose[d] as buyer [of] METHYL AMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Shabu) weighing 0.21 gram without corresponding license or prescription therefore, knowing the same to be such.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, in Criminal Case No. C-74988, accused-appellant was charged with violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, to wit:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 1st day of April, 2006 in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and control METHYLAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Shabu) weighing 0.19 gram, 0.22 gram &amp; 0.20 gram when subjected [to] chemistry examination gave positive result of METHYLAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Although these charges were anchored on a single incident, the two sets of Information were raffled separately. Criminal Case No. C-74987 was raffled to Branch 123, while Criminal Case No. C-74988 was raffled to Branch 127.<br><br>On separate arraignments, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated January 23, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the consolidation of these cases was ordered. Thereafter, a joint trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>As succinctly summarized by the RTC, the version of the prosecution is as follows:<br><blockquote>On April 1, 2006, Col. Cuaton, Chief of the SAID SOU of the Caloocan City Police Station, acting on the information furnished by their confidential informant that an alias Gagay was engaged in illegal drug activities at 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> street, Caloocan City, ordered that a buy bust team be formed to conduct an operation against the said person.<br><br>Accordingly, the team was formed composed of PO3 Valderama, PO3 Modina, PO3 Galvez, PO1 Rosales and PO1 Montefrio. PO1 Montefrio was designated as the poseur buyer who received two (2) P100 bills as buy bust money pre-dusted with ultra violet powder. On the other hand, PO3 Pagsolingan and the rest of the team were designated as backÂ­ups.<br><br>Having agreed on what the signal would be once the same is consummated and after securing a Pre-Operation Report from the PDEA, the team then proceeded to the target place at 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> avenue, 7<sup>th</sup> street, Caloocan City. Upon their arrival and upon seeing alias Gagay, the latter was introduced by the informant to Montefrio who immediately announced his intention to buy <i>shabu</i>. Alias Gagay then asked Montefrio how much. In response, Montefrio said "two hundred pesos" and simultaneously handed the money to alias Gagay, the accused herein. Upon receipt of the money, the accused took from his pocket a plastic sachet from which he pulled one plastic sachet which he gave to PO1 Montefrio who thereafter gave the pre-arranged signal. Thereafter, he arrested the accused and introduced himself as a police officer and recovered the buy bust money from the hand of the accused.<br><br>Upon seeing the pre-arranged signal, Pagsolingan ran towards the accused and Montefrio in order to arrest the former. Having been told by Montefrio that there were still other sachets in the pocket of the.accused, Pagsolingan ordered the latter to empty his pocket. As a result, Pagsolingan recovered three more plastic sachets from the accused.<br><br>The police officers then brought the accused to their office where they turned him over together with the recovered evidence to the investigator, PO2 Randulfo Hipolito. Upon receipt of the evidence, PO2 Randulfo Hipolito marked the evidence that he received from PO1 Montefrio as EBF-1 Buy Bust 04-01-06. On the other hand, the evidence that PO3 Pagsolingan recovered were marked as EBF-2, EBF-3 and EBF-4. Thereafter, the investigator prepared a letter addressed to the Crime Laboratory Office requesting that the buy bust <i>shabu</i> as well as the specimen recovered from the accused be subjected to laboratory examination to determine whether they contained Methylamphetamine hydrochloride. The investigator likewise prepared a letter request for the detection of ultra violet powder on the persons of the accused, the poseur buyer, PO1 Montefrio as well as on the two P100 bills.<br><br>Upon receipt of the Letter Request from the DAID-SOTG, Police Senior Inspector Jesse de la Rosa, conducted an examination on the specimen contained in four plastic sachets pre-marked with EBF-1 Buy Bust 4-01-06 to EBF-4. His examination gave positive results to the test of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. He reduced his findings into writing contained in Physical Science Report D-167-06.<br><br>He also received a request for the detection of ultra violet powder on the living persons of the accused and of PO1 Montefrio as well as the money that was used in the buy-bust operation. His examination gave positive result for the presence of ultra violet powder on the palmar portion of both hands of the accused and of PO1 Montefrio as well as the buy bust money. His findings were contained in PSR No. PI-003-06.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The defense's version, on the other hand, is as follows:<br><blockquote>Accused Edgar Bolo testified that on March 31, 2006 at around 8:30 pm, he was at 7<sup>th</sup> St.[,] 11<sup>th</sup> Ave.[,] Caloocan City. He was fetched by his friends at the "saklaan" and one of them is Gil. They invited him to attend the graduation of Gil's child for thanksgiving at 11th Ave.[,] 7<sup>th</sup> Street, Caloocan City. At the house of Gil, while they were having drinking session, more than ten policemen arrived and introduced themselves as such and frisked them. Then the policemen left and proceeded to another alley where there were also people drinking. He identified one of them as SPO1 Moran. He knew him because he gives money when he goes to the "saklaan." As he was leaving the place, he was accompanied by a lady friend. Upon reaching 7<sup>th</sup> St., the lady friend looked back and saw four male persons coming towards them. When he also looked back, he saw them holding clubs and pipes. Upon seeing them, he ran towards 6<sup>th</sup> St. [W]hile running, he shouted for help. He was blocked on his way [by] an owner type jeep from where SPO1 Moran alighted, pointing a gun at him. He was brought to Sangandaan. He asked them what was his violation, but they did not answer. It was only when he was inquested that he knew of his violation which is Section 5 and Section 11 of RA 9165. Then he had his medical check up. While he was handcuffed, PO1 Montefrio wiped both his hands and his pockets with marked money.<br><br>Janet de Vera testified that on March 31, 2006 at around 8:30, she was invited by a friend to attend a graduation celebration. At the celebration, accused was also one of the visitors. When she decided to go home, accused was also on his way home and asked her where he could take a ride in going home.<br><br>Both of them then left the place. On their way home, she looked back and sensed that there were male persons who were following them. She told the accused on what she noticed. Accused also looked back and confirmed that they were being followed. She told the accused to run and the latter ran towards 12<sup>th</sup> Avenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>After weighing the evidence, the RTC convicted accused-appellant on both charges. The RTC held that the presence of ultraviolet powder on both hands of the accused established that a buy-bust transaction took place. It also accorded full faith and credence to the testimonies of Police Officer 1 Rolly Jones Montefrio (PO1 Montefrio) and PO3 Rodrigo Pagsolingan (PO3 Pagsolingan) as there were no imputations of any evil or improper motives on their persons. Also, it ruled that the specimens recovered from accused-appellant were the same items turned over to the investigator and then to the forensic chemist, and which were found to be <i>shabu</i>. The RTC then concluded that, as against the overwhelming pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution, the defenses of denial and frame-up raised by accused-appellant did not inspire belief.<br><br>The RTC then convicted accused-appellant in this manner:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1.)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">In Crim.

The Court of Appeals found that there was no break in the chain of custody of the confiscated drugs; thus, the integrity and the evidentiary value of the same were preserved and established before the RTC. The appellate court also ruled that the testimony of PO1 Montefrio clearly established the elements for accused-appellant's violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, and that there was no reason to doubt PO1 Montefrio's testimony.<br><br>As such, the Court of Appeals held:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed Decision dated 21 October 2008 of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 123[,] is hereby <b>AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i></b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant is now before the Court, seeking a review of his conviction. In his Brief, accused-appellant claims that the failure of the arresting police officers to comply with Section 21, Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165, specifically on the requirements of markings, physical inventory and photographs, translates to their failure to preserve the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> especially since the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses failed to establish the chain of custody of the seized drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Also, accused-appellant questions the authenticity of the ultraviolet dusting of the buy-bust money in light of the possible contamination of such as the police officers surrendered said dusted money without first placing them in a sealed envelope or container. Accused-appellant then intimates on the possibilities that the dusting was done only after he was arrested and that he was deliberately forced to hold the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>We dismiss the appeal.<br><br>Indeed, as we held in <i>People v. Torres</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> - <br><blockquote>The identity of the prohibited drug must be proved with moral certainty. It must also be established with the same degree of certitude that the substance bought or seized during the buy-bust operation is the same item offered in court as exhibit. In this regard, paragraph 1, Section 21, Article II of [R.A.] No. 9165 (the chain of custody rule) provides for safeguards for the protection of the identity and [the] integrity of dangerous drugs seized, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>However, "this Court has, in many cases, held that while the chain of custody should ideally be perfect, in reality it is not, 'as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.' The most important factor is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items as they will be used to determine the guilt or [the] innocence of the accused. Hence, the prosecution's failure to submit in evidence the physical inventory and photograph of the seized drugs[,] as required under [Section] 21 [Article II of the IRR] of [R.A.] No. 9165, will not render the accused's arrest illegal or the items seized from [him] inadmissible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The chain of custody is not established solely by compliance with the prescribed physical inventory and photographing of the seized drugs in the presence of the enumerated persons. The IRR of R.A. No. 9165 on the handling and disposition of seized dangerous drugs states:<br><blockquote><i>Provided, further</i>, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, PO1 Montefrio and PO3 Pagsolingan testified that, after one of the subject sachets was seized by PO1 Montefrio during the buy-bust operation and after the three other subject sachets were seized by PO3 Pagsolingan during the arrest, both of them turned over the seized items to PO2 Randulfo Hipolito (PO2 Hipolito) at the police station. PO2 Hipolito then testified that he received and marked the seized items (EBF-1 BB 04-01-06 for the sachet seized by PO1 Montefrio, and EBF-2 to EBF-4 for the sachets recovered by PO3 Pagsolingan), and that he brought them to Police Senior Inspector Jesse dela Rosa<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (PSI Dela Rosa), a forensic chemist. PSI Dela Rosa then testified that he received the seized items, that he conducted a qualitative examination on said items, and that his examination confirmed that the seized items were positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride. In open court, PO1 Montefrio, PO3 Pagsolingan, PO2 Hipolito, and PSI Dela Rosa were able to identify the seized items as those confiscated from accused-appellant, as the sachets still bore the markings inscribed by PO2 Hipolito.<br><br>Although the seized items were marked only at the police station and not during the actual apprehension and seizure, in <i>People v. Loks</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we held that the "marking of the seized [substance] immediately upon xxx arrival at the police station qualified as a compliance with the marking requirement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>"Clearly, there was no hiatus or confusion in the confiscation, handling, custody [,] and examination of the <i>shabu</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The sachets of <i>shabu</i> that were seized from accused-appellant, taken to the police station and thereat marked, then taken to the crime laboratory and subjected to a qualitative examination, and thereafter introduced as evidence against accused-appellant were the same sachets of <i>shabu</i> confiscated from him during the buy-bust operation and his arrest.<br><br>We now address the issue of whether all the elements of the crimes charged were duly proven.<br><br>In <i>People v. Gaspar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court held that -<br><blockquote>In a successful prosecution for offenses involving the illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of [R.A. No.] 9165, the following elements must concur: (1) the identities of the buyer and [the] seller, object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for it. What is material is proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The concurrence of these elements can be gleaned from the testimony of PO1 Montefrio:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Then what happened after that?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">We approached the suspect, Ma'am.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">You said we, are you trying to tell us that the informer went with you when you approached the suspect?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes Ma'am.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">Did you reach the suspect?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Yes Ma'am.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify"> What happened next?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify"> We told him [of] our intention to buy, Ma'am.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">How did the suspect respond?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">He asked us how much, Ma'am.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">With whom exactly was the suspect talking, to you or to the informer?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">To both of us.

elements for a conviction of illegal sale of dangerous or prohibited drugs were proven by the prosecution: PO1 Montefrio proved that a buy-bust operation actually took place, and that during said operation, accused-appellant delivered a small plastic sachet to him in exchange for P200.00. PO1 Montefrio retained possession of the sachet until he reached the police station where he turned it over to PO2 Hipolito who, in turn, marked it with accused-appellant's initials and the buy-bust date (EBF-1 BB 04-01-06). PO2 Hipolito then turned over the sachet to PSI Dela Rosa who confirmed that the substance in the sachet was <i>shabu</i>. In open court, PO1 Montefrio was able to identify accused-appellant as the one who sold him the plastic sachet, and he was also able to identify said sachet because of the markings.<br><br>On the other hand, in <i>People of the Philippines v. Amy Dasigan y Oliva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that "[u]nder Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the elements of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, all these elements were proven. First, the three plastic sachets containing <i>shabu</i>, which were the subjects of the charge for illegal possession of dangerous or prohibited drugs, were seen by PO1 Montefrio and found on accused-appellant's person by PO3 Pagsolingan following accused-appellant's arrest in <i>flagrante delicto</i> for the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>. Second, accused-appellant was not able to establish his legal authority to possess the said <i>shabu</i>. And third, accused-appellant's act of giving PO1 Montefrio, the poseur-buyer, one sachet and, in the process, bringing out three more sachets indicated that he freely and consciously possessed the said <i>shabu</i>. Moreover, as testified to by PO3 Pagsolingan, after he recovered the three sachets from accused-appellant, he kept them until he turned them over to PO2 Hipolito at the police station. PO2 Hipolito then marked them (EBF-2, EBF-3 and EBF-4) and turned them over to PSI Dela Rosa who attested that the substance inside the subject sachets was <i>shabu</i>. Consequently, accused-appellant was rightfully convicted of illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>As to accused-appellant's intimation of the possibilities that the police officers conducted the dusting of ultraviolet powder only after accused-appellant was arrested, and that the latter was deliberately forced to hold the same, such claim is speculative and unsupported by any shred of evidence. Contrasted with the testimony of PO1 Montefrio that the buy-bust money was already dusted with ultraviolet powder prior to the buy-bust operation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> accused-appellant's suggestion does not inspire belief.<br><br>In <i>People v. Ting Uy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court explains that "credence shall be given to the narration of the incident by prosecution witnesses especially so when they are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there be evidence to the contrary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In the case at bar, accused-appellant failed to adduce any evidence showing that the police officers harbored ill motives as to falsely incriminate him.<br><br>Under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the penalty for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, regardless of its quantity and purity, is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00. As the penalty imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the Court of Appeals is within the prescribed range, the Court affirms the imposition of life imprisonment and the fine of P1,000,000.00.<br><br>As for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>, Section 11(3), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 provides that if the <i>shabu</i> is less than five grams, then the penalty is imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years plus a fine ranging from P300,000.00 to P400,000.00. In the case at bar, as the total weight of the subject <i>shabu</i> is 0.61 gram or less than five grams, and as the penalty imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the Court of Appeals is also within the prescribed range, the Court affirms the imposition of imprisonment from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to thirteen (13) years and eight (8) months and the fine of P300,000.00.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the present appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
