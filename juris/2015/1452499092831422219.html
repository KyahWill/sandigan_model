The Court of Appeals found that the Regional Director resolved respondent Nationwide Security and Allied Services' Motion for Reconsideration without giving the adverse parties, petitioners Alejandro Ceprado, Jr., Ronilo Sebial, Nicanor Olivar, Alvin Villegas, and Edgar Manato (Ceprado, et. al), their opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Nationwide Security and Allied Services, Inc. (Nationwide Security) is a security agency with Romeo T.

He directed Nationwide Security and Uniden to solidarity pay 40 security personnel the aggregate amount of P1,600,134.40 representing wage differentials and other salary-related benefits, with each security personnel receiving P40,003.36.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Failure to pay the required amount within 10 calendar days, according to the Regional Director, would result in Nationwide Security and/or Uniden paying double indemnity pursuant to Republic Act No. 8188.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Nationwide Security filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that its liability with Uniden is merely joint and not solidary, Uniden being the principal client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Regional Director Martinez heard Nationwide Security's Motion for Reconsideration and directed the company to submit payrolls and daily time records covering the period from November 17, 1998 to November 16, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Nationwide Security subsequently filed a Manifestation, contending for the first time that the Regional Office had no jurisdiction over the case. Citing Article 129 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which limited the jurisdiction of the Regional Director over money claims amounting to P5,000.00 or less, Nationwide Security argued that the Regional Director had no authority to order the payment of P1,600,134.40. Nationwide Security also alleged that some of the security personnel had already received the wage differentials as evidenced by quitclaims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, five (5) of the security personnel—namely: Alejandro Ceprado, Jr., Ronilo Sebial, Nicanor Olivar, Alvin Villegas, and Edgar Manato—filed before the National Labor Relations Commission Regional Arbitration Branch No. IV a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> for illegal dismissal. They alleged that Nationwide Security terminated their employment when they "persisted in seeking enforcement of the awards under the April 19, 2001 [O]rder."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Acting on the Motion for Reconsideration previously filed by Nationwide Security, Regional Director Martinez reversed his April 19, 2001 Order in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated May 8, 2002. He ruled that the jurisdictional amount in Article 129 of the Labor Code had already been repealed by Republic Act No. 7730.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> With respect to the alleged violations of Nationwide Security, Regional Director Martinez found that they had already been rectified. The wage differentials due to the security personnel were likewise recomputed. Specifically for Ceprado, Jr. et al., Regional Director Martinez ruled that they were collectively entitled to P46,218.10 representing the wage differentials and other benefits due them:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="center">NAMES </div></td><td style="text-align: center;" width="20%">AMOUNT</td><td width="60%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>1.

They alleged that upon verification of case records, Nationwide Security and Uniden neither appealed nor filed a motion for reconsideration of the April 19, 2001 Order. Thus, the April 19, 2001 Order already became final and executory and may no longer be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Former Secretary of Labor and Employment Patricia A. Sto. Tomas (Secretary Sto. Tomas) received a copy of Ceprado, Jr. et al.'s Letter on May 30, 2002. She treated the Letter as an appeal and, in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated March 12, 2003, set aside Regional Director Martinez's Resolution dated May 8, 2002. According to Secretary Sto. Tomas, Ceprado, Jr. et al. were not notified of the proceedings subsequent to the issuance of the April 19, 2001 Order. Thus, they were deprived of their right to due process, rendering the Resolution dated May 8, 2002 null and void.<br><br>With no motion for reconsideration having been filed by Nationwide or Uniden, the Order dated March 12, 2003 was deemed final and executory on April 28, 2003. An Entry of Judgment was, thus, issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Regional Office issued a Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> to implement the Order dated March 12, 2003. The aggregate amount payable to Ceprado, Jr. et al. was recomputed to P400,033.60, inclusive of the penalties provided under Republic Act No. 8188.<br><br>A Motion to Quash and Recall Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was filed by Nationwide Security. It argued that the Order dated March 12, 2003 was null and void, having been rendered without proof of service on the company of Ceprado, Jr. et al.'s Letter-Appeal to Secretary Sto. Tomas. It added that it already paid Ceprado, Jr. et al. P46,218.10 as required in the April 19, 2001 Order. Therefore, there was nothing left to execute.<br><br>Still, in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated March 23, 2004, Secretary Sto. Tomas denied the Motion to Quash and Recall Writ of Execution, ruling that there was no denial of due process. According to the Secretary, the findings in the Notice of Inspection Results have long become final and executory. Consequently, the issuance of a Writ of Execution was in order.<br><br>Nationwide Security filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which former Acting Secretary of Labor and Employment Manuel G. Imson denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated July 19, 2004.<br><br>Alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Labor and Employment, Nationwide Security filed a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> before the Court of Appeals. It argued that Secretary Sto. Tomas' Order dated March 12, 2003, which treated Ceprado, Jr. et al.'s Letter dated May 27, 2002 as an appeal and subsequently granted it, was null and void for lack of due process. Nationwide Security was allegedly not furnished a copy of the Letter-Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, it was deprived of the opportunity to file a reply or opposition as provided under Rule IV, Section 4(b) of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Worse, Nationwide Security already paid the judgment amount of P46,218.10 as ordered in the Resolution dated May 8, 2002. The payment was evidenced by Official Receipt No. 2396419 issued by the Regional Office as proof of compliance with the Resolution. It was, therefore, grave abuse of discretion for the Regional Office to issue a Writ of Execution to implement the Order dated March 12, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals granted Nationwide Security's Petition for Certiorari upon finding that Nationwide Security filed its Motion for Reconsideration before Regional Director Martinez without furnishing Ceprado, et al. a copy of the Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It likewise found that Ceprado, et al. filed their Letter-Appeal before the Department of Labor and Employment without furnishing Nationwide Security a copy of the Letter-Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the Court of Appeals voided for lack of due process both the Regional Director's Resolution dated May 8, 2002 granting Nationwide Security's Motion for Reconsideration and the Department of Labor and Employment's Order dated March 12, 2003 granting Ceprado, et al.'s appeal. The Court of Appeals likewise voided the Department of Labor and Employment's Order dated March 23, 2004 denying the Motion to Quash and Recall Writ of Execution, as well as the Order dated July 19, 2004 denying Nationwide Security's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated September 12, 2006, the Court of Appeals set aside the Resolution dated May 8, 2002, the Order dated March 12, 2003, the Order dated March 23, 2004, and the Order dated July 19, 2004. It remanded the case to the Regional Director "for action on the motion for reconsideration and/or appeal filed by [Nationwide Security], with prior notice to and opportunity to be heard on the part of [Ceprado, et al.], subject to further proceedings as the rules and the circumstances may warrant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Ceprado, et al. filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated October 30, 2006.<br><br>Assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision and Resolution, Ceprado, et al. filed before this court their Petition for Review on Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Nationwide Security filed its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> after which Ceprado, et al. filed their Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioners Alejandro Ceprado, Jr., Ronilo Sebial, Nicanor Olivar, Alvin Villegas, and Edgar Manato allege that respondent Nationwide Security and Allied Services, Inc. failed to file an appeal of the Department of Labor and Employment's Order dated March 12, 2003 within the reglementary period. Therefore, the Order had already become final and executory, and the Court of Appeals erred in setting it aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As for respondent Nationwide Security and Allied Services, it alleges that petitioners Ceprado, et. al deprived it of its right to due process when the latter failed to furnish it a copy of their Letter-Appeal to the Department of Labor and Employment. Considering that any judgment rendered without due process is null and void, the Order dated March 12, 2003 was, likewise, null and void. Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err in setting aside the Order dated March 12, 2003 and the subsequent Orders implementing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The sole issue for our resolution is whether the Department of Labor and Employment's Orders dated March 12, 2003, March 23, 2004, and July 19, 2004 are void.<br><br><i>We grant the Petition</i>.<br><br>This case is a labor standards case involving "the minimum requirements prescribed by existing laws, rules and regulations and other issuances relating to wages, hours of work, cost of living allowances and other monetary and welfare benefits, including those set by occupational safety and health standards."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> When this case was commenced, the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices governed labor inspections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Rule II, Section 19 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices allows an aggrieved party to file a motion for reconsideration of the Order of the Regional Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In this case, respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Regional Director Martinez's April 19, 2001 Order.<br><br>However, as found by the Department of Labor and Employment and the Court of Appeals, respondent failed to furnish petitioners a copy of its Motion for Reconsideration. This is contrary to Rule II, Section 12 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which requires parties to comply with due process requirements.<br><br>The Rules of Court, which applies suppletorily in labor standards cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> requires a written notice of every motion for reconsideration to be served on the adverse party as compliance with the requirement of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Motions for reconsideration not served on the other party are <i>pro</i> <i>forma</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and are "mere scrap[s] of paper"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> not to be acted upon by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Motions for reconsideration not served on the other party do not toll the running of the reglementary period for filing an appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and the judgment sought to be reconsidered becomes final and executory upon lapse of the reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>As respondent failed to furnish petitioners a copy of its Motion for Reconsideration of the April 19, 2001 Order, Regional Director Martinez had no jurisdiction to act on the Motion for Reconsideration. The Resolution dated May 8, 2002 granting the Motion for Reconsideration is null and void for want of jurisdiction.<br><br>Moreover, the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration did not toll the running of the seven-day reglementary period under Rule II, Section 19 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices. Thus, the April 19, 2001 Order became final and executory after seven (7) days from the filing of the Motion, i.e., on May 16, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly set aside all the orders subsequent to the April 19, 2001 Order, specifically: the Regional Director's Resolution dated May 8, 2002 granting respondent's Motion for Reconsideration; the Department of Labor and Employment's Order dated March 12, 2003 granting petitioners' appeal; the Order dated March 23, 2004 denying the Motion to Quash and Recall Writ of Execution; and the Order dated July 19, 2004 denying respondent's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>However, the Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case to the Regional Director for further proceedings on the Motion for Reconsideration. The proper course of action is to issue a writ of execution to implement the April 19, 2001 Order.<br><br>Further, we note that similar to respondent, petitioners violated the requirements of due process. They never denied that they failed to furnish respondent a copy of their Letter-Appeal to the Secretary of Labor. Worse, their appeal did not strictly comply with the rules on appeal as provided in the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices.<br><br>Appeal is a purely statutory privilege that "may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> If an appellate court or tribunal takes cognizance of an appeal that does not comply with the rules, the appellate court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The decision on the appeal is null and void.<br><br>Rule IV, Section 3 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices requires that "[t]he appeal [to the Secretary of Labor] ... be filed in five (5) legibly typewritten copies with the Regional Office which issued the Order." Section 4 adds that the appeal "shall be accompanied by a Memorandum of Appeal which shall state the date appellant received the Order and the grounds relied upon and arguments in support thereof[.]"<br><br>These provisions use "shall," indicating that these rules are mandatory and compulsory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> To perfect an appeal, it is the appellant's duty to submit a memorandum of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Throughout the proceedings in this case, petitioners never disputed that they merely filed a letter before Secretary Sto. Tomas to set aside Regional Director Martinez's Resolution dated May 8, 2002. They did not avail themselves of the proper appeal pleading—a memorandum of appeal filed before the Department of Labor and Employment.<br><br>Secretary Sto. Tomas, thus, acted without jurisdiction in treating petitioners' Letter dated May 27, 2002 as an appeal. Although the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices provide that the rules "shall be liberally construed,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> still, courts and tribunals are "limited by the legislative will and intent, <i>as expressed in the law itself</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In this case, the law consists of rules issued under the quasi-legislative power delegated by the legislative branch to the Secretary of Labor and Employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The Secretary of Labor should have strictly followed the rules on appeal under the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices.<br><br>In any case, the April 19, 2001 Order is already final and executory and may no longer be disturbed.
