This conclusion was based on its finding that there was no effort on Gilbert’s part to collect any rental payments from Robert and Gil for more or less six (6) years and that it was only upon the filing of the said complaint that Gilbert wanted them ejected. Accordingly, it sustained Robert and Gil’s assertion that the undated lease contract was a mere formality so as to comply with the requirement of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) in order to install a lottery outlet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Separately, the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab opined that <u>granting <i>arguendo</i></u> that the lease contract is not simulated, the dismissal of Gilbert’s complaint was still in order on the ground of improper venue given that the parties expressly agreed that any dispute arising from the same shall be brought before the courts of Davao City only, to the exclusion of other courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which does not obtain in this case.<br><br>Dissatisfied, Gilbert moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 20, 2006, considering that it was a prohibited pleading under the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure.<br><br>On August 8, 2006, an Entry of Final Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> was issued certifying that the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision had already become <b>final and executory on March 20, 2006</b>.<br><br><b><center>The MTCC-Davao City Proceedings<br>in Civil Case No. 19,590-B-06<br></center></b><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, on November 13, 2006, Gilbert, together with his spouse Analyn dela Llana (respondents), filed a second complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> for unlawful detainer, damages, and attorney’s fees (<b>second ejectment complaint</b>) against Robert and his wife Nenita de Leon (petitioners), also grounded on petitioners’ failure to pay rent under the undated lease contract, but this time, before the <b>Municipal Trial Court in Cities of Davao City, Branch 2 (MTCC-Davao City)</b>, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 19,590-B-06</b>.

Nevertheless, it opined that even assuming that said contract was simulated, Robert’s actions showed that he clearly recognized Gilbert as the administrator of the subject property. Further, it debunked petitioners’ claim of ownership over their occupied portion, considering that title over the subject property was registered under Gilbert’s name which thus could not be subjected to a collateral attack. Lastly, it ruled that even without the contract of lease, the complaint could still prosper given that petitioners’ occupancy may be regarded as one of tolerance, and, thus, their occupation becomes unlawful upon demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 32,003-07.<br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated June 11, 2009, the RTC reversed and set aside the MTCC-Davao City ruling, and ordered the dismissal of the second ejectment complaint since the venue was improperly laid. It held that venue for real actions does not admit of any exceptions, stating that the proper venue for forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases is the municipal trial court of the municipality or city where said property is situated, which in this case, should be the Municipal Trial Court of Nabunturan, Compostela Valley Province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Relative thereto, it enunciated that the parties’ stipulation on venue as found in their undated lease contract could not be enforced, considering that the cause of action herein is not one for breach of contract or specific performance, but for unlawful detainer whose venue was specifically provided for by the Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondents moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated March 1, 2010.

To explicate, this pronouncement was made in reference to the cause of action raised in the first ejectment complaint – that is, the alleged breach of the same lease contract due to non-payment of rent. Therefore, to find that the said contract was simulated and thereby non-binding negates the cause of action raised in the said complaint, hence, resulting in its dismissal.<br><br>By resolving the substantive issue therein – that is, the right of Gilbert to recover the <i>de facto </i>possession of the subject property arising from&nbsp; Robert’s breach of the undated lease contract – the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision should be properly considered as a judgment on the merits. In <i>Allied Banking Corporation v. CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> citing <i>Escarte v. Office of the President,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court defined “judgment on the merits” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>As a technical legal term, ‘merits’ has been defined in law dictionaries as a matter of substance in law, as distinguished from matter of form, and as the real or substantial grounds of action or defense, in contradistinction to some technical or collateral matter raised in the course of the suit. A judgment is upon the merits when it amounts to a declaration of the law to the respective rights and duties of the parties, based upon the ultimate fact or state of facts disclosed by the pleadings and evidence, and upon which the right of recovery depends, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objectives or contentions.</blockquote><br>Simply stated, a judgment on the merits is one wherein there is an unequivocal determination of the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the causes of action and the subject matter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> such as the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision which had resolved the substantive issue in Civil Case No. 821 as above-explained. Contrary to respondents’ stance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> said Decision was not premised on a mere technical ground, particularly, on improper venue. This is evinced by the qualifier “<i>granting arguendo</i>” which opens the discussion thereof, to show that the first ejectment complaint would, according to the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab, have been dismissed on improper venue notwithstanding the undated lease contract’s simulated character.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Importantly, the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision in <b>Civil Case No. 821</b> had already attained finality on March 20, 2006 as per an Entry of Final Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated August 8, 2006. Thereafter, or on November 13, 2006, Gilbert (now joined by his wife, Analyn) filed a second ejectment complaint before the MTCC-Davao City, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 19,590-B-06</b>, again against the same party, Robert (now joined by his wife, Nenita), involving the <b>same subject matter,</b> <i>i.e.</i>, the leased portion of Gilbert’s 541 square-meter property situated in Poblacion, Nabunturan, Compostela Valley Province, and the <b>same cause of action,</b> <i>i.e.</i>, Robert’s (and Gil’s, now Analyn’s) ejectment thereat due to Robert’s alleged breach of their undated lease contract for non-payment of rentals.<br><br>With the <b>identity of the parties, subject matter, and cause of action</b> between <b>Civil Case Nos. 821</b> and <b>19,590-B-06</b>, it cannot thus be seriously doubted that the final and executory judgment in the first case had already barred the resolution of the second. <i>Res judicata, </i>which, to note, was raised by petitioners at the earliest opportunity, <i>i.e</i>., in their answer to the second ejectment complaint,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> but was ignored by the MTCC-Davao City, the RTC, and the CA, therefore obtains in their favor. Consequently, the instant petition should be granted.<br><br>The Court must, however, clarify that <i>res judicata </i>only applies in reference to the cause of action raised by Gilbert in both ejectment complaints – that is, his entitlement to the <i>de facto </i>possession of the subject property <u>based on breach of contract (due to non-payment of rent)</u>, which was resolved to be simulated and, hence, non-binding. Accordingly, any subsequent ejectment complaint raising a different cause of action – say for instance, recovery of <i>de facto</i> possession grounded on tolerance (which was, by the way, not duly raised by the respondents in this case and, therefore, improperly taken cognizance of the MTCC-Davao City in its ruling<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>) – is not barred by the Court’s current disposition. In effect, the dismissal of the second ejectment complaint, by virtue of this Decision, is without prejudice to the filing of another ejectment complaint grounded on a different cause of action, albeit involving the same parties and subject matter.<br><br>As a final point of concern, the Court deems it apt to correct the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s characterization of the simulated character of the undated lease contract, which, to note, stands as a mere error in terminology that would not negate the granting of the present petition on the ground of <i>res judicata.</i> Properly speaking, the contract, as gathered from the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s ratiocination, should be considered as an absolutely and not a relatively simulated contract. The distinction between the two was discussed in Heirs of Intac v. CA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Articles 1345 and 1346 of the Civil Code provide:<br><blockquote>Art. 1345. Simulation of a contract may be absolute or relative. The former takes place when the parties do not intend to be bound at all; the latter, when the parties conceal their true agreement.<br><br>Art. 1346. An absolutely simulated or fictitious contract is void. A relative simulation, when it does not prejudice a third person and is not intended for any purpose contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy binds the parties to their real agreement.</blockquote>If the parties state a false cause in the contract to conceal their real agreement, the contract is only relatively simulated and the parties are still bound by their real agreement. Hence, where the essential requisites of a contract are present and the simulation refers only to the content or terms of the contract, the agreement is absolutely binding and enforceable between the parties and their successors in interest.<br><br><b>In absolute simulation, there is a colorable contract but it has no substance as the parties have no intention to be bound by it. “The main characteristic of an absolute simulation is that the apparent contract is not really desired or intended to produce legal effect or in any way alter the juridical situation of the parties.” “As a result, an absolutely simulated or fictitious contract is void, and the parties may recover from each other what they may have given under the contract.”</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The relevant portions of the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision read:<br><br><blockquote>On the issue that the contract is simulated, the [MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab] affords [Robert’s] counsel the benefit of doubt. The Court submits that the contract is relatively simulated for cogent reasons:<br><br>It tickles the [MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s] imagination why, despite the stark fact that [Robert and Gil have] failed to pay the agreed monthly rentals for more or less six (6) years, it was only upon the filing of the instant complaint that [Gilbert] wanted [Robert and Gil] ejected. In spite of the undeniable fact that [Robert and Gil have] failed to pay their monthly rentals, there was not any effort exerted by [Gilbert] to collect the same prior to the filing of the action.<br><br>Failure of other parties to demand performance of the obligation of the other for unreasonable length of time renders the contract ineffective x x x.<br><br>Now the [MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab] entertains the thought that the filing of the case at bench on March 7, 2005 was just a mere leverage or shall we say a cushion in view of [Fely de Leon’s] filing of the aforesaid civil case against [Gilbert] on June 28, 2004.<br><br>In a simulated contract, the parties do not intend to be bound by the same x x x.<br><br>The [MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab] is now inclined to toe the line of [Robert and Gil] that the execution of the contract was just a mere formality with the requirement of the PCSO for one to install or put up a lottery outlet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>As may be gleaned from the foregoing, it is quite apparent that the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab actually intended to mean that the undated lease contract subject of this case was absolutely simulated. Its pronouncement that the parties did not intend to be bound by their agreement is simply inconsistent with relative simulation. Note that regardless of the correctness of its ruling on the contract’s simulated character, the fact of the matter is that the same had already attained finality. As a result, the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab’s January 24, 2006 Decision bars any other action involving the same parties, subject matter, and cause of action, such as the second ejectment complaint.<br><br>Further, with the undated lease contract definitely settled as absolutely simulated, and hence, void, there can be no invocation of the exclusive venue stipulation on the part of either party; thus, the general rule on the filing of real actions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> in the court where the property is situated – as in the filing of the first ejectment complaint before the MCTC-Nabunturan-Mawab located in Compostela Valley same as the subject property of this case – prevails.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.
