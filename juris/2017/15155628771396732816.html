				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In every application for provisional injunctive relief, the applicant must establish the actual and existing right sought to be protected. The applicant must also establish the urgency of a writ's issuance to prevent grave and irreparable injury. Failure to do so will warrant the court's denial of the application. Moreover, the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction may be denied in the same summary hearing as the application for the issuance of the temporary restraining order if the applicant fails to establish requisites for the entitlement of the writ. <p> This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the October 22, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and June 25, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 112737. The assailed judgments found that the Regional Trial Court did not gravely abuse its discretion when it denied Evy Construction and Development Corporation's (Evy Construction) application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. This application sought to restrain the Register of Deeds from compelling Evy Construction to surrender its owner's copy of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 168590 and from further annotating encumbrances relative to a civil case between its predecessor-in-interest and a third party.</p><p> On September 4, 2007, Evy Construction purchased a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 134890 in Lipa, Batangas from Linda N. Ang (Ang) and Senen T. Uyan (Uyan). They executed a Deed of Absolute Sale, which was notarized on September 11, 2007.

It observed that the grounds raised already touched on the merits of its Complaint, resolution of which would amount to prejudgment of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals likewise pointed out that Evy Construction could still sue for damages if the trial court eventually finds that the sale of the property to Valiant was invalid.

Hence, this Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> was filed.</p><p> Petitioner argues that it was denied due process when its application for preliminary injunction was denied in the same summary proceeding as the denial of its application for a temporary restraining order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Petitioner likewise submits that it was entitled to the injunctive writ applied for since "real estate development is an industry built on trust and public perception."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It explains that the doubt cast by the auction sale and its annotation to the title caused investors to withdraw their investments from petitioner's housing development project, despite the expenses it already incurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> Petitioner avers that the issuance of an injunctive writ is necessary to prevent further damage since its "business reputation and goodwill as a real estate developer, once tarnished and sullied, cannot be restored."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It insists that respondent's indemnity bond in the amount of P745,700.00 was not only inadequate compared to petitioner's investment in the property; it was immaterial since it would be insufficient to restore buyer and investor confidence in the project or in petitioner's competence and reputation as a property developer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, respondent counters that the application for preliminary injunction was never actually set for hearing or resolved by the trial court; thus, it was misleading for petitioner to argue that it was denied due process by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It maintains that the Court of Appeals did not err in finding that petitioner failed to establish the requisites for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and that petitioner still had adequate remedies in the indemnity bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Respondent likewise reiterates the Court of Appeals' finding that petitioner already touches on the merits of its Complaint before the trial court, which effectively prejudges the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p> This Court is asked to resolve the following issues:</p><p> First, whether or not petitioner Evy Construction and Development Corporation was denied due process when its application for a writ of preliminary injunction was denied in the same proceeding as its application for a temporary restraining order; and </p><p> Second, whether or not the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner Evy Construction and Development Corporation's application for injunctive relief. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Injunction is defined as "a judicial writ, process or proceeding whereby a patty is ordered to do or refrain from doing a certain act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It may be filed as a main action before the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> or as a provisional remedy in the main action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <em>Bacolod City Water District v. Hon. Labayen</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> expounded: </p><blockquote> <p> The main action for injunction is distinct from the provisional or ancillary remedy of preliminary injunction which cannot exist except only as part or an incident of an independent action or proceeding. As a matter of course, in an action for injunction, the auxiliary remedy of preliminary injunction, whether prohibitory or mandatory, may issue. Under the law, the main action for injunction seeks a judgment embodying a final injunction which is distinct from, and should not be confused with, the provisional remedy of preliminary injunction, the sole object of which is to preserve the status quo until the merits can be heard. A preliminary injunction is granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order. It persists until it is dissolved or until the termination of the action without the court issuing a final injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner claims that it was denied due process when "no valid hearing for the application for preliminary injunction was ever set" by the trial court and it "was NOT even allowed to present its summary arguments and its witness in support of its application for a [temporary restraining order]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> A temporary restraining order may be issued <em>ex parte</em> "to preserve the status quo until the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction[,] which cannot be issued<em> ex parte</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Otherwise stated, a trial court may issue a temporary restraining order even without a prior hearing for a limited period of 72 hours "if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this instance, a summary hearing, separate from the application of the preliminary injunction, is required only to determine if a 72-hour temporary restraining order should be extended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> A trial court may also issue <em>ex parte </em>a temporary restraining order for 20 days "[i]f it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The trial court has 20 days from its issuance to resolve the application for preliminary injunction. If no action is taken on the application for preliminary injunction during this period, the temporary restraining order is deemed to have expired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Notably, the Rules do not require that a hearing on the application for preliminary injunction be conducted during this period. </p><p> While Rule 58, Section 4(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> requires that the trial court conduct a summary hearing in every application for temporary restraining order regardless of a grant or denial, Rule 58, Section 5 requires a hearing only if an application for preliminary injunction is <em>granted</em>. Thus, Section 5 states that "[n]o preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined," Inversely stated, an application for preliminary injunction may be <em>denied</em> even without the conduct of a hearing separate from that of the summary hearing of an application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. </p><p> In this case, the November 9, 2009 hearing was denominated as a "hearing on the application for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Petitioner's counsel was allowed to present its arguments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and its witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> but conceded that the issues before the trial court were legal in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Thus, the trial court resolved that there was no need to present the witness, which petitioner's counsel accepted without objection: </p><blockquote> <p> COURT </p> <blockquote> <p>[T]he only issue now is purely legal, so there is no need to present your witness. </p> </blockquote> <p>ATTY. LIMBO </p> <blockquote> <p>Yes[.] Your Honor. </p> </blockquote> <p>COURT </p> <blockquote> <p>We are submitting the Motion for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order for resolution. </p> </blockquote> <p>ATTY. LIMBO </p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, Your Honor. </p> </blockquote> <p>COURT </p> <blockquote> <p>Alright, submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner cannot insist on a separate hearing for the application for preliminary injunction, considering that it accepted that its application would be submitted for decision without the presentation of its witness. The trial court did not find any need to conduct a further hearing on the application for preliminary injunction since petitioner was unable to substantiate its entitlement to a temporary restraining order. In any case, even if a separate hearing was granted, petitioner would have presented the same arguments and evidence in the November 9, 2009 hearing. Thus, there can be no denial of due process if the party alleging it has already been granted an opportunity to be heard. </p><p align="center"> <b>II.A</b> </p><p> Under Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, a preliminary injunction "is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts" or an order "requir[ing] the performance of a particular act or acts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is an ancillary relief granted by the court where the main action or proceeding is pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p> In order to be granted the writ, it must be established: </p><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="center">(a)</div></td> <td width="94%"> <div align="justify">That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is considered an "extraordinary event," being a "strong arm of equity or a transcendent remedy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, the power to issue the writ "should be exercised sparingly, with utmost care, and with great caution and deliberation.''<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> An injunctive writ is granted only to applicants with "actual and existing substantial rights"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> or rights<i> in esse</i>. Further, the applicant must show "that the invasion of the right is material and substantial and that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, the writ will not issue to applicants whose rights are merely contingent or to compel or restrain acts that do not give rise to a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> In this case, petitioner alleges that as the registered owner of the property covered by TCT No. 168590, "[i]t has the undeniable right to the full use and possession [of it]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> At the time of the sale between petitioner Evy Construction, Uyan, and Ang, TCT No. 134890 in Uyan's and Ang's names did not contain any liens or encumbrances, except for a notice of adverse claim by Ang dated January 21, 1999. However, petitioner admitted that while the Deed of Absolute Sale was executed on September 4, 2007, the property was only registered in its name on November 20, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The encumbrances in respondent's favor were annotated on September 18, 2007, October 2, 2007, and November 8, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> or when the property was still registered under Uyan's and Ang's names. </p><p> Under the Torrens system of registration, a person who deals with the registered owner of the property is not bound to look beyond the title for any liens or encumbrances that have not been annotated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> TCT No. 134890 did not contain a notice of<em> lis pendens</em> that could have warned petitioner that the property was under litigation. </p><p> The sale between petitioner Evy Construction, Uyan, and Ang was not annotated on TCT No. 134890 at the time of its sale. A sale of property that is not registered under the Torrens system is binding only between the buyer and the seller and does not affect innocent third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The Regional Trial Court could not have been faulted for ordering the annotation of the notice of levy on attachment on TCT No. 134890 considering that when the September 18, 2007 Order was issued, the property was still in Uyan's and Ang's names. </p><p> Thus, in determining whether or not petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief, the courts would have to pass upon the inevitable issue of which between petitioner and respondent has the better right over the property, the very issue to be resolved in the main case. </p><p> The facts of this case mirror that of<em> Spouses Chua v. Hon. Gutierrez</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> where this Court was confronted with the issue of whether or not a registered lien of attachment is superior to that of an unregistered deed of sale. In <em>Spouses Chua</em>, the property was already registered in the Spouses Chua's names when the property was levied. Thus, they argued that, not being the judgment debtors, the property should not have been subjected to an execution sale. </p><p> This Court found the argument unmeritorious and held: </p><blockquote> <p> [A] levy on attachment, duly registered, has preference over a prior unregistered sale and, even if the prior unregistered sale is subsequently registered before the sale on execution but after the levy is made, the validity of the execution sale should be upheld because it retroacts to the date of levy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The prior levy on attachment carries over to the new certificate of title, effectively placing the buyers in the position of their vendor under litigation. </p><p> However, <em>Spouses Chua</em> stated an exception in that "[k]nowledge of an unregistered sale is equivalent to registration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> If a party presents evidentiary proof that the judgment creditor had knowledge of a valid sale between the judgment debtor and an innocent third party, that knowledge would have the effect of registration on the judgment creditor. </p><p> As in <em>Spouses Chua</em>, respondent's attachment liens dated September 18, 2007, October 2, 2007, and November 8, 2007, if valid, may have been superior to whatever right petitioner may have acquired by virtue of the Deed of Absolute Sale, which was only registered on November 20, 2009. However, the validity of the liens and the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale are factual matters that have yet to be resolved by the trial court. The trial court must also determine whether or not respondent had prior knowledge of the sale. </p><p> Thus, no injunctive writ could be issued pending a final determination of petitioner's actual and existing right over the property. The grant of an injunctive writ could operate as a prejudgment of the main case. </p><p align="center"> <b>II.B </b> </p><p> Even assuming that there is already a final determination of petitioner's right over the property, petitioner still failed to prove the urgent and paramount necessity to enjoin the Register of Deeds from making<em> further</em> annotations on TCT No. 168590. </p><p> Petitioner prays for the issuance of an injunctive writ to prevent grave and irreparable damage to its reputation as a real estate developer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Indeed, injunctive relief could be granted to prevent grave and irreparable damage to a business entity's goodwill and business reputation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> Injury is considered irreparable if "there is no standard by which [its] amount can be measured with reasonable accuracy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The injury must be such that its pecuniary value cannot be estimated, and thus, cannot fairly compensate for the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> For this reason, the loss of goodwill and business reputation, being unquantifiable would be considered as grave and irreparable damage. </p><p> In<em> Yu v. Court of Appeals,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> this Court granted an exclusive distributor's prayer for an injunctive writ to prevent a competitor from selling the same product on the ground that the continued sale would "[render] illusory . . . the very purpose for which the exclusive distributorship was conceptualized, at the expense of the sole authorized distributor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> In <em>Semirara Coal Corporation v. HGL Development Corporation</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> this Court upheld the issuance of a writ of mandatory injunction to prevent Semirara Coal Corporation's (Semirara) continued intrusion on HGL Development Corporation's (HGL) property. It also found that Semirara damaged HGL's business standing when it prevented HGL from operating its cattle-grazing business on its property, which ''[was] perceived as an inability by HGL to comply with the demands of its customers and sow[ed] doubts in HGL's capacity to continue doing business."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> In <em>Philippine National Bank v. RJ Ventures Realty &amp; Development Corporation</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this Court affirmed the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the extrajudicial foreclosure of Rajah Broadcasting Network's radio equipment pending the resolution of the main case questioning the mortgage. This Court found that the foreclosure would stop the operations of Rajah Broadcasting Network's radio stations. The loss of its listenership and the damage to its image and reputation would not be quantifiable, and thus, would be irreparable. </p><p> However, in applications for provisional injunctive writs the applicant must also prove the <em>urgency </em>of the application. The possibility of a grave and irreparable injury must be established, at least tentatively to justify the restraint of the act complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It is "[a]s the term itself suggests. . . temporary, subject to the final disposition of the principal action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Its sole objective is "to preserve the status quo until the merits can be heard."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner alleges that the execution sale and the prior annotations on its title caused ''crucial investors and buyers"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> to withdraw, "notwithstanding the considerable costs and expenses [it] already incurred."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> This is the grave and irreparable damage it sought to be protected from. However, the feared "damage" was caused by the execution sale and the annotations already made on the title. It even admits that the annotations were "impairing the progress of [its] housing development."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79] </sup>In other words, petitioner failed to establish the urgent and paramount necessity of preventing <em>further</em> annotations on the title. </p><p> Thus, what petitioner actually seeks is the removal of the annotations on its title, which is precisely what it asked for in its Complaint for Quieting of Title/Removal of Cloud, Annulment of Execution Sale and Certificate of Sale, and Damages before the trial court. Injunctive relief would have no practical effect considering that the purported damage it seeks to be protected from has already been done. Therefore, its proper remedy is not the issuance of an injunctive writ but to thresh out the merits of its Complaint before the trial court. </p><p> In <em>Cortez-Estrada v. Heirs of Samut</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> this Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he grant or denial of a writ of preliminary injunction in a pending case rests in sound discretion of the court taking cognizance of the case since the assessment and evaluation of evidence towards that end involve findings of facts left to the said court for its conclusive determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The court's discretion is not interfered with unless there is a showing that the grant or denial was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><p> The trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, denied petitioner's application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction on the ground that petitioner would still have sufficient relief in its prayer for damages in its Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> In the event that the annotations on petitioner's title are found by the trial court to be invalid, petitioner would have adequate relief in the removal of the annotations and in the award of damages.
