CEPALCO contended that the Deed of Assignment was null and void for being absolutely simulated and, as a <i>dacion en pago</i>, it did not bear the conformity of the creditor. GHI and FPI have substantially the same directors. The Deed of Assignment was in fraud of FPFs creditors as it was made after the RTC-Pasig had already rendered a partial judgment in favor of CEPALCO and was, therefore, rescissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, the CA rendered its Decision dated August 14, 2008 in CA G.R.

The CA ruled that the RTC-CDO correctly found the existence of fraud or deliberate intent on the part of FPI and GHI to defraud CEPALCO. The agreement between GHI and FPI where GHI was given the option to operate the smelting facility using the alleged "Outokumpo" work process which FPI retained, subject to payment of an agreed amount to FPI as owner of the rights of the work process, was designed to keep the smelting facility intact and insulated against execution in satisfaction of CEPALCO's judgment credit. The CA also ruled that the Deed of Assignment was absolutely simulated and having been executed after the Partial Summary Judgment rendered by the RTC-Pasig, it was done in anticipation of the adverse final outcome of the RTC-Pasig case. Regarding GHI's contention that CEPALCO failed to pay the filing fees, the CA noted that CEPALCO filed its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Cross-claim on April 26, 2004. At that time, the CA reasoned that CEPALCO was not yet liable to pay filing fees. Under Rule 141, Section 7, as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, docket fees were required to be paid for compulsory counterclaims and cross-claims effective only on August 16, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.

At that time, CEPALCO was not yet liable to pay filing fees. The Supreme Court stressed, however, that effective 16 August 2004 under Rule 141, Section 7, as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, docket fees are required to be paid for compulsory counterclaims and cross-claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>As to the cause of action of GHI in its Complaint in Civil Case No. 2004-111 (RTC-CDO case), the caption states that it is for: "FOR INJUNCTION AND NULLIFICATION OF SHERIFF'S LEVY ON EXECUTION AND AUCTION SALE; RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF PROPERTIES; AND DAMAGES, WITH PRAYER FOR ISSUANCE OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In its second cause of action, GHI alleges that it is "entitled to the immediate return and restitution of said [transportation and] mobile equipment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In the Complaint's prayer, GHI seeks the return of the possession of such properties to GHI, "the rightful owner thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As basis of its claim of ownership, GHI alleges in the Complaint that:<br><blockquote>x x x The smelter facility/properties subject of sheriffs Notice of Levy Upon Personal Property and Notice of Levy Upon Real Property are owned by GHI, having acquired the same through a Deed of Assignment of March 11, 2003 executed by FPI in favor of GHI, in consideration of x x x [P]50,366,926.71 x x x paid by GHI. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>In light of the foregoing, CEPALCO's counterclaim and prayer for rescission of the Deed of Assignment can only be viewed, as it is indeed, a compulsory counterclaim because it "arises out of or is connected with the transaction or occurrence constituting the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Being a compulsory counterclaim, the CA was correct when it ruled that as of the filing of CEPALCO's Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Cross-Claim on April 26, 2004, it was not liable to pay filing fees on its compulsory counterclaim. Thus, on the first issue, the CA committed no reversible error when it did not order the dismissal of CEPALCO's counterclaim, which is compulsory, for non-payment of docket fees.<br><br><b><i>Efficacy of the Deed of Assignment</i></b><br><br>Since the second, third and fourth issues concern the legal effect or efficacy, if any, of the Deed of Assignment between GHI and FPI, they will be discussed together. It is noted, however, that the legality or efficacy of the Deed of Assignment is attacked in the second issue as being absolutely simulated, while, in the third and fourth issues, it is claimed to be rescissible for having been undertaken in fraud of creditors, given the presence of badges of fraud in its execution.<br><br>Under the Civil Code, there are four defective contracts, namely: (1) rescissible contracts; (2) voidable contracts; (3) unenforceable contracts; and (4) void or inexistent contracts. However, it has been opined that, strictly speaking, only the voidable and unenforceable contracts are defective contracts and are the only ones susceptible of ratification unlike the rescissible ones which suffer from no defect and the void or inexistent contracts which do not exist and are absolute nullity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, the four may be more appropriately categorized as species or forms of the inefficacy of contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Since the Deed of Assignment is being questioned for being both rescissible and, at the same time, an absolute simulation, it may be <i>apropos</i> to compare rescissible contracts with void or inexistent contracts.<br><br>Rescission has been defined as a remedy to make ineffective a contract validly entered into and which is obligatory under normal conditions by reason of external causes resulting in a pecuniary prejudice to one of the contracting parties or their creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Rescission, which is a specie or form of the inefficacy of contracts and operates by law and not through the will of the parties, requires the following: (1) a contract initially valid and (2) a lesion or pecuniary prejudice to someone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Under Article 1381 of the Civil Code, the following contracts are rescissible: (1) those which are entered into by guardians whenever the wards whom they represent suffer lesion by more than one-fourth of the value of the things which are the object thereof; (2) those agreed upon in representation of absentees, if the latter suffer the lesion stated in the preceding number; (3) those undertaken in fraud of creditors when the latter cannot in any manner collect the claims due them; (4) those which refer to things under litigation if they have been entered into by the defendant without the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of competent judicial authority; and (5) all other contracts specially declared by law to be subject to rescission.<br><br>It is further provided under Article 1383 that the action for rescission is a subsidiary one, and cannot thus be instituted except when the party suffering damage has no other legal means to obtain reparation for the same.<br><br>On the other hand, void or inexistent contracts are those which are <i>ipso jure</i> prevented from producing their effects and are considered as inexistent from the very beginning because of certain imperfections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Under Article 1409 of the Civil Code, the following contracts are inexistent and void from the beginning: (1) those whose cause, object or purpose is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy; (2) those which are absolutely simulated or fictitious; (3) those whose cause or object did not exist at the time of the transaction; (4) those whose object is outside the commerce of men; (5) those which contemplate an impossible service; (6) those where the intention of the parties relative to the principal object of the contract cannot be ascertained; and (7) those expressly prohibited or declared void by law.<br><br>These contracts cannot be ratified and the right to set up the defense of illegality cannot be waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Further, the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.<br><br>Rescission and nullity can be distinguished in the following manner: (a) by reason of the basis — rescission is based on prejudice, while nullity is based on a vice or defect of one of the essential elements of a contract; (2) by reason of purpose — rescission is a reparation of damages, while nullity is a sanction; (3) by reason of effects — rescission affects private interest while nullity affects public interest; (4) by reason of nature of action — rescission is subsidiary while nullity is a principal action; (5) by reason of the party who can bring action — rescission can be brought by a third person while nullity can only be brought by a party; and (6) by reason of susceptibility to ratification — rescissible contracts need not be ratified while void contracts cannot be ratified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>They can likewise be distinguished as follows: (1) as to defect: In rescissible contracts, there is damage or injury either to one of the contracting parties or to third persons; while in void or inexistent contracts, one or some of the essential requisites of a valid contract are lacking in fact or in law; (2) <i>As to effect</i>: The first are considered valid and enforceable until they are rescinded by a competent court; while the latter do not, as a general rule, produce any legal effect; (3) <i>As to prescriptibility of action or defense</i>: In the first, the action for rescission may prescribe; while in the latter, the action for declaration of nullity or inexistence or the defense of nullity or inexistence does not prescribe; (4) <i>As to susceptibility of ratification</i>: The first are not susceptible of ratification, but are susceptible of convalidation; while the latter are not susceptible of ratification; (5) <i>As to who may assail contracts</i>: The first may be assailed not only by a contracting party but even by a third person who is prejudiced or damaged by the contract; while the latter may be assailed not only by a contracting party but even by a third party whose interest is directly affected; (6) <i>As to how contracts may be assailed</i>: the first may be assailed directly, and not collaterally; while the latter may be assailed directly or collaterally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The enumerations and distinctions above indicate that rescissible contracts and void or inexistent contracts belong to two mutually exclusive groups. A void or inexistent contract cannot at the same time be a rescissible contract, and <i>vice versa</i>. The latter, being valid and until rescinded, is efficacious while the former is invalid. There is, however, a distinction between inexistent contracts and void ones as to their effects. Inexistent contracts produce no legal effect whatsoever in accordance with the principle "<i>quod nullum est nullum producit effectum</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In case of void contracts where the nullity proceeds from the illegality of the cause of object, when executed (and not merely executory) they have the effect of barring any action by the guilty to recover what he has already given under the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The RTC-CDO ruled the Deed of Assignment as a rescissible contract and ordered its rescission. However, the CA, while affirming the RTC-CDO Decision, stated that it "agree[d] with the RTC[-CDO] that the Deed of Assignment was absolutely simulated"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and, at the same time, noted that "the RTC-CDO correctly found the existence of fraud or deliberate intent on the part of FPI and GHI to defraud CEPALCO."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Unfortunately, however, and contrary to what the CA declared, nowhere is it ruled in the RTC-CDO Decision that the Deed of Assignment was absolutely simulated.<br><br>Given a seemingly conflicting finding or ruling by the RTC-CDO and the CA as to the classification of the Deed of Assignment — whether rescissible or inexistent, it behooves the Court to resolve the conflict.<br><br>Under Article 1345 of the Civil Code, simulation of a contract may be absolute, when the parties do not intend to be bound at all, or relative, when the parties conceal their true agreement. The former is known as <i>contracto simulado</i> while the latter is known as <i>contracto disimulado</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> An absolutely simulated or fictitious contract is void while a relatively simulated contract when it does not prejudice a third person and is not intended for any purpose contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy binds the parties to their real agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In <i>Vda. de Rodriguez v. Rodriguez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court, speaking through the renowned civilist, Justice J.B.L. Reyes, stated that:<br><blockquote>x x x the characteristic of simulation is the fact that the apparent contract is not really desired or intended to produce legal effects or in any way alter the juridical situation of the parties. Thus, where a person, in order to place his property beyond the reach of his creditors, simulates a transfer of it to another, he does not really intend to divest himself of his title and control of the property; hence, the deed of transfer is but a sham. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court, in <i>Heirs of Spouses Intac v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> reiterated that:<br><blockquote>In absolute simulation, there is a colorable contract but it has no substance as the parties have no intention to be bound by it. "The main characteristic of an absolute simulation is that the apparent contract is not really desired or intended to produce legal effect or in any way alter the juridical situation of the parties." "As a result, an absolutely simulated or fictitious contract is void, and the parties may recover from each other what they may have given under the contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>In the Deed of Assignment, did FPI intend to divest itself of its title and control of the properties assigned therein?<br><br>The lack of intention on the part of FPI to divest its ownership and control of "all of [its] properties, equipment and facilities, located in Phividec Industrial Estate, Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> — in spite of the wordings in the Deed of Assignment that FPI "assigned, transferred, ceded and conveyed [them] x x x absolutely in favor of [GHI]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> — <u><b>is evident from the letter dated February 28, 2003 which reveals the true intention of FPI and GHI</b></u>.<br><br>In the letter dated February 28, 2003, it is there provided that the right to the work process, otherwise known as "Outokumpo," was to be retained by FPI and would only be made available to GHI under two options. One option even gave FPI the option to operate the assigned assets with the obligation to pay GHI a guaranteed revenue. While GHI was given the first crack to choose which of the two options to take, such chosen option would only last for three years, and subsequently, FPI would make the choice and the option chosen by FPI would last for the next three years. The cycle would then be repeated if the ferro-alloy plant would not be operated for six years from assignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> What is evident, therefore, in the delineation of the different options available to FPI and GHI in the settlement of FPI's obligations to the latter is that FPI did not intend to really assign its assets "absolutely" to GHI. Stated differently, this letter belies the wordings of the Deed of Assignment that, it should be emphasized, was executed a mere 11 days after the letter, that is, on March 11, 2003.<br><br>That there was no intention to absolutely assign to GHI all of FPI's assets was confirmed by the finding of the RTC-CDO that, according to FPI's Acting President, Juanito E. Figueroa, "GHI cannot operate the [equipment, machinery and smelting facilities] without the patented 'Outokumpo' process and GHI has not been operating the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Moreover, the equipment and machinery remain physically in the plant premises, slowly depreciating with the passage of time, and, worse, there also appears to be no effective delivery as the premises on which these are located remain under the control of FPI which continues to employ the security and skeletal personnel in the plant premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Thus, in executing the Deed of Assignment, FPI's intention was not to transfer absolutely the assigned assets (admittedly valued at about P280 Million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>) to GHI in payment of FPI's obligations to GHI amounting to P50,366,926.71.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> FPI, as shown above, did not really intend to divest itself of its title and control of the assigned properties. FPI's real intention was, borrowing the words of Justice J.B.L Reyes in <i>Rodriguez</i>, to place them beyond the reach of its creditor CEPALCO. This was astutely observed by the CA Decision, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x The Deed of Assignment was executed while Civil Case No. 65789 was already pending with the RTC-Pasig <u>and after</u> the Partial Summary Judgment was rendered on 22 April 1999. In anticipation of the adverse final outcome of Civil Case No. 65789 as promulgated in the 19 January 2004 Decision of the RTC-Pasig, GHI and FPI executed the Deed of Assignment. Hence, the presumption of fraud set in by operation of the law against the sister companies, FPI, then already the judgment debtor, and GHI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>As to the presence of badges of fraud, which the RTC-CDO found to have existed and affirmed by the CA, they do, in fact, confirm the intention of FPI to defraud CEPALCO. But these findings do not thereby render as rescissible the Deed of Assignment under Article 1381(3). Rather, they fortify the finding that the Deed of Assignment was "not really desired or intended to produce legal effects or in any way alter the juridical situation of the parties" or, put differently, that the Deed of Assignment was a sham, or a <i>contracto simulado</i>.<br><br>Thus, given the foregoing, the Deed of Assignment is declared inexistent for being absolutely simulated or fictitious. Accordingly, the CA correctly ruled that the Deed of Assignment was absolutely simulated, although it was in error in affirming the rescission ordered by the RTC-CDO because, as explained above, rescissible contracts and void or inexistent contracts belong to two mutually exclusive groups. This error, however, does not justify the granting of the Petition.<br><br><b><i>Entitlement to Damages</i></b><br><br>The Court's declaration of the inexistence of the Deed of Assignment renders the resolution of the fifth issue — on GHI's entitlement to damages — superfluous. Instead, the dismissal of its complaint for lack of cause of action is warranted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.
