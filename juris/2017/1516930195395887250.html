Thus, Domingo prayed that as owner of the land occupied by Dela Cruz, he be placed in possession thereof.<br><br>Domingo immediately thereafter filed two more cases for recovery of possession against Dela Cruz before the DARAB, docketed as DARAB Case Nos. 299 and 300, relative to his land covered by TCT EP-82013 and TCT EP-82015.<br><br>Dela Cruz failed to timely file an answer to the three petitions, for which reason a consolidated Decision dated April 25, 2006 was rendered by DARAB Provincial Adjudicator Marvin Bernal ordering Dela Cruz to vacate Domingo's lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Dela Cruz filed a motion for reconsideration with motion to admit his answer.<br><br><b><i>DARAB Case No. 372</i></b><br><br>Without awaiting the resolution of his motions for reconsideration and to admit answer in DARAB Case Nos. 298-300, Dela Cruz filed DARAB Case No. 372 (or 372'NNE'06) for annulment of TCT EP-82013 and TCT EP-82015.

Dela Cruz prayed that Domingo's titles be annulled and cancelled; that he be declared owner of the lands covered thereby; that new titles be issued in his name; and that he be awarded attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>Domingo filed his Answer with Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> arguing that Dela Cruz's CLT 0401815 covers a parcel of land different from his lands; that he (Domingo) is in actual possession of the lands covered by TCT EP-82013 and TCT EP-82015; that Dela Cruz is guilty of forum shopping for filing the case in spite of the fact that a consolidated Decision has been issued in DARAB Case Nos. 298-300 against him; and for these reasons, the case should be dismissed.<br><br>On September 26, 2007, a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> was rendered by Talavera, Nueva Ecija DARAB Provincial Adjudicator Marvin Bernal, who also rendered the consolidated Decision in DARAB Case Nos. 298-300. It was held that Dela Cruz failed to prove that the subject parcels of land were sold to him; that the pieces of documentary evidence he submitted do not sufficiently prove a sale in his favor; that the lands belong to Domingo as the awardee thereof; that Domingo's disability does not disqualify him from becoming a farmer­-beneficiary under the agrarian laws; that Dela Cruz's allegations of fraud, deceit and false machinations have not been substantially proved; and that Dela Cruz merely holds a certificate of land transfer covering the subject lands, which does not grant ownership, as opposed to Domingo's transfer certificate of title. Thus, it was decreed that -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered by DISMISSING the instant petition, as it is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>All claims and other counterclaims the parties may have against each other [are] likewise dismissed for want of evidence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the DARAB</i></b><br><br>Dela Cruz took the matter before the DARAB via appeal docketed as DARAB Case No. 15566.

It held that Dela Cruz should have raised his claim of ownership and possession as a counterclaim in DARAB Case Nos. 298-300; that since Domingo's cases for recovery of possession or reconveyance involved an assertion of his ownership over the subject parcels of land, Dela Cruz should have interposed his own claim in these cases and sought annulment and cancellation of titles therein; and that since the parties, issues, and causes of action in these cases are identical, a decision in one will constitute <i>res judicata</i> in the others.<br><br>Petitioners moved to reconsider,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but the CA stood firm.

This is the essence of his claim.<br><br>However, a certificate of land transfer does not vest ownership in the holder thereof. In <i>Martillano v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court held that<br><blockquote>x x x A certificate of land transfer merely evinces that the grantee thereof is qualified to, in the words of <i>Pagtalunan</i>, 'avail of the statutory mechanisms for the acquisition of ownership of the land tilled by him as provided under Pres. Decree No. 27.' It is not a muniment of title that vests upon the farmer/grantee absolute ownership of his tillage. On the other hand, an emancipation patent, while it presupposes that the grantee thereof shall have already complied with all the requirements prescribed under Presidential Decree No. 27, serves as a basis for the issuance of a transfer certificate of title. It is the issuance of this emancipation patent that conclusively entitles the farmer/grantee of the rights of absolute ownership. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Dela Cruz must have relied on past interpretations relative to the document he possesses. But these no longer hold true.<br><blockquote>It is true that in past decisions of this Court, in particular <i>Torres v. Ventura</i> (which was cited by the DARAB Appeal Board) and <i>Quiban v. Butalid</i> (which was relied upon by the CA), we held that a tenant issued a CLT is deemed the owner of the land. This is because PD 27 states that '(t)he tenant farmer, whether in land classified as landed estate or not, shall be deemed owner of a portion constituting a family-size farm of five (5) hectares if not irrigated and three (3) hectares if irrigated.'<br><br>But, as correctly argued by PDB, more current decisions of this Court (where the interpretation of the phrase 'deemed owner' was directly tackled) have clarified these pronouncements by distinguishing the legal effects of a CLT and those of an emancipation patent. <i>Martillano v. Court of Appeals</i> is instructive:<br><blockquote>Both instruments have varying legal effects and implications insofar as the grantee's entitlements to his landholdings. A certificate of land transfer merely evinces that the grantee thereof is qualified to, in the words of <i>Pagtalunan</i>, 'avail of the statutory mechanisms for the acquisition of ownership of the land tilled by him as provided under Pres. Decree No. 27.' It is not a muniment of title that vests upon the farmer/grantee absolute ownership of his tillage. On the other hand, an emancipation patent, while it presupposes that the grantee thereof shall have already complied with all the requirements prescribed under Presidential Decree No. 27, serves as a basis for the issuance of a transfer certificate of title. It is the issuance of this emancipation patent that conclusively entitles the farmer/grantee of the rights of absolute ownership. <i>Pagtalunan</i> distinctly recognizes this point when it said that:<br><blockquote>It is the emancipation patent which constitutes conclusive authority for the issuance of an Original Certificate of Transfer, or a Transfer Certificate of Title, in the name of the grantee . . .<br><br>Clearly, it is only after compliance with the above conditions which entitle a farmer/grantee to an emancipation patent that he acquires the vested right of absolute ownership in the landholding - a right which has become fixed and established, and is no longer open to doubt or controversy. At best, the fanner/grantee, prior to compliance with these&nbsp; conditions, merely possesses a contingent or expectant right of ownership over the landholding.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Given that Garcia is a holder of a CLT but not of an emancipation patent, full ownership of the land has not yet vested in him. Hence, there is no basis for the CA and DARAB Appeal Board to direct the bank to turn over the land to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Petitioners concede that Dela Cruz was not issued an EP over the subject property; he only has CLT 0401815. On the other hand, Domingo was issued EPs over the same property, after which transfer certificates of title, TCT EP-82013 and TCT EP-82015, were issued to him. Between the two of them, Domingo is deemed the owner of the subject lands, and Dela Cruz has no valid claim. For some reason or other, Dela Cruz was not issued an EP for the subject lands, while for other lands, he was granted patents. This can only mean that for the subject lands, he failed to qualify as owner thereof under the government's agrarian reform program.<br><br>For this reason alone, it is clear that Dela Cruz has no cause of action against Domingo. His claim of ownership, which is the sole foundation for his case in DARAB Case No. 372, has fallen. His accompanying claims of fraud, deceit, and machinations; prior sale in his favor; and disqualification of Domingo as farmer-beneficiary do not deserve consideration by this Court. These have been passed upon by the DARAB itself and on two levels, no less. It need not be said that the Department of Agrarian Reform, through the DARAB, is in a "better position to resolve agrarian disputes, being the administrative agency possessing the necessary expertise on the matter and vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform controversies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>With the view taken of the case, there is no need to discuss the issues raised by the parties.
