Thus, there is no tax exemption to speak of because the said taxes shall be assumed by the Philippine Government; hence, the said provision is not violative of the Constitutional prohibition against the grants of tax exemption without the concurrence of the majority of the members of Congress.

Therefore, petitioner's payments of income tax and BPRT to the CIR, when such payments should have been made by the NPC, undoubtedly constitute erroneous payments under Section 229 of the NIRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> The CTA Division acknowledged that based on Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 42-99 dated June 2, 1999, amending RMC No. 32-99, the proper remedy for a Japanese contractor who previously paid the taxes directly to the BIR is to recover or obtain a refund from the government executing agency - the NPC in this case. It held, however, that RMC No. 42-99 does not apply to petitioner as it filed its ITR on July 15, 1998 or almost a year before the issuance of the same. It added that RMC No. 42-99 cannot be given retroactive effect as it would be unfair to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> The CIR moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated April 23, 2004; thus, the CIR elevated the matter to the CTA <em>En Banc</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The CTA En Banc's Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated May 24, 2006, the CTA<em> En Banc</em> reversed the CTA Division's rulings and declared that petitioner is not entitled to a refund of the taxes it paid to the CIR. It held that, <em>first</em>, petitioner failed to establish that its tax payments were "erroneous" under the law to justify the refund, adding that the CIR has no power to grant a refund under Section 229 of the NIRC absent any tax exemption. It further observed that by its clear terms, the Exchange of Notes granted no tax exemption to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <em>Second</em>, the Exchange of Notes cannot be read as a treaty validly granting tax exemption considering the lack of Senate concurrence as required under Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <em>Third</em>, RMC No. 42-99, which was already in effect when petitioner filed its administrative claim for refund on June 30, 2000, specifies petitioner's proper remedy that is, to recover the subject taxes from NPC, and not from the CIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner sought reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> but the CTA <em>En Banc</em> denied the motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated December 4, 2006; hence, this petition. </p><p align="center"><b>The Issues Before the Court</b> </p><p>The issues before the Court are two-fold: (<em>a</em>) whether petitioner is entitled to a refund; and (<em>b</em>) if in the affirmative, from which government entity should the refund be claimed. </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p>The petition is meritorious. </p><p align="center"><strong>I. </strong> </p><p>Sections 204 (C) of the NIRC grants the CIR the authority to credit or refund taxes which are erroneously collected by the government:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>SEC. 204. <em>Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate, and Refund or Credit Taxes.</em> </strong>The Commissioner may - </p> <p>x x x x</p> <p> (C) Credit or <strong><u>refund taxes erroneously or illegally received</u></strong> or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and, in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer <u>files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund</u> within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund. </p> <p>x x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The authority of the CIR to refund erroneously collected taxes is likewise reflected in Section 229 of the NIRC, which reads: </p> <blockquote> <p><strong>SEC. 229. <em>Recovery of Tax Erroneously or Illegally Collected</em>.</strong> — No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner; but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress."</p> <p> x x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p>In this case, it is fairly apparent that the subject taxes in the amount of P52,612,812.00 was erroneously collected from petitioner, considering that the obligation to pay the same had already been assumed by the Philippine Government by virtue of its Exchange of Notes with the Japanese Government. Case law explains that an exchange of notes is considered as an <strong>executive agreement</strong>, which is binding on the State even without Senate concurrence. In <em>Abaya v. Ebdane</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> <blockquote> <p> An "exchange of notes" is a record of a routine agreement that has many similarities with the private law contract. The agreement consists of the exchange of two documents, each of the parties being in the possession of the one signed by the representative of the other. Under the usual procedure, the accepting State repeats the text of the offering State to record its assent. The signatories of the letters may be government Ministers, diplomats or departmental heads. The technique of exchange of notes is frequently resorted to, either because of its speedy procedure, or, sometimes, to avoid the process of legislative approval.</p> <p> It is stated that "treaties, agreements, conventions, charters, protocols, declarations, memoranda of understanding,<em> modus vivendi</em> and exchange of notes" all refer to "international instruments binding at international law."</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Significantly, an exchange of notes is considered a form of an executive agreement, which becomes binding through executive action without the need of a vote by the Senate or Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Paragraph 5 (2) of the Exchange of Notes provides for a<strong> tax assumption provision</strong> whereby: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td width="98%"><div align="justify">The <strong>Government of the Republic of the Philippines will, <u><em>itself</em></u> or through its executing agencies</strong> or instrumentalities, <strong><u>assume all fiscal levies or taxes</u></strong> imposed in the Republic of the Philippines <em>on Japanese firms and nationals operating as suppliers, contractors or consultants</em> on and/or in connection with any income that may accrue from the supply of products of Japan and services of Japanese nationals to be provided under the Loan. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>To "assume" means "[t]o take on, become bound as another is bound, or put oneself in place of another as to an obligation or liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This means that the obligation or liability remains, although the same is merely passed on to a different person. In this light, the concept of an assumption is therefore different from an exemption, the latter being the "[f]reedom from a duty, liability or other requirement" or "[a] privilege given to a judgment debtor by law, allowing the debtor to retain [a] certain property without liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, contrary to the CTA <em>En Banc</em>'s opinion, the constitutional provisions on tax exemptions would not apply.</p> <p> As explicitly worded, the Philippine Government, through its executing agencies (<em>i.e</em>., NPC in this case) particularly assumed "all fiscal levies or taxes imposed in the Republic of the Philippines on Japanese firms and nationals operating as suppliers, contractors or consultants on and/or in connection with any income that may accrue from the supply of products of Japan and services of Japanese nationals to be provided under the [OECF] Loan." The Philippine Government's assumption of "all fiscal levies and taxes," which includes the subject taxes, is clearly a form of concession given to Japanese suppliers, contractors or consultants in consideration of the OECF Loan, which proceeds were used for the implementation of the Project. As part of this, NPC entered into the June 21, 1991 Contract with Mitsubishi Corporation (<em>i.e</em>., petitioner's head office in Japan) for the engineering, supply, construction, installation, testing, and commissioning of a steam generator, auxiliaries, and associated civil works for the Project,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> which foreign currency portion was funded by the OECF loans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, in line with the tax assumption provision under the Exchange of Notes, Article VIII (B) (1) of the Contract states that NPC shall pay any and all forms of taxes that are directly imposable under the Contract: </p><blockquote> <p>Article VIII (B) (1) </p> <p>B. FOR ONSHORE PORTION.</p> <blockquote> <p> 1.) [The] CORPORATION <strong>(NPC) shall</strong>, subject to the provisions under the Contract [Document] on Taxes, <strong>pay any and all forms of taxes</strong> which are directly imposable under the Contract including VAT, that may be imposed by the Philippine Government, or any of its agencies and political subdivisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphases supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> This notwithstanding, petitioner included in its income tax due the amount of P44,288,712.00, representing income from the OECF-funded portion of the Project, and further remitted P8,324,100.00 as BPRT for branch profits remitted to its head office in Japan out of its income for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> These taxes clearly fall within the ambit of the tax assumption provision under the Exchange of Notes, which was further fleshed out in the Contract. Hence, it is the Philippine Government, through the NPC, which should shoulder the payment of the same.</p><p> It bears stressing that the CIR had already acknowledged, through its administrative issuances, that Japanese contractors involved in the Project are not liable for the subject taxes. In RMC No. 42-99, the CIR interpreted the effect of the tax assumption clause in the Exchange of Notes on petitioner's tax liability, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> The foregoing provisions of the Exchange of Notes mean that the Japanese contractors or nationals engaged in EOCF-funded projects in the Philippines <strong><u>shall not be required to shoulder all fiscal levies or taxes associated with the project.</u></strong> x x x </p> <p>x x x x</p> <p> x x x Since the executing government agencies are mandated to assume the payment of [income taxes] under the Exchange of Notes, the said Japanese firms or nationals <strong><u>need not pay taxes due thereunder</u></strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The CIR subsequently affirmed petitioner's non-liability for taxes and entitlement to tax refunds by issuing Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 24-2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> addressed to specified BIR offices. The RMO provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Pursuant to the provisions of [RMC] No. 32-99 as amended by RMC No. 42-99, Japanese contractors and nationals engaged in OECF-funded projects in the Philippines <strong><u>shall not be required to shoulder</u></strong> the fiscal levies or<strong> <u>taxes associated with the project</u></strong>. Thus, the concerned Japanese contractors are <strong><u>entitled to claim for the refund of all taxes paid and shouldered by them</u></strong> relative to the conduct of the Project. </p> <p> You are, therefore, directed to expedite/ prioritize the processing of the claims for refund of Japanese contractors and nationals so [as] not to delay and jeopardize the release of the funds for OECF funded projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Therefore, considering that petitioner paid the subject taxes in the aggregate amount of P52,612,812.00, which it was not required to pay, the BIR erroneously collected such amount. Accordingly, petitioner is entitled to its refund. </p><p align="center"><strong> II. </strong> </p><p> As above-stated, the NIRC vests upon the CIR, being the head of the BIR, the authority to credit or refund taxes which are erroneously collected by the government. This specific statutory mandate cannot be overridden by averse interpretations made through mere administrative issuances, such as RMC No. 42-99, which - as argued by the CIR - shifts to the executing agencies (particularly, NPC in this case) the power to refund the subject taxes:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify"><strong>(3)</strong></div></td> <td width="98%"><div align="justify"><strong>In cases where income taxes were previously paid directly by the Japanese contractors or nationals, the corresponding cash refund shall be <u>recovered from the government executing agencies</u></strong> upon the presentation of proof of payment by the Japanese contractors or nationals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>A revenue memorandum circular is an administrative ruling issued by the CIR to interpret tax laws. It is widely accepted that an interpretation by the executive officers, whose duty is to enforce the law, is entitled to great respect from the courts. However, such interpretation is not conclusive and will be disregarded if judicially found to be incorrect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Verily, courts will not tolerate administrative issuances that override, instead of remaining consistent and in harmony with, the law they seek to implement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as in this case. Thus, Item B (3) of RMC No. 42-99, an administrative issuance directing petitioner to claim the refund from NPC, cannot prevail over Sections 204 and 229 of the NIRC, which provide that claims for refund of erroneously collected taxes must be filed with the CIR. </p> <p> All told, petitioner correctly filed its claim for tax refund under Sections 204 and 229 of the NIRC to recover the erroneously paid taxes amounting to P44,288,712.00 as income tax and P8,324,100.00 as BPRT from the BIR. To reiterate, petitioner's entitlement to the refund is based on the tax assumption provision in the Exchange of Notes. Given that this is a case of tax assumption and not an exemption, the BIR is, therefore, not without recourse; it can properly collect the subject taxes from the NPC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> as the proper party that assumed petitioner's tax liability. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
