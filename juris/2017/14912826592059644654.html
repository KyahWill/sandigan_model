The petition is meritorious.<br><br>In labor cases, Our power of review is limited to the determination of whether the CA correctly resolved the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC. The Court explained this in <i>Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br><blockquote>x x x In a Rule 45 review, we consider the <b>correctness of the assailed CA decision</b>, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari </i>it ruled upon was presented to it; <b>we have to examine&nbsp; the CA decision from&nbsp; the prism&nbsp; of whether&nbsp; it correctly&nbsp; determined the presence or absence&nbsp; of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct.</b> In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. <b>In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case</b>?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote> Errors of judgment are not within the province of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, which&nbsp; is merely&nbsp; confined&nbsp; to issues of jurisdiction&nbsp; or grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; To be considered "grave," discretion must be exercised in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]&nbsp; </sup>In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions reached are not supported by substantial evidence or are in total disregard of evidence material to or even decisive of the controversy; when it is necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice; when the findings of the NLRC contradict those of the LA; and when necessary to arrive at a just decision of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <br><br>In the case at bar, We hold that the CA erred in ruling that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when it sustained the Labor Arbiter's finding that Ando is not a regular employee but a project employee of EGI.<br><br>The terms<b> regular, project, seasonal</b> and <b>casual </b>employment are taken from Article 280<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; of the Labor Code, as amended. In addition,<i> Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> ruled that fixed-term employment contract is not <i>per se </i>illegal or against public policy?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Under Art. 280, project employment is one which "has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement&nbsp; of the employee." To be considered&nbsp; as project-based, the employer has the burden of proof to show that: (<i>a</i>) the employee was assigned to carry out a specific project or undertaking and (<i>b</i>) the duration and scope of which were specified at the time the employee was engaged for such&nbsp; project&nbsp; or&nbsp; undertaking.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; It must be&nbsp; proved&nbsp; that the&nbsp; particular work/service to be performed as well as its duration are defined in the employment agreement and made clear to the employee who was informed thereof at the time of hiring.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <br><br>The activities of project employees <b>may or may not</b> be usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer. In <i>ALU-TUCP v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; two (2) categories of project employees were distinguished:<br><blockquote>In the realm of business and industry, we note that "project" could refer to one or the other of at least two (2) distinguishable types of activities. Firstly, a project could refer to a particular job or undertaking that is within the regular or usual business of the employer company, but which is distinct and separate, and identifiable as such, from the other undertakings of the company. Such job or undertaking begins and ends at determined or determinable times. The typical example of this first type of project&nbsp; is a particular&nbsp; construction&nbsp; job or project&nbsp; of a construction company. x x x. Employees who are hired for the carrying out of one of these separate&nbsp; projects,&nbsp; the scope&nbsp; and duration&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; has been determined and made known to the employees at the time of employment, are properly treated as "project employees," and their services may be lawfully terminated at completion of the project.<br><br>The term "project" could also refer to, secondly, a particular job or undertaking that is <i>not </i>within the regular business of the corporation. Such a job or undertaking must also be identifiably separate and distinct from the ordinary or regular business operations of the employer. The job or undertaking also begins and ends at determined or determinable times. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote> As the assigned project or phase <b>begins and ends at determined or determinable times</b>, the services of the project employee may be lawfully terminated at its completion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br>In this case, the three project employment contracts signed by Ando explicitly stipulated the agreement "to engage [his] services as a Project Worker"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; and that:<br><blockquote>5. [His] services with the Project will end upon completion of the phase of work for which [he was] hired for and is tentatively set on <u>(written date)</u>. However, this could be extended or shortened depending on the work phasing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </blockquote>The CA opined that Ando's contracts do not bear the essential element of a project employment because while his contracts stated the period by which he was engaged, his tenure remained indefinite. The appellate court ruled that the stipulation that his services "could be extended or shortened depending on the work phasing" runs counter to the very essence of project employment since the certainty of the completion or termination of the projects is in question. It was noted that, based on Ando's payslips, his services were still engaged by EGI even after his contracts expired. These extensions as well as his repeated rehiring manifested that the work he rendered are necessary and desirable to EGI's construction business, thereby removing him from the scope of project employment contemplated under Article 280.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Records show that Ando's contracts for Bahay Pamulinawen Project were extended until December 31, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; (from the original stated date of September 30, 2010) and shortened to February 15,2011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; (from the original stated date of February 28, 2011) while his services in West Insula Project was extended until April 30, 2011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; (from the original stated date of March 31, 2011). These notwithstanding, he is still considered as a project, not regular, employee of EGI.<br><br>A project employment contract is valid under the law.<br><blockquote>x x x By entering into such a contract, an employee is deemed to understand that his employment is coterminous with the project. He may not expect to be employed continuously beyond the completion of the project. It is of judicial notice that project employees engaged for manual services or those for special skills like those of carpenters or masons, are, as a rule, unschooled. However, this fact alone is not a valid reason for bestowing special treatment on them or for invalidating a contract of employment. Project employment contracts are not lopsided agreements in favor of only one party thereto. The employer's interest is equally important as that of the employee's for theirs is the interest that propels economic activity. While it may be true that it is the employer who drafts project employment contracts with its business interest as overriding consideration, such contracts do not, of necessity, prejudice the employee. Neither is the employee left helpless by a prejudicial employment contract. After all, under the law, the interest of the worker is paramount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </blockquote>The Court has upheld the validity of a project-based contract of employment provided that the period was agreed upon knowingly and voluntarily by the parties, without any force, duress or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his consent; or where it satisfactorily appears that the employer and employee dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance whatever being exercised by the former over the latter; and it is apparent from the circumstances that the period was not imposed to preclude the acquisition of tenurial security by the employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Otherwise, such contract should be struck down as contrary to public policy, morals, good custom or public order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <br><br>Here, Ando was adequately notified of his employment status at the time his services were engaged by EGI for the Bahay Pamulinawen and the West Insula Projects. The contracts he signed consistently stipulated that his services as a project worker were being sought. There was an informed consent to be engaged as such. His consent was not vitiated. As a matter of fact, Ando did not even allege that force, duress or improper pressure were used against him in order to agree. His being a carpenter does not suffice.<br><br>There was no attempt to frustrate Ando's security of tenure. His employment was for a specific project or undertaking because the nature of EGI's business is one which will not allow it to employ workers for an indefinite period. As a corporation engaged in construction and residential projects, EGI depends for its business on the contracts it is able to obtain. Since work depends on the availability of such contracts, necessarily the duration of the employment of its work force is not permanent but coterminous with the projects to which they are assigned and from whose payrolls they are paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It would be extremely burdensome for EGI as an employer if it would have to carry them as permanent employees and pay them wages even if there are no projects for them to work on. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <br><br>Project employment should not be confused and interchanged with <i>fixed-term</i> employment:<br><br><blockquote>x x x While the former requires a project as restrictively defined above, the duration of a fixed-term employment agreed upon by the parties may be any day certain. which is understood to be "that which must necessarily come although it may not be known when." The decisive determinant&nbsp; in&nbsp; fixed-term&nbsp; employment&nbsp; is not&nbsp; the&nbsp; activity&nbsp; that&nbsp; the employee is called upon to perform but the day certain agreed upon by the parties&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; commencement&nbsp; and&nbsp; termination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the employment relationship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote> The decisive determinant in project employment is the activity that the employee is called upon to perform and not the day certain agreed upon by the parties for the commencement and termination of the employment relationship. Indeed, in <i>Filsystems, Inc. v. Puente,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; We even ruled that an employment contract that does not mention particular dates that establish the specific duration of the project does not preclude one's classification as a project employee.<br><br>In this case, the duration of the specific/identified&nbsp; undertaking for which Ando was engaged was reasonably determinable. Although the employment contract provided that the stated date may be "extended or shortened depending on the work phasing," it specified the termination of the parties' employment relationship on a "day certain," which is "upon completion of the phase of work for which [he was] hired for."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><blockquote>A "day" x x x is understood to be that which must necessarily come, although is may not be known exactly when. This means that where the final completion of a project or phase thereof is in fact determinable and the expected completion is made known to the employee, such project employee may not be considered regular, notwithstanding the one-year duration of employment in the project or phase thereof or the one-year duration of two or more employments in the same project or phase of the project.<br><br>The completion of the project or any phase thereof is determined on the 
date originally agreed upon or the date indicated in the contract, or if
 the same is extended, the date of termination of project extension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <br></blockquote>Ando's tenure as a project employee remained definite because there was certainty of completion or termination of the Bahay Pamulinawen and the West Insula Projects. The project employment&nbsp; contracts sufficiently apprised him that his security of tenure with EGI would only last as long as the specific projects he was assigned to were subsisting. When the projects were completed, he was validly terminated from employment since his engagement was coterminous thereto.<br><br>The fact that Ando was required to render services necessary or desirable in the operation of EGI's business for more than a year does not in any way impair the validity of his project employment contracts. Time and again, We have held that the length of service through&nbsp; repeated and successive rehiring is not the controlling determinant of the employment tenure of a project employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rehiring of construction workers on a project-to-project&nbsp; basis does not confer upon them regular employment status as it is only dictated by the practical consideration that experienced construction workers are more preferred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; In Ando's case, he was rehired precisely because of his previous experience working with the other phases of the project. EGI took into account similarity of working environment. Moreover-<br><blockquote>x x x It is widely known that in the construction industry, a project employee's work depends on the availability of projects, necessarily the. duration of his employment. It is not permanent but coterminous with the work to which he is assigned. It would be extremely burdensome for the employer, who depends on the availability of projects, to carry him as a permanent employee and pay him wages even if there are no projects for him to work on. The rationale behind this is that once the project is completed it would be unjust to require the employer to maintain these employees in their payroll. To do so would make the employee a privileged retainer who collects payment from his employer for work not done. This is extremely unfair to the employers and amounts to labor coddling at the expense of management.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </blockquote>Finally, the second paragraph of Article 280, stating that an employee who has rendered service for at least one (1) year shall be considered a regular employee, is applicable only to a casual employee and not to a project or a regular employee referred to in paragraph one thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <br><br>The foregoing considered, EGI did not violate any requirement of procedural due process by failing to give Ando advance notice of his termination. Prior notice of termination is not part of procedural due process if the termination is brought about by the completion of the contract or phase thereof for which the project employee was engaged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Such completion automatically terminates the employment and the employer is, under the law, only required to render a report to the Department of Labor and Employment (<i>DOLE</i>) on the termination of employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In this case, it is undisputed that EGI submitted the required Establishment Employment Reports to DOLE-NCR&nbsp; Makati/Pasay&nbsp; Field&nbsp; Office&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; Ando's "temporary&nbsp; lay-off' effective February 16, 2011 and "permanent termination" effective May 2, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
