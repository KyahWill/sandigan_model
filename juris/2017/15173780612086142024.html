				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> For resolution are the following motions filed subsequent to the entry in the Book of Entries of the Judgment of the Court's decision in the above-entitled case: (a) the National Power Corporation (NPC)'s Manifestation and Motion dated August 22, 2014; (b) Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM)'s Omnibus Motion dated August 22, 2015; (c) the petitioners' Motion to Expunge dated September 1, 2014; and (d) Meralco's Special Appearance with Urgent Motion for Clarification dated September 4, 2014.<br><br><center><u><b>Antecedent Facts</b></u><br></center><br>The Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> was enacted to ordain reforms in the electric power industry, including the privatization of the assets and liabilities of the NPC. Pursuant to this objective, the said law created the <b>National Power Board (NPB)</b> consisting of <b>nine (9) heads of agencies</b> as members, to wit: (a) Secretary of Finance, (b) Secretary of Energy, (c) Secretary of Budget and Management, (d) Secretary of Agriculture, (e) Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, (f) Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, (g) Secretary of the Interior and Local Government, (h) Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, and (i) President of the NPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In line with NPC's privatization, the EPIRA also called for the NPC's restructuring. In this regard, <b>the NPB passed NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125</b> directing the termination from service of all NPC employees effective January 31, 2003. The restructuring plan covered even "Early-leavers" or those who: (a) did not intend to be rehired by NPC based on the new organizational structure, <i>or</i> (b) were no longer employed by NPC after June 26, 2001, the date of the EPIRA's effectivity, for any reason other than voluntary resignation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Main Decision</i></b><br><br>In Our <b><u>Decision</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <b>dated September 26, 2006</b>, we ruled that the above­-mentioned resolutions were void and without effect. These were not passed by a majority of NPB's members, as only three out of nine members voted. The other four signatories to the resolutions were not members of the Board. They were merely representatives of those actually named under the EPIRA to sit as members of the NPB. Thus, their votes did not count.<br><br><b><i>Clarifiying the Main Decision</i></b><br><br>Subsequently, We clarified the effect of Our Decision in our <u><b>Resolution</b></u> dated <b>September 17, 2008</b> to wit:<br><ol><li>The Court's Decision does not preclude the NPB from passing another resolution, in accord with law and jurisprudence, approving a new separation program from its employees.<br><br></li><li>The <b>termination</b> of the petitioners' employment on January 31, 2003 was <b>illegal</b>.<br><br></li><li>Due to the illegal dismissal, as a general rule, the petitioners are entitled to reinstatement. However, <b>reinstatement has become impossible</b> because NPC was still able to proceed with its reorganization prior to the promulgation of the Decision dated September 26, 2006.<br><br></li><li>Thus, the petitioners are <b>entitled</b> to the following:<br><ol type="a"><br><li><b>Separation pay in lieu of reinstatement</b>, based on a validly approved separation program of the NPC; and<br><br></li><li><b>Back wages</b> together with <b>wage adjustments and all other benefits</b> which they would have received had it not been for the illegal dismissal, <b>computed from January 31, 2003 until actual reinstatement or payment of separation pay</b>.<br></li></ol><br></li><li> However, any amount of separation benefits <b>already received</b> by the petitioners under NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 shall be <b>deducted</b> from their total entitlement.<br></li></ol>We also approved a <b>10% charging lien</b> in favor of the petitioners' counsels, Attys. Aldon and Orocio, in accordance with the Labor Code which limits attorney's fees in illegal dismissal cases (in the private sector) to 10% of the recovered amount.<br><br>Finally, We <b>deferred the computation</b> of the actual amounts due the petitioners and the enforcement of payment thereof by execution to the proper forum, as this Court is not a trier of facts. We held that this Court is not equipped to receive evidence and determine the truth of the factual allegations of the parties on this matter.<br><br><b><i>NPB Ratifies NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125</i></b><br><br>In the meantime, on September 14, 2007, the NPB issued Resolution No. 2007-55, which adopted, confirmed, and approved the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125.<br><br><b><i>Entry of Judgment</i></b><br><br>Our Decision dated September 26, 2006 became <b>final and executory</b> on October 10, 2008. The <b>entry of judgment</b> thereof was made on October 27, 2008. Thus, in Our <b><u>Resolution</u> dated December 10, 2008</b>, we granted the petitioners' motion for execution. We directed the Chairman and Members of the NPB and the President of NPC (NPB/NPC) to prepare a <b>verified list</b> of the <u>names</u> of all NPC employees terminated/separated as a result of NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and the <u>amounts</u> due to each of them, <u><i>including 12% legal interest</i></u>. We also directed the Office of the Clerk of Court and <i>ex-officio</i> Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City to: a) issue a <b>writ of execution</b> based on the list submitted by the NPC, and b) undertake all necessary actions to execute the herein decision and resolution.<br><br>The petitioners sought to cite the NPB/NPC for contempt for its alleged failure to comply with the Court's directive. They also insisted for the garnishment and/or levy of NPC's assets, <b>including those of PSALM</b>, for the satisfaction of the judgment.<br><br>The NPC countered that there were actually only <b>16 NPC personnel terminated on January 31, 2003</b>. Also, the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cured the infirm NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125. Thus, the termination on January 31, 2003 was valid and legal.<br><br><b><i>Extent of Illegal Dismissal and PSALM's Liability</i></b><br><br>In our <b><u>Resolution</u> dated December 2, 2009</b>, We held that Our previous rulings contemplated the illegal dismissal of <b>all NPC employees</b> pursuant to NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125, not just 16. Based on NPC Circular No. 2003-09, the terminations were implemented in four (4) tranches, <i>viz</i>.: (a) <b>Top executives</b> - effective January 31, 2003; (b) <b>Early-leavers</b> - effective January 15, 2003; (c) <b>Those no longer employed in the NPC after June 26, 2001</b> - effective on the date of actual separation; and (d) <u><b>All other personnel</b></u> - effective February 28, 2003.<br><br>We ruled further that the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on September 14, 2007 only means that the services of all NPC employees have been <b>legally</b> terminated on this date. Thus, the petitioners' entitlement (<i>i.e.</i>, separation pay in lieu of reinstatement plus back wages less benefits already received) <b>shall be reckoned from the above-mentioned dates (instead of just January 31, 2003) up to September 14, 2007</b>.<br><br>Lastly, We held that PSALM's assets may be subject of the execution of this case. We explained that under the EPIRA, PSALM shall assume all of NPC's existing generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate, and other disposable assets. <b>It would be unfair and unjust if PSALM gets nearly all of NPC's assets but will not pay for liabilities incurred by NPC during the privatization stage.</b> Further, there was a transfer of interest over these assets by operation of law. <u><b>These properties may be used to satisfy the judgment.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><b><i>Our Jurisdiction, Legal Interest, and NPB Resolution No. 2007-55's Non­-Retroactivity</i></b><br><br>In our <u><b>Resolution</b></u> <b>dated June 30, 2014</b>, we emphasized that by virtue of <b>Section 78 of the EPIRA, We have jurisdiction</b> to rule on the issue of the illegal termination of NPC employees. Also, since Our Decision dated September 26, 2006 and Resolution dated September 17, 2008 have already become final and executory, NPC is barred by the principles of <b>estoppel</b> and <b>finality of judgments</b> from raising arguments aimed at modifying Our final rulings.<br><br>Further, we held that Our Resolution dated September 17, 2008 did not grant additional reliefs. It merely <b>clarified</b> the Decision dated September 26, 2006.<br><br>On the other hand, we also ruled that Our Resolution dated December 10, 2008 did not exceed the terms of the Resolution dated September 17, 2008 (inasmuch as it also awarded <b>interest</b>). Legal interest on the judgment debt shall be computed as follows:<br><ol><li><b>12%</b> from <u>October 10, 2008</u> (finality of the Decision dated September 26, 2006) until June 30, 2013; and<br><br></li><li><b>6%</b> from July 1, 2013 (effectivity of Central Bank Circular No. 799) onwards.<br></li></ol>As for NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, We pointed out that it did not affect our final rulings as the said resolution shall be applied <b>prospectively</b> (September 14, 2007 onwards).<br><br>We continued to explain PSALM's liability in this case. Pursuant to Sections 47, 49, 50, and 55 of the EPIRA, <b>PSALM assumed NPC's liabilities</b> existing at the time of the EPIRA's effectivity, <b>including the separation benefits due to the petitioners</b>.<br><br>Finally, We found the NPC and Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) guilty of <b>indirect contempt</b> due to their noncompliance with our final orders. The parties were ordered to pay a fine of P30,000.00 each.<br><br><b><i>Implementation and Execution of the Court's Main Decision and Resolutions</i></b><br><br>Pursuant to Our Resolution dated June 30, 2014, the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i> Sheriff issued a Demand for Immediate Payment dated July 28, 2014 and served the same upon the NPC and PSALM. The demand amounted to P62,051,646,567.13 broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%">Judgment amount,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> inclusive of 10% charging lien</td><td width="15%"><div align="right">P60,244,316,841.88</div></td><td width="61%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Lawful fees and costs of execution</td><td><div align="right">1,807,329,725.25</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Total amount demanded</td><td><div align="right">P62,051,646,567.13</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>A few days later, in a letter dated July 31, 2014, the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex Officio</i> Sheriff asked the Court to clarify the effects of our Resolution dated June 30, 2014, specifically whether the judgment may already be executed. In response, some of the petitioners, as represented by Attys. Aldon and Orocio, also wrote a letter dated August 5, 2014 to request the Court to immediately act on this matter.<br><br>Before the Court could act on the above-mentioned correspondences, the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>ex-officio</i> Sheriff issued Notices of Garnishment addressed to the Manila Electric Company (Meralco), and National Transmission Commission (Transco)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> with respect to all credits in or under their possession or control owing or payable to NPC and/or PSALM, including but not limited to bank deposits and financial interests, goods, effects, stocks, interest in stock and shares, and any other personal properties. Another Notice of Garnishment was also served upon Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) in relation to NPC and PSALM's bank accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In separate letters, PSALM, through its president and chief executive officer Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr., advised Meralco and Transco to "exercise restraint and refrain from improvidently releasing funds" owing to PSALM to satisfy the Notices of Garnishment served upon them.<br><br><b><i>NPC Employees List Requirement and Suspension of Execution</i></b><br><br>In Our <u><b>Resolution</b></u> <b>dated September 9, 2014</b>, the Court directed the parties to submit their <b>separate lists of NPC employees</b> as of January 31, 2002, showing the following data:<br><ol type="i"><li>The full name;<br><br></li><li>Date of hire;<br><br></li><li>Last date of uninterrupted service after date of hire;<br><br></li><li>Position. and salary as of last date of service; and<br><br></li><li>If termination or separation pay has been received at any time from NPC, the amount of termination or separation pay received and date of receipt.<br></li></ol>Further, We directed the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i> Sheriff: (a) to <b>defer</b> the implementation of the Main Decision and the Resolutions dated September 17, 2008, December 2, 2009, and June 30, 2014 while We consider the submissions now before Us and until further notice; and (b) <b>lift</b> the Notice of Garnishment dated August 14, 2014.<br><br>Subsequently, in Our <b><u>Resolution</u> dated October 20, 2014</b>, we <b>modified</b> the terms of Our Resolution dated September 9, 2014 and required a more detailed list as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Employee's full name;<br><br></li><li>Date of hire;<br><br></li><li>Position as of date of hire;<br><br></li><li>Date of actual termination under NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125;<br><br></li><li>Position as of date of actual termination under NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125;<br><br></li><li>Salary as of last date of actual termination;<br><br></li><li>Separation pay that the employee is entitled to under the approved separation pay program;<br><br></li><li>Date of receipt of separation pay;<br><br></li><li>Amount of separation pay received;<br><br></li><li>Wage adjustments and other benefits that the employee is entitled to from the date of actual termination until September 14, 2007;<br><br></li><li>Wage adjustments and other benefits that the employee has received from the date of actual termination until September 14, 2007;<br><br></li><li>Date of re-hire by the NPC, the PSALM, or the TRANSCO, if any;<br><br></li><li>Position as of date of re-hire by the NPC, the PSALM, or the TRANSCO, if any;<br><br></li><li>Salary as of date of re-hire by the NPC, the PSALM, or the TRANSCO, if any;<br><br></li><li>Subsequent position/s in the NPC, the PSALM, or the TRANSCO as a result of personnel actions after the date of re-hire;<br><br></li><li>Date of release of appointment papers in the subsequent position/s;<br><br></li><li>Salary in the subsequent position/s;<br><br></li><li>Date of actual termination in the NPC, the PSALM, or the TRANSCO, if any;<br><br></li><li>Separation pay that the employee is entitled to under the approved separation pay program;<br><br></li><li>Amount of separation pay received;<br><br></li><li>Date of receipt of separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The NPC and PSALM submitted their compliance to our Resolution dated October 20, 2014.<br><br>The <b>NPC submitted a list of 9,272 employees</b>, including details required by our Resolution dated October 20, 2014, through their Compliance <i>Ad Cautelam</i> dated March 16, 2015. However, it made the following reservations:<br><ol><li>Its submission should not prejudice the reliefs prayed for in NPC's Manifestation and Motion dated August 22, 2014.<br><br></li><li>The figures in the submission are necessarily indeterminate because they are subject to the final outcome of disallowance proceedings under the Commission on Audit and a pending case before the RTC (Case No. R-QZN-15-01290 CV) based on their lack of appropriation cover.<br></li></ol>On the other hand, PSALM's submission was partially based on the information it received from NPC, the custodian of personnel records, which considered <b>47 former NPC employees</b>. PSALM points out that it is unable to provide complete information.<br><br>It argues that assuming that it is liable, the affected NPC employees have already been paid separation benefits pursuant to Rule 33 of the EPIRA Implementing Rules.<br><br><center><u><b>Motions Pending Resolution</b></u><br></center><br>The motions that remain pending before Us (after the Resolution dated June 30, 2014) are as follows: (a) the NPC's Manifestation and Motion dated August 22, 2014; (b) PSALM's Omnibus Motion dated August 22, 2015; (c) the petitioners' Motion to Expunge dated September 1, 2014; and (d) Meralco's Special Appearance with Urgent Motion for Clarification dated September 4, 2014.<br><br><b><i>The NPC's Manifestation and Motion dated August 22, 2014</i></b><br><br>The NPC argues as follows:<br><ol><li>The subject matter of the. case has a <b>huge financial impact</b>, which must be decided <i>en banc</i>.<br></li></ol>PSALM echoes this view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It further claims that two divisions of the Court have given conflicting decisions-while one has ruled that PSALM is an indispensable party, the other considered them as a necessary party. Thus, in PSALM's view, to remedy the <b>seeming conflict</b> between the two rulings, the present case must be referred to the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>In Our Resolution dated September 9, 2014, we deferred the resolution of this matter pending full consideration of other remaining motions submitted by the parties.<br><ol start="2"><li>The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over illegal dismissal cases of NPC employees. Jurisdiction is vested with the Civil Service Commission (CSC).<br><br></li><li>Department secretaries may vote through representatives.<br><br></li><li>In the absence of an actual computation of the amounts due to the petitioners, the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i> sheriff of Quezon City cannot garnish NPC's properties. The Court's delegation of authority must first be raffled to an RTC judge for proper determination pursuant to the Court's Resolution dated June 30, 2014.<br></li></ol><b><i>PSALM's Omnibus Motion dated August 22, 2015</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>PSALM maintains that it should be absolved from any liability in this case due to the following reasons:<br><ol><li>PSALM shall only be liable for obligations/liabilities that were exclusively listed under the EPIRA, to wit: (1) NPC liabilities transferred to PSALM, (2) transfers from the national government, (3) new loans, and (4) NPC stranded contract costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, despite the privatization of NPC's assets, NPC remained as separate and distinct from PSALM. It is capable of fulfilling its own obligations that were not assumed by PSALM.<br><br></li><li>The obligation to pay separation benefits was not among the liabilities assumed by PSALM because it arose only after the EPIRA took effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><ol type="a"><br><li>Under Section 49 of the EPIRA, PSALM shall be liable only for NPC's selected <b>outstanding obligations</b>. The obligation to pay separation benefits in the present case was not an outstanding obligation assumed by PSALM because, at the time of the EPIRA's passage, the obligation did not yet exist nor did it arise from any loan, bond issuance, security and other instrument or indebtedness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br></li><li>The obligation to pay the separation benefits in the present case only arose after the EPIRA took effect. Only NPC liabilities existing during the effectivity of the EPIRA were transferred to PSALM. Such transfer could not have included even NPC liabilities incurred after the EPIRA took effect.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>NPC remains to be solely liable for the payment of separation benefits in this case.<br><ol type="a"><br><li>Separation benefits as a result of the privatization of NPC are governed by Section 63 of the EPIRA and Rule 33 of its Implementing Rules.<br><br></li><li>Under Section 4, Rule 33 of the Implementing Rules, <b>funds necessary to cover the payment of separation pay shall be provided by either the GSIS or from the corporate funds of the NEA or the NPC, as the case may be. The Buyer or Concessionaire or the successor company shall not be liable for the payment thereof.</b><br><br></li><li>There is no basis to hold PSALM liable. The IRR clearly mandates that the payment of separation pay in favor of displaced NPC employees shall be out of NPC's own corporate funds.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>If PSALM is at all liable, its liability is limited to the separation pay of NPC employees terminated pursuant to a valid separation plan. PSALM cannot be held liable for separation pay arising from a separation/restructuring plan that was tainted with irregularities and bad faith. If the law had intended PSALM to assume even the obligation to pay separation pay, the same would have been clear and categorical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></li></ol>However, in PSALM's Supplement to the Compliance dated October 27, 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it argues that the separation program was effected through valid board actions. The laws applicable to government corporations like NPC recognize the validity of designating alternates to sit as members of the governing boards.<br><br>Further, based on the Congressional deliberations leading to the EPIRA's enactment, the legislature intended to limit NPC liabilities to be transferred and assumed by PSALM only to NPC debts arising from <b>direct contractual obligations with banking and multilateral financial institutions</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><ol start="5"><li>Its right to due process was violated when it was declared as a mere necessary party to the case.<br><br></li><li>In keeping with PSALM's right to due process, the Notices of Garnishment issued to it by the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City, Clerk of Court should be quashed for being fatally defective.<br><br></li><li>Prior approval by the Commission on Audit (COA) must first be obtained before any money judgment can be enforced against PSALM.<br></li></ol>On the other hand, the petitioners counter that while government funds are generally not subject to execution, this rule admits of exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Relying on <i>National Housing Authority v. Heirs of Isidro Guivelondo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> they argue that funds belonging to a public corporation or a government-owned or controlled corporation like PSALM, which is clothed with its own personality, separate, and distinct from that of the government are not exempt from garnishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioners' Motion to Expunge dated September 1, 2014</i></b><br><br>The petitioners argue that the NPC's Manifestation and Motion dated August 22, 2014 and PSALM's Omnibus Motion dated August 22, 2015 violate the prohibition against the filing of a second motion for reconsideration. In their view, the arguments raised in these motions are mere rehashes of issues already resolved and disposed of by the Court. Thus, the petitioners request that these motions be denied and excluded from the records of the case altogether.<br><br><b><i>Meralco's Special Appearance with Urgent Motion for Clarification dated September 4, 2014</i></b><br><br>Meralco filed its Special Appearance before the Court in view of: (a) the Notice of Garnishment dated August 14, 2014 served by the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i> Sheriff garnishing <i>all</i> credits owing to PSALM but in and under Meralco's possession and control; and (b) PSALM's letter of even date cautioning Meralco to exercise restraint and refrain from releasing funds due to PSALM but still in its (Meralco) possession.<br><br>Meralco manifests to the Court the following:<br><ol><li>In response to the Notice of Garnishment, it filed a Compliance and Manifestation dated August 19, 2014. Meralco informed the RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i> Sheriff that it is ready and willing to comply with the RTC's directives and processes. However, there are serious repercussions that may arise due to the garnishment of PSALM's credits (<i>i.e.</i>, suspension and/or nonpayment/fulfillment of reciprocal obligations between PSALM and Meralco, possible breach of contract on Meralco's part, <i>etc.</i>). Thus, the parties must first clarify these matters with and seek guidance from the Court.<br><br></li><li>Meralco also asserts that its regular remittances to PSALM may be any one of three types, to wit: (a) <i>universal charges</i> for: 1) NPC's stranded contract costs, 2) missionary electrification, and 3) environmental charges; (b) <i>line rental costs</i> for energy purchases of Sunpower Philippines Manufacturing Limited (Sunpower); and (c) <i>deferred accounting adjustments - generation rate adjustment mechanism</i> (DAA-GRAM).<br></li></ol>It discusses each type of remittance as follows:<br><ol type="a"><li><i>Universal charges</i> are collected by Meralco and remitted to PSALM by virtue of several Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) rulings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In accordance with the EPIRA, upon remittance, PSALM will then place the amounts received in a Special Trust Fund (STF), which shall be disbursed for purposes specified in Section 34 of the EPIRA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and in favor of identified beneficiaries. Meralco claims that the judgment obligation in the present case has not been included in the previous filings of the NPC/PSALM for the recovery of any component of universal charge.<br><br></li><li><i>Line rental cost</i> is an amount billed by the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PMC) to buyers of electricity covered by bilateral contracts to account for the cost of energy lost in the process of delivering contracted energy volumes from a generator's plant to the buyers. Sunpower is one of the said buyers of electricity. There is a special arrangement with regard to the line rental cost attributable to Sunpower where, instead of billing Sunpower directly, PMC bills PSALM, which in turn bills Meralco. Meralco then has the duty to collect the amount from Sunpower. Upon collection, Meralco shall remit the amount to PSALM, which will ultimately be remitted to PMC. Thus, while the amounts of line rental cost will be initially remitted to PSALM, the latter does not own the same nor will it accrue in its favor.<br><br></li><li><i>DAA-GRAM</i> is a means approved by the ERC allowing the NPC to recover the difference between the allowable fuel and purchased power costs and the amounts recovered under the basic generation charge for the period from January 2007 to April 2010. Meralco shall collect the DAA-GRAM from the end users and remit the same in favor of the NPC. Stated differently, it is a pass-through charge.<br></li></ol>Meralco points out that since the Notice of Garnishment covers all credits owing to PSALM/NPC, it is thus being required to withhold all the above-mentioned remittances.

PSALM's assumption is clear based on the following reasons: (a) the subject liability was already <b>existing</b> at the time of the EPIRA's effectivity and was transferred from NPC to PSALM by virtue of Section 49 of the law; (b) the subject liability is a "<b>Transferred Obligation</b>" as defined under the Deed of Transfer; and (c) under the EPIRA, PSALM is <b>duty-bound</b> to settle this liability.<br><br><i>Second</i>, while PSALM is directly liable for the payment of the petitioners' entitlement, We direct the petitioners to follow the proper procedure to enforce a judgment award against the government.

PSALM is directly liable for the judgment obligation</b><br><br>In Our Resolution dated June 30, 2014, we held that the separation benefits in the present case were NPC's "existing liability" at the time of the EPIRA's enactment and, thus, the same was transferred to PSALM. We explained:<br><blockquote>The separation of NPC employees affected by its reorganization and privatization was a foregone conclusion. In recognition of this, the EPIRA gave the assurance that these employees shall receive the separation pay and other benefits due them under existing laws, rules or regulations or be able to avail of the privileges under a separation plan which shall be one and one-half month salary for every year of service in the government. <b>The employees' separation being an unavoidable consequence of the mandated restructuring and privatization of the NPC, the liability to pay for their separation benefits should be deemed existing as of the EPIRA's effectivity, and were thus transferred to PSALM pursuant to Section 49 of the law.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>In its Omnibus Motion dated August 22, 2015,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> PSALM denies this liability by arguing as follows: (a) The liability to pay the separation benefits only arose after the effectivity of the EPIRA, (b) It was not among the obligations exclusively listed under the EPIRA for which PSALM shall be liable; and (c) NPC remains to be solely liable.<br><br>We disagree with PSALM.<br><br>The Court already held that herein petitioners are entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, plus back wages and other wage adjustments, less separation pay already received by virtue of the restructuring plan because they were illegally dismissed. Thus, to clarify, the liability is not limited just to <i>separation pay</i> but to the <i>full entitlement</i> of an illegally terminated employee, as We will further qualify below.<br><br><b>A. The General Rule</b><br><br>The settled rule is that an employer who terminates the employment of its employees without lawful cause or due process of law is liable for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>When the EPIRA mandated the NPC's privatization, it directed the sale, disposition, change and transfer of ownership and control of NPC's assets and IPP contracts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> for the purpose of pooling funds to liquidate NPC's liabilities. This transaction is akin to an asset sale-type corporate acquisition in the law of mergers and acquisitions where one entity-the seller-sells all or substantially all of its assets to another-the buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In <i>SME Bank, Inc. v.

Drilon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that unless expressly assumed, labor contracts such as employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements are not enforceable against a buyer of an enterprise, labor contracts being <i>in personam</i>, thus binding only between the seller-employer and its employees.<br><br>Following these rules, the NPC, as employer, is liable for the illegal dismissal and, in effect, the payment of the petitioners' entitlement.<br><br><b>B. The Exceptions</b><br><br>There are however recognized exceptions to the general rule, where the employer's liability for the separation of its employees is nonetheless devolved upon the transferee of the employer's assets.<br><br><b><i>1. The transferee acknowledges the contractual obligation to be liable for separation pay</i></b><br><br>In <i>Republic v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the government acquired Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation (Bisudeco)'s assets and identified the same for privatization. Pursuant to the privatization, the assets were transferred to the Asset Privatization Trust (APT) for conservation, provisional management, and disposal. We recognized that, as a mere transferee/conservator of Bisudeco's assets, the APT did not substitute Bisudeco as employer. The transfer was not for the purpose of continuing the latter's business. <u><b>However</b></u>, We found that the APT issued a resolution authorizing the payment of the Bisudeco employees' separation benefits. Thus, through the resolution, the APT <b>acknowledged its contractual obligation to be liable</b> for benefits arising from an employer-employee relationship <b>even though, as a mere conservator of assets, it was not supposed to be liable</b>.<br><br><b><i>2. The transferee assumes the obligation through a transfer document</i></b><br><br>On the other hand, in <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v. BPI Employees Union-Davao Chapter-Federation of Unions in BPI Unibank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> pursuant to a corporate merger, the assets and liabilities of Far East Bank &amp; Trust Company, the absorbed corporation, were transferred to the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), the surviving entity. We recognized that employment is a personal consensual contract. Thus, in mergers, the absorbed corporation's <i>employment contracts</i> are not automatically absorbed by the surviving entity. <u><b>However</b></u>, the liability for separation and other benefits due to the absorbed corporation's former employees can be transferred to the surviving <b>entity if the latter clearly assumed the obligation pursuant to the <i>articles of merger</i></b>.<br><br><b>C. The Present Case Falls Within the Exceptions</b><br><br>We reiterate Our finding in Our Resolution dated June 30, 2014 that, upon the NPC's privatization, PSALM <b>assumed</b> all of its liabilities, <b>including the separation benefits due to the petitioners</b>.<br><br>That PSALM assumed the NPC 's liability to pay these separation benefits is clear based on the following reasons: (1) The liability was already <b>existing</b> at the time of the EPIRA's effectivity and was transferred from NPC to PSALM by virtue of Section 49 of the law; (2) It is a "<b>Transferred Obligation</b>" as defined under the Deed of Transfer; and (3) Under the EPIRA, PSALM is <b>duty-bound</b> to settle the subject liability.<br><br><b><i>1. The subject liability was existing at the time of the EPJRA's effectivity and was transferred from NPC to PSALM by virtue of Section 49 of the law</i></b><br><br>The EPIRA provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 49. <i>Creation of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation.</i> - There is hereby created a government­ owned and -controlled corporation to be known as the "Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation," hereinafter referred to as the "PSALM Corp.," <b>which shall take ownership of all <u><i>existing</i> NPC</u> generation</b> assets, <u><b>liabilities</b></u>, IPP contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets. All outstanding obligations of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In Our Resolution dated June 30, 2014, the Court explained that the term "existing" in Section 49 qualified "liabilities" to mean that only those liabilities <i>existing at the time of the EPIRA 's effectivity</i> were subject of the transfer.<br><br>Verily, the liability (to pay separation benefits) here arose due to the petitioners' illegal dismissal. However, the separation from employment <i>per se</i> took place only pursuant to the EPIRA's mandate on NPC's privatization and restructuring, except that its implementation through NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 was later on invalidated.<br><br>Stated differently, since the EPIRA mandated the NPC's privatization and subsequent restructuring, the law, when it took effect on June 26, 2001, had already contemplated the termination of all NPC employees as a logical effect of its mandate. To be sure, <b>the liability to pay the full entitlement arising from the employees' separation is <u>deemed to have existed</u> upon the EPIRA's effectivity</b>.<br><br>Thus, PSALM assumed the liability to pay the petitioners' full entitlement in the present case because: (a) Section 49 of the EPIRA mandated the transfer of all <b>existing NPC liabilities</b> to PSALM, and (b) Such liability was already <b><i>existing</i></b> at the time of the EPIRA's effectivity.<br><br><b><i>2. The subject liability is a "Transferred Obligation" as defined under the Deed of Transfer</i></b><br><br>Under the EPIRA, following are valid claims against PSALM:<br><blockquote>SECTION 56. <i>Claims Against the PSALM Corp.</i> - The following shall constitute the claims against the PSALM Corp.:<br><blockquote><b>(a) NPC liabilities transferred to the PSALM Corp.;</b><br><br>(b) Transfers from the National Government; (c) New Loans; and<br><br>(d) NPC stranded contract costs.

Thus, it is now bound to ensure that it is settled.<br><br>Even if We rule that the liability was not a Transferred Obligation nor was it ever voluntarily assumed under the Deed of Transfer, it is still clear that the law itself mandated PSALM to satisfy the same. PSALM's obligation is provided in: (a) <u><b>Section 49 of the EPIRA, where it was directed to take ownership of all <i>existing</i> NPC liabilities</b></u>; and (b) <u><b>Section 50 of the EPIRA, where it was mandated to liquidate <i>all</i> NPC financial obligations</b></u>.<br><br>Clearly, PSALM cannot now turn its back on an obligation that is both contractual and statutory. Although the liability was initially imposed upon the NPC as the petitioners' employer, <u><b>the responsibility for its satisfaction now rests with PSALM</b></u>.<br><br>This ruling is not affected by Section 4, Rule 33<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of the EPIRA IRR, which provides that the "funds necessary to cover the separation pay" of all NPC employees displaced as a result of the restructuring plan "shall be provided either by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) or <b>from the NPC's corporate funds</b>."<br><br>As it now stands, after privatization, We find that the NPC's corporate funds are largely within PSALM's control.<br><br>Prior to the EPIRA, the NPC performed and derived corporate funds from three main functions: <i>generation, transmission</i>, and <i>missionary electrification</i>. Upon privatization, the NPC divested its <i>generation and transmission assets</i> but continued operations as to its <i>missionary electrification</i> function, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SECTION 70. <i>Missionary Electrification</i>. - Notwithstanding the divestment and/or privatization of NPC assets, IPP contacts and spun­off corporations, NPC shall remain as a National Government-owned and -controlled corporation <b>to perform the missionary electrification function</b> through the Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG) and shall be responsible for providing power generation and its associated power delivery systems in areas that are not connected to the transmission system. <b>The missionary electrification function shall be funded from the revenues from sales in missionary areas and <u>from the universal charge to be collected from all electricity end-users</u> as determined by the ERC.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)<br></blockquote>The <i>generation</i> function having been devolved to PSALM, all net profits from its operations also accrued in their favor after the date of transfer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the revenues from <i>missionary electrification</i> function retained by the NPC are collected from end-users via the <i>universal charge</i>.

Thus, the Court's ruling invalidating these resolutions could only affect the restructuring plan implemented in 2003.

Back wages</b><br><br>We have consistently ruled that an illegally dismissed government employee is entitled to back wages from the time of his illegal dismissal until his reinstatement because he is considered as not having left his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Following <i>Galang v.

Verily, NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 directed the termination from service of all NPC employees effective January 31, 2003. However, the NPC subsequently issued NPC Circular No. 2003-09 setting forth <b>four different dates of effectivity</b>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;" width="50%"><strong>Group</strong></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Effective date of termination</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>a) Top executives</td><td><div align="center">January 31, 2003</div></td></tr><tr><td>b) Early-leavers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></td><td><div align="center">January 15, 2003</div></td></tr><tr><td>c) Those no longer employed after June 26, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></td><td><div align="center">Date of actual separation</div></td></tr><tr><td>d) All other NPC personnel</td><td><div align="center">February 28, 2003</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Thus, back wages shall be counted <i>from</i> <b>each group's respective effective date of termination</b>, as the case may be.<br><br><b><i>2. End date</i></b><br><br>As a rule, back wages shall be computed until actual reinstatement. However, since reinstatement is no longer possible in this case, it must be computed from the petitioners' effective dates of termination <i>until</i> <b>September 14, 2007</b> or the petitioners' <b>date of retirement</b>, in case petitioners retired <i>after</i> the effective date of termination but before September 14, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>To be clear, the computation of <i>separation pay</i> is based on the length of the employee's service; and the computation of <i>back wages</i> is based on the actual period when the employee was unlawfully prevented from working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> While these two awards are reckoned from different dates, both are computed in the present case until September 14, 2007 or the date of retirement, whichever is earlier. The period of overlap is proper because the period where back wages are awarded must be included in the computation of separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><b><u>Effect of employment in the civil service immediately succeeding termination</u></b><br><br>In the recent case of <i>Campol v. Balao-As</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> the Court explained at length the rationale supporting the award of <b>full back wages</b> in favor of an illegally dismissed civil service employee, <b>without deducting any income</b> that he may have earned in case he is employed anew in another government position during the pendency of the action. In <i>Campol</i>, the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of Boliney, Abra passed a resolution in 2004 terminating Julius B. Campol as SB Secretary. In 2005, while his illegal termination case was still pending, Campol obtained another job as an administrative aide in the Public Attorney's Office. The Court ruled that Campol's PAO earnings should not be deducted from the award of full backwages, explaining as follows:<br><blockquote>This entitlement to full backwages also means that there is no need to deduct Campol's earnings from his employment with PAO from the award. The right to receive full backwages means exactly this - that it corresponds to Campol's salary at the time of his dismissal until his reinstatement. Any income he may have obtained during the litigation of the case shall not be deducted from this amount. This is consistent with our ruling that an employee illegally dismissed has the <b>right to live and to find employment elsewhere during the pendency of the case</b>. At the same time, an employer who illegally dismisses an employee has the obligation to pay him or her <b>what he or she should have received had the illegal act not be done</b>. It is an <b>employer's price or penalty</b> for illegally dismissing an employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)<br></blockquote>The Court further explained that this is also the prevailing doctrine in the award of back wages in the private sector, as previously held in <i>Bustamante v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> and <i>Equitable Banking Corporation v. Sadac</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>However, We revisit Our ruling in <i>Campol</i>. We agree with Hon. Justice Antonio T. Carpio's opinion that the award of full back wages in favor of an illegally dismissed civil service employee who was subsequently employed in another government agency certainly violates the constitutional prohibitions against double office-holding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> and double compensation in the civil service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Section 7, Article IX-B of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>Section 7. No elective official shall be eligible for appointment or designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure.<br><br>Unless otherwise allowed by law or by the primary functions of his position, no appointive official shall hold any other office or employment in the Government or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, Section 8, Article IX-B of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, nor accept without the consent of the Congress, any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind from any foreign government.<br><br>Pensions or gratuities shall not be considered as additional, double, or indirect compensation.<br></blockquote>Thus, We rule that petitioners who were subsequently: (a) rehired by the NPC, (b) absorbed by PSALM or Transco, or (c) transferred or employed by other government agencies, are not entitled to back wages.<br><br>Moreover, to award full back wages even to those who remained employed as a direct result of the 2003 reorganization amounts to unjust enrichment and damage to the government.<br><br>In the present case, the EPIRA and its IRR established policies governing the subsequent placement of all NPC employees affected by the restructuring, <i>viz</i>.: (a) giving the NPC board of directors the sole prerogative to hire the separated employees as new employees and to assign them to new positions with the corresponding compensation in accordance with its restructuring program; and (b) entitling qualified displaced or separated personnel to preference in the hiring of the manpower requirements of PSALM and Transco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to these policies and as pointed out by PSALM, there were NPC employees who were: (a) rehired by NPC or (b) absorbed by PSALM or Transco as a direct result of the 2003 reorganization (Rehired or Absorbed NPC Personnel). These personnel immediately reported for work the day after their termination from NPC. True enough, a perusal of NPC's list of employees submitted in compliance to Our Resolution dated October 20, 2014 reveals that a majority of the listed personnel were either rehired by NPC or absorbed by PSALM or Transco on March 1, 2003 or within March 2003.<br><br>These circumstances lend peculiarity to the present case, setting it apart from <i>Campol, Bustamante</i>, and <i>Equitable Banking Corporation</i>. The novelty of this case's factual backdrop is even more evident in the following:<br><br><u><i>First</i></u>, it is important to note that there was no break or gap in the rehired or absorbed NPC personnel's government service. They continuously had employment and a means to receive regular and periodic compensation. Thus, they were not deprived of the right to live nor prevented from earning a living to support their daily expenses and financial obligations. Moreover, they were not forced to seek employment elsewhere, because they were able to capitalize on the statutory preference given to them in filling up the manpower requirements in PSALM or Transco. Obviously, the evil sought to be avoided in the above-cited jurisprudence does not exist insofar as the rehired or absorbed NPC personnel are concerned.<br><br><u><i>Second</i></u>, verily, the Court nullified NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125, and consequently held that the herein petitioners were illegally dismissed. However, in the meantime, NPC proceeded to implement these resolutions. As a result, some of the petitioners were re-employed by NPC or hired by PSALM or Transco. In other words, while they may have been illegally dismissed, it cannot be denied that the rehired or absorbed NPC personnel nonetheless benefitted from the now-defunct NPB resolutions when they continued to be employed in the government and receive compensation for their service.<br><br>To allow them: (a) to enjoy, without reimbursement, the employee benefits they earned as rehired or absorbed NPC employees after termination from NPC until September 14, 2007 or the date of retirement, whichever is earlier and <i>simultaneously</i>, and (b) to benefit from the award of full back wages covering the same period is tantamount to permitting these personnel to occupy multiple positions in the civil service (<i>i.e.</i>, their original position in the NPC <i>and</i> their new position in the NPC, PSALM, or Transco after the reorganization) and to receive benefits separately for each of those positions.<br><br>It is clear that sustaining the effects of these NPB resolutions prior to nullification is incompatible with upholding the prevailing doctrine on the award of full back wages as a result of illegal separation after the same NPB resolutions were invalidated.<br><br>On the other hand, petitioners who were neither rehired by the NPC or absorbed by PSALM or Transco pursuant to the 2003 reorganization and subsequently employed in the private sector shall be entitled to full back wages (applying <i>Bustamante</i> and <i>Equitable Banking Corporation</i>).<br><br><b>C. Wage Adjustments and Other Benefits</b><br><br>In addition, We have also ruled that back wages should include <b>other monetary benefits</b> attached to the employee's salary following the principle that an illegally dismissed government employee who is later reinstated is entitled to all the rights and privileges that accrue to him/her by virtue of the office he/she held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br><b>D. Separation pay already received under the restructuring plan</b><br><br>Recall that the Court did not issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction to enjoin the implementation of NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125. In effect, the NPC proceeded with the implementation of the restructuring plan, the termination of the petitioners' employment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> and consequently the payment of the personnel's separation pay under the plan.<br><br>Thus, while the petitioners are entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, back wages, and other wage adjustments, <b>the amount they shall receive must be reduced by any separation pay each of them has already received under the separation plan</b>.<br><br><center><b>Interest and Attorney's Lien</b><br></center><br><b>A.

In this case, the Court held that, "The imposition of legal interest on the amount payable to private respondent as attorney's fees is unwarranted. Even as we agree that parties can freely stipulate on the terms of payment, still the imposition of interest in the payment of attorney's fees is not justified. In the case of <i>Cortes v. Court of Appeals</i>, we ruled that Article 2209 of the Civil Code does not even justify the imposition of legal interest on the payment of attorney's fees as it is a provision of law governing ordinary obligations and contracts. It deleted the 6% interest imposed by the appellate court on the payment of attorney's fees."
