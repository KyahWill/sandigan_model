Where the error is not one of jurisdiction, but of an error of law or fact — a mistake of judgment — appeal is the remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>On the other hand, errors of jurisdiction are those where the act or acts complained of were done without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> <i> Milwaukee Industries Corporation v. Court of Tax Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> discussed these concepts; thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>Without jurisdiction </i>denotes that the tribunal, board, or officer acted with absolute lack of authority. There is <i>excess of jurisdiction </i> when the public respondent exceeds its power or acts without any statutory authority. <i>Grave abuse of discretion </i>connotes such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction; otherwise stated, power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility; and such exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal either to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br><br>The mere allegation of grave abuse of discretion in a petition for certiorari does not mean that the petition will automatically be given due course, The general invocation of grave abuse of discretion is insufficient.&nbsp; Parties must satisfy other exacting requirements under the Rules of Court.<br><br>A petition for certiorari brought under Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court is specifically required to have "no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." Ordinarily, if an appeal can be taken from a judgment or order, then the remedy of certiorari will not lie. The mere possibility of delay arising from an appeal does not warrant direct recourse to a petition for certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, the availability of an appeal does not necessarily proscribe the institution of a petition for Certiorari if it is shown that an appeal is "inadequate, slow, insufficient and will not promptly relieve a party from the injurious effects of the order complained of."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In <i>Silvestre&nbsp; v.

Davao Lumber Company,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> where this Court underscored the standard in determining the propriety of a petition for certiorari, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The availability of the ordinary course of appeal does not constitute sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari where the appeal is not an adequate remedy or equally beneficial, speedy and sufficient. <i>It is the inadequacy not the mere absence of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually determine the propriety of certiorari.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In the present case, petitioners' allegation that the Office of the President, through then Executive Secretary Ermita, gravely abused its discretion in failing to appreciate the merits of the February 18, 1948 Decision of the Court of First Instance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; involves an error of judgment, not of jurisdiction.

Although both relate to the same Property, the February 18, 1948 Decision of the Court of First Instance was simply an agreement partitioning the bigger parcel of land, which embraced the smaller portion claimed by petitioners and private respondents. On the other hand, private respondents' free patent applications involved the establishment of their rights as the purported occupants and cultivators of the Property. Evidently, there is no identity of subject matter. The principle of <i>res judicata </i>does not apply.<br><br>In addition, the Court of First Instance did not recognize, expressly or impliedly, that private petitioners' predecessors-in-interest occupied and cultivated the Property for more than 30 years since 1915. It also did not declare petitioners' predecessors-in-interest as the <i>ipso jure</i> owners of the same.<br><br>Therefore, the February 18, 1948 Decision of the Court of First Instance cannot bar the filing of a subsequent free patent application over the Property, Likewise, petitioners cannot rely solely on this Decision to obtain free patents. Entitlement to agricultural lands of the public domain requires compliance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Act.<br><br>There are four (4) modes of disposition of agricultural lands under Section 11 of the Public Land Act, namely: "(1) for homestead settlement; (2) by sale; (3) by lease; or (4) by confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>The applicant of a homestead must be a "citizen of the Philippines over the age of eighteen years, or the head of a family[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> The applicant must prove compliance with the residency and cultivation requirements under Chapter IV of Public Land Act.

Thereby, a conclusive presumption that the applicant has performed all the conditions essential to a government grant arises, and the applicant becomes the owner of the land by virtue of an imperfect or incomplete title.

The validity or invalidity of free patents granted by the government and the corresponding certificates of title is a matter between the grantee and the government. In explaining this rule, this Court in <i>Sumail v. Court of First Instance of Cotabato</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> underscored the nature of a free patent application, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Consequently, Sumail may not bring such action or any action which would have the effect of cancelling a free patent and the corresponding certificate of title issued on the basis thereof, with the result that the land covered thereby will again form part of the public domain. <i>Furthermore, there is another reason for withholding legal personality from Sumail. He does not claim the land to be his private property. In fact, by </i><i> his application for a free patent, he had formally acknowledged and recognized the land to be a part of the public domain; this, aside from the declaration made by the cadastral court that lot 3633 was public land. Consequently, even </i><i> if the parcel were declared reverted to the public domain, Sumail does not automatically become owner thereof. He is a mere public land applicant like others who might apply for the same.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>This principle was reiterated later in <i>Cawis v.

Thus:<br><br><blockquote>[W]e must point out that petitioners' complaint questioning the validity of the sales patent and the original certificate of title over Lot No. 47 is, in reality, a reversion suit. The objective of an action for reversion of public land is the cancellation of the certificate of title and the resulting reversion of the land covered by the title to the State. This is why an action for reversion is oftentimes designated as an annulment suit or a cancellation suit.<br><br>Coming now to the first issue, Section 101 of the Public Land Act clearly states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 101. All actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.</blockquote><br><br>Even assuming that private respondent indeed acquired title to Lot No. 47 in bad faith, only the State can institute reversion proceedings, pursuant to Section 101 of the Public Land Act and our ruling in Alvarico v. Sola.<i> Private persons may not bring an action for reversion or any action which would have the effect of canceling a land patent and the corresponding certificate of title issued on the basis of the patent, such that the land covered thereby will again form part of the public domain. Only the O[ffice] [of the] S[olicitor] G[eneral] or the officer acting in his stead may do so. Since the title originated from a grant by the government, its cancellation is a matter between the grantor and the grantee.</i><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Urquiaga v. CA, </i>this Court held that there is no need to pass upon any allegation of actual fraud in the acquisition of a title based on a sales patent. Private persons have no right or interest over land considered public at the time the sales application was filed. They have no personality to question the validity of the title. <i>We further stated that granting, for the sake of argument, that fraud was committed in obtaining the title, it is the State, in a reversion case, which is the proper party to file</i><i> the necessary action.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br><i> Lorzano v.
