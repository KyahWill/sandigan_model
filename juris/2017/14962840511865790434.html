Both the Ombudsman and the CA held that such omission provides substantial basis to hold petitioner liable for the administrative offenses of Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and violation of Section 8 (A) of RA 6713, warranting the supreme penalty of dismissal from service, with all its accessory penalties.<br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>Records reveal that the element of <b>intent to commit a wrong</b> required under both the administrative offenses of Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> are lacking to warrant petitioner's dismissal from service.<br><br><b>Dishonesty is committed when an individual <u><i><b>intentionally</b></i></u> makes a false statement of any material fact,</b> practices or attempts to practice any deception or fraud in order to secure his examination, registration, appointment, or promotion. It is understood to imply the disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, betray or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; and the lack of fairness and straightforwardness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, <b>misconduct is <u><i>intentional</i></u> wrongdoing or <i><u>deliberate</u></i> violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior.</b> To constitute an administrative offense, misconduct <b>should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties of a public officer. In grave misconduct,</b> as distinguished from simple misconduct, <b>the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule must be manifest.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Without any of these elements, the transgression of an established rule is properly characterized as simple misconduct only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Most importantly, without a <b>nexus between the act complained of and the discharge of duty,</b> the charge of grave misconduct shall necessarily fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the failure to file a truthful SALN puts in doubt the integrity of the public officer or employee, and would normally amount to dishonesty. It should be emphasized, however, that mere non-declaration of the required data in the SALN does not automatically amount to such an offense. Dishonesty requires malicious intent to conceal the truth or to make false statements. In addition, a <b>public officer or employee becomes susceptible to dishonesty only when such non-declaration results in the accumulated wealth becoming manifestly disproportionate to his/her income, and income from other sources, and he/she fails to properly account or explain these sources of income and acquisitions.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Here, the Court finds that there is no substantial evidence of intent to commit a wrong, or to deceive the authorities, and conceal the other properties in petitioner's and her husband's names. Petitioner's failure to disclose in her 1997 SALN her business interest in KEI is not a sufficient badge of dishonesty in the absence of bad faith, or any malicious intent to conceal the truth or to make false statements. Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill-will for ulterior purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Notably, petitioner readily admitted in her Counter-Affidavit her business interest in KEI in 1997,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which belied any malicious intent to conceal. While concededly, the omission would increase her net worth for the year 1997, the Court observes that the Ombudsman declared respondent's evidence insufficient to warrant a finding that petitioner had any unexplained wealth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> On the contrary, it found that her children have the financial capacity to put up KEI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It should be emphasized that <b>the laws on SALN aim to curtail the acquisition of unexplained wealth.</b> Thus, in several cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> <b>where the source of the undisclosed wealth was properly accounted for, the Court deemed the same an "explained wealth" which the law does not penalize.</b> Consequently, absent any intent to commit a wrong, and having accounted for the source of the "undisclosed wealth," as in this case, petitioner cannot be adjudged guilty of the charge of Dishonesty; but at the most, of mere negligence for having failed to accomplish her SALN properly and accurately.<br><br>Negligence is the omission of the diligence which is required by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the persons, of the time, and of the place. <b>In the case of public officials, there is negligence when there is a breach of duty or failure to perform the obligation,</b> and there is gross negligence when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <b>An act done in good faith, which constitutes only an error of judgment and for no ulterior motives and/or purposes,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><b> as in the present case, is merely Simple Negligence.</b><br><br>In the same vein, petitioner's failure to declare the Galant sedan in her SALNs from 1997 to 2003 stemmed from the fact that the same was registered in her husband's name, and purportedly purchased out of his personal money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> While such bare allegation is not enough to overthrow the presumption that the car was conjugal, neither is there sufficient showing that petitioner was motivated by bad faith in not disclosing the same. In fact, the Ombudsman conceded that petitioner's husband was financially capable of purchasing the car,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> negating any "unexplained wealth" to warrant petitioner's dismissal due to Dishonesty.<br><br>Likewise, the charge of Grave Misconduct against petitioner must fail. Verily, the omission to include the subject properties in petitioner's SALNs, by itself, does not amount to Grave Misconduct, in the absence of showing that such omission had, in some way, hindered the rendition of sound public service for there is no direct relation or connection between the two.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court finds no reason to hold petitioner liable for the charges of Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct, but declares her guilty, instead, of Simple Negligence in accomplishing her SALN. Simple Negligence is akin to Simple Neglect of Duty,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> which is a less grave offense punishable with suspension without pay for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months, for the first offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Since the penalty of suspension can no longer be imposed on account of petitioner's resignation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and considering that she readily admitted her omissions which do not appear to have been attended by any bad faith or fraudulent intent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court finds that the penalty of fine in the amount equivalent to one (1) month and one (1) day<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of petitioner's last salary is reasonable and just under the premises.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
