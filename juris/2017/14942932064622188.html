Philippine National Bank</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The doctrine protecting mortgagees and innocent purchasers in good faith emanates from the social interest embedded in the legal concept granting indefeasibility of titles. The burden of discovery of invalid transactions relating to the property covered by a title appearing regular on its face is shifted from the third party relying on the title to the co-owners or the predecessors of the title holder. Between the third party and the co-owners, it will be the latter that will be more intimately knowledgeable about the status of the property and its history. The costs of discovery of the basis of invalidity, thus, are better borne by them because it would naturally be lower. A reverse presumption will only increase costs for the economy, delay transactions, and, thus, achieve a less optimal welfare level for the entire society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>Philippine Banking Corporation v. Dy, et al.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this Court explained this concept in relation to banks: </p><blockquote> <p> Primarily, it bears noting that the doctrine of "mortgagee in good faith" is based on the rule that all persons dealing with property covered by a Torrens Certificate of Title are not required to go beyond what appears on the face of the title. This is in deference to the public interest in upholding the indefeasibility of a certificate of title as evidence of lawful ownership of the land or of any encumbrance thereon. In the case of banks and other financial institutions, however, greater care and due diligence are required since they are imbued with public interest, failing which renders the mortgagees in bad faith. Thus, before approving a loan application, it is a standard operating practice for these institutions to conduct an ocular inspection of the property offered for mortgage and to verify the genuineness of the title to determine the real owner(s) thereof. The apparent purpose of an ocular inspection is to protect the "true owner" of the property as well as innocent third parties with a right, interest or claim thereon from a usurper who may have acquired a fraudulent certificate of title thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Further, in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Corpuz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> As a rule, the Court would not expect a mortgagee to conduct an exhaustive investigation of the history of the mortgagor's title before he extends a loan. But petitioner ... is not an ordinary mortgagee; it is a bank. Banks are expected to be more cautious than ordinary individuals in dealing with lands, even registered ones, since the business of banks is imbued with public interest. It is of judicial notice that the standard practice for banks before approving a loan is to send a staff to the property offered as collateral and verify the genuineness of the title to determine the real owner or owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> On petitioner's claim that it was a mortgagee in good faith, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner "was actually remiss in its duty to ascertain the title of [respondents Eduardo and Nenita] to the property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The Court of Appeals' Decision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> During trial, appellant [Land Bank] presented its Account Officer Randy Quijano who testified that while it conducted a credit investigation and inspection of the subject property as stated in its Credit Investigation Report dated March 17, 1998, a perusal of the report and the testimony of the account officer failed to establish that the bank's standard operating procedure in accepting the property as security, including having investigators visit the subject property and appraise its value were followed.</p> <p> At the most, the report and the testimonial evidence presented were limited to the credit investigation report conducted by Randy Quijano who, in turn relied on the report made by its field officers. [Land Bank's] field officers who allegedly visited the property and conducted interviews with the neighbors and verified the status of the property with the courts and the police were not presented. At the most, We find [Land Bank's] claim of exhaustive investigation was a just generalization of the bank's operating procedure without any showing if the same has been followed by its officers.</p> <p> The Credit Investigation Report also does not corroborate the material allegations of [Land Bank] that verifications were made with the Treasurer's Office and the courts and the owners of the adjoining properties. For one, the report failed to mention the names of the adjoining owners or neighbors whom the credit investigation team were able to interview; second, the report did not mention the status of the realty taxes covering the property although Land Bank is now claiming that [Eduardo and Nenita] were up to date in paying the realty taxes. No certification from the Treasurer's Office was presented to prove [Land Bank's] claim that [Eduardo and Nenita] were the one[s] regularly paying the taxes on the said property.</p> <p> Moreover, what further militates against the claim of [Land Bank's] good faith is the fact that TCT No. 304649 which was mortgaged to the bank, was issued by virtue of a Decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board] Region III dated December 29, 1997. The said Decision was, however, inscribed only on February 25, 1998, after the issuance of TCT No. 304649 on February 8, 1998. In addition, the property was mortgaged to [Land Bank] a few days after the inscription of the alleged Decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board]. This circumstance should have aroused a suspicion on the part of [Land Bank] and anyone who deliberately ignores a significant fact that would create suspicion in an otherwise reasonable person cannot be considered as a mortgagee in good faith.</p> <p> We quote the following disquisitions of the trial court on the Land Bank's apparent bad faith in the transaction:</p> <blockquote> <p> "[Land Bank] however tried to show that the title of the land owned by Jovita Musni was cancelled by virtue of a decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform] Adjudication Board, Region III and in lieu thereof TCT No. 304649 was issued in favor of Nenita Sonza et.al. The date of the decision in (sic) December 29, 1997 but inscribed only on February 25, 1998. If this were so, why is it that Nenita Santos was issued TCT No. 304649 on February 8, 1998, before the Decision was inscribed. Defendant Nenita Santos never mentioned any decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board] awarding the lot to her."</p> </blockquote> <p>. . . .</p> <p> The cited case of <em>Philippine Veterans Bank vs. Monillas</em> is not controlling to Land Bank's case. In the said case, [Philippine Veterans Bank] has the right to rely on what appears on the certificate of title because of the absence of any infirmity that would cast cloud on the mortgagor's title. The situation is different in the present case since the certificate of title (TCT No. 304649) apparently shows the defect in the owner's title. As previously stated, the title of [Eduardo and Nenita] to the subject property was dubious because the certificate of title was issued before the inscription of the Decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board]. Accordingly, Land Bank cannot be considered a mortgagee in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals also found that petitioner was not an innocent purchaser for value: </p><blockquote> <p> Neither can We also consider [Land Bank] as an innocent purchaser for value because the subject property was foreclosed on May 4, 1999 while the complaint for falsification was filed on March 4, 1999.</p> <p> A purchaser in good faith is one who buys property without notice that some other person has a right to or interest in such property and pays its fair price before he has notice of the adverse claims and interest of another person in the same property. Clearly, the factual circumstances as afore-cited surrounding the acquisition of the disputed property do not make [Land Bank] an innocent purchaser for value or a purchaser in good faith. Thus, We are in accord with the ruling of the trial court in that:</p> <blockquote> <p> "In the instant case, the Court cannot consider the Land Bank of the Philippines as innocent purchaser for value. With all its resources, it could have ascertained how Nenita Sonza acquired the land mortgaged to it and later foreclosed by it. The fact the land (sic) was foreclosed after Criminal Case No. 4066-99 was instituted should have warned it. The questionable ownership of Nenita Sonza for it and its employees to obtain knowledge of the questionable transfer of the land to Nenita Sonza. Its failure to take the necessary steps or action shall make the bank liable for damages. The bank shall be responsible for its and its employer shortcomings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner's defense that it could not have known the criminal action since it was not a party to the case and that there was no notice of <em>lis pendens</em> filed by respondent Musni, is unavailing. This Court held in <em>Heirs of Gregorio Lopez v. Development Bank of the Philippines</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The rule on "innocent purchasers or [mortgagees] for value" is applied more strictly when the purchaser or the mortgagee is a bank. Banks are expected to exercise higher degree of diligence in their dealings, including those involving lands. Banks may not rely simply on the face of the certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Had petitioner exercised the degree of diligence required of banks, it would have ascertained the ownership of one of the properties mortgaged to it.</p><p> Where "the findings of fact of the trial courts are affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the same are accorded the highest degree of respect and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal[;] Such findings are binding and conclusive on this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Accordingly, this Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the findings of the trial court, that petitioner is neither a mortgagee in good faith nor an innocent purchaser for value.</p><p align="center"><strong> II</strong> </p><p> Petitioner is not entitled to the award of P448,000.00 as damages.</p><p> In its Decision, the trial court ordered respondents Nenita and Eduardo to pay petitioner damages in the amount equivalent to the appraised value of the property being claimed by respondent Musni.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The Court of Appeals deleted the award, and held that: </p><blockquote> <p> In so ruling, the trial court resorted to a partial nullification of the real estate mortgage executed by [respondents Spouses Santos] and [Land Bank] because while maintaining the validity of the mortgage over the parcel of land with an area of 800 square meters, the trial court however, partially nullified the mortgage pertaining to the parcel of land containing an area of 24, 937 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals considered the grant of award as a partial extinguishment of the real estate mortgage, which is not allowed. Since the mortgage is indivisible, the Court of Appeals nullified the real estate mortgage involving the two properties, and deleted the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> Although the Court of Appeals' basis for deleting the award is erroneous, this Court affirms the removal on a different ground.</p><p> The Court of Appeals misconstrued the award given by the trial court. When the trial court awarded the amount of P448,000.00, it did so in representation of the damages that petitioner suffered "by reason of the mortgage, foreclosure[,] and consolidation of the land in its name."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The award was meant to compensate petitioner for the loss it suffered in transacting with respondents Spouses Santos and Eduardo.</p><p> Nonetheless, this Court affirms the removal of the damages since petitioner did not seek relief from the Court with clean hands. Petitioner may have incurred losses when it entered into the mortgage transaction with respondents Spouses Santos and Eduardo, and the corresponding foreclosure sale. However, the losses could have been avoided if only petitioner exercised the required due diligence.</p><p> This Court notes that both lower courts erroneously reconveyed TCT No. 333352 to respondent Musni, despite finding that only one of the properties covered by the title was in question. Thus, the consolidated title should be cancelled before the reconveyance of the subject property.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated February 29, 2012, and the Resolution dated March 12, 2013 are <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with the following <strong>MODIFICATIONS</strong>: </p><ol><li> TCT No. 333352 is hereby <strong>CANCELLED</strong>; <br> </li><li>Eduardo Sonza and Nenita Sonza Santos are hereby ordered to reconvey TCT No. 304649 to Lorenzo Musni; and<br> </li><li> Lorenzo Musni is directed to pay Nenita Sonza Santos and Ireneo Santos the amount of P286,640.82, with legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum computed from the date of judicial demand on March 15, 2002 up to June 30, 2013, and at 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.</li></ol> <p><strong> SO ORDERED. </strong> </p><p> <i>Carpio (Chairperson), Peralta, Mendoza</i>, and <i>Jardeleza, JJ</i>., concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo,</em> pp. 9-31. <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 32-50.
