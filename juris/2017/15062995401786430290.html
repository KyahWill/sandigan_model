No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund.</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p>Section 229. <em>Recovery of Tax Erroneously or Illegally Collected</em>. - No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner; but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.</p> <p> In any case, no such suit or proceeding shall be filed after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty regardless of any supervening cause that may arise after payment: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commissioner may, even without a written claim therefor, refund or credit any tax, where on the face of the return upon which payment was made, such payment appears clearly to have been erroneously paid.</p> </blockquote> <p> The procedure outlined above provides that a claim for refund of excessively or erroneously collected taxes should be made within two (2) years from the date the taxes are paid. Both the administrative and judicial claims should be brought within the two (2)-year prescriptive period. Otherwise, they shall forever be barred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> However, Section 229 presupposes that the taxes sought to be refunded were wrongfully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></p><p> It is unnecessary to construe and harmonize Sections 112(C) and 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Excess input tax or creditable input tax is not an excessively, erroneously, or illegally collected tax because the taxpayer pays the proper amount of input tax at the time it is collected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> That a VAT-registered taxpayer incurs excess input tax does not mean that it was wrongfully or erroneously paid. It simply means that the input tax is greater than the output tax, entitling the taxpayer to carry over the excess input tax to the succeeding taxable quarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> If the excess input tax is derived from zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions, the taxpayer may either seek a refund of the excess or apply the excess against its other internal revenue tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup></p><p> The distinction between "excess input tax" and "excessively collected taxes" can be understood further by examining the production process vis-a-vis the VAT system. In <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The input VAT is not "excessively" collected as understood under Section 229 because at the time the input VAT is collected the amount paid is correct and proper. The input VAT is a tax liability of, and legally paid by, a VAT-registered seller of goods, properties or services used as input by another VAT-registered person in the sale of his own goods, properties, or services. This tax liability is true even if the seller passes on the input VAT to the buyer as part of the purchase price. The second VAT-registered person, who is not legally liable for the input VAT, is the one who applies the input VAT as credit for his own output VAT. If the input VAT is in fact "excessively" collected as understood under Section 229, then it is the first VAT-registered person — the taxpayer who is legally liable and who is deemed to have legally paid for the input VAT — who can ask for a tax refund or credit under Section 229 as an ordinary refund or credit outside of the VAT System. In such event, the second VAT-registered taxpayer will have no input VAT to offset against his own output VAT.</p> <p> In a claim for refund or credit of "excess" input VAT under Section 110 (B) and Section 112 (A), the input VAT is not "excessively" collected as understood under Section 229. At the time of payment of the input VAT the amount paid is the correct and proper amount. Under the VAT System, there is no claim or issue that the input VAT is "excessively" collected, that is, that the input VAT paid is more than what is legally due. The person legally liable for the input VAT cannot claim that he overpaid the input VAT by the mere existence of an "excess" input VAT. The term<em> "excess" input VAT simply means that the input VAT available as credit exceeds the output VAT, not that the input VAT is excessively collected because it is more than what is legally due</em>. Thus, the taxpayer who legally paid the input VAT cannot claim for refund or credit of the input VAT as "excessively" collected under Section 229.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Considering that creditable input tax is not an excessively, erroneously, or illegally collected tax, Section 112(A) and (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code govern: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 112. <em>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax</em>. - </p> <p>(A) <em>Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales</em>. — Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108 (B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): <em>Provided, further</em>, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p>(C) <em>Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made</em>. — In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.</p> <p> In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.</p> </blockquote> <p> Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code provides two (2) possible scenarios.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> The first is when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denies the administrative claim for refund within 120 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> The second is when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue fails to act within 120 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Taxpayers must await either for the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or for the lapse of 120 days before filing their judicial claims with the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Failure to observe the 120-day period renders the judicial claim premature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></p><p> CE Luzon's reliance on <em>Atlas</em> is misplaced because <em>Atlas</em> did not squarely address the issue regarding the prescriptive period in filing judicial claims for refund of creditable input tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> <em>Atlas</em> did not expressly or impliedly interpret Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> The main issue in <em>Atlas</em> was the reckoning point of the two (2)-year prescriptive period stated in Section 112(A).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> The interpretation in <em>Atlas</em> was later rectified in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

In determining whether <span style="font-style: italic;">Aichi</span>'s judicial claim for refund of creditable input tax was timely filed, this Court declared: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 112 (D) of the NIRC clearly provides that the CIR has "120 days, from the date of the submission of the complete documents in support of the application [for tax refund/credit]," within which to grant or deny the claim. In case of full or partial denial by the CIR, the taxpayer's recourse is to file an appeal before the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the decision of the CIR. However, if after the 120-day period the CIR fails to act on the application for tax refund/credit, the remedy of the taxpayer is to appeal the inaction of the CIR to CTA within 30 days. </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> Respondent's assertion that the non-observance of the 120-day period is not fatal to the filing of a judicial claim as long as both the administrative and the judicial claims are filed within the two-year prescriptive period has no legal basis. </p> <p> There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC to support respondent's view. Subsection (A) of the said provision states that "any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales." The phrase "within two (2) years . . . apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund" refers to applications for refund/credit filed with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA. This is apparent in the first paragraph of subsection (D) of the same provision, which states that the CIR has "120 days from the submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B)" within which to decide on the claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The <em>Aichi</em> doctrine was reiterated by this Court in <em>San Roque</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> which held that the 120-day and 30-day periods in Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code are both mandatory and jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> </p><p> In the present case, only CE Luzon's second quarter claim was filed on time.
