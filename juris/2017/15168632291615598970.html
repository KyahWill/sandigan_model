Respondents made efforts in communicating with petitioners, specifically, through complainant Layaona, but to no avail. As a result, respondents were compelled to engage the services of other personnel for the completion of the QC project.

Michael M. Racelis, and hired Malcolm Law as their new counsel; and, (3) due to lack of material time, volume and pressure of work, they cannot complete the motion within the period allowed by the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure. Subsequently, respondents filed a <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on August 20, 2015, arguing, among others, that: since there was no proper service of the petitioners' <i>Memorandum of Appeal with Notice of Appeal</i> to respondents, there was no perfected appeal, hence, the LA's decision has attained finality; the petitioners proffered no evidence that they were either dismissed from employment or that they were prevented from returning to work or otherwise deprived of any work assignment; and, the petitioners are not entitled to backwages and separation pay since they failed to prove that they were illegally dismissed. </p><p> Both motions, however, were denied in the NLRC's September 29, 2015 resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The NLRC ruled that the motion for extension was denied since the substitution of counsel was not a valid ground to extend the period to file a motion for reconsideration. Consequently, the motion for reconsideration proper, was deemed to have been filed out of time. </p><p> Unfazed, respondents elevated the matter to the CA by filing a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, urgently praying for a <i>Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p> On November 8, 2016, the CA rendered a decision, granting the petition and reversing the NLRC decision. The CA brushed aside technicalities and ruled that the NLRC is given the discretion to exercise liberality to enable it to ascertain the facts of the case speedily and objectively without any ill intent to wear out the laborer's resources. The CA found that respondents were not in any way motivated to unnecessarily delay the resolution of the case. The CA likewise ruled that the petitioners failed to establish the fact of their dismissal and that they abandoned their employment. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, finding the petition to be impressed with merit, the same is hereby GRANTED. The assailed NLRC resolutions are hereby ANNULLED, and a new judgment is hereby ENTERED finding no unlawful termination of private respondents' employment in the case at bar.

Failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the decision is a procedural defect that generally warrants a dismissal of the petition for<em> certiorari</em>''.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, "We held that despite procedural lapses, fundamental consideration of substantial justice may warrant this Court to decide a case on the merits rather than dismiss it on a technicality. In so doing, We exercise our prerogative in labor cases that no undue sympathy is to be accorded to any claim of procedural misstep, the idea being that our power must be exercised according to justice and equity and substantial merits of the controversy",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in order to avoid further delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> Likewise, the NLRC is not restricted by the technical rules of procedure and is allowed to be liberal in the application of its rules in hearing and deciding labor cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Under Section 2, Rule I of the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure and reiterated verbatim in the same provision of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, it is provided that: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><em>Section 2. Construction</em>.</b> — These Rules shall be liberally construed to carry out the objectives of the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines and other relevant legislations, and to assist the parties in obtaining just, expeditious and inexpensive resolution and settlement of labor disputes. </p> </blockquote> <p> Then, too, under Section 10, Rule VII of both the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure and the 2011 NLRC Rules, it is also identically stated that: </p><blockquote> <p> <em><strong>Section 10. Technical Rules Not Binding. </strong></em>— The rules of procedure and evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity shall not be controlling and the Commission shall use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process. </p> <p> In any proceeding before the Commission, the parties may be represented by legal counsel but it shall be the duty of the Chairman, any Presiding Commissioner or Commissioner to exercise complete control of the proceedings at all stages. </p> </blockquote> <p> In view of the factual circumstances of the case, We are persuaded that the rigid rules of procedure must give way to the demands of substantial justice, and that the case must be decided on the merits. Indeed, the prevailing trend is to accord party litigants the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of their causes, free from the constraints of needless technicalities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> especially so in this case where the varying and conflicting factual deliberations of the LA, the NLRC and the CA are factored in. </p><p> Thus, the CA committed no error when it admitted Ablaze's petition for certiorari, and had jurisdiction over said petition. </p><p> <i>Substantial:</i> </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Neither illegal dismissal by the employer nor abandonment by the employees exists in this case </i></b>—</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>This Court is aware of the familiar rule in labor cases that the employer has the burden of proving that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, We stress that it remains incumbent upon the employees that they should first establish by competent evidence the fact of their dismissal from employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Since an allegation is not evidence, it is elementary that a party alleging a critical fact must support his allegation with substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It has also been held that the evidence to prove the fact of dismissal must be clear, positive and convincing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Stated otherwise, in cases of illegal dismissal, before the employer must bear the burden of proof to establish that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause, the employees must first prove by substantial evidence the fact of their dismissal from service. Logically, if there is no dismissal, then there can be no question as to the legality or illegality thereof, as in this case. </p><p> Here, there is no ample evidence to establish a<em> prima facie </em>case that petitioners were dismissed from employment. That they were told on February 28, 2014 by one of respondents' project engineer that their employment has been terminated since there is no more work to be done is at best, speculative. The identity of the project engineer was not revealed. There is even no proof that respondents authorized the unnamed project engineer, or any project engineer for that matter, to notify the petitioners of their alleged dismissal. Petitioners were likewise inconsistent as to the date of their alleged employment and under what particular circumstance were they dismissed from employment. Respondents, on the other hand, presented affidavits executed by their project engineers, Engr. Calma and Engr. Bacalso, Jr., who adamantly denied that they eased the petitioners out of their employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> As correctly observed by the LA, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> There would be no dismissal committed by respondents, actual, or constructive, as complainants have failed to substantiate their allegation that there was in fact a dismissal "On 28 February 2014, a Project Engineer of Respondent Corporation told them that they are terminated from their employment since there was no work to be done, even if the phase on which they were working was not yet completed," whereas respondents substantiated their denial of any dismissal effected thru the Affidavits of their two project engineers, one Romeo Calma and Pedro Bacalso, Jr., Project Site Engineers, Pedro Bacalso, Jr. being the Project Engineer at the Races Avenue QC Finishing phase Project whereof complainants were last engaged as project employees, and denying under oath of having told complainants on 2/28/2014 that they were already terminated, re their allegation that "On 28 February 2014, a Project Engineer of Respondent Corporation told them that they are terminated from their employment since there was no work to be done, even if the phase on which they were working was not yet completed." </p> <p> Of note, adding to this disbelief as to complainants (sic) claim of constructive dismissal is that complainants stated in their complaint that the date of their respective dismissal was Froel Pu-od - "FEBRUARY 2014," Bombom Layaona "01-2014" Joel Pu-od "01-2014" Danilo Orsal "11-2003) (sic) and Joseph Flores "02-2014" whereas in their position paper, they all inconsistently alleged a single date on 2/28/2014 of having been told of their dismissal by a Project Engineer, which makes it impossibly hard to tie the knots of credibility to this allegation of constructive dismissal. Moreover, complainants did not even present even a speck of assertion, far less any evidence as to the motivation or factual circumstances why they would be discriminated, harassed, their employment made unbearable as defined in a charge of constructive dismissal, and eventually dismissed on 2/28/2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> [Citations Omitted.] </p> </blockquote> <p> The records are likewise bereft of any indication that petitioners were barred from respondents' premises or were otherwise deprived of any work assignment after the alleged verbal dismissal. On the contrary, the evidence showed that respondents tried to contact them, but its effort was to no avail. Consequently, respondents learned that petitioners were already reporting for work in another construction company. </p><p> Thus, in the absence of any showing of an overt or positive act proving that respondents had dismissed petitioners, the latter's claim of illegal dismissal cannot be sustained as the same would be self-serving, conjectural and of no probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Be that as it may, however, the Court finds that petitioners did not abandon their employment, as erroneously claimed by the respondents. </p><p> Abandonment is a matter of intention and cannot lightly be presumed from certain equivocal acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It is incumbent upon the employer to prove the two elements that must concur in order for an act to constitute abandonment: First, respondents must provide evidence that petitioners failed to report for work for an unjustifiable reason. Second, respondents must prove petitioners' overt acts showing a clear intention to sever their ties with their employer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> with the second element as the more determinative factor, and being manifested by some overt acts. </p><p> The record shows that respondents proffered nothing beyond bare allegations to prove that petitioners had abandoned their employment. Although respondents made an effort in requiring petitioners to return to work, there was neither proof that petitioners' failure to comply with the same was for an unjustifiable reason; nor was there any proof that petitioners' absence amounted to a clear intention to sever their employment. Indeed, the mere absence or failure to report for work, even after notice to return, does not necessarily amount to abandonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> This Court recalls to mind that petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal without opting to be reinstated, and admitting in their <em>Rejoinder</em> that reinstatement is no longer feasible due to strained relationship. </p><p> This act of filing the complaint is inconsistent with abandonment of employment. This effectively negates any suggestion that they had the intention to abandon their employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Verily, respondents failed to show a clear proof of deliberate and unjustified intent on the part of the petitioners to sever the employer­ employee relationship. The operative act is still the employees' ultimate act of putting an end to their employment, which is totally missing in this case. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><em><strong>Deletion of Award of Backwages and Separation Pay — </strong></em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In cases where there is both an absence of illegal dismissal on the part of the employer and an absence of abandonment on the part of the employees, the remedy is reinstatement but without backwages. However, considering that the reinstatement was already impossible by reason of the strained relations of the parties, and the fact that petitioners already found another employment, each party must bear his or her own loss, thus, placing them on equal footing. </p><p> Thus, in <em><strong>MZR Industries, et.al. v. Majen Colambot,</strong></em> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> We held that: </p><blockquote> <p> These circumstances, taken together,<em><strong> the lack of evidence of dismissal and the lack of intent on the part of the respondent to abandon his work, the remedy is reinstatement but without backwages. However, considering that reinstatement is no longer applicable due to the strained relationship between the parties and that Colambot already found another employment, each party must bear his or her own loss, thus, placing them on equal footing</strong></em>. </p> <p> Verily, <em><strong>in a case where the employee's failure to work was occasioned neither by his abandonment nor by a termination, the burden of economic loss is not rightfully shifted to the employer; each party must bear his own loss</strong></em>.[Emphasis Supplied.] </p> </blockquote> <p> So too, in <em><strong>John L. Borja and Aubrey L. Borja/Dong Juan v. Randy B. Miñoza and Alaine S. Bandalan</strong></em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> wherein this Court deleted the award of separation pay in a factual situation analogous to the instant case, We explained that: </p><blockquote> <p> "Therefore, since respondents were not dismissed and that they were not considered to have abandoned their jobs, it is only proper for them to report back to work and for petitioners to reinstate them to their former positions or substantially-equivalent positions. In this regard, jurisprudence provides that in instances where there was neither dismissal by the employer nor abandonment by the employee, the proper remedy is to reinstate the employee to his former position, but without the award of backwages. However, since reinstatement was already impossible due to strained relations between the parties, as found by the NLRC, each of them must bear their own loss, so as to place them on equal footing. At this point, it is well to emphasize that 'in a case where the employee's failure to work was occasioned neither by his abandonment nor by a termination, the burden of economic loss is not rightfully shifted to the employer; each party must bear his own loss.' </p> <p> In sum, the NLRC ruling holding that <em><strong>respondents were not constructively dismissed and that they did not abandon their jobs must be reinstated, subject to the modification that the award of separation pay in their favor must be deleted.</strong></em>" [Emphasis Supplied.] </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the doctrines embodied in the aforementioned cases, this Court is constrained to rule that the petitioners are not entitled to the award of backwages and separation pay. </p><p> To restate, considering that petitioners' cessation of employment was neither brought about by abandonment nor illegal dismissal, and their reinstatement is no longer feasible due to strained relations and because they did not opt to be reinstated, coupled with the fact that they already found employment elsewhere, the legal effect is that the burden of economic loss is not rightfully shifted to the employer; the parties must bear the burden of their own loss. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, We <strong>DENY</strong> the petition. The Decision dated November 8, 2016 and Resolution dated March 20, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142970, are hereby <strong>REVERSED</strong> and<strong> SET ASIDE</strong> and a new judgment is rendered declaring petitioners' failure to prove the fact of their dismissal; and that respondent-company in turn, failed to show abandonment on the part of the petitioners. Thus, petitioners are not entitled to their money claims, either in the form of backwages or separation pay. </p><p><strong> SO ORDERED.</strong> </p><p> <em>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo</em>, and <em>Jardeleza, JJ</em>., concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 11-32. <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Romeo F.
