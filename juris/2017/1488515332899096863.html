In addition, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, <i>i.e.</i>, (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land, (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties, (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property, and the income therefrom, (<i>d</i>) the owner's sworn valuation, (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations, (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors, (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (<i>h</i>) the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>However, it bears pointing out that while Congress passed <b>RA 9700</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> on August 7, 2009, further amending certain provisions of RA 6657, as amended, among them, Section 17, its implementing rules, <i>i.e.</i>, DAR AO 2, Series of 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> clarified that the said law shall not apply to claims/cases where the <b>claim folders were received by the LBP prior to July 1, 2009</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In such a situation, just compensation <b>shall be determined in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, <i>prior to its further amendment by RA 9700</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In <i>LBP v. Kho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court had succinctly explained the "cut-off rule" in the application of RA 9700:<br><blockquote>It is significant to stress, however, that DAR AO 1, series of 2010 which was issued in line with Section 31 of RA 9700 empowering the DAR to provide the necessary rules and regulations for its implementation, became effective only <u><i>subsequent to July 1. 2009</i></u>. Consequently, it cannot be applied in the determination of just compensation for the subject land where the claim folders were undisputedly received by the LBP <u><i>prior to July 1, 2009</i></u>, and, as such, <u>should be valued in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657 prior to its further amendment by RA 9700</u> pursuant to the cut-off date set under DAR AO 2, series of 2009 (cut-off rule). Notably, DAR AO 1, series of 2010 did not expressly or impliedly repeal the cut-off rule set under DAR AO 2, series of 2009, having made no reference to any cut-off date with respect to land valuation for previously acquired lands under PD 27 and EO 228 wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners. Consequently, the application of DAR AO 1, series of 2010 should be, thus, limited to those where the claim folders were received <u><i>on or subsequent to July 1, 2009</i></u>. (Emphases and underlining supplied)<br></blockquote>Following the above dictum, since the claim folder covering the subject land was received by the LBP on December 2, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> or prior to July 1, 2009, the RTC should have computed just compensation using pertinent DAR regulations applying Section 17 of RA 6657 prior to its amendment by RA 9700 instead of adopting the new DAR issuance. While the RTC, acting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC), is not strictly bound by the different formula created by the DAR since the valuation of property or the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts, and not with administrative agencies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> it must explain and justify in clear terms the reason for any deviation from the prescribed factors and the applicable formula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court has gone over the records and found that neither the RTC nor the CA considered the date when the claim folder was received nor explained their reasons for deviating from the DAR formula. Therefore, as it stands, the RTC and the CA should have utilized the basic formula prescribed and laid down in pertinent DAR regulations existing prior to the passage of RA 9700, in determining the just compensation for the subject land.<br><br>Accordingly, while the parties did not raise as issue the <i>improper</i> application of DAR AO 1, Series of 2010, the Court finds the need to <b><u><i>remand</i></u></b> the case to the RTC for the determination of just compensation to <b>ensure compliance with the law, and to give everyone - the landowner, the farmers, and the State - their due</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> To this end, the RTC is hereby directed to observe the following guidelines in the remand of the case:<br><br><b><u>1.</u> <i>Just compensation must be valued at the time of taking</i></b>, or the time when the owner was deprived of the use and benefit of his property, in this case, when emancipation patents were issued in the names of the farmer ­ beneficiaries in 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, the evidence to be presented by the parties before the RTC for the valuation of the subject land must be based on the <u>values prevalent on such time of taking for like agricultural lands</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b><u>2.</u> <i>Just compensation must be arrived at pursuant to the guidelines set forth in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its amendment by RA 9700</i>.</b> However, the RTC is reminded that while it should take into account the different formula created by the DAR in arriving at the just compensation for the subject land, it is not strictly bound thereto if the situations before it do not warrant their application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In any event, should the RTC find the said guidelines to be inapplicable, it must clearly explain the reasons for deviating therefrom, and for using other factors or formula in arriving at the reasonable just compensation for the acquired property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b><u>3.</u> <i>Interest may be awarded as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case and based on prevailing jurisprudence</i>.</b> In previous cases, the Court has allowed the grant of legal interest in expropriation cases where there is delay in the payment since the just compensation due to the landowners was deemed to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Legal interest on the unpaid balance shall be pegged at the rate of 12% p.a. from the time of taking in 1989 when Emancipation Patents were issued, until June 30, 2013 only. Thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due the landowners shall earn interest at the new legal rate of 6% p.a.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> in line with the amendment introduced by <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i>-Monetary Board Circular No. 799,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Series of 2013.<br><br>For guidance of the bench, the bar, and the public, we reiterate the rule: Out of regard for the DAR's expertise as the concerned implementing agency, courts should henceforth consider the factors stated in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, as translated into the applicable DAR formulas in their determination of just compensation for the properties covered by the said law. If, in the exercise of their judicial discretion, courts find that a strict application of said formulas is not warranted under the specific circumstances of the case before them, they may deviate or depart therefrom, provided that this departure or deviation is supported by a reasoned explanation grounded on the evidence on record. In other words, courts of law possess the power to make a final determination of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Amended Decision dated October 24, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
