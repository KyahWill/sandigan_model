Agreeing with the trial court, the Court of Appeals explained that it would only be fair and equitable to impose a straight 12% per annum on the total amount due starting October 1994, rather than the 2% penalty per month on top of the 20% and 7.5% interest on the peso and dollar obligation, respectively, being demanded by the Bank.<br><br>Petitioners now contend that since the trial and appellate courts found the stipulated interests and penalty charges to be excessive and iniquitous,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> then the amounts of P17,995,214.47 and US$289,730.10 adjudged against them (which already incorporated the interests and penalty charges) should have been reduced to the actual unpaid principals of P12,957,500.00 and US$209,941.55, respectively, devoid of any interests and penalty charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Security Bank counters that petitioners raise purely factual questions, which are not proper in a Rule 45 petition before this Court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and petitioners' arguments were a mere rehash of their arguments before the Court of Appeals, which have already been judiciously passed upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioners are mistaken.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court did not delete altogether the 2% monthly penalty charges and stipulated interests of 7.5% (on the dollar obligations) and 20% (on peso obligations). The trial court, in fact, adjudged petitioner Erma liable to pay the amounts of P17,995,214.47 and US$289,730.10, inclusive of the stipulated interest and penalty as of October 31, 1994, on the basis of Article 1308<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the Civil Code and jurisprudential pronouncements on the obligatory force of contracts - not otherwise contrary to law, morals, good customs or public policy - between contracting parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The stipulated 7.5% or 21% per annum interest constitutes the monetary or conventional interest for borrowing money and is allowed under Article 1956 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> On the other hand, the penalty charge of 2% per month accrues from the time of Erma's default in the payment of the principal and/or interest on due date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This 2% per month charge is penalty or compensatory interest for the delay in the payment of a fixed sum of money, which is separate and distinct from the conventional interest on the principal of the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this connection, this Court, construing Article 2209<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of he Civil Code, held that:<br><blockquote>[T]he appropriate measure for damages in case of delay in discharging an obligation consisting of the payment of a sum or money, is the payment of penalty interest at the rate agreed upon; and in the absence of a stipulation of a particular rate of penalty interest, then the payment of additional interest at a rate equal to the regular monetary interest; and if no regular interest had been agreed upon, then payment of legal interest or six percent (6%) per annum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the promissory notes provide for monthly compounding of interest: "Interest not paid when due shall be compounded monthly from due date."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Compounding is sanctioned under Article 1959 of the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>Article 1959. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2212, interest due and unpaid shall not earn interest. <i>However, the contracting parties may by stipulation capitalize the interest due and unpaid, which as added principal, shall earn new interest.</i> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>What the trial court did was to stop the continued accrual of the 2% monthly penalty charges on October 31, 1994, and to thereafter impose instead a straight 12% per annum on the total outstanding amounts due. In making this ruling, the Regional Trial Court took into account the partial payments made by petitioners, their efforts to settle/restructure their loan obligations and the serious slump in their export business in 1993. The Regional Trial Court held that, under those circumstances, it would be "iniquitous, and tantamount to merciless forfeiture of property"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> if the interests and penalty charges would be continually imposed. The Regional Trial Court held:<br><blockquote>It is no longer disputed that defendant ERMA was paying interest on its loan obligation until October 1994; that defendant ERMA exerted efforts to settle its obligation to SBC, as in fact it proposed to SBC the restructuring of its loan; and delivered to SBC, TCT No. M-7021 to manifest its sincere effort to settle the obligation by way of restructuring its loan obligation into five-year term loan. Additionally, plaintiff­ ERMA's export business suffered serious slump in 1993 which prompted it to seek a restructuring of its entire loan. Were it not for said financial crisis, defendant ERMA would not have defaulted in the payment of its obligation, or at least the interest thereon.<br><br>Recognizing the predicament which ERMA found itself, it is considered iniquitous, and tantamount to merciless forfeiture of property to require defendant ERMA to continue paying 2% penalty per month as well as payment of legal interest upon all accrued interest after October 1994. This court therefore finds plaintiff SBC not entitled to the recovery of the amount corresponding to 2% penalty per month and to the legal interest on the accrued interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>The Regional Trial Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, acted in accordance with Article 1229 of the Civil Code, which allows judges to equitably reduce the penalty when there is partial or irregular compliance with the principal obligation, or when the penalty is iniquitous or unconscionable.<br><br>Whether a penalty charge is reasonable or iniquitous is addressed to the sound discretion of the courts and determined according to the circumstances of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The reasonableness or unreasonableness of a penalty would depend on such factors as "the type, extent and purpose of the penalty, the nature of the obligation, the mode of breach and its consequences, the supervening realities, the standing and relationship of the parties[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>For instance, in <i>Palmares v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court eliminated altogether the payment of the penalty charge of 3% per month for being inequitable and unreasonable. It ruled that the purpose of the penalty interest - that is to punish the obligor - have been sufficiently served by the compounded interest of 6% per month on the P30,000 loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In <i>Tan v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the continued monthly accrual of the 2% penalty on the total amount due of about P7.996 million was held to be unconscionable. Considering the debtor's partial payments and offer to settle his outstanding loan in good faith, the Court found it fair and equitable to reduce the 2% penalty charge, compounded monthly, to a straight twelve (12%) per annum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in this case, the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found it reasonable to reduce the 2% penalty charges, compounded monthly as to interests due and unpaid, to 12% per annum of the total outstanding obligations, in light of petitioners' partial payments and their good faith to settle their obligations. This reduction is essentially discretionary with the trial court and, in the absence of any abuse of discretion will not be disturbed.<br><br>Furthermore, we find no cogent reason to disturb the sums of P17,995,214.47 and US$289,730.10 adjudged against the petitioners in favor of Security Bank. Time and again, this Court has held that factual determinations of the Regional Trial Court, especially when adopted and confirmed by the Court of Appeals, are final and conclusive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> barring a showing that the findings were devoid of support or that a substantial matter had been overlooked by the lower courts, which would have materially affected the result if considered. This case does not fall within any of the recognized exceptions justifying a factual review in a Rule 45 petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further assert that they should be awarded at least P50,000.00 as attorney's fees for having been forced to defend themselves in needless litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>The award of attorney's fees under Article 2208 of the Civil Code demands factual, legal and equitable justification. Even when a claimant is compelled to litigate to defend himself/herself, still attorney's fees may not be awarded where there is no sufficient showing of bad faith of the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> It is well within Security Bank's right to institute an action for collection and to claim full payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Absent any proof that respondent Bank intended to prejudice or injure petitioners when it rejected petitioners' offer and filed the action for collection, we find no basis to grant attorney's fees.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>For his part, respondent Sergio Ortiz-Luis, Jr. insists that he is not liable to Security Bank because he merely signed the Suretyship Agreement as an accommodation party being the Administrative Vice President of Erma at that time; and there was novation of the Credit Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Respondent Ortiz's position had been consistently rejected by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. The lower courts found that while respondent Ortiz signed the Credit Agreement as an officer of Erma, as shown by his signature under Erma Industries Inc.

Joint and Several Suretyship. - <i>If the Surety is more than one person, all of their obligations under this Suretyship shall be joint and several with the Debtor and with each other.</i> The Bank may proceed under this Suretyship against any of the sureties for the entire Guaranteed Obligations, without first proceeding against the Debtor or any other surety or sureties of the Guaranteed Obligations, and without exhausting the property of the Debtor, the Surety hereby expressly waiving all benefits under Article 2058 and Article 2065 and Articles 2077 to 2081, inclusive, of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, respondent Ortiz's claim that he is a mere accommodation party is immaterial and does not discharge him as a surety. He remains to be liable according to the character of his undertaking and the terms and conditions of the Continuing Suretyship, which he signed in his personal capacity and not in representation of Erma.<br><br>The Court has elucidated on the distinction between an accommodation and a compensated surety and the reasons for treating them differently:<br><blockquote>The law has authorized the formation of corporations for the purpose of conducting surety business, and the corporate surety differs significantly from the individual private surety. First, unlike the private surety, the corporate surety signs for cash and not for friendship. The private surety is regarded as someone doing a rather foolish act for praiseworthy motives; the corporate surety, to the contrary, is in business to make a profit and charges a premium depending upon the amount of guaranty and the risk involved. Second, the corporate surety, like an insurance company, prepares the instrument, which is a type of contract of adhesion whereas the private surety usually does not prepare the note or bond which he signs. Third, the obligation of the private surety often is assumed simply on the basis of the debtor's representations and without legal advice, while the corporate surety does not bind itself until a full investigation has been made. For these reasons, the courts distinguish between the individual gratuitous surety and the vocational corporate surety. In the case of the corporate surety, the rule of <i>strictissimi juris</i> is not applicable, and courts apply the rules of interpretation . . . of appertaining to contracts of insurance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, the rule of strict construction of the surety contract is commonly applied to an accommodation surety but is not extended to favor a compensated corporate surety.<br><blockquote>The rationale of this doctrine is reasonable; an accommodation surety acts without motive of pecuniary gain and, hence, should be protected against unjust pecuniary impoverishment by imposing on the principal duties akin to those of a fiduciary. This cannot be said of a compensated corporate surety which is a business association organized for the purpose of assuming classified risks in large numbers, for profit and on an impersonal basis, through the medium of standardized written contractual forms drawn by its own representatives with the primary aim of protecting its own interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>The nature and extent of respondent Ortiz's liability are set out in clear and unmistakable terms in the Continuing Suretyship agreement. Under its express terms, respondent Ortiz, as surety, is "bound by all the terms and conditions of the credit instruments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> His liability is solidary with the debtor and co-sureties; and the surety contract remains in full force and effect until full payment of Erma's obligations to the Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Respondent Ortiz's claim of novation was likewise rejected by the lower courts. The Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals were in agreement that while there were ongoing negotiations between Erma and Security Bank for the restructuring of the loan, the same did not materialize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Erma offered to restructure its entire outstanding obligation and delivered TCT No. M-7021 as collateral, to which Security Bank counter-offered a partial restructuring or only up to P5,000,000. This counter-offer was not accepted by Erma. There was no new contract executed between the parties evidencing the restructured loan. Neither did Erma execute a real estate mortgage over the property covered by TCT No. M-7021.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
