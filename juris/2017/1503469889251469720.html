Deen's death on December 18, 1978, an extra-judicial settlement of estate, which did not include Lot 2535, was executed by his heirs. Later, or on March 30, 1988, they executed an Additional ExtraÂ­Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale, which sold the land for P10,000.00 to Norberto B. Bas (Norberto), who took possession of and built a house on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On December 15, 1995, Norberto died without a will and was succeeded by his niece and only heir, Lolita Bas Capablanca (Lolita).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Lolita learned that a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-96676 dated June 6, 1996 was issued in the names of Andres and Pedro on the basis of a reconstituted Deed of Conveyance No. 96-00004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In October 1996, Josefina Bas Espinosa (Josefina) represented the Heirs of Pedro Bas to file a complaint for Clarification of Ownership of Lot 2535 against Lolita before the Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay Biasong, Talisay, Cebu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The conflict between the parties was not resolved and resulted to the issuance of a Certification to file Action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On December 16, 1996, a notarized Partition Agreement of Real Property, Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights was executed between the heirs of Andres and Lolita, representing Norberto, whereby they partitioned Lot 2535 among themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Lolita sought to register her portion in Lot 2535 but was denied by the Register of Deeds of Cebu, citing the need for a court order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Lolita then learned that TCT No. T-96676 had been partially cancelled and TCT Nos. T-100181, T-100182, T-100183, and T-100185 had been issued in the name of the Heirs of Pedro Bas, represented by Josefina, on May 29, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On December 16, 1997, Lolita filed a complaint before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City for the cancellation of the titles with prayer for moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In their Answer, the Heirs of Pedro Bas claimed that "the sale between Pedro Bas and Faustina Manreal [was] fake, spurious and invalid because [Pedro] who [was] an illiterate never learned how to write his name so that the signature appearing thereon could not have been made by Pedro Bas."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> They further claimed that the cancellation of TCT No. T-96676 was made pursuant to a final judgment in Civil Case No. 840<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for Partition, Damages, and Attorney's Fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After trial, Branch 8, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on December 26, 2007, in favor of Lolita. The trial court held that there was substantial evidence to prove that Lolita had been in long possession of the lot under a claim of ownership as the heir of Norberto and that it was not necessary for her to be first declared as his heir before filing the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It further ruled that to dismiss the case on the ground that Lolita should first be declared an heir would be too late as the Heirs of Pedro Bas did not raise the issue in a motion to dismiss or as an affirmative defense in their complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On the substantive issues, the trial court upheld the validity of the 1939 Deed of Sale executed by Pedro in favor of Faustina. It found Josefina's uncorroborated testimony of Pedro's illiteracy as self-serving and unconvincing to contradict the regularity of the notarized deed. Moreover, her testimony was controverted by the notarized Assignment of Sale Certificate 195, which bore the same signature of Pedro, and by the Heirs of Pedro Bas' answers in Civil Case No. R-10602, another case which contained allegations that Pedro sold his share in the lot to Faustina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The trial court further held that the object of the sale was determinate, i.e., Pedro's share in Lot 2535 was specified by the boundaries indicated in the Deed of Sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It concluded that Norberto acquired the entire share of Pedro in Lot 2535, which was found only after survey in 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to actually consist of 3,060 square meters and not 1,000 square meters as insisted by the Heirs of Pedro Bas. The trial court gave credence to Lolita's testimony that before the survey, Pedro's portion was estimated to be 1,000 square meters; hence, the area indicated in the successive transfers of the lot from the heirs of Faustina down to Norberto was "1,000 square meters, more or less."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Consequently, with Pedro's sale of his share in Lot 2535, his heirs acquired no portion by inheritance and their titles were null and void and should be cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Finally, the trial court affirmed that the Judgement of the Municipal Trial Court of Talisay in Civil Case No. 840 for Partition, Damages and Attorney's fees was not binding on Lolita, who was not a party to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, a judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, declaring as null and void and ordering the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu to cancel the following transfer certificates of title:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-100181, of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, in the name of Heirs of Pedro Bas, represented by Josefina Bas, covering Lot 2535-J, Psd-07-037377, being a portion of Lot 2535, Flr-133, situated in the Barrio of Dumlog, Mun. of Talisay, Prov. of Cebu, Island of Cebu, containing an area of 304 square meters;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-100182, of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, in the name of Heirs of Pedro Bas, represented by Josefina Bas, covering Lot 2535-B, Psd-07-037377, being a portion of Lot 2535, Flr-133, situated in the Barrio of Dumlog, Mun. of Talisay, Prov. of Cebu, Island of Cebu, containing an area of 1,554 square meters;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-100183, of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, in the name of Heirs of Pedro Bas, represented by Josefina Bas, covering Lot 2535-A, Psd-07-037377, being a portion of Lot 2535, Flr-133, situated in the Barrio of Dumlog, Mun. of Talisay, Prov. of Cebu, Island of Cebu, containing an area of 965 square meters; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-100185, of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, in the name of Heirs of Pedro Bas, represented by Josefina Bas, covering Lot 2535-A Psd-07-037377, being a portion of Lot 2535, Flr-133, situated in the Barrio of Dumlog, Mun. of Talisay, Prov. of Cebu, Island of Cebu, containing an area of 187 square meters.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Costs against the defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>The Regional Trial Court subsequently denied the Heirs of Pedro Bas' motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Hence, the Heirs of Pedro Bas appealed to the Court of Appeals, making the following lone assignment of error:<br><blockquote>The trial court seriously erred in not dismissing the case for plaintiffs lack of cause of action pursuant to (the) doctrinal jurisprudential case of Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay vs. Del Rosario (304 SCRA 18) considering that plaintiff in her complaint alleged, she is the sole heir of Norberto Bas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals reversed the Regional Trial Court Decision and dismissed the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> According to the Court of Appeals, Lolita must first be declared as the sole heir to the estate ofNorberto in a proper special proceeding.

Del Rosario</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> cited in the Court of Appeals Decision does not apply to this case because the factual circumstances are different.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In that case, the claims of the opposing parties were anchored on their alleged status as heirs of the original owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> "Hence there may have been the need for a previous judicial declaration of heirship in a special proceeding."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Here, petitioner does not claim to be an heir of Pedro, the original owner. Rather, her interest over the property is derived from a series of transactions starting from the sale executed by Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further contends that respondents neither raised the ground "lack of cause of action" as an affirmative defense nor filed a motion to dismiss before the court <i>a quo</i>. Instead, they allowed the trial to proceed with their full participation all throughout. Petitioner asserts that respondents' action or inaction should be constituted a waiver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Otherwise, respondents' "failure to properly act on its perceived defect" in the complaint hampers the speedy disposition of the action "and would only promote multiplicity of suits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In their two (2)-page Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> respondents contend that the findings of the Court of Appeals were duly supported by evidence and jurisprudence.<br><br>This Court grants the petition.<br><br>Contrary to the erroneous conclusion of the Court of Appeals, this Court finds no need for a separate proceeding for a declaration of heirship in order to resolve petitioner's action for cancellation of titles of the property.<br><br>The dispute in this case is not about the heirship of petitioner to Norberto but the validity of the sale of the property in 1939 from Pedro to Faustina, from which followed a series of transfer transactions that culminated in the sale of the property to Norberto. For with Pedro's sale of the property in 1939, it follows that there would be no more ownership or right to property that would have been transmitted to his heirs.<br><br>Petitioner's claim is anchored on a sale of the property to her predecessor-in-interest and not on any filiation with the original owner. What petitioner is pursuing is Norberta's right of ownership over the property which was passed to her upon the latter's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>This Court has stated that no judicial declaration of heirship is necessary in order that an heir may assert his or her right to the property of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <i>Marabilles v. Quito</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><blockquote><i>The right to assert a cause of action as an heir, although he has not been judicially declared to be so, if duly proven, is well settled in this jurisdiction. This is upon the theory that the property of a deceased person, both real and personal, becomes the property of the heir by the mere fact of death of his predecessor in interest, and as such he can deal with it in precisely the same way in which the deceased could have dealt, subject only to the limitations which by law or by contract may be imposed upon the deceased himself.</i> Thus, it has been held that "[t]here is no legal precept or established rule which imposes the necessity of a previous legal declaration regarding their status as heirs to an intestate on those who, being of age and with legal capacity, consider themselves the legal heirs of a person, in order that they may maintain an action arising out of a right which belonged to their ancestor" ... A recent case wherein this principle was maintained is Cabuyao vs. [C]aagbay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals' reliance on the ruling in <i>Heirs of Yaptinchay v. Del Rosario</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> was misplaced. In that case, the motion to dismiss was filed immediately after the second Amended Complaint was filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that the Heirs of Yaptinchay "have not shown any proof or even a semblance of it-except the allegations that they are the legal heirs of the above-named Yaptinchays-that they have been declared the legal heirs of the deceased couple."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Here, respondents never raised their objection to petitioner's capacity to sue either as an affirmative defense or in a motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Rule 9, Section 1 of the Rules of Court states, "[d]efenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived." Thus, it was erroneous for the Court of Appeals to dismiss the complaint on the ground that there was no prior judicial declaration of petitioner's heirship to Norberto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the pronouncement in the <i>Heirs of Yaptinchay</i> that a declaration of heirship must be made only in a special proceeding and not in an ordinary civil action for reconveyance of property was based on <i>Litam, etc., et al. v. Rivera</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and <i>Solivio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> which involved different factual milieus.<br><br>The facts of the case in <i>Litam, etc., et al. v. Rivera</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> show that during the pendency of the special proceedings for the settlement of the intestate estate of the deceased Rafael Litam, the plaintiffs-appellants filed a civil action. They claimed that as the children of the deceased by a previous marriage to a Chinese woman, they were entitled to inherit his one-half (1/2) share of the conjugal properties acquired during his marriage to Marcosa Rivera (Marcosa).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The trial court in the civil case declared, among others, that the plaintiffs-appellants were not children of the deceased and that Marcosa was his only heir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> On appeal, this Court ruled that such declaration-that Marcosa was the only heir of the decedent-was improper because the determination of the issue was within the exclusive competence of the court in the special proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In <i>Solivio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the deceased Esteban Javellana, Jr. was survived by Celedonia Solivio (Celedonia), his maternal aunt, and Concordia Javellana-Villanueva (Concordia), his paternal aunt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Celedonia filed the intestate proceedings and had herself declared as sole heir and administratrix of the estate of the decedent to facilitate the implementation of the latter's wish to place his estate in a foundation named after his mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> While the probate proceeding was pending, Concordia filed a separate civil action where she sought to be declared as co-heir and for partition of the estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This Court held that the "separate action was improperly filed for it is the probate court that has exclusive jurisdiction to make a just and legal distribution of the estate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This Court further held that "in the interest of orderly procedure and to avoid confusing and conflicting dispositions of a decedent's estate, a court should not interfere with probate proceedings pending in a co-equal court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In <i>Litam</i> and <i>Solivio</i>, the adverse parties were putative heirs to a decedent's estate or parties to the special proceedings for an estate's settlement. Hence, this Court ruled that questions on the status and right of the contending parties must be properly ventilated in the appropriate special proceeding, not in an ordinary civil action.<br><br>Here, as stated, the main issue is the annulment of title to property, which ultimately hinges on the validity of the sale from Pedro to Faustina. Petitioner does not claim any filiation with Pedro or seek to establish her right as his heir as against the respondents. Rather, petitioner seeks to enforce her right over the property which has been allegedly violated by the fraudulent acts of respondents.<br><br>Furthermore, as found by the Regional Trial Court:<br><blockquote>The plaintiff [Lolita] has sufficient interest to protect in the subject portion of Lot 2535. She had been there for around thirty (30) years, and had been in possession thereof under a claim of ownership as an alleged heir of Norberto Bas after the latter's death on December 15, 1993, that is: long before the issuance of TCT Nos. T-100181, T-100182, T-100183[,] and T-100185 in 1997, and even TCT No. T-96676 in 1996. Moreover, it is annotated on TCT No. T-96676 (Exhibit "G") that she, together with the heirs of Osmundo Bas, executed a declaration of heirs with partition, quitclaim, etc., dated December 16, 1996, registered on March 3, 1997 ... wherein they adjudicated unto themselves and partitioned Lot No. 2535 ... She also executed on June 14, 1997 an Affidavit of Adjudication by Sole Heir, declaring herself as the sole heir of Norberta Bas and adjudicated unto herselfthe subject portion pursuant to Section 1, Rule 74 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>The existence of the questioned certificates of title, and other related documents, constitute clouds on said interest. There seems, therefore, to be no necessity that the plaintiff should have been declared first as an heir of Norberta Bas as a prerequisite to this action. Her possession of the subject lot under a claim of ownership is a sufficient interest to entitle her to bring this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>This case has gone a long way since the complaint was filed in 1997. A full-blown trial had taken place and judgment was rendered by the Regional Trial Court where it thoroughly discussed, evaluated, and weighed all the pieces of documentary evidence and testimonies of the witnesses of both parties. At this point, to dismiss the case and require petitioner to institute a special proceeding to determine her status as heir of the late Norberta would hamper, instead of serve, justice.<br><br>In <i>Portugal v. Portugal-Beltran</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> where the contending parties insisted to be the legal heirs of the decedent, this Court dispensed with the need to institute a separate special proceeding to determine their heirship since the parties had voluntarily submitted the issue to the trial court and already presented their evidence. It held:<br><blockquote>It appearing, however, that in the present case the only property of the intestate estate of Portugal is the Caloocan parcel of land, to still subject it, under the circumstances of the case, to a special proceeding which could be long, hence, not expeditious, just to establish the status of petitioners as heirs is not only impractical; it is burdensome to the estate with the costs and expenses of an administration proceeding. And it is superfluous in light of the fact that the parties to the civil case - subject of the present case, could and had already in fact presented evidence before the trial court which assumed jurisdiction over the case upon the issues it defined during pre-trial.<br><br>In fine, under the circumstances of the present case, there being no compelling reason to still subject Portugal's estate to administration proceedings since a determination of petitioners' status as heirs could be achieved in the civil case filed by petitioners, the trial court should proceed to evaluate the evidence presented by the parties during the trial and render a decision thereon[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In this case, there is no necessity for a separate special proceeding and to require it would be superfluous considering that petitioner had already presented evidence to establish her filiation and heirship to Norberto, which respondents never disputed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
