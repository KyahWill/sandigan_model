"The existence and availability of the right of appeal prohibits the resort to <i>certiorari </i>because one of the requirements for the latter remedy is that there should be no appeal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Allegations in the petition of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals do not <i>ipso facto </i>render the intended remedy that of <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. In <i>Microsoft Corporation v. Best Deal Computer Center Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court discussed the distinction between a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 and a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45:<br><br><blockquote>Significantly, even assuming that the orders were erroneous, such error would merely be deemed as an error of judgment that cannot be remedied by certiorari. As long as the respondent acted with jurisdiction, any error committed by him or it in the exercise thereof will amount to nothing more than an error of judgment which may be reviewed or corrected only by appeal. The distinction is clear: A petition for certiorari seeks to correct errors of jurisdiction while a petition for review seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court. Errors of judgment include errors of procedure or mistakes in the court's findings. Where a court has jurisdiction over the person and subject matter, the decision on all other questions arising in the case an exercise of that jurisdiction. Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of such jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment. Certiorari under Rule 65 is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>In this case, what Steamship seeks to rectify may be construed as errors of judgment of the Court of Appeals. These errors pertain to Steamship's allegations of the Court of Appeals' failure to rule that a valid arbitration agreement existed between the parties and to refer the case to arbitration. It does not impute any error with respect to the Court of Appeals' exercise of jurisdiction, As such, the Petition is simply a continuation of the appellate process where a case is elevated from the trial court of origin, to the Court of Appeals, and to this Court via Rule 45.<br><br>The basic issues raised in the Petition for Review are: (1) whether or not an arbitration agreement may be validly incorporated by reference to a contract; and (2) how the trial court should proceed to trial upon its finding "that only some and not all of the defendants are bound by an arbitration agreement[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> These are questions of law properly cognizable in a Rule 45 petition.<br><br>In <i>BCDA v.

Balmores</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>[T]here is a question of law "when there is doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain [set] of facts." The test is "whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence." Meanwhile, there is a question of fact when there is "doubt . . . as to the truth or falsehood of facts." The question must involve the examination of probative value of the evidence presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Sulpicio denies being bound by the arbitration clause in the Club Rules since neither the Certificate of Entry and Acceptance, which covers M/V Princess of the World, mentioned this arbitration agreement, nor was it given a copy of the Club Rulebook.<br><br>In sustaining the denial of Steamship's Motion to Dismiss and/or to Refer Case to Arbitration, the Court of Appeals ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Unfortunately, the Court is not convinced that a valid and binding arbitration agreement exists between the Steamship and Sulpicio. And even assuming that there is such an agreement, it does not comply with Section 4 of the Arbitration Law which provides that "a contract to arbitrate a controversy thereafter arising between the parties, as well as a submission to arbitrate an existing controversy shall be in writing and subscribed by the party sought to be charged, or by his lawful agent."<br><br><i>As correctly pointed out by Sulpicio, there is no proof that it was served a copy of the Club Rules in question and that it signed therein.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>A factual question on whether or not Sulpicio was given a copy of the Club Rulebook must be resolved because it has a bearing on the legal issue of whether or not a binding arbitration agreement existed between the parties.

Associated Bank filed a Third-Party Complaint against Philippine Commercial International Bank, Far East Bank &amp; Trust Company, Security Bank and Trust Company, and Citytrust Banking Corporation for reimbursement, contribution, and indemnity. This Complaint was based on their being the collecting banks and by virtue of their bank guarantee for all checks sent for clearing to the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC). The trial court dismissed the Third-Party Complaint for lack of jurisdiction, citing Section 36 of the Clearing House Rules and Regulations of the PCHC, which provides for arbitration. This Court, in affirming the dismissal, held:<br><br><blockquote>Under the rules and regulations of the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC), <i>the mere act of participation of the parties concerned in its operations in effect amounts to a manifestation of agreement by the parties to abide by its rules and regulations. As a consequence of such participation, a party cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the courts over disputes and controversies which fall under the PCHC Rules and Regulations without first going through the arbitration processes laid out by the </i><i> body. </i> Since claims relating to the regularity of checks cleared by banking institutions are among those claims which should first be submitted for resolution by the PCHC's Arbitration Committee, petitioner Associated Bank, having voluntarily bound itself to abide by such rules and regulations, is estopped from seeking relief from the Regional Trial Court on the coattails of a private claim and in the guise of a third party complaint without first having obtained a decision adverse to its claim from the said body. lt cannot bypass the arbitration process on the basis of its averment that its third party complaint is inextricably linked to the original complaint in the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><blockquote>Section 36.6 is even more emphatic:<br><br>36.6 The fact that a bank participates in the clearing operations of PCHC shall be deemed its written and subscribed consent to the binding effect of this arbitration agreement as if it had done so in accordance with Section 4 of the Republic Act No. 876 otherwise known as the Arbitration Law.<br></blockquote><br>Thus, not only do the parties manifest by mere participation their consent to these rules, but such participation is deemed (their) written and subscribed consent to the binding effect of arbitration agreements under the PCHC rules. Moreover, a participant subject to the Clearing House Rules and Regulations of the PCHC may go on appeal to any of the Regional Trial Courts in the National Capital Region where the head office of any of the parties is located only after a decision or award has been rendered by the arbitration committee or arbitrator on questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>This Court held that mere participation by the banks in the clearing operations of the PCHC manifest their consent to the PCHC Rules, including the binding effect of the arbitration agreements under these Rules.<br><br>In this case, by its act of entering its fleet of vessels to Steamship and accepting without objection the Certificate of Entry and Acceptance covering its vessels, Sulpicio manifests its consent to be bound by the Club Rules.

Banzon, Jr. sent an emai1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> dated 30 November 2005 to Mr. Carlos Go reminding Sulpicio of the remedy of voluntary arbitration under Rule 47 of the Club's Rulebook and attaching a copy of Rule 47. Copies of these documents are attached as Annex "4."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup><br></blockquote><br>These foregoing affidavits and the attached supporting documents consistently declared that Sulpicio was given copies of the Rulebook on an annual basis and had even invoked its provisions in making a claim from Steamship. Sulpicio's previous letters to Steamship referring to provisions of the Club Rules show its knowledge. Sulpicio was also reminded of the arbitration clause during the negotiations preceding the institution of the present case.<br><br>"[A] party is not relieved of the duty to exercise the ordinary care and prudence that would be exacted in relation to other contracts. The conformity of the insured to the terms of the policy is implied from [its] failure to express any disagreement with what is provided for."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> The agreement to submit all disputes to arbitration is a long standing provision in the Club Rules. It was incumbent upon Sulpicio to familiarize itself with the Club Rules, under the presumption that a person takes due care of its concerns. Being a member of Steamship for 20 years,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> it has been bound by its Rules and has been expected to abide by them in good faith.<br><br>In <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v.

We might say — paraphrasing <i>Tin Tua Sia vs. Yu Biao Sontua, </i> 56 Phil. 707 — that they being of age and businessmen of experience, it must be presumed that they had acted with due care and to have signed the documents in question with full knowledge of their import and the obligations they were assuming thereby; that this presumption of law may not be overcome by the mere testimony of the obligor or obligors; that, to permit a party, when, sued upon a contract, to admit that he signed it but to deny that it expresses the agreement he had made, or to allow him to admit that he signed it solely on the verbal assurance given by one party, however high his station may be, that he would not be held liable thereon, would destroy the value of all contracts. Indeed, it would be disastrous to give more weight and reliability to the self-serving testimony of a party bound by the contract than to the contents thereof. <i>Verba volant, scripta manent.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Sulpicio is estopped from denying knowledge of the Rulebook by its own acts and representations, as evidenced by its various letters to Steamship, showing its familiarity with the Rulebook and its provisions.<br><br>"In estoppel, a person, who by his [or her] deed or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner, is barred from adopting an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that thereby causes loss or injury to another."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> It further bars a party from denying or disproving a fact, which has become settled by its acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Court finds a preponderance of evidence showing that Sulpicio was given a copy and had knowledge of the 2005/2006 Club Rules. Moreover, the 2005/2006 Club Rules' provision on arbitration is valid and binding upon Sulpicio.<br><br><div align="center"><b>III.B</b><br></div><br>The Regional Trial Court should suspend proceedings to give way to arbitration.

A person should not be condemned for contempt where he contends for what he believes to be right and in good faith institutes proceedings for the purpose, however erroneous may be his conclusion as to his rights.

It does not appear that Steamship was motivated by bad faith in initiating the arbitration proceedings. Rather, its act of commencing arbitration in London is but a bona fide attempt to preserve and enforce its rights under the Club Rules.<br><br>There was no legal impediment at the time Steamship initiated London arbitration proceedings. Steamship commenced arbitration on July 31, 2007 even before the Regional Trial Court denied its Motion to Dismiss and/or Refer Case to Arbitration on July 11, 2008. There was no order from the Regional Trial Court enjoining Steamship from initiating arbitration proceedings in London. Besides, the 2009 Special ADR Rules specifically provided that arbitration proceedings may be commenced or continued and an award may be made, while the motion for the stay of civil action and for referral to arbitration is pending resolution by the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup><br><br>This Court notes that while the arbitration proceeding was commenced as early as July 31, 2007, it is only six (6) years later that Sulpicio filed its Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> to cite Steamship for indirect contempt. Sulpicio cannot invoke lack of knowledge of the London arbitration proceedings due to several reasons.

Second, Steamship presented evidence showing Sulpicio's refusal to receive any notices, orders, or communications related to the arbitration proceedings. Lastly, the pendency of the London arbitration was made known to the Court of Appeals and this Court through Steamship's petitions. Sulpicio's belated filing of its Petition, only after Steamship has deducted from the refund due it the alleged "arbitration costs," indicates its lack of sincerity and good faith.<br><br>Finally, this Court finds Sulpicio's claim for damages to be improperly raised.
