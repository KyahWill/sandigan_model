No. 03-1-09-SC, otherwise known as the <i>Proposed Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-Trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Pre-Trial Guidelines), particularly paragraph A(2)(d) thereof, which states:<br><br><blockquote>PRE-TRIAL<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div> </td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Civil Cases</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">2.</div> </td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The parties shall submit, at least three (3) days before the pre-trial, pre-trial briefs containing the following:</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">d. </div> </td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The documents or exhibits to be presented, stating the purpose thereof. <b>(No evidence shall be allowed to be presented and offered during the trial in support of a party's evidence-in-chief other than those that had been earlier identified and pre-marked during the pre-trial, <u>except if allowed by the court for good cause shown</u>)</b>[.] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote><br>Petitioners' reliance on the purported exception under paragraph A(2)(d) is misplaced. As its introductory phrase clearly indicates, paragraph A(2) enumerates the matters which parties are required to state in the pre-trial brief. Since paragraph A(2) does not prescribe rules on admissibility and presentation of evidence, it should not be interpreted in this manner.<br><br>In addition, paragraph (A)(2)(d) refers to documentary and object evidence, and not testimonial evidence, which, in turn, are treated separately under paragraph (A)(2)(f).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Accordingly, the scope of the specific exception under paragraph A(2)(d) should not be unduly extended to cover testimonial evidence.<br><br>Even assuming, <i>arguendo, </i>that the exception under paragraph A(2)(d) may be invoked as basis to allow the presentation of witnesses not listed in the pre-trial order, its application remains contingent upon a showing of good cause sufficient to justify the same. Petitioners attempted to satisfy this condition by citing "special and extraordinary circumstances" which they claim should have impelled the RTC to allow the presentation of their additional witnesses. The Petition summarizes these circumstances, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>The presence of a written reservation<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[39]</sup></font> by then counsel of x x x [Jose and Angelina] to present additional witnesses x x x as shown in [their] [P]re-[T]rial [B]rief x x x[;]<br><br></li><li>The oral manifestation<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[40]</sup></font> of then counsel of x x x [Jose and Angelina], Atty. Leong, that he is reserving five (5) more witnesses depending on the outcome of the cross-examination of x x x [Jose], without objection interposed by [Respondents] at that time as recorded x x x in [the Transcript of Stenographic Notes (TSN)] x x x.<br><br></li><li>The fact that on July 17, 2006, [Judge Ruiz, then Presiding Judge of the RTC] x x x allowed the presentation of additional witnesses for the [Petitioners] by setting six (6) additional calendar dates for the presentation of evidence of the [Petitioners] even after the Pre-Trial Order had already been issued x x x[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring omitted)</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>The Court finds these circumstances grossly insufficient to support Petitioners' cause.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the CA in the Assailed Decision, neither Jose nor his counsel Atty. Leong took the necessary steps to cause the revision of the Pre-Trial <i>Order </i>to reflect the general reservation in Jose's Pre-Trial <i>Brief, </i>notwithstanding the explicit directive to make such necessary corrections in the <i>Colatilla </i>portion of the Pre-Trial <i>Order. </i>This failure binds the Petitioners as substitute parties, being mere representatives of the latter's interests in the present case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the setting of additional hearing dates following the direct examination of Jose should not be impliedly taken as a grant of leave to present Petitioners' additional witnesses. To be sure, the hearing dates in question were set on <b>July 17, 2006.</b> Petitioners do not deny that they sought leave to present their six (6) additional witnesses <i>only </i>on <b>January 16, 2008,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> one (1) year and five (5) months <i>after </i>the additional hearing dates were set. If Judge Ruiz did in fact grant Jose leave to present witnesses excluded in the Pre-Trial <i>Order, </i>Petitioners would not have sought such leave anew. Evidently, Petitioners' argument that Judge Ruiz already allowed such presentation, and that Judge Maniba was bound to honor such previous directive, is a mere afterthought.<br><br>Finally, it bears stressing that Petitioners neither furnished the Court with copies of the judicial affidavits of their additional witnesses, nor make any allegations detailing the substance of their respective testimonies. Hence, the Court is left without any opportunity to determine if the presentation of said witnesses is indeed necessary to "ferret out the whole truth,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> as Petitioners claim.<br><br><i>The rules governing pre-trial remain<br>controlling in this case.</i><br><br>The importance of pre-trial in civil cases cannot be overemphasized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Time and again, this Court has recognized "the importance of pre-trial procedure as a means of facilitating the disposal of cases by simplifying or limiting the issues and avoiding unnecessary proof of facts at the trial, and x x x to do whatever may reasonably be necessary to facilitate and shorten the formal trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The need for strict adherence to the rules on pre-trial thus proceeds from its significant role in the litigation process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>This is not to say, however, that the rules governing pre-trial should be, at all times, applied in absolute terms. While faithful compliance with these rules is undoubtedly desirable, they may be relaxed in cases where their application would frustrate, rather than facilitate, the ends of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The relaxation of these rules, however, is contingent upon a showing of compelling and persuasive reasons to justify the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>It is the Court's considered view that Petitioners have failed to sufficiently show that such compelling and persuasive reasons exist in this case. Consequently, the Petition must be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>is <b>DENIED.</b> The Assailed Decision dated November 27, 2014 and Resolution dated May 25, 2015 issued by the Court of Appeals Eighteenth Division in CA-G.R.
