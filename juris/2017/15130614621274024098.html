While petitioners filed the Affidavit of Service and incorporated registry receipts, [petitioner] still failed to comply with the requirement on proper proof of service. Post office receipt is not the required proof of service by registered mail. Section 10, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure specifically stated that service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or after five (5) days from the date he received the first notice of the postmaster, whichever is earlier. Verily, registry receipts cannot be considered as sufficient proof of service; they are merely evidence of mail matter by the post office to the addressee; and<br><br></li><li>there was no competent evidence regarding the identity of Jocelyn B. Alcoreza as the alleged authorized representative of co-petitioner Meatworld International on the attached Verification and Certification Against Non-Forum Shopping as required by Section 12, Rule II of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Further, there was no board resolution empowering Jocelyn B. Alcoreza to represent petitioner corporation in this case. The Supreme Court was emphatic when it ruled that in the absence of authority from the board of directors, no person[,] not even the officers[,] can bind the corporation. It stressed that any suit filed on behalf of the corporation wanting the required board resolution should be dismissed, since the power of the corporation to sue and be sued in any court is lodged with the board of directors that exercises its corporate powers. Thus, only individuals vested with authority by a valid board resolution may sign the certificate of non-forum shopping in behalf of a corporation. In addition, the Court has required that proof of said authority must be attached. Failure to provide a certificate of non-forum shopping is sufficient ground to dismiss the petition. Likewise, the petition is subject to dismissal if a certification was submitted unaccompanied by proof of the signatory's authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner sought reconsideration contending that it complied with the proof of service requirement and that the Secretary's Certificate attached to the Petition is sufficient proof of the authority of Alcoreza to file the said Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In its July 3, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the CA conceded that petitioner complied with the proof of service requirement, however, it maintained that petitioner failed to present the Board Resolution and the competent evidence of identity of the affiant.<br><br>Hence, petitioner filed the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, raising the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE FINDING OF 1HE [CA] THAT THERE WAS NO COMPETENT EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY AND BOARD RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE VICE PRESIDENT OF PETITIONER COMPANY TO FILE THE PETITION IS CONTRARY TO FACTS.<br><br></li><li>THE [CA] ERRED IN DECLARING THAT A COPY OF 1HE BOARD RESOLUTION ITSELF, AUTHORIZING THE PERSON ACTING IN ITS BEHALF SHOULD BE APPENDED TO THE PETITION.<br><br></li><li>THE [CA] ERRED IN NOT RESOLVING THE CASE ON THE MERITS AND:<br><br>1.

In several instances, however, the Court has considered a Secretary's Certificate sufficient proof of authority for a person named in it to represent a corporation in a suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In this case, no board resolution was attached to the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>. However, in lieu thereof, petitioner attached a Secretary's Certificate attesting that Alcoreza was duly authorized by the Board of Directors to sign the necessary pleadings, verification, and certificate of non-forum shopping on behalf of the corporation. This, under prevailing jurisprudence, is sufficient proof of authority.<br><br>In addition, contrary to the CA's finding, Alcoreza presented "competent evidence of identity" as she presented before the notary public her valid Philippine Passport.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court agrees with petitioner that there were no procedural defects to warrant the dismissal of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> by the CA. However, while there were no procedural defects, the Court finds that the instant petition is still dismissible on the merits.<br><br><b><i>Respondent was illegally dismissed.</i></b><br><br>In illegal dismissal cases, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee's termination was for a valid or authorized cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This rule, however, presupposes that the employee was dismissed from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In this case, records show that in November 2010 respondent was suspended for one week because of his undertime on October 31, 2010 and November 5, 2010 and his absence on November 1, 2010. Immediately after his suspension, he was placed on preventive suspension for three days for sampling food products. After his preventive suspension, respondent reported to the office but was told that there was no available outlet. After more than a week of making follow-ups, respondent was assigned at Robinsons Place Manila. Less than a month later, petitioner told respondent to report to the office on January 6, 2011 as his assignment at Robinsons Place Manila was only temporary. Respondent reported to the office on January 6, 10, and 13, 2011 but was told that there was no available outlet. On January 13, 2011, the last time respondent went to the office of petitioner, he was scolded by Alcoreza for arriving late and was told to resign, otherwise, he would be dismissed. All these factual circumstances, taken together, led the NLRC to conclude that petitioner was giving respondent a hard time in order to make his employment unbearable, and eventually, force him to resign. Unfortunately, instead of resigning, respondent sought the help of Tulfo who referred him to DOLE. With these findings, the NLRC sustained the ruling of the Labor Arbiter that respondent was illegally dismissed.<br><br>Petitioner, however, insists that respondent was not dismissed from employment. Instead, it was respondent who failed to report for work because he erroneously assumed that he was being terminated.<br><br>After a careful review of the instant Petition, the Court finds that although there was no actual dismissal, the failure of petitioner to assign respondent to a specific branch without any justifiable reason constituted illegal constructive dismissal.<br><br>Constructive dismissal is defined as a "cessation of work because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Similarly, there is constructive dismissal "when an act of clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer has become so unbearable to the employee leaving him with no option but to forego with his continued employment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Simply put, it is a "dismissal in disguise or an act amounting to dismissal but made to appear as if it were not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner admits that after relieving respondent from his assignment at Robinsons Place Manila on January 5, 2011, it failed to assign him to a new branch. However, to justify its failure, petitioner claims that there was no available post as the vacancy which respondent was supposed to fill was no longer available since he failed to report on January 6, 2011. Petitioner later clarified that respondent did report to the office on January 6, 2011 but that he arrived late, and thus was not given the assignment Petitioner also claims it was having a hard time finding a new branch as respondent was already banned at SM Hypermarket Muntinlupa, Market Market, and all Puregold supermarkets.<br><br>The Court finds petitioner's justification unacceptable.<br><br>It bears stressing that "[d]ue to the grim economic consequences to the employee, the employer should bear the burden of proving that there are no posts available to which the employee temporarily out of work can be assigned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Thus, in this case, it was incumbent upon petitioner to prove that respondent was banned at SM Hypermarket Muntinlupa, Market Market, and all Puregold supermarkets, and that there was no available branch for respondent Unfortunately, petitioner failed to prove both. Except for a Memorandum from SM Hypermarket stating that respondent was no longer allowed to be assigned at the Muntinlupa branch, no other evidence was presented by petitioner to show the respondent was also banned at Market Market and at all Puregold supermarkets and that all posts were indeed taken. Petitioner could have easily asked its HR Department for a list of all its branches together with the list of all its employees assigned thereat to prove its allegation that there are no available posts for respondent. But it did not. Instead, it argued that respondent's various infractions made it difficult for petitioner to assign respondent to a new assignment. As evidence, petitioner submitted several memoranda it issued against respondent. These, however, do not prove petitioner's allegation that there are no available posts for respondent. If at all, it only shows that petitioner considered respondent an undesirable employee due to his various infractions. Such infractions, however, are not sufficient to prove that there are no available posts for respondent.<br><br>Moreover, contrary to the claim of petitioner, respondent's act of seeking help from Tulfo was not the primary consideration of the NLRC in finding the existence of illegal dismissal. It was only one of the many circumstances, which the NLRC took into consideration. Petitioner's failure to assign respondent to an outlet without any justifiable reason, as well as the apparent disdain of petitioner towards respondent as can be seen through the acts of Alcoreza, the immediate response of respondent to seek help from Tulfo, and the antecedent events, were all considered in determining the existence of illegal dismissal. Accordingly, the Court finds no error on the part of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC in ruling that respondent was illegally dismissed, and thus entitled to backwages and separation pay.<br><br>In closing, while the Court recognizes that the management has the discretion and prerogative to regulate all aspects of employment, which includes the transfer of employees, work assignments, discipline, dismissal and recall of workers, the exercise of power is not absolute as "it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of labor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> More important, "management prerogative may not be used as a subterfuge by the employer to rid himself of an undesirable worker."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
