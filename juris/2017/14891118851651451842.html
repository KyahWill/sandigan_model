				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></div><br>Before the Court is a disbarment complaint filed by Eduardo R. Alicias, Jr. (Alicias), against Atty. Myrna V. Macatangay (Macatangay), Atty. Karin Litz P. Zerna (Zerna), Atty. Ariel G. Ronquillo (Ronquillo), and Atty. Cesar D. Buenaflor (Buenaflor) for violation of the Lawyer's Oath or Code of Professional Responsibility gross neglect of duty, and gross ignorance of the law.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The present administrative case stemmed from an initial complaint filed by Alicias, an Associate Professor in the College of Education of the University of the Philippines against Dean Leticia P. Ho (Ho) of the same College for two counts of violation of Republic Act No. 6713.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Civil Service Commission (CSC), through its Office of Legal Affairs (CSC-OLA), then headed by Director IV Florencio P. Gabriel, Jr., referred Alicias' complaint against Ho to its Regional Office in the National Capital Region (CSC-NCR).&nbsp; In its 26 June 202 Resolution, the CSC-NCR found that the complaint was insufficient to support a <i>prima facie</i> case against Ho. Alicias' complaint against Ho was dismissed.<br><br>On 12 July 2002, Alicias filed a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> with the CSC. The CSC asked the CSC-NCR, to comment. Pending the resolution of the petition for review, Macatangay replaced Director Gabriel, Jr. as Officer-in­-Charge of the CSC-OLA. In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 5 May 2003, Alicias followed up his petition for review and notified the CSC of his new residential address in Cainta, Rizal. On 26 April 2004, Alicias wrote a second letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to follow-up his petition for review. On 9 August 2004, the CSC, as a collegial body, deliberated on the draft resolution prepared by the CSC-OLA. The draft resolution, however, was returned for re-writing.<br><br>On 30 August 2004, Zerna succeeded Macatangay as Officer-in­-Charge of the CSC-OLA. A third follow-up was made by Alicias on 16 September 2004 through a handwritten note.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Alicias claimed that he never received any reply from the CSC-OLA. On 28 October 2004, the CSC released a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dismissing Alicias' petition for review for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As CSC Commissioner, Buenaflor was one of the signatories of the Resolution.<br><br>Alicias did not receive a copy of the Resolution. The records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> show that it was mistakenly sent to his old address in Quezon City. Unaware that the petition for review was already resolved, Alicias moved for its resolution on 16 February 2006, followed by another letter on 10 April 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Ronquillo, who assumed as Director IV of the CSC-OLA, received Alicias' Motion for Resolution. Ronquillo replied that the petition for review was already dismissed on 28 October 2004.<br><br>On 26 April 2006, Alicias received through registered mail a copy of the CSC's Resolution. Alicias filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied on 1 August 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Commissioner Buenaflor was one of the signatories of the Resolution. Alicias did not appeal the CSC's Resolution with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On 11 April 2007, Alicias filed the present administrative complaint before the Court accusing Macatangay, Zerna, Ronquillo, and Buenaflor of violation of the Lawyer's Oath or Code of Professional Responsibility, gross neglect of duty, and gross ignorance of the law. Alicias alleged that respondents, by reason of their respective offices in the CSC, participated directly or indirectly in writing or approving the Resolution. Respondents allegedly (1) did not conduct a careful evaluation of the records; (2) did not hear the arguments of both partes; (3) ignored uncontroverted documentary evidence adduced by him; (4) erroneously applied established jurisprudence; (5) denied him due process of law by not furnishing him a copy of the CSC's Order directing the CSC-NCR to comment and a copy of the CSC-NCR comment; and (6) willfully did not give him a copy of the Resolution of his petition for review.<br><br>In their Joint Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated 16 August 2007, respondents argued that Alicias was not denied due process because after the denial of his motion for reconsideration, he still had the available remedy of filing a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with the Court of Appeals. Respondents contended that no clear and convincing evidence had been offered to show bad faith or ulterior motive on their part.<br><br>In a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated 30 August 2007, Alicias claimed that the present administrative complaint is not an alternative remedy to seek judicial relief since it is founded on a different cause of action. Alicias contended that bad faith is not an element to sustain an action for gross ignorance of the law. He argued that the failure to follow prescribed procedure constitutes <i>malum prohibitum</i>. Hence, proof of mere violation is sufficient to sustain a conviction without need of proving ill motive.<br><br>On 8 October 2007, the Court, through the Second Division, referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the IBP</u></b><br></center><br>In a Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 20 October 2010, IBP Commissioner Maria Editha A. Go-Binas (Commissioner Go-Binas) recommended that the administrative complaint against Macatangay, Zerna, Ronquillo, and Buenaflor be dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Commissioner Go-Binas found that the complaint was baseless and Alicias failed to show sufficient proof in support of his claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In Resolution No. XX-2011-288<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> passed on 10 December 2011, the IBP Board of Governors adopted and approved Commissioner Go-Binas' Report and Recommendation, dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>In Resolution No. XX-2013-738<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> issued on 21 June 2013, the IBP Board of Governors likewise denied the motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> filed by Alicias. The Board found no cogent reason to reverse its initial findings since the matters raised were reiterations of those which had already been taken into consideration.<br><br>Hence, Alicias filed this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></center><br>The Court disagrees with the Report and Recommendation of the IBP Board of Governors. The IBP has no jurisdiction over the disbarment complaint. The administrative complaint must be filed with the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>Republic Act No. 6770<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (R.A. No. 6770), otherwise known as "The Ombudsman Act of 1989," prescribes the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman. Section 15, paragraph 1 of R.A. No. 6770 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 15. <i>Powers, Function and Duties</i>. - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:<br><blockquote>(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases.<br></blockquote></blockquote>The 1987 Constitution clothes the Office of the Ombudsman with the administrative disciplinary authority to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of any government official when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Office of the Ombudsman is the government agency responsible for enforcing administrative, civil, and criminal liability of government officials "in every case where the evidence warrants in order <b>to promote efficient service by the Government to the people</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In <i>Samson v. Restrivera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court ruled that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman encompasses all kinds of malfeasance, misfeasance, and non-feasance committed by any public officer or employee during his or her tenure. Consequently, acts or missions of public officials relating to the performance of their function as government officials are within the administrative disciplinary jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In <i>Spouses Buffe v. Secretary Gonzales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that the IBP has no jurisdiction over government lawyers who are charged with administrative offenses involving their <b>official duties</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In the present case, the allegations in Alicias' complaint against Atty. Macatangay, Atty. Zerna, Atty. Ronquillo, and Atty. Buenaflor, which include their (1) failure to evaluate CSC records; (2) failure to evaluate documentary evidence presented to the CSC; and (3) non-service of CSC Orders and Resolutions, all relate to their misconduct in the discharge of their official duties as government lawyers working in the CSC. Hence, the IBP has no jurisdiction over Alicias' complaint. These are acts or omissions connected with their duties as government lawyers exercising official functions in the CSC and within the administrative disciplinary jurisdiction of their superior<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or the Office of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the administrative complaint against Atty.
