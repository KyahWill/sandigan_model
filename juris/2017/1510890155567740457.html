Moreover, applicant's evidence consisting of the DENR-CENRO Certifications (Exhs. "O" and "P") that Lot 2 of PSY 213331 is not covered by any public land application and that its equivalent is Lot No, 10549 of the Montalban Cadastre have substantial probative value which established (sic) that the land is alienable and disposable and not covered by any land grant from the government.<br></blockquote>Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The CA, however, denied the motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated 22 January 2008, prompting petitioner to elevate the case to this Court.<br><br><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THIS COURT</span><br></center><br>In its Petition for Review, the Republic argues that (a) the decision of the CA and the RTC to confirm the title of respondent to the land based on her possession and occupation thereof was not supported by evidence; and (b) the testimonial and documentary evidence she presented did not establish possession of the property in the manner and period required by law, that is, her possession of the property since 12 June 1945 or earlier.

Since each type is governed by its own set of legal principles, the framework for analysis to be used in resolving an application would vary depending on the paragraph invoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Hence, it is important for the Court to first determine the exact legal ground used by an applicant for registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In this case, we note that the application filed by respondent before the RTC did not state the exact legal basis of her request. At best, the pleading implied that her claim was one for registration and confirmation of title based on her <i>possession</i> and <i>occupation</i> of the property:<br><blockquote>COMES NOW Petitioner Rosario L. Nicolas, of legal age, widow, Pilipino [sic] with address at Brgy. San Isidro, Rodriguez (formerly Montalban), Rizal Province, Philippines, by her undersigned counsel and to this Honorable Court respectfully petitions to have the land hereinafter described below brought under the operation of the Land Registration Act and to have said land <b>titled, registered and confirmed</b> in her name and further declares that:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>6. Petitioner acquired the subject parcel of land <b>by way of occupation</b> and has been in <b>natural, open, public, adverse, contin[u]ous, uninterrupted</b> and in the concept of an <b>owner/possessor</b> thereof since October 1964 up to the present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>From the foregoing allegations, it appears that the claim of respondent is anchored on either of the first two paragraphs of Section 14. However, it is unclear whether she sought judicial confirmation and registration of her title pursuant to Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529, or of the registration of her title on the ground of acquisitive prescription under Section 14(2) of the same law.<br><br>Similarly, no specific provision in P.D. 1529 was identified by the RTC when it granted the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Its mention of the Civil Code, however, seems to indicate an application of the principle of acquisitive prescription. The CA, for its part, delineated the differences between the first two paragraphs of Section 14, but decided to apply both clauses. In its Decision, it ruled that respondent is entitled to register her title under either paragraph:<br><blockquote>From the evidence adduced, <b>applicant-appellee has convincingly established her registrable title to the subject land, which is entitled to confirmation and registration by the trial court</b>. As testified by the daughter of applicant, her mother commenced occupying the subject land since 1940 and up to the present which (sic) has been planted with fruit-bearing trees and vegetables by their caretaker. Her testimony was corroborated by Santiago Eulin, their caretaker since 1942 who took over after his father, the original caretaker. These witnesses declared that they even stayed on the land in question where the applicant has a hut. It was also established that the applicant had the property surveyed in 1964 resulting in the approval of Plan PSU 21331 by the Bureau of Lands. This qualifies applicant under <b>Section 14, par. 1 of the Property Registration Decree</b>.<br><br>Even assuming that applicant's occupation and possession of the subject land did not start on July 12, 1945 or earlier but only in 1964 when she had it surveyed, still <b>she can apply for registration of title under Sec. 14, par. 2 of the Property Registration Decree as she has been occupying the land continuously for more than thirty (30) years from the time the application was filed in 1996</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>Given these findings, the Court has examined the application for registration in this case under the legal framework of<i> both</i> Section 14(1) and (2) of P.D. 1529. We find that respondent has failed to sufficiently establish the requisites of both paragraphs; in particular, with respect to the classification and the character of the land in question. Hence, we are constrained to reverse the CA and the RTC Decisions allowing the registration of her title to the property.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">Respondent has failed to prove that the property is alienable and disposable agricultural land that may be registered under Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529.</i><br><br>Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529 governs applications for registration of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain. This paragraph operationalizes Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141 as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This provision grants occupants of public land the right to judicial confirmation of their title. Based on these two provisions and other related sections of C.A. 141, registration is allowed provided the following requisites have been complied with:<br><ol><li>The applicant is a Filipino citizen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br></li><li>The applicant, by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, has been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the property since 12 June 1945.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br></li><li>The property has been declared alienable and disposable as of the filing of the application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br></li><li>If the area applied for does not exceed 12 hectares, the application should be filed by 31 December 2020.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></li></ol>As earlier stated, respondent failed to establish the third requisite, i.e., that the property subject of the application is alienable and disposable agricultural land.<br><br>The Court has emphasized in a long line of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> that an applicant for registration under Section 14(1) must prove that the subject property has been classified as alienable and disposable agricultural land by virtue of a positive act of the Executive Department. In <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we declared:<br><blockquote>Alienable and disposable lands of the State fall into two categories, to wit: (a) patrimonial lands of the State, or those classified as lands of private ownership under Article 425 of the Civil Code, without limitation; and (b) lands of the public domain, or the public lands as provided by the Constitution, but with the limitation that the lands must only be agricultural. Consequently, lands classified as forest or timber, mineral, or national parks are not susceptible of alienation or disposition unless they are reclassified as agricultural. A positive act of the Government is necessary to enable such reclassification, and the exclusive prerogative to classify public lands under existing laws is vested in the Executive Department, not in the courts. xxx Thus, until the Executive Department exercises its prerogative to classify or reclassify lands, or until Congress or the President declares that the State no longer intends the land to be used for public service or for the development of national wealth, the Regalian Doctrine is applicable.<br></blockquote>In this case, we note that both the RTC and the CA glossed over this requirement. The RTC, for instance, only made a general conclusion as to the classification and alienability of the property, but without any discussion of the evidence presented:<br><blockquote>From the evidence adduced, applicant-appellee has convincingly established her registrable title to the subject land which is entitled to confirmation and registration by the trial court. x x x It was also established that the applicant had the property surveyed in 1964 resulting in the approval of Plan PSU-213331 by the Bureau of Lands. This qualifies applicant under Sec. 14, par. 1 of the Property Registration Decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA, on the other hand, simply relied on the fact that the property had been the subject of a private survey in 1964:<br><blockquote>From the evidence adduced, the following facts have been duly proved:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>That the land applied for is neither subject to any water, oil/nor (sic) mineral rights, not within any government reservation, naval or military, or mineral rights, within the forest zone, and neither is it part of the inalienable or undisposable land of the public domain nor covered by the Code on Comprehensive Agrarian Reform or subject to any subsisting Public Patent application;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>That the said parcel of land applied for is duly surveyed for registration (Exh. "J"), classified as agricultural; that they planted mangoes, buko, sometimes corn in the area through their caretaker x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>While a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is generally limited to a review of errors of law, the Court may conduct its own review of the evidence if the findings of the lower courts are bereft of legal and factual bases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In this case, the conclusions of the RTC and the CA are not only contradicted by the evidence on record; they are likewise contrary to law and jurisprudence. As a result, the Court is constrained to set aside these pronouncements.<br><br>To prove that the property subject of an application for original registration is part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, applicants must "identify a positive act of the government, such as an official proclamation, declassifying inalienable public land into disposable land for agricultural or other purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> To sufficiently establish this positive act, they must submit (1) a certification from the CENRO or the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO); and (2) a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Here, respondent presented the following pieces of evidence to establish her claim that the land had been classified as agricultural and considered alienable and disposable:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) A CENRO Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> stating that the land was not covered by any public land application or embraced by any administrative title, but with a notation that that the alienability of the land was "[n]ot projected due to [u]navailability of coordinates re: Tala Estate Tie-line";<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) A CENRO Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> that the lot "is not covered by any kind of public land application";<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) A Report;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> from the Land Registration Authority (LRA) declaring that it was "not in a position to verify whether or not the parcel of land subject of registration is already covered by land patent and is within the area classified as alienable and disposable land of the public domain"; and<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(4) The testimonies of Leonila Alfaro,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> her daughter, and Santiago Eulin<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (the caretaker of the land) confirming that the property is agricultural in nature.<br></div><br>It is evident from the foregoing enumeration that respondent not only neglected to submit the required CENRO/PENRO certification and DENR classification, but ah;o presented evidence that completely failed to prove her assertion.<br><br>First, the testimonies of Leonila and Santiago on the classification of the land have very little evidentiary value. That they consider the property agricultural in nature is irrelevant, as their statements are mere opinions bereft of any legal significance.<br><br>Second, none of the documents submitted by respondent to the trial court indicated that the subject property was agricultural or part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain. At most, the CENRO Report and Certification stated that the land was not covered by any kind of public land application. This was far from an adequate proof of the classification of the land. In fact, in <i>Republic v Lualhati</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court rejected an attempt to prove the alienability of public land using similar evidence:<br><blockquote>Here, respondent failed to establish, by the required evidence, that the land sought to be registered has been classified as alienable or disposable land of the public domain. The records of this case merely bear certifications from the DENR-CENRO, Region IV, Antipolo City, stating that no public land application or land patent covering the subject lots is pending nor are the lots embraced by any administrative title. Said CENRO certifications, however, do not even make any pronouncement as to the alienable character of the lands in question for they merely recognize the absence of any pending land patent application, administrative title, or government project being conducted thereon. But even granting that they expressly declare that the subject lands form part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, these certifications remain insufficient for purposes of granting respondent's application for registration. As constantly held by this Court, it is not enough for the CENRO to certify that a land is alienable and disposable. The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. Unfortunately for respondent, the evidence submitted clearly falls short of the requirements for original registration in order to show the alienable character of the lands subject herein.<br></blockquote>Applying these standards to the instant case, we declare that the RTC <b>did</b> not have sufficient basis for its finding that the property in question was alienable and disposable.<br><br>The Court also finds that the ruling of the CA on the evidentiary value of the private survey is untenable. The fact that the land has been privately surveyed is not sufficient to prove its classification or alienable character. While the conduct of a survey and the submission of the original tracing cloth plan are mandatory requirements for applications for original registration of land under P.D. 1529, they only serve to establish the true identity of the land and to ensure that the property does not overlap with another one covered by a previous registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> These documents do not, by themselves, prove alienability and disposability of the property. In fact, in several cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court has declared that even a survey plan with a notation that the property is alienable cannot be considered as sufficient evidence of alienability. Here, the survey plan and original tracing cloth plan submitted by respondent does not even bear that notation. Consequently, it was grave error for the CA to consider the mere conduct of a private survey as proof of the classification and the alienability of the land.<br><br><b><i>Respondent has failed to prove that the land subject of the application is part of the patrimonial property of the State that may be acquired by prescription under Section 14(2) of P.D. 1529.</i></b><br><br>As previously noted, the CA also allowed the registration of the property under Section 14(2) of P.D. 1529 based on the following findings: (1) the property is "private in nature" as shown by the fact that it is "covered by a private survey";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (2) respondent had occupied the land continuously for more than 30 years from the time of the filing of the application in 1996;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and (3) the land is not covered by any public land application based on the DENR-CENRO Certifications submitted by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>We do not agree. The Court finds no sufficient basis to allow the registration of the property under Section 14(2).<br><br>By express provision of the law, only <i>private</i> lands that have been acquired by prescription under existing laws may be the subject of applications for registration under Section 14(2). The starting point of the Court's evaluation must, therefore, be whether the property involved falls within the scope of the paragraph.<br><br>Under the Civil Code, all things within human commerce are generally susceptible of prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Properties of the public dominion, or those owned by the State, are expressly excluded by law from this general rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> unless they are proven to be <i>patrimonial</i> in character. As the Court explained in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Tan</i>:<br><blockquote>Only private property can be acquired by prescription. Property of public dominion is outside the commerce of man. It cannot be the object of prescription because prescription does not run against the State in its sovereign capacity. However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">when property of public dominion is no longer intended for public use or for public service, it becomes part of the patrimonial property of the State</span>. When this happens, the property is withdrawn from public dominion and becomes property of private ownership, albeit still owned by the State. The property is now brought within the commerce of man and becomes susceptible to the concepts of legal possession and prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To establish that the land subject of the application has been converted into patrimonial property of the State, an applicant must prove the following:<br><ol><li>The subject property has been classified as agricultural land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br></li><li>The property has been declared alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br></li><li>There is an express government manifestation that the property is already patrimonial, or is no longer retained for public service or the development of national wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></li></ol>It must be emphasized that without the concurrence of these three conditions, the land remains part of public dominion and thus incapable of acquisition by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Here, the records show that respondent has failed to allege or prove that the subject land belongs to the patrimonial property of the State. As earlier discussed, the evidence she has presented does not even show that the property is alienable and disposable agricultural land. She has also failed to cite any government act or declaration converting the land into patrimonial property of the State.<br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the CA, the DENR-CENRO Certifications submitted by respondent are not enough; they cannot substitute for the three conditions required by law as proof that the land may be the subject of prescription under the Civil Code. For the same reason, the mere conduct of a private survey of a property — even with the approval of the Bureau of Lands — does not convert the lot into private land or patrimonial property of the State. Clearly, the appellate court erred when it relied on the survey to justify its conclusion that the land is private in nature.<br><br>Considering the absence of sufficient evidence that the subject land is a patrimonial property of the State, we must consider it part of public dominion and thus immune from acquisitive prescription.<br><br>As a final note, the Court must point out that proof of the classification, alienability and disposability of the subject property is of particular significance in applications for the registration of land. Given the general rule that public lands may not be alienated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> it is the burden of applicants to prove that the land they seek to register falls within the classifications enumerated in Section 14 of P.D. 1529; in particular, the specific paragraph they invoke as basis for registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Absent that proof, no length of possession or occupation would vest any right of ownership over the property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and registration under P.D. 1529 cannot be sanctioned by this Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
