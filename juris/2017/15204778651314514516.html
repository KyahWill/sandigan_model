(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The Petition calls into question the proper application of: <i>(i) </i>the two (2)-year period under Section 112(A); and <i>(ii) </i>the one hundred twenty (120) and thirty (30)-day periods under Section 112(C). These questions, however, have long been put to rest in the cases of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>(Aichi)</i> and <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Rogue Power Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>(San Roque)</i>.<br><br>In <i>Aichi, </i>the Court unequivocally ruled that the two (2)-year period under Section 112(A) should be reckoned from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made consistent with the plain import of the NIRC. The Court also clarified that the two (2)-year period only applies to administrative claims, and does <i>not </i>extend to judicial claims. Anent judicial claims, the Court held that the one hundred twenty (120) and thirty (30)-day periods under Section 112(C) are mandatory and jurisdictional, such that judicial claims filed before the denial of the taxpayers' administrative claim or the lapse of the one hundred twenty (120)-day period in case of the CIR's inaction would be deemed premature, while judicial claims filed beyond the thirty (30)-day period after such denial or lapse would be deemed filed out of time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Court's ruling in <i>San Roque </i>set out exceptions to the mandatory periods under Section 112(C), thus:<br><br><blockquote>There is no dispute that the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and that the CTA does not acquire jurisdiction over a judicial claim that is filed before the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br><b>There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. The first exception is if the Commissioner, through a specific ruling, misleads a particular taxpayer to prematurely file a judicial claim with the CTA. Such specific ruling is applicable only to such particular taxpayer. The second exception is <u>where the Commissioner, <i>through a general interpretative rule </i>issued under Section 4 of the Tax Code, misleads all taxpayers into filing prematurely judicial claims with the CTA</u>. In these cases, the Commissioner cannot be allowed to later on question the CTA's assumption of jurisdiction over such claim since equitable estoppel has set in as expressly authorized under Section 246 of the Tax Code.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Specifically, the Court, in <i>San Roque, </i>held that <b>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03,</b> which states that "[the] taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the [one hundred twenty (120)]-day period before x x x seek[ing] judicial relief with the CTA by way of [p]etition for [r]eview"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> serves as a valid claim for equitable estoppel recognized under Section 246 from the time it was issued on December 10, 2003 until it was overturned on October 6, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In turn, the principles decreed in <i>Aichi </i>and <i>San Roque </i>were later synthesized in the consolidated cases of <i>Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership v.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (2013 Consolidated Cases) involving M1's claim for unutilized input VAT for the-year 2003. The 2013 Consolidated Cases summarized the relevant periods under Section 112, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(1) An administrative claim must be filed with the CIR within two [2] years after the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales were made.<br><br>(2) The CIR has [one hundred twenty (120)] days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the administrative claim within which to decide whether to grant a refund or issue a tax credit certificate. The [one hundred twenty (120)]-day period may extend beyond the two [2]-year period from the filing of the administrative claim if the claim is filed in the later part of the two [2]-year period. If the [one hundred twenty (120)]-day period expires without any decision from the CIR, then the administrative claim may be considered to be denied by inaction.<br><br>(3) <b>A judicial claim must be filed with the CTA within [thirty] 30 days from the receipt of the CIR's decision denying the administrative claim or from the expiration of the [one hundred twenty (120)]-day period without any action from the CIR. </b><br><br>(4) All taxpayers, however, can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on [December 10, 2003] up to its reversal by this Court in <i>Aichi </i>on [October 6, 2010], as an exception to the mandatory and jurisdictional 120+30 day periods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Proceeding therefrom, it becomes clear that M1's judicial claim for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 were filed out of time. The Court notes the following relevant dates:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="14%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Quarter </b></div> </td> <td width="23%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Close of Taxable Quarter </b></div> </td> <td width="24%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Amended Administrative Claim </b></div> </td> <td width="21%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Expiration of CIR's period to Act </b></div> </td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Judicial Claim </b></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="14%"><div align="CENTER">Second </div> </td> <td width="23%"><div align="CENTER">June 30, 2004 </div> </td> <td width="24%"><div align="CENTER">June 22, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="21%"><div align="CENTER">October 20, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER">July 21, 2006 </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="14%"><div align="CENTER">Third </div> </td> <td width="23%"><div align="CENTER">September 30, 2004 </div> </td> <td width="24%"><div align="CENTER">June 22, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="21%"><div align="CENTER">October 20, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER">July 21, 2006 </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="14%"><div align="CENTER">Fourth </div> </td> <td width="23%"><div align="CENTER">December 31, 2004 </div> </td> <td width="24%"><div align="CENTER">June 22, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="21%"><div align="CENTER">October 20, 2005 </div> </td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER">July 21, 2006 </div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>The thirtieth (30<sup>th</sup>) day following October 20, 2005 (which is the date when the CIR's period to act expired) fell on November 19, 2005, a Saturday. Accordingly, M1 had until November 21, 2005, the next working day, to file its judicial claim before the CTA. As M1 filed its judicial claim over seven (7) months beyond the expiration of the thirty (30)-day period, the CTA <i>En Banc </i>correctly ordered its dismissal. To be sure, while BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was in effect at the time M1 filed its judicial claim, said ruling only constitutes a valid claim for equitable estoppel with respect to <b>premature </b>judicial claims, and not those filed beyond the 120+30-day periods under Section 112(C).<br><br>Finally, it bears stressing that neither <i>Atlas </i>nor <i>Mirant </i>had been promulgated at the time M1 filed its administrative and judicial claims. Hence, M1's argument that <i>Atlas </i>was controlling at the time it filed its judicial claim is erroneous and misleading, as the Court already found in the 2013 Consolidated Cases:<br><br><blockquote><i>Atlas</i> was promulgated on [June 8, 2007], while <i>Mirant </i>was promulgated on [September 12, 2008]. It is therefore misleading to state that <i>Atlas </i>was the controlling doctrine at the time of filing of the claims. The 1997 Tax Code, which took effect on [January 1, 1998], was the applicable law at the time of filing of the claims in issue, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Accordingly, the Petition should be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>is <b>DENIED.</b> The Assailed Decision dated January 12, 2011 and Resolution dated June 30, 2011 of the CTA <i>En Banc </i>in C.T.A.
