				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A judgment upon a compromise is rendered based on the parties' reciprocal concessions. With all the more reason should a judgment upon a compromise be complied with in good faith considering that the parties themselves crafted its terms. <p> These are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the December 10, 2009 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and March 17, 2010 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 104961. The Court of Appeals held that both parties—Team Image Entertainment, Inc. (Team Image) and Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. (Solar Team)—violated the Compromise Agreement they had entered into in connection with a civil case for accounting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> filed before Branch 59, Regional Trial Court, Makati City. Team Image was specifically ordered to pay Solar Team P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages for failing to settle its monetary obligation to Solar Team within the period provided in the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Further, the Court of Appeals allowed Team Image to suspend payments under the Compromise Agreement because Solar Team failed to withdraw the complaint-in-intervention it had earlier filed against Team Image's President, Felix S. Co (Co), contrary to their agreement to dismiss all actions they had filed against each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> Solar Team owned movies, films, telenovelas, television series, programs, and coverage specials that it aired over block times in several television stations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It derived profits by selling advertising spots to interested business enterprises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> On April 24, 1996, Solar Team entered into a Marketing Agreement with Team Image,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which agreed to act as Solar Team's exclusive marketing agent by selling advertising spots to business enterprises on behalf of Solar Team.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> According to Solar Team, Team Image breached their Marketing Agreement by failing to disclose the names of the entities to which Team Image sold advertising spots. Further, Team Image allegedly represented itself as the owner of Solar Team's television programs, series, and telenovelas, hence collecting the proceeds of the sale without remitting them to Solar Team. For these reasons, Solar Team demanded that Team Image render an accounting of all the transactions the latter had entered into pursuant to the Marketing Agreement and that it remit all the proceeds it had received in selling Solar Team's television programs, series, and telenovelas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> When Team Image refused to render an accounting, Solar Team filed against Team Image and its President, Co, a Complaint for Accounting and Damages before the Regional Trial Court of Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The case was raffled to Branch 59, presided by Judge Winlove M. Dumayas (Judge Dumayas).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> On January 17, 2002, the trial court rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> finding that Team Image breached the Marketing Agreement. According to the trial court, Team Image only had the authority to sell advertisement spots on behalf of Solar Team, not to collect any sales proceeds. Thus, it ordered Team Image to render an accounting of all its transactions and collections under the Marketing Agreement. The dispositive portion of this Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [Solar Team] and against [Team Image and Felix S.

In essence, the parties agreed on the payment terms and their division of receivables from the media company VTV Corporation, which had purchased advertising spots from Team Image as Solar Team's marketing agent. For purposes of accounting and auditing these receivables, the parties hired SyCip Gorres Velayo and Company (SGV and Co.) as auditor. </p><p> With respect to other business ventures that the parties may have jointly undertaken, paragraph 18 of the Compromise Agreement stated that the parties must submit a certification of the existence of these receivables: </p><blockquote> <p> 18. To further assure each one of them, both parties shall within ten (10) days from the date of execution of this agreement, submit to one another, certification and/or reasonable and available proof of the existence of said receivables.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The parties likewise agreed to waive all their claims against each other and to cause the provisional dismissal of all the criminal and civil actions that they had filed against each other. Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement provided: </p><blockquote> <p> 21. This agreement constitutes the final repository of all the prior understanding agreements and contracts of the parties and shall operate as total waiver and discharge of any or all claims, counterclaims, causes of action, claims and demands of whatever kind and nature which each may have against the other, including their respective heirs[,] assigns[,] and successors-in-interest arising out of any of all matters, cause or thing, whether directly or indirectly, related with the Marketing Agency Agreement dated 24 April 1996. </p> <p> 22. By virtue hereof, the parties have agreed, as they hereby agree to immediately provisionally dismiss all actions, whether civil or criminal, they may have filed against the other, and after SGV shall have finally completed the audit and accounting tasked upon it, the results of which is final and binding upon the parties, all said civil and/or criminal actions shall be permanently dismissed by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Further, the parties agreed to the immediate issuance of a writ of execution and payment of liquidated damages in case of breach of the Compromise Agreement. Paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement stated: </p><blockquote> <p> 24. In the event SGV shall have made a final determination of the respective accountability of the parties and any of the parties fail to comply with the same, or in the event any of the parties is remiss or reneges from [its] commitment/s as specified in this Agreement or breaches the warranties and/or representation as contained herein, then the aggrieved party shall be entitled to an immediate issuance of a writ of execution to enforce compliance thereof and the guilty party shall pay the innocent party the sum of P2 Million Pesos by way of liquidated damages and/or penalty and shall, likewise, shoulder all the expenses in enforcing this compromise agreement by a writ of execution. Moreover, the innocent party shall have the right to invoke the principle of reciprocity of obligations in contracts as provided for by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Finding the provisions of the Compromise Agreement not contrary to law, morals, or public policy, the trial court approved and rendered judgment based on the Compromise Agreement in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated April 30, 2003.</p><p> The parties subsequently filed motions for issuance of a writ of execution on account of the other's alleged violation of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> The first motion for issuance of a writ of execution was filed by Team Image on April 26, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Team Image prayed that the trial court allow it to suspend payments to Solar Team under the Compromise Agreement due to the alleged failure of Solar Team's Chief Executive Officer, William Tieng (Tieng), to collect receivables from VTV Corporation. In addition, Solar Team allegedly failed to submit to Team Image a certification on the existence of the receivables from VTV Corporation, in violation of paragraph 18 of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated April 29, 2004, the trial court allowed Team Image to suspend payments to Solar Team '"until after [the trial court] shall have resolved [the April 26, 2004 motion for issuance of a writ of execution]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The trial court subsequently issued a Writ of Execution on May 28, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> However, in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated November 23, 2004, the trial court granted Solar Team's Motion for Reconsideration; thus, it set aside its previous order allowing suspension of payment and quashed the writ of execution. The dispositive portion of the November 23, 2004 Order read: </p><p align="center"> ORDER </p><blockquote> <p> Finding the Motion for Reconsideration filed by [Solar Team] to be impressed with merit, the same is hereby GRANTED. </p> <p> Accordingly, the Order of the Court dated April 30, 2004 is hereby RECONSIDERED and set aside and the Writ of Execution dated May 28, 2004 is hereby QUASHED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Team Image moved to reconsider the November 23, 2004 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p>In the meantime, on October 6, 2005, Team Image filed a second motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> for issuance of a writ of execution and suspension of payments (October 6, 2005 Motion) due to Solar rerun's alleged violation of paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement. According to Team Image, Solar Team failed to cause the dismissal of its complaint-in-intervention in a collection case filed against Team Image,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> with Solar Team actively participating in the civil case after the execution of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated November 3, 2005, the trial court granted the October 6, 2005 Motion, issuing a writ of execution to enforce payment by Solar Team of P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages and allowing Team Image to suspend payments to Solar Team. The dispositive portion of the November 3, 2005 Order read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby . . .

The trial court found that Team Image filed the Motion for Reconsideration beyond the reglementary period. As for Solar Team, the trial court found that it had failed to comply with its obligation to cause the dismissal of all pending cases that it had filed against Team Image. Hence, Solar Team was ordered to pay Team Image P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages per paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement. The dispositive portion of the April 7, 2006 Order read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court resolves to DENY [Team Image's] Motion for Reconsideration dated August 22, 2005 from the Order of this Court dated November 23, 2004.

Team Image argued that Solar Team's Tieng violated anew paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement by failing to cause the dismissal of the criminal cases he had earlier filed against Team Image's Co. On December 18, 2007, Team Image filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> with prayer for issuance of a writ of execution and suspension of payments (December 18, 2007 Omnibus Motion), this time, for Solar Team's Tieng to return to Team Image a total of P25,862,750.00. This amount allegedly included the collections in excess of the P26,000,000.00 fixed in the Compromise Agreement; the P2,891,226.97 supposedly collected by a certain Ma. Fe Barreiro (Barreiro)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> without Solar Team's authority but actually redounded to Tieng's benefit; and a total of P8,500,000.00 in post-dated checks still in possession of Tieng. Thus, Team Image reiterated its prayer for the trial court to implement the November 3, 2005 Order directing Solar Team to pay Team Image liquidated damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p> In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated January 9, 2008, the trial court ordered the implementation of the November 3, 2005 Order to enforce payment of liquidated damages by Solar Team for failure to cause the dismissal of its complaint-in-intervention in the collection case filed against Team Image. A Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> was subsequently issued on January 16, 2008, directing the sheriff to implement the November 3, 2005 Order.</p><p> Two (2) days after or on January 18, 2008, Solar Team filed a motion to defer the implementation of the January 16, 2008 Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Solar Team likewise filed a motion to hold in abeyance the implementation of the Letters of Garnishment issued pursuant to the January 16, 2008 Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> Acting on Team Image's December 5, 2007 Motion and December 18, 2007 Omnibus Motion in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated January 21, 2008, the trial court directed Solar Team, through Tieng, to cause the dismissal of the criminal cases filed against Co pursuant to paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement.</p><p> Further, the trial court found that Tieng indeed had excess collections from VTV Corporation. In his complaint for sum of money filed against VTV Corporation, Tieng allegedly admitted that he had collected P22,971,572.03 from VTV Corporation, an amount which exceeded the P10,275,547.48 disclosed in paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> The trial court likewise found that contrary to Solar Team's representation in paragraph 5 of the Compromise Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the P2,891,226.97 supposedly collected by Barreiro without Solar Team's authority actually redounded to Tieng's benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p> Based on these findings, the trial court ordered Solar Team to return the excess amounts and incorrect charges and to pay Team Image a total of P8,000,000.00 in liquidated damages for breaching four (4) warranties made in the Compromise Agreement. The dispositive portion of the January 21, 2008 Order read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court hereby grants [Team Image and Felix S.

Co;</p><p> Fourth, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in finding no grave abuse of discretion in the trial court's reversal of its earlier order that required Solar Team Entertainment, Inc.'s William Tieng to turn over P25,862,750.00. to Team Image Entertainment, Inc. as overpayments and P2,891,226.97 to Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. as amounts collected by William Tieng from VTV Corporation; and,</p><p> Finally, whether or not only a maximum of P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages may be awarded under the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> On the first issue, Team Image argues that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's May 19, 2008 Order declaring Team Image to have defaulted in paying its obligation under the Compromise Agreement. Team Image maintains that the trial court, in its own November 3, 2005 Order, stated that Team Image was entitled to suspend payments under the Compromise Agreement because Solar Team did not withdraw the complaint-in-intervention it had earlier filed against Team Image. Team Image's liability under the Compromise Agreement, if any, only became due and demandable on April 7, 2006 when the trial court set aside the November 3, 2005 Order, not on February 19, 2005 as erroneously found by the trial court in its subsequent May 19, 2008 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p><p> On the second issue, Team Image maintained that Solar Team violated the Compromise Agreement because the latter failed to withdraw the complaint-in-intervention it had filed in <em>ABC v. Team Image</em>, a collection case against Team Image. The trial court's November 3, 2005 and April 7, 2006 Orders that ordered Solar Team to withdraw its complaint-in-intervention were affirmed on certiorari by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 94102 and on appeal by this Court in G.R. No. 183848. While Solar Team filed a Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 183848, the Motion was already denied with finality. Thus, Solar Team's argument that it cannot withdraw its complaint-in-intervention pending the resolution of its Motion for Reconsideration "rest[s] on a shaky and slim foundation[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p> On the third issue, Team Image argues that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring that criminal liability cannot be the subject of a compromise. Team Image maintains that there was nothing in the Compromise Agreement which was contrary to law, morals, or public policy. Further, courts encourage judgments based on compromise, the only exceptions being matters relating to: (a) civil status of persons; (b) the validity of a marriage or a legal separation; (c) any ground for legal separation; (d) future support; (e) the jurisdiction of courts; and, (f) future legitime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement that required Solar Team to dismiss all cases it had filed against Team Image and Co does not fall within these exceptions. Consequently, Solar Team must cause the dismissal of the criminal cases it filed against Team Image and Co per paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> On the fourth issue, Team Image maintains that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the reversal of trial court's earlier Orders requiring Solar Team's Tieng to turn over a total of P25,862,750.00 in excess collections from VTV Corporation to Team Image for equal division among the parties. Team Image argues that contrary to Solar Team and Tieng's representation in paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement, Tieng collected more than P10,275,547.48 from VTV Corporation. Specifically, Tieng received P22,971,527.03 from VTV Corporation as he alleged in his Complaint in Civil Case No. 05-603 pending before Branch 57 of the trial court. In addition, the P2,891,226.97 supposedly collected by Barreiro without Solar Team's authority actually redounded to the benefit of Tieng; hence, the amount should likewise be returned for equal distribution between Solar Team and Team Image.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p><p> On the fifth issue, Team Image argues that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the reversal by the trial court of its earlier Order for Solar Team to pay a total of P8,000,000.00 in liquidated damages: According to Team Image, it is clear from paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement that a writ of execution may issue for every violation of the Compromise Agreement. Hence, for every writ of execution, a corresponding award of liquidated damages to the aggrieved party must be paid. Team Image contends that the maximum amount of P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages allowed to be awarded would "result in a serious crisis whereby one party will contravene and/or breach with impunity any of [its] representations and warranties, and worst, even all of them, with only a relatively small amount of penalty compared [to] the actual amount which is the subject matter of the entire compromise agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><p> Arguing on the first issue, Solar Team counters that Team Image defaulted in its payments under the Compromise Agreement as was earlier found by the trial court. Between November 23, 2004, when the trial court set aside its initial order allowing suspension of payments, and November 3, 2005, when the trial court again allowed suspension of payments, there was an almost one (1)-year period when Team Image should have resumed its payments to Solar Team. Team Image, thus, defaulted in its payments during this almost one (1)-year period and the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the November 3, 2005 and April 7, 2006 Orders directing Team Image to pay Solar Team P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages for violation of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p><p> On the second issue, Solar Team maintains that it did not violate the Compromise Agreement when it failed to withdraw the complaint-in­ intervention it had filed in<em> ABC v. Team Image</em>. Solar Team alleges that the issue of whether or not it indeed violated the Compromise Agreement is currently pending before this Court in a Petition for Review docketed as <em>Solar Team v. Hon. Dumayas</em>, G.R. No. 183848. Consequently, the Court of Appeals should not have resolved this issue in deference to this Court's ''supreme authority."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> </p><p> On the third issue, Solar Team echoes the Court of Appeals' pronouncement that criminal liability cannot be the subject of a compromise. A crime being a violation of public law, the aggrieved party is the public in general, not a private individual. Consequently, neither Team Image nor Solar Team, both being private entities, may agree to cause the dismissal of the criminal cases they filed against each other because they are both mere witnesses, not parties, in the criminal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> On the fourth issue, Solar Team maintains that Team Image's claim of overpayments is premature considering that the appointed auditing firm, SGV and Co., has not yet finalized its accounting report as required under paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement. Further, Tieng's supposed admission that he received P22,971,572.03 from VTV Corporation was, at best, an extrajudicial admission not made in the present case. This admission cannot be used against him and the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court orders that set aside the earlier directives for Solar Team to return Team Image's alleged overpayments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></p><p> On the fifth issue, Solar Team reiterates the Court of Appeals' pronouncement that only a maximum of P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages may be awarded based on the Compromise Agreement. Solar Team argues that nothing in the Compromise Agreement provided that each breach would correspond to an award of liquidated damages. Furthermore, paragraph 24 used "breaches of warranties" and "commitments,'' meaning, "there can be as many orders of compliance as there are proven breaches,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> but only a maximum of P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages, regardless of the number of supposed breaches, may be awarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> This Court <em>partially grants </em>the respective Petitions for Review on Certiorari filed by Team Image and Solar Team. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Under the Compromise Agreement, Team Image acknowledged and agreed to pay a total of P26,000,000,00 representing marketing commissions collectible from VTV Corporation.

For instance, 50 days from the signing of the Compromise Agreement on April 28, 2003 would fall on June 17, 2003. Hence, by June 17, 2003, Team Image should have already paid Solar Team P3,267,000.00 in post-dated checks. Another obligation would be for Team Image to pay Solar Team P1,015,425.06 within 60 days from the signing of the Compromise Agreement, the 60<sup>th</sup> day being June 27, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> There is no proof, however, that Team Image complied with these obligations within the required periods. That Team Image filed a motion for suspension of payments further demonstrates that it had not fully paid its obligations under the Compromise Agreement. </p> <p> While it is true that the trial court granted the Motion for Suspension of Payments in its April 29, 2004 Order, this Order was subsequently set aside on November 23, 2004. Until the trial court granted Team Image's second motion for suspension of payments on November 3, 2005, Team Image had almost a year to resume payments. However, Team Image did not do so. The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly held that Team Image was in default for failure to resume payments under the Compromise Agreement. Team Image violated paragraphs 6 to 9 of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement are again provided below: </p><blockquote> <p> 21.

By virtue hereof, the parties have agreed, as they hereby agree to immediately provisionally dismiss all actions, whether civil or criminal, they may have filed against the other, and after SGV shall have finally completed the audit and accounting tasked upon it, the results of which is final and binding upon the parties, all said civil and/or criminal actions shall be permanently dismissed by the parties. </p> </blockquote> <p> Paragraph 22 requires both Team Image and Solar Team to "immediately provisionally dismiss all actions, whether civil or criminal, they may have filed against each other." They shall cause the permanent dismissal of the actions "after [SGV and Co.] shall have finally completed the audit and accounting tasked upon it." </p><p> When the Compromise Agreement was executed on April 28, 2003, there was a pending collection case filed by ABC Television against Team Image when Solar Team filed a complaint-in-intervention. It does not appear that Solar Team filed a motion to dismiss the complaint-in-intervention it had filed against Team Image; hence, Solar Team violated paragraph 22 of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> That the term "provisional dismissal," in its technical sense, only applies to criminal cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> is not an argument for Solar Team to refuse to withdraw the complaint-in-intervention. It does not appear that Team Image and Solar Team meant to use the term in its technical sense. Considering that the parties agreed in paragraph 21 that the Compromise Agreement "shall operate as total waiver and discharge of any or all claims, counterclaims, causes of action, claims and demands of whatever kind and nature which each may have against the other," the parties intended to terminate all the cases they filed against each other. </p><p> The pendency of the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Solar Team in <i>Solar Team v. Hon. Dumayas</i>, G.R. No. 183848, may no longer be invoked because it had already been denied with finality. Even if G.R. No. 183848 remained active, it originated from a Petition for Certiorari questioning the interlocutory Order of November 3, 2005, a suit that can proceed separately from the main case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> It merely continued the certiorari proceedings before the Court of Appeals; hence, this Court need not await the resolution of G.R. No. 183848 before resolving whether or not Solar Team violated the Compromise Agreement for failing to withdraw its complaint-in-intervention against Team Image. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> However, despite paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Compromise Agreement, Solar Team cannot be deemed to have violated it for failing to cause the dismissal of the criminal cases for estafa Tieng filed against Co. It is settled that criminal liability cannot be the subject of a compromise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> "[A] criminal case is committed against the People, and the offended party may not waive or extinguish the criminal liability that the law imposes for its commission."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> This explains why "a compromise is not one of the grounds prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the extinction of criminal liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></p><p> None of the cases cited by Team Image supports its argument that criminal liability may be subject of a compromise. <i>Chavez v. Presidential Commission on Good Government</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> and <i>Benedicto v. Board of Administrators</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> ironically cited by Team Image, are both clear that compromise is encouraged only in <em>civil </em>cases. <i>Chavez</i> explicitly stated that "[w]hile a compromise in civil suits is expressly authorized by law, there is no similar general sanction as regards criminal liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> </p><p> Team Image confused the Presidential Commission on Good Government's power to grant criminal immunity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> with the act of compromising criminal liability. Granting criminal immunity is allowed because no criminal case has yet been filed in court, and therefore, there is no criminal liability to compromise. On the other hand, compromising criminal liability presupposes that a criminal case has already been filed in court, the dismissal of which is already based on the sound discretion of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> In other words, the dismissal cannot be automatic, regardless of the agreement between the private complainant and the accused to dismiss the case. As discussed, the real offended party in a criminal case is the State and the outcome of the criminal case cannot be based on the will of the private complainant who is a mere witness for the prosecution. </p><p> The cases involved here are cases not under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Chavez and Benedicto, therefore, do not apply. </p><p> All told, the Court of Appeals correctly found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court when it held that Team Image and Solar Team cannot agree on the dismissal of the criminal cases. Solar Team did not violate the Compromise Agreement when Tieng failed to cause the dismissal of the criminal cases for estafa he had filed against Co. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> Furthermore, it was premature for Team Image to claim that it made overpayments to Solar Team when Tieng allegedly admitted to receiving from VTV Corporation the amount of P22,971,572.03, significantly more than the P10,275,547.48 provided in paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the Compromise Agreement provide: </p><blockquote> <p> 3. The parties agree that William Tieng is entitled to initially receive the amount of TWENTY[-]SIX MILLION PESOS (P26,000,000.00), Philippine Currency, as stipulated and embodied in their handwritten memorandum of agreement executed on 05 May 1998, out of the sales and collections made by [Team Image]/Felix S. Co as marketing agent of [Solar Team]. This is so because, [Team Image]/Felix S. Co have admitted having earlier collected at least the sum of at least P26M, hence, to equalize the sharing of Felix S. Co and William Tieng on the proceeds of the sales. William Tieng should also receive the sum of at least P26M.</p> <p> 4. William Tieng acknowledges that VTV had made payments in the total sum of TEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY[-]FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY[-]SEVEN AND 48/100 PESOS (10,275,547[.]48) Philippine Currency, from the contracts with VTV for the airing over IBC-13 of the TV programs/materials belonging to either Solar Entertainment Corporation, or Solar Films, Inc., or Solar Team Entertainment, Inc., out of which, TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY[-]ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY[-]SIX AND 97/100 (P2,891,226.97) was collected and paid to Ma. Fe Barriero as what she represented to be marketing commissions, thus leaving a balance of SEVEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY[-]FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY AND 51/100 (P7,384,320.51). An accounting shall he made by VTV to determine how much of this amount of P7,384,320.51, pertain to programs/materials owned by [Solar Team]. Upon such determination, the amount pertaining to the programs/materials owned by [Solar Team] (which company is owned 50/50 by Felix Co and William Tieng) shall be credited to it and shall be credited to William Tieng as part of the amount he is entitled to receive stated and referred to in paragraph 3 hereof: </p> <p> 5. William Tieng represents and warrants that the aforesaid sum of P2,891,226.97 which is charged as marketing commissions are unauthorized collections which, did not redound to the benefit of the parties from their joint operation as stated in the paragraph immediately preceding, but to the personal gain and advantage of their marketing agent, Maria Fe Barriero, hence, earnest efforts shall be exerted by said William Tieng to collect the same from the offending party. After said collection or in the event that said amount shall be proved to have redounded to the benefit of said William Tieng, then William Tieng shall turn-over the said amount to [Solar Team] and thereafter SGV shall determine the share of Felix S. Co thereon which shall be paid immediately to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Under paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Compromise Agreement, there must first be an audit and accounting by SGV and Co. before there can be a final determination of the share of Team Image from the collectibles from VTV Corporation. There is no showing that SGV and Co. had already completed its audit and accounting when Team Image filed a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution. </p><p> The supposed admission of Tieng in Civil Case No. 05-603 that he received P22,971,572.03 is not a judicial admission contemplated under Rule 129, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Rule 129, Section 4 requires that the admission be made in the same case. The admission of Tieng was made in a different case. Therefore, the admission in Civil Case No. 05-603 cannot be made basis to contend that Tieng misrepresented the amounts he stated in paragraph 4 of the Compromise Agreement. The Court of Appeals correctly held that it was premature for Team Image to claim overpayments.</p><p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><p> Paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement is reiterated below: </p><blockquote> <p> 24. In the event SGV shall have made a final determination of the respective accountability of the parties and any of the parties fail to comply with the same, or in the event any of the parties is remiss or reneges from [its] commitment/s as specified in this Agreement or breaches the warranties and/or representation as contained herein, then the aggrieved party shall be entitled to an immediate issuance of a writ of execution to enforce compliance thereof and the guilty party shall pay the innocent party the sum of P2 Million Pesos by way of liquidated damages and/or penalty and shall, likewise, shoulder all the expenses in enforcing this compromise agreement by a writ of execution. Moreover, the innocent party shall have the right to invoke the principle of reciprocity of obligations in contracts as provided for by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Paragraph 24 of the Compromise Agreement gives two (2) classifications of the possible violations of the Compromise Agreement. The first is "in the event" where the appointed auditing firm, SGV and Co., would have made a final determination of the accountabilities of the parties and any of the parties fails to pay its respective accountabilities based on the audit. The second is ''in the event" where "any of the parties is remiss or reneges from [its] commitment/s as specified in this Agreement or breaches the warranties and/or representation as contained herein." That these are the only two (2) classifications of violations is inferable from the use of the phrase "in the event," a comma, and the word "or" to separate these two (2) instances. In other words, all obligations that require SGV and Co.'s final accounting fall under the first classification. All other obligations fall under the second classification. </p><p> Given the foregoing, the payment of liquidated damages is based on these two (2) "events" or classifications of violation. Since there are only two (2) classifications of violations immediately preceding the provision on the payment of P2,000,000.00 liquidated damages, only a maximum of P4,000,000.00 may be paid under paragraph 24. </p><p> The obligations under the Compromise Agreement that require SGV and Co.'s final determination are found in paragraphs 9, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> 15,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> 16,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> 17,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> 19,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> 22,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> and 24.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Violations of these paragraphs fall under the first "event” or classification. Violations of all other paragraphs fall under the second "event” or classification. </p><p> As previously discussed, Team Image violated paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Compromise Agreement by failing to pay its monetary obligations under these paragraphs. For these violations, Team Image must pay Solar Team P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages. As for Solar Team, it violated paragraph 22 the Compromise Agreement for failure to withdraw the complaint-in-intervention it had earlier filed against Team Image. Hence, Solar Team must pay Team Image P2,000,000.00 in liquidated damages.</p><p align="center"> <b>VI</b> </p><p> Articles 1279 and 1281 of the Civil Code provide: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1279. In order that compensation may be proper, it is necessary: </p> <blockquote> <p> (1) That each one of the obligors be bound principally, and that he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other; </p> <p> (2) That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things due are consumable, they be of the same kind, and also of the same quality if the latter has been stated; </p> <p> (3) That the two debts be due; </p> <p> (4) That they be liquidated and demandable; </p> <p> (5) That over neither of them there be any retention or controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated in due time to the debtor. </p> </blockquote> <p> Article 1281. Compensation may be total or partial. When the two debts are of the same amount, there is a total compensation. </p> </blockquote> <p> Considering that the parties are equally liable to each other in the amount of P2,000,000.00, this Court confirms that the amounts are set off by operation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>VII</b> </p><p> However, this Court recalls that in the May 19, 2008 Omnibus Order, Judge Dumayas directed Solar Team to deposit with Office of the Clerk of Court Regional Trial Court of Makati City the amount of P2,000,000.00 representing liquidated damages for Solar Team's failure to withdraw the complaint-in-intervention it had filed against Team Image. Judge Dumayas added that the amount “will be released only after final determination of the obligations of [Team Image and Co] pursuant to the compromise agreement and after the issue on the violation of the same agreement by [Solar Team] for its failure to [withdraw the complaint-in-intervention] has been resolved with finality.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup></p><p> As held by the Court of Appeals, it was grave abuse of discretion for Judge Dumayas to keep the P2,000,000.00 in <i>custodia legis</i>.

For this reason, adding the highly irregular order of deposit, this matter is referred to the Office of the Court Administrator to be docketed as a separate administrative matter against Judge Dumayas. Judge Dumayas is to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with for: first, in issuing the May 19, 2008 Omnibus Order which directed the deposit of P2,000,000.00 before the Office of the Clerk of Court-Regional Trial Court, Makati City; and, second, for reversing himself, on several occasions, on the issues of whether or not Team Image was entitled to suspend payments to Solar Team and whether or not the criminal cases may be dismissed based on the Compromise Agreement. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petitions for Review on Certiorari filed by Team Image Entertainment, Inc. and Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. are <strong>PARTIALLY GRANTED</strong> and the Court of Appeals December 10, 2009 Decision in CA-G.R.
