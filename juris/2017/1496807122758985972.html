In the Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DT010-148 to 153, the urine specimens taken from accused-appellants yielded "<b>positive</b> results for the presence of Methamphetamine[.]" Obviously, accused-appellants cannot claim that they have no knowledge of the nature of said drug den when they were positively identified by a police officer as present in the premises, and their drug test results indicate that their urine samples contain Methamphetamine, a dangerous drug. Moreover, it is well-established that the defense of denial, in the absence of convincing evidence, is invariably viewed with disfavor by the courts for it can be easily concocted, especially in cases involving the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Similarly, the Regional Trial Court ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>With regard to the charge for Violation of Section 7 of Republic Act No. 9165, to render a verdict of conviction, it is not enough that the integrity and evidentiary value of the specimen were preserved and that the presumption of regularity of performance of duties was upheld. It is primordial for the prosecution to establish the allegation that the accused knowingly visit[ed] a drug den.<br><br>....<br><br>As for accused Medel Coronel y Santillan, Ronalda Permejo y Abarquez, Nestor Villafuerte y Sapin and Joanne Olivarez y Ramos a.k.a. Joanne Olivare, with the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence preserved, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties upheld and their respective drug tests yielding positive results to existence of Methamphetamine, a dangerous drug, the court is convinced that evidence for the prosecution has established the allegations of the information beyond reasonable doubt, thus, sustain a verdict of conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>Likewise, respondent claims that the prosecution has established that petitioners knew that the place was a drug den, based solely on the positive drug test results:<br><blockquote>A drug den is a lair or hideaway where prohibited or regulated drugs are used in any form or are found. Its existence [may be] proved not only by direct evidence but may also be established by proof of facts and circumstances, including evidence of the general reputation of the house, or its general reputation among police officers. The prosecution established that appellants knew that the place is a drug den. All the appellants in the instant case tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride. The drug tests were conducted right after the appellants were arrested. Taken together, these facts prove that appellants knowingly visited a drug den on the day the search warrant was implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent apparently maintains that because the petitioners' drug tests were conducted right after their arrest, it was proven that drugs were used at the drug den itself. Moreover, the use of drugs at a drug den automatically implies that the drug users were aware of the nature of the place as a drug den before visiting it.<br><br>This position is untenable.<br><br>True, the drug test results sufficiently proved that petitioners had used drugs some time before their arrest. However, assuming that petitioners were, in fact, at the alleged drug den before their arrest, there was no showing how long petitioners were at the alleged drug den, or how long the drugs had been in their system. In other words, there is no basis to assume that petitioners used drugs at the moment immediately before arrest, and thus, at the location of the arrest.<br><br>Assuming that persons who test positive for drugs used them at the place of arrest is not sufficient to show that they were aware of the nature of the suspected drug den before visiting it, absent any other circumstantial evidence.<br><br>There was no attempt to show that petitioners knew the nature of the alleged drug den, or even that they used drugs in the premises. The petitioners were not found to be in possession of any drugs. When petitioners were arrested, nobody was found "in the act of using, selling or buying illegal drugs, nor packaging nor hiding nor transporting the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> There were no acts alleged or evidence found, which would tend to show a familiarity with the nature of the place as a drug den.<br><br>The crime of knowingly visiting a drug den under Article II, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 9165 carries with it a minimum penalty of imprisonment of 12 years and one (1) day, and a maximum of20 years. It is not to be taken so lightly that its elements can be presumed to exist without any effort to show them. Given the dearth of evidence in this case, we are constrained to acquit petitioners of this particular charge.<br><br>However, petitioners do not assail the determination that they violated Article II, Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9165, and this conviction must be sustained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
