				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>
  </p>This is an administrative matter which stemmed from an oral report made 	by 	the 	complainant, 	Judge 	Guillermo	P. 	Agloro 	(<em>Judge 	Agloro</em>), Presiding Judge of Branch 83, Regional Trial Court, Malolos City, Bulacan (<em>RTC-Malolos</em>),
 regarding certain irregularities relative to the 	petition 	for 
reconstitution of four (4) transfer certificates of title docketed as 
LRC Case No. P-335-2011 (<em>LRC case</em>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><p><em> The Antecedents </em>
  </p><p> On 	May 	17, 2012, Judge 	Agloro 	formalized	his 	oral 	report 	to 	then Executive Judge Renato C. Francisco (<em>EJ Francisco</em>) of RTC-Malolos. In his Private and Confidential Memo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 to EJ Francisco, he reported that, based on his own investigation, the 
LRC case was raffled off to Branch 77 but for "unknown reason," the 
record of the case appeared in Branch 83; that the petition was heard 
and granted by Branch 83 in its Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 dated November 4, 2011; that he came to know that the registration of 
the entry of judgment for the November 4, 2011 Order was refused by the 
Office of the Clerk of Court (<em>OCC</em>) because the LRC case was 
raffled off to Branch 77, and not to Branch 83; and that he was in a 
predicament because there was a pending motion for execution, yet the 
decision was not yet final and executory.
  </p><p> In response, EJ Francisco issued a memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 to the OCC personnel and to the OIC/Legal Researcher of Branch 77 to 
explain how the LRC case was raffled to Branch 77 and yet appeared in 
Branch 83.
  </p><p> On July 5, 2012, the new Executive Judge, Ma. Theresa V. MendozaÂ­Arcega (<em>EJ Arcega</em>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> wrote a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 addressed to Deputy Court Administrator Raul B. Villanueva, referring 
the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (<span style="font-style: italic;">OCA</span>) after she had 
conducted her own investigation on the personnel of the OCC and Branch 
83 regarding the apparent anomalies surrounding the LRC case. She also 
forwarded the case folder of the LRC case from Branch 77 and the case 
folder from Branch 83, together with the affidavits of the court 
personnel.
  </p><p> In a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
dated September 28, 2012, the OCA acknowledged the letter 	of 	EJ 	
Arcega 	and 	directed	her 	to 	conduct	a 	more 	exhaustive investigation
 and to submit a detailed report.</p><p> <i>The Investigation Report of EJ Arcega</i> </p><p> In compliance, EJ Arcega submitted her Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 dated February 18, 2013, confirming what Judge Agloro had previously 
reported to then EJ Francisco that the LRC case was raffled off to 
Branch 77. EJ Arcega further explained that the case records delivered 
to, and received by, Branch 77 contained the raffle sheet bearing the 
signatures of the eight (8) members of the raffle committee, and the 
summary of legal fees and assessment form from the Office of the 
Provincial Prosecutor of Bulacan. On the other hand, the case records 
found with Branch 83 did not include the summary of legal fees and 
assessment. Furthermore, it bore only three (3) signatures which were 
already declared by EJ Francisco and the other members of the raffle 
committee as forgeries. EJ Arcega also summarized the explanation given 
by every person apparently involved in the irregularities, attending the
 LRC case, as follows:</p><p> <i><b>Judge Rolando J. Bulan</b></i>, 
Presiding Judge, Branch 77, explained that the LRC case was raffled off 
to Branch 77 on June 6, 2011. He, however, noticed that the Transfer 
Certificate of Title (<em>TCT</em>) numbers of the four (4) certificates
 sought to be reconstituted were not indicated in the petition and 
instead, "N/A's" were written in their respective places. Thus, he 
issued an order, dated July 15, 2011, directing petitioner Felicisima B.
 Buendia (<em>Buendia</em>) to show legal basis stating that a TCT 
without the corresponding number could be reconstituted. The LRC case 
was, however, not set for hearing because Buendia failed to comply with 
the aforementioned directive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p><p> <b><i>Atty. Miguel Larida </i></b>(<em>Atty. Larida</em>), 
Buendia's counsel, claimed that sometime in June or July 2011, his 
office received a copy of an order from Branch 83 setting the LRC case 
for initial hearing; that Atty. Renato Dilag appeared for their office 
as counsel for Buendia; that he was confronted by an order issued by 
Branch 77, also assuming jurisdiction over the LRC case, but he did not 
entertain the same because the proceedings before Branch 83 were about 
to be terminated; and that he had neither knowledge nor information as 
to how the LRC case was assigned to Branch 83.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p><p> <b><em>Liwayway S.J. Pagdangan</em></b>, Administrative Officer I; <b>Ronalie B. Reyes,</b> Clerk III; and <b>Cinderella T. Canoza</b>,
 Clerk III, all of the OCC, denied any participation in the anomaly. 
They explained that after the raffle of the LRC case to Branch 77, the 
records thereof were delivered to the said branch by Marita M. Esguerra (<em>Esguerra</em>), the duly authorized utility worker assigned in the LRC Section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 Esguerra corroborated the aforesaid statements 	and 	asserted 	that 	
the 	receipt 	of 	the 	subject 	records 	was acknowledged by <b>Cecilia Baesa</b>, Clerk of Branch 77, as evidenced by her signature in the record book Esguerra was carrying at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  </p><p> <b><i>Juliana M. Raymundo</i></b>, OIC of Branch 77, confirmed
 the receipt of the subject records by their branch. She further 
clarified that the said records remained in their custody because they 
officially received the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> <b><i>Leslie J. Burgos </i></b>(<em>Burgos</em>),
 OIC/Interpreter of Branch 83, averred that sometime in May 2012, she 
was informed by Julieta Fajardo (Fajardo), then Clerk-in-Charge for 
criminal cases of Branch 83, that she came across a raffle sheet which 
indicated that the LRC case was actually raffled to Branch 77, and not 
to their branch. Fajardo, when summoned, orally confirmed the statement 
of Burgos that she confronted respondent Annaliza P. Santiago (<em>Santiago</em>),
 Clerk-in-Charge for civil and land registration cases of Branch 83, 
regarding her discovery, but the latter responded merely by pointing her
 lips at the direction of <b>Marissa Garcia</b> (<em>Garcia</em>), Court Stenographer of Branch 83.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
  </p><p>To personally confirm the information, Burgos checked the 
logbook for land registration cases raffled to their branch and 
discovered that the LRC case was not recorded therein. She further 
stated that previously, a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution
 relating to the LRC case was filed in their branch, but the same was 
denied. Subsequently, however, another motion for execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 was filed, but this time, a photocopy of the cancelled entry of 
judgment was attached thereto. Burgos further claimed that she had 
nothing to do with the attempt to register the entry of judgment on 
February 20, 2012 as the same did not bear her signature. The entry of 
judgment was apparently prepared by Garcia who signed the same for 
Burgos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  </p><p> <b><i>Annaliza P. Santiago</i></b>, Clerk III, OCC, but 
detailed at Branch 83, claimed that sometime in June 2011, she came 
across the records of the LRC case on top of her table; and that, per 
her usual practice, she stamped received the said record, docketed it in
 their docket book, and transmitted it to the person in charge of the 
preparation of the initial hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> For her part, Branch 83 Stenographer<b><i> Marissa M. Garcia</i></b>
 admitted that she prepared the order setting the LRC case for initial 
hearing, and the final order granting the petition. She reasoned, 
however, that she only did the same in her capacity as a senior 
stenographer who merely assisted another stenographer, Marilou de Guzman
 (<em>de Guzman</em>). She also admitted signing the cancelled entry of 
judgment, but only because then OIC Burgos was absent or her whereabouts
 at that time were unknown to them. Burgos, however, denied that she was 
absent on February 20, 2012, as evidenced by her daily time record (<em>DTR</em>)
 for said date. She also alleged in her supplemental affidavit that 
Branch 83 was using an old logbook as record book for newly raffled 
cases, which she earlier checked and found that the LRC case was never 
recorded, but that after the February 20, 2012 incident, the logbook 
turned up neatly covered and the LRC case had already been entered in 
the said logbook.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
  </p><p> On March 5, 2014, the OCA Legal Office recommended that the 
July 5, 2012 Letter and the February 18, 2013 Investigation Report of EJ
 Arcega be considered as a complaint against Burgos, Santiago, Garcia, 
and Fajardo, all of Branch 83, RTC-Malolos, and that the said 
respondents be directed to comment on the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>
 On 	April 	4, 	2014, 	the 	OCA 	directed 	respondents 	Burgos, 	
Fajardo, Santiago, and Garcia to file their respective comments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> <i>The Respondents' Position</i></p><p> In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 dated May 30, 2014, Burgos reiterated the explanation she gave to EJ 
Arcega and the statements contained in her previous affidavits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 She also claimed that in no more that two decades of service, she had 
never been involved in any irregularity and she had served the Judiciary
 and the public faithfully and honestly; and that her track record would
 speak for the reason she was appointed the OIC of their branch. She, 
however, ascribed bad faith and connivance on respondents Santiago and 
Garcia. Burgos alleged that after reporting the anomaly to Judge Agloro,
 she conducted her own investigation on the matter. During the course 
thereof, she learned from one of the administrative officers of the OCC 
that prior to the raffle of the LRC case to Branch 77, <em>Garcia</em> 
went to the OCC carrying a case record/folder apparently containing 
copies of the petition and inquired from the OCC whether it would be 
possible for the same to be raffled to Branch 83. 
  </p><p> Burgos further averred that on February 20, 2012, when the OCC
 refused to receive the entry of judgment, Garcia personally retrieved 
it and caused its cancellation; and that more than a month later on 
March 28, 2012 Garcia, without her 	knowledge, issued and signed a 
certified true copy of the said 	entry 	of 	judgment, 	which 	was 	
thereafter 		used 	by 	Buendia 	as 		an attachment to her motion for 
execution. She also belied Garcia's claim that the latter merely 
assisted the other stenographer, de Guzman, to prepare the initial 	
order 	because de 	Guzman 	 asked 	for 	her 	help. Burgos 	attached 	the
 DTR of de Guzman on June 8, 2011, the date of the initial order, 
showing de Guzman was on leave and she could not have asked for Garcia's
 help.</p><p> Burgos	also 	 dismissed		 Santiago's 	explanations		as 	
mere 		flimsy excuses. Contrary to her claim, what she did was not the 
usual practice in the office.		According 	to 	Burgos, 	in 	receiving 	
case 		 records 	from 	the 	OCC 's Raffle 	Section, the 	standard 	
procedure 	was 		for 		the 	 clerk-in-charge		or 	the receiving 	clerk 	
	to 	 sign 	in 	the 		logbook		carried 	by 	the 	OCC 		personnel 		to 
evidence the actual receipt of the records. After receipt of the 
records, the details of the case folders would be entered in the 
clerk-in-charge's logbook. With the LRC case, however, Santiago never 
bothered to comply with the usual practice. Moreover, Burgos noted that 
it was Santiago who brought the entry of judgment to the OCC.</p><p> Fajardo, in her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 dated May 30, 2014, narrated how she accidentally discovered that the 
LRC case was raffled to Branch 77, while compiling their copies of the 
raffle sheets. She also stated that she told OIC Burgos what she found 
out; that she asked Santiago about the matter; and that she explained to
 EJ Arcega why she did not file any affidavit during the investigation 
because she was trying to avoid conflict with Garcia who is not her 
friend.
  </p><p> In their separate comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 both dated June 25, 2014 Santiago and Garcia merely reiterated their 
allegations in their previous affidavits without rebutting, or offering 
any explanation to, the points raised by Burgos and Fajardo. 
  </p><p> On November 25, 2014, the Manifestation with Notice of Death<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 of respondent Fajardo was filed by her widower, Reynaldo L. Fajardo, 
praying for the dismissal of the case against her on account of her 
death. On June 25, 2015, her widower filed the Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> reiterating the prayer for the dismissal of the case against her.</p><p> <i>The OCA Recommendation</i></p><p> On July 28, 2016, the OCA made the following recommendation:

  </tbody></table>
  <p>The OCA opined that the evidence gathered against Santiago was 
insufficient to establish a link between her and Garcia's scheme because
 her acts were done in accordance with her usual daily routine in the 
office. Nevertheless, the OCA concluded that Santiago was aware of 
Garcia's misconduct but, for whatever reason, she chose to seal her lips
 and conceal the latter's wrongdoing.
  </p><p> As to Garcia, the OCA was convinced that she played an 
indispensable role in ensuring the success of the nefarious scheme. It 
observed that before the actual raffle, Garcia inquired with the OCC 
whether it was possible for the LRC petition to be raffled to Branch 83;
 that she participated in the subject case, having prepared practically 
all the orders in the said case; that she railroaded the disposition of 
the LRC case by issuing an entry of judgment therefor and, thus, 
usurping the function of Burgos as OIC of Branch 83; and that she 
personally retrieved the entry of judgment and had it cancelled, when 
the OCC refused to register the same.</p><p> The Court concurs with the findings and recommendation of the OCA subject to certain modifications.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b>
  </p><p> The Court agrees that there is a dearth of evidence to hold 
Burgos administratively liable. Indeed, no participation, whatsoever, 
relating to the subject scheme could be attributed to her. On the 
contrary, Burgos participated, not in the realization, but in the 
investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the devious 
scheme. The records would also show that Burgos came to know of the 
misdeed only after Fajardo had reported the same to her. Thus, the Court
 concurs with the conclusion of the OCA that Burgos could not be made 
administratively liable as she could not have prevented the devious 
scheme by any amount of diligence.</p><p> As regards Fajardo, 
jurisprudence is settled that the death of a respondent does not 
preclude a finding of administrative liability, subject to certain 
exception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the case of <em>Gonzales v. Escalona</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (<em>Gonzales</em>), the Court wrote:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> While his death intervened after the completion of the 
investigation, it has been settled that the Court is not ousted of its 
jurisdiction over an administrative matter by the mere fact that the 
respondent public official ceases to hold office during the pendency of 
the respondent's case; jurisdiction once acquired, continues to exist 
until the final resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The above rule, however, admits of exceptions. In <em>Gonzales,</em> citing the case of <em>Limliman vs. Judge Ulat-Marrero</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 the Court held that the death of the respondent necessitated the 
dismissal of the administrative case upon a consideration of any of the 
following factors:<em> first</em>, if the respondent's right to due process was not observed; <em>second</em>, the presence of exceptional circumstances in the case on the grounds of equitable and humanitarian reasons; and <em>third</em>, the kind of penalty imposed.
  </p><p> In the case against Fajardo, none of the aforesaid exceptions 
exists. As borne by the records, Fajardo's right to due process was not 
violated as she was given the opportunity to answer the charges against 
her. In fact, Fajardo was able to file her comment before the OCA. 
Neither could equitable or humanitarian reasons be sufficient ground for
 the dismissal of the present case. Respondent's demise, alone, could 
not be considered sufficient ground to justify the dismissal of the 
administrative case on the ground of equitable or humanitarian reason. 
Thus, the case against Fajardo could not be dismissed merely on account 
of her death. </p><p> Nevertheless, the Court is convinced that the case
 against Fajardo must be dismissed for want of evidence against her. 
Just like in the case of Burgos, there was lack of evidence to show that
 Fajardo was involved in this anomaly. In fact, it was her actions which
 led to the discovery of the irregularity. If not for her discovery, 
this Court would not have the opportunity to mete the appropriate 
penalties for the persons responsible for this reprehensible scheme. The
 administrative charge against Fajardo must perforce be dismissed.</p><p>
 The 	Court 	likewise 	concurs 	with 	the 	recommendation	of 	the 	OCA 
with respect to Garcia, but modifies its findings in the case of 
Santiago. The Court is convinced that Santiago is also administratively 
liable for grave misconduct, serious dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial
 to the best interest of the service. </p><p> Dishonesty is defined as a
 disposition to lie, cheat, deceive or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack 
of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack 
of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or 
betray.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Misconduct,
 on the other hand, is a transgression of some established and definite 
rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence
 by the public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> 
The misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of
 corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard 
established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>
 Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service refers to acts 
or omissions that violate the norm of public accountability and diminish
 - or tend to diminish - the people's faith in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Understandably, dishonesty and grave misconduct constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p>
 In this case, the record is replete with evidence pointing not only to 
Garcia but also to Santiago as the persons responsible for the subject 
misdeed. </p><p> First, with respect to Garcia, testimonial and 
documentary evidence reveals her unwarranted interest in the LRC case. 
Garcia performed numerous acts which led to no other conclusion than 
that she was instrumental and complicit in making sure that the petition
 would be granted. Garcia first approached the OCC and tried to persuade
 them to have the LRC case assigned to Branch 83. Her request was denied
 as there was a process of raffling off the cases. This, however, did 
not stop Garcia from pursuing her objective. When the LRC case 
mysteriously appeared in Branch 83, it was Garcia who practically 
prepared all the orders relating to the said case. More importantly, it 
was Garcia who prepared the draft of the November 4, 2011 Order which 
granted the petition.</p><p> Moreover, apart from preparing the draft of
 the subject order, Garcia surreptitiously issued an entry of judgment 
for the same on February 20, 2012. Garcia claimed that she only issued 
the subject entry of judgment to prevent the disruption of service 
because Burgos was absent on that day. It must be noted that it was the 
function of Burgos, as OIC, to prepare and sign the entry of judgment. 
Regrettably for Garcia, Burgos was able to successfully rebut her claim 
by attaching her DTR for February 20, 2012 to prove that she was present
 on the said date. </p><p> Likewise, aside from failing to inform Burgos
 of the said entry of judgment, Garcia notified neither the latter nor 
Judge Agloro of the OCC's refusal to receive the entry of judgment. </p><p>
 Finally, as to Santiago, the Court disagrees with the OCA that her acts
 were done in accordance with her usual daily routine. Contrary to the 
OCA findings, Santiago's acts, relating to the present anomaly, could 
not be considered as constituting simple neglect of duty because they 
were not committed due to carelessness and indifference, but as a result
 of a willful violation of the established rules. In fact, her 
participation was an essential part of the scheme, without which, no 
semblance of legitimacy could have attached to the proceedings before 
Branch 83 regarding the LRC case. </p><p> As stated by Burgos, the 
standard procedure in the trial court was for the clerk-in-charge to 
receive the case records raffled to their branch from the OCC personnel 
and to sign in the logbook carried by the latter to evidence receipt of 
the records. A similar procedure was explained by the OCC staff when 
they attested that the record of the LRC case was delivered to and 
received by Branch 77. </p><p> Santiago could not claim simple 
negligence for failing to comply with the said procedure. It must be 
recalled that Fajardo confronted Santiago regarding the irregularity but
 the latter responded by pointing to Garcia with her lips. Santiago 
never denied this assertion. Her response to Fajardo's inquiry only 
shows that she was aware of the misdeed. </p><p> Furthermore, Santiago 
also failed to inform Burgos and Judge Agloro of the OCC 's refusal to 
register the entry of judgment for the order in the LRC case. As borne 
by the OCC records, it was Santiago who brought the said entry of 
judgment to the OCC. It was also Santiago who was asked by the OCC 
personnel why she furnished the OCC an entry of judgment for the order 
in the LRC case when it was officially raffled off to Branch 77. The 
incident was witnessed by Fajardo and was never refuted by Santiago. </p><p> In sum, the totality of the evidence shows that <strong>Garcia and Santiago connived</strong>
 to guarantee that the LRC petition would be acted on favorably. 
Clearly, they were united in their efforts to ensure the realization of 
their scheme	without being found out. Despite the positive evidence and 
allegations hurled against them, Garcia and Santiago chose to simply 
deny their complicity without addressing the actions attributed to them.
 	Verily, their responsibility and culpability with regard to the 
misdeed were established by substantial evidence. Their respective 
participation in this misdeed and their continuous feigning of
