Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> it ruled upon was presented to it; <i>we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct</i>.

If grave abuse of discretion exists, then the CA must grant the petition and nullify the NLRC ruling, entering at the same time the ruling that is justified under the evidence and the governing law, rules and jurisprudence.

As with international calls, there is a pattern on decline: PLDT earned P10.6 billion from this service in 2000, so it is accurate to say that the company has seen revenue from national long distance decline by more than a billion pesos a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The National Labor Relations Commission has found that Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company was able to discharge its burden of proving that its redundancy measures had substantial basis:<br><blockquote>Guided by the foregoing jurisprudence, it is evident that PLDT discharged the burden of proving that the declaration or implementation of redundancy measures have basis. For one, PLDT experienced a decline of subscribers, long distance calls, operated both local and abroad, has declined, landline or fixed line services also declined. This decrease of the need of PLDT services resulted from the advent of wireless telephone, of texting as means of communication, the use of direct dialing including prepaid telesulit and teletipid measures introduced in the communication services. For another, PLDT has a debt burden of P70 billion pesos and it cannot subsidize the salaries of employees whose positions are redundant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals echoed the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission regarding the validity of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company's redundancy measures:<br><blockquote>We find that MKP demonstrated no such patent and gross evasion of a positive duty on the part of the NLRC. On the contrary, the NLRC's finding that the 2002 redundancy declaration of PLDT was justified and valid rested on substantial evidence, for the NLRC ostensibly based its finding on established facts showing the decline of subscribers, the decline in long distance local and international calls, and the decline in landline or fixed line services, constraining PLDT to declare certain positions redundant. There could be no question that such factual circumstances were traceable to "the advent of wireless telephone, of texting as a means of communication, the use of direct dialing including prepaid <i>telesulit</i> and <i>teletipid</i> measures introduced in the communication services."<br><br>As such, the NLRC did not commit any grave abuse of discretion when it regarded the technological advancements resulting in less work for the redundated employees as justifying PLOT's declaration of redundancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court sees no reason to depart from the findings of the Court of Appeals and of the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br>Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company's declaration of redundancy was backed by substantial evidence showing a consistent decline for operator-assisted calls for both local and international calls because of cheaper alternatives like direct dialing services, and the growth of wireless communication. Thus, the National Labor Relations Commission did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it upheld the validity of PLDT's redundancy program. Redundancy is ultimately a management prerogative, and the wisdom or soundness of such business judgment is not subject to discretionary review by labor tribunals or even this Court, as long as the law was followed and malicious or arbitrary action was not shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Nonetheless, there is a need to review the redundancy package awarded to the employees terminated due to redundancy. For either redundancy or retrenchment, the law requires that the employer give separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month pay of the affected employee, or at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. The employer must also serve a written notice on both the employees and the Department of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the effective date of termination due to redundancy or retrenchment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>While we agree that Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company complied with the notice requirement, the same cannot be said as regards the separation pay received by some of the affected workers.<br><br>Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company claims that most employees who were declared redundant received a very generous separation package or "as much as 2.75 months [worth of salary] for every year of service, with the average separation package at [P]586,580.27."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> However, the records belie its claims as shown by the notice of termination of employment received by the workers affected by the redundancy program:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">November 25, 2002<br></div><br><b>MYRNA C.

We have held that it is a statutory right designed to provide the employee with the wherewithal during the period that he is looking for another employment.<br><br>Retirement benefits, where not mandated by law, may be granted by agreement of the employees and their employer or as a voluntary act on the part of the employer.
