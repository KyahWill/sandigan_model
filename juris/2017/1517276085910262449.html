Commission on Audit</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In contrast, COA insists that the mid-year and year-end financial assistance and the <i>bigay-pala</i> anniversary bonus initially granted in 1987 were not among the benefits authorized under Item 5 of Letter of Implementation (LOI) No. 97 dated August 31, 1979;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> that said benefits had been granted pursuant to board resolutions without the imprimatur of the Office of the President (OP) as required by Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 985;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that the act of the Board of Trustees of the MWSS in increasing the amount of medical allowance without the authority from the OP was an <i><i>ultra vires</i></i> act; and that the productivity incentive benefit equivalent to one-month pay in 1999 was grossly in excess of the prescribed P2,000.00 cap in violation of A.O.

No. 220729 were liable to refund the disallowed amount.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>After a careful evaluation of the facts and pertinent laws, the Court finds and declares that COA Proper did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the NDs against the MWSS; but the Court holds that the petitioners in G.R. No. 220729 should not be held liable to refund the disallowed benefits and allowances.<br><br><center><b>1.<br>Propriety of applying COA Resolution No. 2011-006, amending the 2009 COA Revised Rules of Procedures</b><br></center><br>We shall deal first with the procedural question on which rule of procedure was applicable.<br><br>In issuing COE 2015-174, COA applied COA's Resolution No. 2011-006, and held that notwithstanding the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 64 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, its decisions should forthwith commence and would not be stayed unless the Court itself directed otherwise. To recall, the original rule (Section 9, Rule X of the 2009 COA Rules of Procedure) deemed the finality and execution of the decision stayed by the filing of the motion for reconsideration or of the recourse in this Court.<br><br>We note that the petition in G.R. No. 195105 was filed on February 1, 2011 and COE 2015-174 was issued on September 7, 2015; and Resolution No. 2011-006 was approved on August 17, 2011 and took effect 15 days after its publication in two newspapers of general circulation. It is evident that if the old rule on the finality of judgment were to be applied, the petitioners would have no reason to apply for the temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to prevent COA from deeming the assailed decisions executory and issuing COE 2015-174, considering that their salaries and other benefits were not in any danger of being withheld pending the final resolution of their petitions by the Court. Instead, COA retroactively applied Resolution No. 2011-006.<br><br>We rule that such application by COA constituted grave abuse of discretion under the circumstances obtaining herein.<br><br>The general rule that a rule of procedure can be given retroactive effect admits of exceptions, such as where the rule itself expressly or by necessary implication provides that pending actions are excepted from its operation, or where to apply it to pending proceedings would impair vested rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the situation before us, there were already four years and seven months from the filing of the petition in G.R. No. 195105, which resulted in the stay of execution of Decision No. 2009-072 dated September 1, 2009 and Decision No. 2010-145 dated December 30, 2010. To allow the retroactive application of Resolution No. 2011-006 would really create a great injustice to the petitioners who were governed by the previous rule at the time of the filing of the petition of the MWSS to assail the decisions. Such retroactive application would deprive them of their salaries and compensation, and would not be fair to them, to say the least.<br><br><center><b>2.<br>R.A. No. 6758 repealed the pertinent provisions of the MWSS's corporate charter</b><br></center><br>Section 16 of R.A. No. 6758 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 16. Repeal of Special Salary Laws and Regulations.</b> - All laws, decrees, executive orders, <b>corporate charters</b>, and other issuances <b>or parts thereof</b>, that exempt agencies from the coverage of the System, or <b>that authorize and fix</b> position classification, <b>salaries, pay rates or allowances</b> of specified positions, or groups of officials and employees or of agencies, which are inconsistent with the System, including the proviso under Section 2, and Section 16 of Presidential Decree No. 985 are hereby repealed. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 6758, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) were included in the Compensation and Position Classification System under the law. As the aforequoted provision indicates, R.A. No. 6758 has repealed all corporate charters of the GOCCs, and such repeal has been put to rest by this Court. In the 1999 ruling in <i>Philippine International Trading Corporation v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court opined:<br><blockquote>xxx [T]he repeal by Section 16 of RA 6758 of "all corporate charters that exempt agencies from the coverage of the System" was clear and expressed necessarily to achieve the purposes for which the law was enacted, that is, the standardization of salaries of all employees in government owned and/or controlled corporations to achieve "equal pay for substantially equal work." Henceforth, PITC should now be considered as covered by laws prescribing a compensation and position classification system in the government including RA 6758. This is without prejudice, however, as discussed above, to the non-diminution of pay of incumbents as of July 1, 1989 as provided in Sections 12 and 17 of said law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>As things now stand, the governing boards of the GOCCs no longer wield the power to fix compensation and allowances of their personnel, including the authority to increase the rates, pursuant to their specific charters.<br><br>COA rightly submits that the grant by the Board of Trustees of the MWSS of the benefits constituted an <i>ultra vires</i> act. Verily, what is <i>ultra vires</i> or beyond the power of the MWSS to do must also be <i>ultra vires</i> or beyond the power of its Board of Trustees to undertake. The powers of the Board of Trustees, who under the law were authorized to exercise the corporate powers, were necessarily limited by restrictions imposed by law on the MWSS itself, considering that Board of Trustees only acted in behalf of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Upon the effective repeal of the MWSS Charter, the Board of Trustees could no longer fix salaries, pay rates or allowances of its officials and employees upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 6758.<br><br><center><b>3.<br>Consolidation of allowances and compensation of government employees</b><br></center><br>Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 12. <i>Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation</i>.</b> - All allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed. Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.<br><br>Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government.<br></blockquote>This provision consolidated or integrated allowances in the standardized salary in the Philippine position classification and compensation system, which previous laws on standardization of compensation of government officials and employees did not do. Presidential Decree No. 985, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1597,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the law antecedent to Republic Act No. 6758, repealed all laws, decrees, executive orders, and other issuances or parts thereof that authorized the grant of allowances in favor of officials and employees occupying certain positions. Under Presidential Decree No. 985, allowances, honoraria, and other fringe benefits could only be granted to government employees upon approval of the President with the recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>It is the distinct policy of Section 12, supra, to standardize salary rates among government personnel and to do away with multiple allowances and other incentive packages as well as the resulting differences in compensation among them. Thus, the general rule now is that all allowances are deemed included in the standardized salary, unless excluded by law or by an issuance by DBM. The integration of the benefits and allowances is by legal fiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Without the issuance by DBM, the enumerated non-integrated allowances in Section 12 remain exclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The following non-integrated allowances under Section 12 are the only allowances that government personnel may continue to receive in addition to their standardized salary rates, unless DBM shall add other items thereto, namely:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Representation and transportation allowances (RATA);<br><br></li><li>Clothing and laundry allowances;<br><br></li><li>Subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels;<br><br></li><li>Subsistence allowance of hospital personnel;<br><br></li><li>Hazard pay;<br><br></li><li>Allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and<br><br></li><li>Such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On February 15, 1999, DBM issued the Corporate Compensation Circular (DBM-CCC) No. 10 to initiate the rules and regulations implementing R.A. No. 6758 for the GOCCs and government financial institutions (GFIs). DBM-CCC No. 10 listed other non-integrated allowances allowed <i>only</i> to incumbents of positions authorized and actually receiving such allowances/benefits as of June 30, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Paragraph 5.4-5.6 of DBM-CCC No. 10 further provided:<br><blockquote>5.4.

The following allowances/fringe benefits authorized to GOCCs/GFIs pursuant to the aforementioned issuances <b>are not likewise to be integrated into the basic salary and allowed to be continued only for incumbents of positions as of June 30, 1989 who are authorized and actually receiving said allowances/benefits as of said date</b> xxx:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>5.5.4.

Payment made for <b>such unauthorized allowances/fringe benefits shall be considered as illegal disbursement of public funds</b>. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the disallowed benefits and allowances of MWSS's officials and employees, with the exception of the RATA and the medical allowance, were not excluded by R.A. No. 6758 or any issuance by DBM. It is understood that as a general rule such benefits and allowances were already included and given to the officials and employees when they received their basic salaries. Their receipt of the disallowed benefits and allowances was tantamount to double compensation. It is thus incumbent upon the MWSS to prove that the disallowed allowances were sanctioned by the Office of the President or DBM, as the laws required.<br><br>The MWSS relies primarily on Exhibit F of the Concession Agreement captioned "Existing MWSS Fringe Benefits" to support the Board of Trustees' grant of the questioned allowances. It must be noted, however, that it was not the 1997 Concession Agreement that authorized the release or grant of the allowances, as borne by the records, but the resolutions of the Board of Trustees, which were done contrary to the express mandate of R.A. No. 6758. We cannot subscribe to the MWSS's argument that the allowances already bore the imprimatur of the Office of the President through Secretary Vigilar of the DPWH on the basis of the latter's signing of the Concession Agreement because such part of the agreement contravened R.A. No. 6758; hence, the same was invalid. Under Section 16.13 of the Concession Agreement, any invalid or unenforceable portion or provision should be deemed severed from the agreement. Accordingly, Exhibit F of the Concession Agreement, being contrary to R.A. No. 6758, could not be made a source of any right or authority to release the precluded allowances. Moreover, the law is clear that it should be DBM, not the DPWH, that must determine the other additional compensation not specified under the law.<br><br>Although it was the clear policy intent of R.A. No. 6758 to standardize salary rates among government personnel, Congress nonetheless saw, as made clear in Section 12 and Section 17 of the law, the need for equity and justice in adopting the policy of non-diminution of pay when it authorized incumbents as of July 1, 1989 to receive salaries and/or allowances over and above those authorized by R.A. No. 6758. In this regard, we held in <i>Aquino v. Philippine Ports Authority</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that no financial or non-financial incentive could be awarded to employees of the GOCCs aside from benefits being received by incumbent officials and employees as of July 1, 1989. This Court then observed:<br><blockquote>The consequential outcome, under sections 12 and 17, is that if the incumbent resigns or is promoted to a higher position, his successor is no longer entitled to his predecessors RATA privilege or to the transition allowance. After 1 July 1989 the additional financial incentives such as RATA may no longer be given by GOCCs with the exemption of those which were authorized to be continued under Section 12 of RA 6758.<br></blockquote>In <i>Philippine International Trading Corporation v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we also held that incumbents as of July 1, 1989 should continue to receive the allowance mentioned in Section 12 even after R.A. No. 6758 took effect, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>First of all, we must mention that this Court has confirmed in <i>Philippine Ports Authority vs. Commission on Audit</i> the legislative intent to protect incumbents who are receiving salaries and/or allowances over and above those authorized by RA 6758 to continue to receive the same even after RA 6758 took effect. In reserving the benefit to incumbents, the legislature has manifested its intent to gradually phase out this privilege without upsetting the policy of non-diminution of pay and consistent with the rule that laws should only be applied prospectively in the spirit of fairness and justice. xxx<br></blockquote>Clearly, the Court has been very consistent in construing the second sentence in the first paragraph of Section 12, supra, as prescribing July 1, 1989 as the qualifying date to determine whether or not an employee was an <i>incumbent</i> and <i>receiving</i> the non-integrated remuneration or benefit <i>for purposes of entitling the employee to its continued grant</i>. Stated differently, those allowances or fringe benefits (whether RATA or other benefits) that have not been integrated into the standardized salary are allowed to be continued only for incumbents of positions as of July 1, 1989 and who were actually receiving said allowances or fringe benefits as of said date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>It is basic enough that the erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not estop the Government from subsequently making a correction of the errors. Practice, without more, no matter how long continued, cannot give rise to any vested right if it is contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Accordingly, COA correctly held that only the following benefits could be granted to its officers and employees incumbent as of July 1, 1989: the medical allowance as authorized under LOI No. 97, the RATA equivalent to 40% of the basic salary, and the productivity incentive benefits to the extent of the P2,000.00 cap mandated by law.<br><br>In this respect, inasmuch as the MWSS did not substantiate the entitlement of its officers and employees to the mid-year and year-end financial assistance as well as the <i>bigay-pala</i> anniversary bonus, said benefits must be disallowed in full without any need to distinguish between employees hired before or after July 1, 1989.<br><br><center><b>4.<br>COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing the NDs</b><br></center><br>In the discharge of its constitutional mandate, COA is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. It has the power to ascertain whether public funds were utilized for the purpose for which they had been intended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The 1987 Constitution has expressly made COA the guardian of public funds, vesting it with broad powers over all accounts pertaining to government revenue and expenditures and the uses of public funds and property, including the exclusive authority to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods for such review, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of COA in issuing the assailed Decisions.<br><br>By <i>grave abuse of discretion</i> is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The burden is on the part of petitioner to prove not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent issuing the impugned order. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of COA in issuing the assailed Decisions. On the contrary, COA only thereby steadfastly complied with its duty under the 1987 Constitution to exercise its general audit power.<br><br><center><b>5.<br>Liability of the approving officials and obligation to return the disallowed benefits</b><br></center><br>Section 16 of the 2009 COA Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 16. Determination of Persons Responsible/Liable.</b><br><br>Section 16.1 The liability of public officers and other persons for audit disallowances/charges shall be determined on the basis of (a) the nature of the disallowance/charge; (b) the duties and responsibilities or obligations of officers/employees concerned; (c) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/charged transaction; and (d) the amount of damage or loss to the government, thus:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>16.1.3 Public officers who approve or authorize expenditures shall be held liable for losses arising out of their negligence or failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the solidary liability is in accordance with Book VI, Chapter V, Section 43 of the <i>Administrative Code</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>Liability for Illegal Expenditures</i>. - Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the general and special provisions contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be void. Every payment made in violation of said provisions shall be illegal and every official or employee authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein, and every person receiving such payment shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the full amount so paid or received.<br></blockquote>In <i>Blaquera v. Alcala</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court did not require the officials and employees of the different government departments and agencies to refund the productivity incentive bonus they had received because of the absence of bad faith, and because the disbursement was made in the honest belief that the recipients deserved the amounts. The <i>Blaquera</i> ruling was modified in <i>Casal v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> where the Court ruled that the approving officials were liable to refund the incentive award due to their patent disregard of the issuances of the President and the directives of COA. The officials' failure to observe the issuances amounted to gross negligence, which was inconsistent with the presumption of good faith. Applying both the <i>Blaquera</i> and the <i>Casal</i> rulings, we declared in <i>Velasco v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>Similarly in the present case, the blatant failure of the petitioners­ approving officers to abide with the provisions of AO 103 and AO 161 overcame the presumption of good faith. The deliberate disregard of these issuances is equivalent to gross negligence amounting to bad faith. Therefore, the petitioners-approving officers are accountable for the refund of the subject incentives which they received.<br><br>However, with regard to the employees who had no participation in the approval of the subject incentives, they were neither in bad faith nor were they grossly negligent for having received the benefits under the circumstances. The approving officers' allowance of the said awards certainly tended to give it a color of legality from the perspective of these employees. Being in good faith, they are therefore under no obligation to refund the subject benefits which they received.<br></blockquote>Based on the evolving jurisprudence, and in view of Section 16 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts, the approving officers of the MWSS were personally liable for the amount of disallowed benefits. Despite the lack of authority for granting the benefits, they still approved the grant and release of the benefits in excess of the allowable amounts and extended the same benefits to its officials and employees not entitled thereto, patently contravening the letter and spirit of R.A. No. 6758 and related laws. They were very adamant in their stance that R.A. No. 6758 did not apply to them despite its clear provisions and the relevant issuances of DBM, thereby deliberately disregarding the basic principle of statutory construction that when the law was clear, there should be no room for interpretation but only application. Moreover, as we have earlier pointed out, institutional practice is not an excuse to allow disbursements that were otherwise contrary to law.<br><br><center><b>6.<br>Who are the MWSS approving officials liable to return the disallowed benefits?</b><br></center><br>The petitioners in G.R. No. 220729 contend that they should not be held liable to return the disallowed amounts. Although they held certain management positions in the MWSS, they neither possessed nor had custody of the government funds as to allow them to grant the release of certain allowances and benefits. Their respective positions at the time the disallowed benefits were initially approved are as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>PETITIONER</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>POSITION</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Loida G.

Failure to comply with said rules constitutes gross negligence.<br><br>xxxx<br></blockquote>The petitioners in G.R. No. 220727 counter that the Board of Trustees that had authorized and approved the grant of the benefits should be held liable for the amounts and not them.<br><br>We rule in favor of the petitioners in G.R. No. 220727. Although they were officers of the MWSS, they had nothing to do with policy-making or decision-making for the MWSS, and were merely involved in its day-to-day operations. In particular, petitioners Ceguerra, Cleofas, Naz, and Uy were department/division managers who had only certified that their subordinates whose names appeared in the payrolls had rendered actual service. Petitioner Toledo, being the one who had prepared the payroll forms, only certified that the payees had not been on AWOL on the dates specified. Lastly, petitioner Fulgueras, then the Chief Corporate Accountant, only checked the entries in the journal as against the payrolls and disbursement vouchers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The COA has not proved or shown that the petitioners, among others, were the approving officers contemplated by law to be personally liable to refund the illegal disbursements in the MWSS. While it is true that there was no distinct and specific definition as to who were the particular approving officers as well as the respective extent of their participation in the process of determining their liabilities for the refund of the disallowed amounts, we can conclude from the fiscal operation and administration of the MWSS how the process went when it granted and paid out benefits to its personnel.<br><br>The Board of Trustees, in whom all the corporate powers and functions of the MWSS were vested, governed the agency. In turn, the Management of the MWSS was at the center of decision-making for the day-­to-day affairs of the MWSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Nonetheless, it was the Board of Trustees, through board resolution, that issued the authority granting the benefits and allowances to the employees. The Management, acting by virtue of and pursuant to the resolution, implemented the same. In this connection, it is notable that the resolution approving the release of the mid-year financial assistance for CY 2000 facially indicated that the authority had emanated from the Board of Trustees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, the petitioners in G.R. No. 220727, albeit officials of the MWSS, were not members of the Board of Trustees and, as such, could not be held personally liable for the disallowed benefits by virtue of their having had no part in the approval of the disallowed benefits. In turn, the recipients of the benefits - officials and employees alike - were not liable to refund the amounts received for having acted in good faith due to their honest belief that the grant of the benefits had legal basis.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court:<br><br>1. <b>DISMISSES</b> the petition in G.R.
