On separate dates, they went to meet with Racho either at her residence in Vigan, Ilocos Sur or her office in Makati City where they were briefed about the available position for them and the corresponding compensation. They were then asked to provide documents, fill out bio-data forms, and pay placement fees, which they did. They then left the Philippines on different dates and stayed in East Timor while waiting for their working visas. However, two to three months passed and yet no working visas were issued despite Radio's promises. Thus, they went back to the Philippines, and after failing to find Racho, filed their complaints before the Presidential Anti-Illegal Recruitment Task Force Hunter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the course of the proceedings, Racho moved that some cases be provisionally dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> due to the failure of the other complainants to give their testimonies despite due notice. In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 17, 2012, the RTC provisionally dismissed nine (9) Estafa cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> leaving the following cases to proceed: (<i>a</i>) the Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale case, <i>i.e.</i>, Crim. Case No. 05-1935; (<i>b</i>) the above-stated six Estafa cases - Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938, 05-1941, 05-1945, 05-1948, 05-1949, and 05-1951; and (<i>c</i>) an additional Estafa case, namely <b>Criminal Case No. 05-1943</b> filed by complainant Dominador S. Pena (Dominador), who, same as William, failed to give his testimony.<br><br>As to the cases which proceeded, the defense countered with the sole testimony of Racho, who denied the charges against her and argued that she was an auditor of PET Plans, Inc. from March 23, 2000 to August 31, 2005, making it highly unlikely for her to have engaged in the business of recruitment and promised employment abroad. She also belied the claim that she received the amounts allegedly paid by the complainants and insisted that the latter only found out about the employment abroad from another person over the radio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated May 28, 2014, the RTC found Racho guilty beyond reasonable doubt of: (<i>a</i>) Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale in Criminal Case No. 05-1935, and accordingly, sentenced her to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) six (6) counts of Estafa in Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938, 05-1941, 05-1945, 05-1948, 05-1951, <b>including Criminal Case No. 05-1949</b>, and accordingly, sentenced her to suffer imprisonment for indeterminate periods<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and to pay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> complainants the amounts they paid as placement fees plus twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the information until finality of its judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>At the outset, the RTC dismissed Criminal Case No. 05-1943 involving Dominador for failure of the prosecution to present any evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in the Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale case, the RTC was convinced that Racho offered and promised employments in East Timor to complainants despite not having any license to recruit them. It found that Racho indeed required the complainants to submit their bio-data, birth certificates, and passports, as well as pay placement fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As to the six (6) Estafa cases, the RTC held that the prosecution has proven Racho's misrepresentation that she could provide jobs to complainants in East Timor despite lack of authority from the POEA and that she demanded payment of placement fees. It added that Radio's deceit was underscored by the fact that complainants were stranded in East Timor without any jobs and upon their return to the country, could not find her to recover their payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Racho appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated October 15, 2015, the CA affirmed Racho's convictions <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It held that Racho's representation that she had the authority to deploy workers in East Timor for employment despite the absence of the required license or authority from the POEA, as well as her demand for payment of placement fees from the complainant, proved her guilt in the Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and six (6) Estafa cases;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> hence, the instant appeal involving these cases.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Racho is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and of Estafa.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Settled is the rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those raised as errors by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In this light, the Court affirms Racho's convictions in Criminal Case No. 05-1935 for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, as well as the Estafa cases docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938, 05-1941, 05-1945, 05-1948, and 05-1951, but acquits her in Crim. Case No. 05-1949, <i>i.e.</i>, the Estafa case filed by William, for lack of evidence. Moreover, the Court reduces the damages awarded to Rodolfo, the complainant in Criminal Case No. 05-1951, from P60,000.00 to P35,000.00 to conform with the amount proven in court. Finally, the Court adjusts the penalties imposed on Racho as regards the Estafa cases in view of the recent amendment under RA 10951,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as well as the interest rate pursuant to law.<br><br><center><b>I.</b><br></center><br>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale is defined under Section 6 of RA 8042, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 6. Definition. - For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean <u>any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contact services-promising or advertising for employment abroad</u>, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a <u>non-licensee or non-holder of authority</u> contemplated under Article 13 (f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: <i>Provided</i>, That any such non-licensee or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. It shall likewise include the following acts, whether committed by any person, whether a non-licensee, non-holder, licensee or holder of authority:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed <u><b>committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group</b></u>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The elements of the offense are: (<i>a</i>) the offender has no valid license or authority to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; (<i>b</i>) he undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code (now Section 6 of RA 8042); and (<i>c</i>) he commits the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the RTC and the CA found that all these elements are present. The POEA certification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as confirmed by Bella Diaz, sufficiently established that Racho is neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers for overseas employment. Clearly, a person or entity engaged in recruitment and placement activities without the requisite authority is engaged in illegal recruitment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The definition of "recruitment and placement" under Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code includes <b>promising or advertising for employment</b>, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not, provided, that any person or entity which, in any manner, <b>offers or promises for a fee</b>, employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement. Thus, Racho's act of offering and promising to deploy the complainants to East Timor for work and collecting placement fees from more than three (3) persons, despite not being authorized to do so, renders her liable for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale. In this relation, her defense of denial cannot overcome complainants' categorical and positive testimonies against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Therefore, the Court finds no cogent reason to deviate from the lower courts' findings on this score. Racho is therefore sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and penalized with a fine of P1,000,000.00.<br><br>As to the penalty, although Section 7 of RA 8042 has been amended by Section 6 of RA 10022<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which, accordingly, increased the penalty for the crime, the old law, <i>i.e.</i>, RA 8042 - which is more advantageous to the accused - still applies considering that the crime was committed from 2004 to 2005 when the old law was still in effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, the courts <i>a quo</i> correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and fine of P1,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>Racho's conviction for Estafa in Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938, 05-1941, 05-1945, 05-1948, and 05-1951 is likewise warranted. Article 315 of the RPC states:<br><blockquote>Article 315. <i>Swindling (estafa)</i>. - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned herein below x x x:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Under this provision, Estafa by means of deceit is committed when these elements concur: (<i>a</i>) the accused used fictitious name or false pretense that he possesses power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or other similar deceits; (<i>b</i>) he used such deceitful means prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud; (<i>c</i>) the offended party relied on such deceitful means to part with his money or property; and (<i>d</i>) the offended party suffered damage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Case law holds that the same pieces of evidence that establish liability for illegal recruitment in large scale confirm culpability for Estafa. In <i>People v. Chua</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><blockquote>[W]e agree with the appellate court that the same pieces of evidence which establish appellant's liability for illegal recruitment in large scale likewise confirm her culpability for <i>estafa</i>.<br><br>It is well-established in jurisprudence that a person may be charged and convicted for both illegal recruitment and <i>estafa</i>. The reason therefor is not hard to discern: illegal recruitment is <i>malum prohibitum</i>, while <i>estafa</i> is <i>mala in se</i>. In the first, the criminal intent of the accused is not necessary for conviction. In the second, such intent is imperative. <i>Estafa</i> under Article 315, paragraph 2 (a) of the Revised Penal Code is committed by any person who defrauds another by using fictitious name, or falsely pretends to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of similar deceits executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>Records show that Racho defrauded Odelio, Simeon, Bernardo, Renato, and Rodolfo by representing that she can provide them with jobs in East Timor even though she had no license to recruit workers for employment abroad. She even collected the irrelevant documents and placement fees of varying amounts. Although complainants were able to fly to East Timor, they remained unemployed there due to Racho's failure to obtain their working visas. When they returned to the country and looked for Racho, complainants could not locate her to recover the amounts they paid. Undeniably, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Racho committed Estafa against the five (5) complainants.<br><br>However, the Court acquits Racho in Criminal Case No. 05-1949 due to the prosecution's failure to present any evidence to prove the crime charged. Records show that William, the complainant in this particular Estafa case, failed to testify before the RTC despite receipt of two Subpoenas ordering him to appear and testify. No documentary or other testimonial evidence was also presented. Therefore, an acquittal is warranted for this particular case and, accordingly, the award of actual damages to William is deleted. Therefore, Racho's conviction for Estafa is affirmed only for five (5) counts.<br><br><center><b>III.</b><br></center><br>For another, the Court reduces the actual damages awarded to Rodolfo in Criminal Case No. 05-1951 to P35,000.00. Even though the amount alleged in the Information was P60,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Rodolfo's testimony revealed that he paid only P35,000.00 as placement fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> "A party is entitled to adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss actually suffered and duly proved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the Court modifies the penalties for the five (5) counts of Estafa pursuant to the recently-enacted RA 10951, which adjusted the base amounts that determine the incremental penalties to be imposed in Estafa cases and effectively reduced the imposable penalties. Notably, Section 100<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of RA 10951 echoes the rule that a penal law may have retroactive effect when it is favorable to the accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>The defrauded amounts involved in this case are: P100,000.00 in Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938 and 05-1948; P80,000.00 in Criminal Case Nos. 05-1941 and 05-1945; and P35,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 05-1951.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Prior to RA 10951, the imposable penalty when the amount involved exceeds P22,000.00 is the maximum period of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum, as minimum, to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum (<i>i.e.</i>, six [6] years, eight [8] months, and twenty one [21] days to eight [8] years), as maximum, plus one year for each additional P10,000.00.<br><br>With the enactment of RA 10951,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the imposable penalties were effectively reduced. For instance, when the amount involved is over P40,000.00 but not exceeding P1,200,000.00, the prescribed penalty is only <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum period (<i>i.e.</i>, four [4] months and one [1] day to two [2] years and four [4] months), which applies to Criminal Case Nos. 05-1938, 05-1941, 05-1945, and 05-1948 in this case.
