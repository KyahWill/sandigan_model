The prosecution's version of the story is as follows:<br><br>On July 21, 2010 at around 2:20 p.m., police officers coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to act on a tip by a confidential informant. P./Insp. Gerardo Macaraeg, Jr., PO3 Lucas Salonga (PO3 Salonga), PO3 Christian Carvajal (PO3 Carvajal), PO1 Allan Emerson Daus, and PO1 Ferdinand Lopez carried out a buy-bust operation in Sagana's residence at Muslim Tondaligan, Dagupan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>PO3 Salonga posted as the poseur-buyer. Five (5) P100.00 bills served as buy-bust money, marked with PO3 Salonga's initials, "LCS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Allegedly before the operation, PO3 Salonga had arranged the transaction through a phone call with Sagana, who set the meeting at his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The operation ensued.<br><br>Upon arrival at Sagana's house, Sagana invited PO3 Salonga and PO3 Carvajal inside. Once inside, PO3 Salonga informed Sagana that he would purchase P500 worth of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>When Sagana asked for the payment, PO3 Salonga gave him the marked money. After counting the money, Sagana handed him one (1) plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i>. Thereafter, PO3 Salonga confronted Sagana and introduced himself as a police officer. PO3 Carvajal apprehended Sagana's wife and another lady who also peddled him <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After a body search on Sagana, PO3 Salonga recovered the marked money and retrieved five (5) more plastic sachets of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> PO3 Salonga marked the articles with his initals, "LCS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accordingly, he made the confiscation receipt before delivering Sagana to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At the police station, the incident was entered in the police blotter. They took photos of Sagana and the confiscated items in the presence of a representative from the Department of Justice, media representatives, and an elected barangay official.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Based on the chemistry reports of P/Sr. Insp. Myma Malojo (P/Sr. Insp. Malojo), the heat-sealed plastic sachets were positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the defense posed frame-up and extortion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> against the police officers in their version of the events as follows:<br><br>On July 21, 2010 at around 2:00 p.m., Sagana was allegedly washing the dishes by the deep well next to his house when he heard a commotion in the yard. He was then prompted to check out what it was. There, he purportedly saw an armed man attempting to destroy their fence. This man hurriedly approached him, held his neck, and instructed him not to stand and to keep quiet because they were searching for someone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Allegedly, two (2) men barged inside his house. When the men went out, they commanded him to direct them to "the money." When Sagana asked about the money, one (1) of them supposedly hit his left side with a gun and was told that he would be brought to the police station. His family saw what the men did, which made his eldest child hysterical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Sagana and his wife were taken to the police station where he was asked if the items on top of the office table were his. Sagana answered in the negative which prompted the police officers to bring his wife to the investigating room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>A police officer allegedly demanded P50,000.00 in exchange for not filing a case against Sagana, an amount open for bargain. However, when Sagana told them that they did not have that amount, he was detained and was taken to the prosecutor's office for inquest the following week.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On July 19, 2011, the Regional Trial Court found Sagana guilty of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26] </sup>It ruled that Sagana "was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i> to a poseur buyer and possessing another five (5) plastic sachets of <i>shabu</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It found that all the elements necessary to establish the illegal sale and illegal possession of drugs were proven by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28] </sup>The dispositive portion of the decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Ernesto Sagana y de Guzman <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">GUILTY</span> beyond reasonable doubt in. Criminal Case No. 2010-0390-D for selling and delivering shabu weighing 0.12 gram to a poseur buyer in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act [No.] 9165, and pursuant to law, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and [a] fine of P500,000.00 and to pay the cost of suit.<br><br>In Criminal Case no. 2010-0391-D, the court likewise finds the accused Ernesto Sagana y de Guzman <i style="font-weight: bold;">GUILTY</i> beyond reasonable doubt for Possession of 0.59 gram of Shabu, a dangerous drug, in violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act [No.] 9165 and pursuant to law, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and [a] fine of P400,000.00 and to pay the cost of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>On appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Sagana asserted that the police officers failed to comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 and its implementing rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He argued that the trial court allegedly erred in finding him guilty of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On February 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the trial court's ruling. It held that failure to comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 did not render Sagana's arrest illegal or the evidence confiscated inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Strict compliance with the law can be dispensed with provided that "the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items [were] . . . preserved" by the law enforcers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal before this Court.<br><br>On August 28, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court of Appeals elevated to this Court the records of this case pursuant to its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated March 14, 2013. The Resolution gave due course to the Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> filed by Sagana.<br><br>In the Resolution dated September 30, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court noted the records of this case forwarded by the Court of Appeals. The parties were then ordered to file their supplemental briefs, should they so desired, within 30 days from notice.<br><br>On November 18, 2013, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> on behalf of the People of the Philippines stating that it would no longer file a supplemental brief. A similar Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> was filed by the Public Attorney's Office on behalf of Sagana.<br><br>For resolution before this Court is whether Ernesto Sagana's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. Subsumed in the resolution of this issue is whether the police officers complied with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 and its implementing rules in handling the alleged confiscated <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>Sagana insists that there are substantial gaps in the chain of custody presented by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>PO3 Salonga allegedly marked the six (6) sachets of <i>shabu</i> and conformably prepared the pertinent confiscation receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>At the police station, the confiscated items were allegedly turned to the desk officer for the incident to be entered in the police blotter and for the investigator to prepare the corresponding request for examination. Thereafter, the articles were delivered to the crime laboratory and were received by P/Sr. Insp. Malojo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Given this sequence, Sagana underscores that there are three (3) key persons involved: an unnamed desk officer, an unnamed police investigator, and P/Sr. Insp. Malojo, the receiving officer at the crime laboratory. All of them had contact with the purportedly confiscated illicit drugs. However, they were not presented as witnesses by the prosecution, for no reasonable explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Sagana emphasizes that in spite of making P/Sr. Insp. Malojo's testimony a subject of stipulation, it does not cover either the circumstances under which the specimens were received at the laboratory for testing and analysis or the processes done to these items while in her possession and custody. He then surmises that there can be no guarantee that the alleged confiscated <i>shabu</i> were the same ones seized from the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Sagana asserts that the prosecution failed to show that the marking and preparation of the receipt were made in his presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Despite the signatures of an elected public official and representatives from the media and the Department of Justice on the receipt, there were still infirmities as these signatories were not present in the operation when the inventory was done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General contends that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that all the essential elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> were present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>PO3 Salonga, as well as the other prosecution witnesses, recounted the circumstances of the contraband's sale that ended with Sagana's apprehension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The narration made by other witnesses, who were also police officers, should be given weight with the presumption that they performed their duties in a regular manner, absent any evidence to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the Office of the Solicitor General asserts that the chain of custody was never broken and that the seized <i>shabu's</i> integrity remained intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It avers that the drugs seized from Sagana were undoubtedly the exact specimens examined in the crime laboratory and presented and identified in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>This Court rules in favor of accused-appellant Sagana.<br><br>In a criminal case, this Court commences with the law's own standpoint on the standing of the accused that "in all criminal prosecutions, he is <i>presumed innocent of the charge</i> laid unless the contraiy is proven beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The burden of proof lies with the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, it must depend "on the strength of its case rather than on the weakness of the case for the defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Moreover, "[p]roof beyond reasonable doubt, or that quantum of proof sufficient to produce a moral certainty that would convince and satisfy the conscience of those who act in judgment," is necessary to surmount the presumption of innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>For a plausible conviction under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 or <i style="font-weight: bold;">illegal sale</i> of prohibited drugs, the prosecution must ascertain the following:<br><blockquote>(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>In illegal sale of dangerous drugs, it is necessary that the sale transaction actually happened and that "the [procured] <i><span style="font-weight: bold;">object</span> is properly presented</i> as evidence in court <i>and is shown to be the same drugs seized from the accused</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the following elements must be proven in <i style="font-weight: bold;">illegal possession</i> of prohibited drugs:<br><blockquote>[1] the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; [2] such possession was not authorized by law; and [3] the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>In both cases involving illegal sale and illegal possession, the illicit drugs confiscated from the accused comprise the <i style="font-weight: bold;">corpus delicti</i> of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>"[I]t is of paramount importance that the existence of the drug, the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime, be established beyond doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Its identity and integrity must be proven to have been safeguarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Aside from proving the elements of the charges, "the fact that the substance illegally possessed and sold [was] the same substance offered in court as exhibit must likewise be established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The <i style="font-weight: bold;">chain of custody</i> carries out this purpose "as it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>While the definition of chain of custody was not expressly provided for under Republic Act No. 9165,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002 defined it as follows:<br><blockquote>b. "Chain of custody" means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plants sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment at each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody w[as] made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition[.]<br></blockquote>In compliance with the chain of custody, the prosecution must identify the persons involved in handling the seized articles from confiscation up to their presentation as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67] </sup>Concomitantly, the prosecution should also offer statements pertaining to each link of the chain "in such a way that every person who touched the illegal drugs would describe how and from whom they were received, where they were and what happened to them while in his or her possession, the condition in which he or she received them, and their condition upon delivery."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><i>Mallillin v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> explained the importance of acquiescence to the chain of custody due to the distinctive nature of narcotics.<br><blockquote>A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases—by accident or otherwise—in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. <i style="font-weight: bold;">Hence, in authenticating the same, a. standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The prosecution in this case offered testimonies corroborating the narration of the alleged sale of illicit drugs that paved the way for Sagana's arrest. However, there were apparent lapses in the chain of custody that cast doubt on the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Hence, the prosecution failed to establish that the miniscule amounts of 0.12 grams and 0.59 grams of dangerous drugs presented as evidence in court were the very same ones allegedly seized and retrieved from Sagana.<br><br><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br></center><br>In this case, a buy-bust operation was conducted to validate the tip given by the confidential informant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> While a buy-bust operation has been known to be useful in "flush[ing] out illegal transactions that are otherwise conducted covertly and in secrecy," it has its drawback "that has not escaped the attention of the framers of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> It is prone "to police abuse, the most notorious of which is its use as a tool for extortion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In <i>People v. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> courts were urged to be more cautious in dealing with drug cases:<br><blockquote>"[B]y the very nature of anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin <i><span style="font-weight: bold;">can be planted in pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility of abuse is great</span>." Thus, the courts have been exhorted to be extra vigilant in trying drug cases lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis provided)<br></blockquote>Thus, it is essential that the chain of custody is established in buy-bust operations. This includes:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer;<br><br><i>Second</i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer;<br><br><i>Third</i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, the then<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> prevailing law, provides the manner in dealing with confiscated articles in drug cases. This mandated procedure emphasizes "the value of preserving the chain of custody in relation to the dangerous drugs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Hence, the prosecution must prove compliance to establish the elements of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The initial procedural safeguard<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> is provided for under Section 21, paragraph 1 of Republic Act No. 9165, which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span> after seizure and confiscation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physically inventory and photograph</span> the same in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presence of the accused</span> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</span></span> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>This is further elucidated in its Implementing Rules and Regulations, which state:<br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> — ...<br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs <i style="font-weight: bold;">shall</i>, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <i style="font-weight: bold;">Provided, further</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The prosecution's narration of events reveals that the police officers did not to conform with the chain of custody.

While they are certainly a bane to our society, small retailers are but low-lying fruits in an exceedingly vast network of drug cartels. Both law enforcers and prosecutors should realize that the more effective and efficient strategy is to focus resources more on the source and true leadership of these nefarious organizations. Otherwise, all these executive and judicial resources expended to attempt to convict an accused for 0.05 gram of <i>shabu</i> under doubtful custodial arrangements will hardly make a dent in the overall picture. It might in fact be distracting our law enforcers from their more challenging task: to uproot the causes of this drag menace.
