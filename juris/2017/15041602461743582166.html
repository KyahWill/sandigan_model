Hence, provisions having regulatory and prohibitive effect may be taken out of the Assailed Ordinance without entirely impairing its validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Further, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> took exception to PSPC's allegations and asserted that the Assailed Ordinance had been published in Dyaryo Veritas, a newspaper of general circulation in the area. Moreover, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> claimed that a joint public hearing on the Assailed Ordinance had in fact been conducted by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> and <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i>, where PSPC was duly represented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In addition, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> argued that the requirement of referral of ordinances to the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> applies only to tax and other revenue measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Finally, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> averred that since PSPC and SPEX, along with other concerned heavy industries, essentially question the former's authority to regulate and prohibit the use of fresh ground water, they should have first referred their grievances to NWRB by filing a complaint for adjudication on the threatened revocation of their existing water permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On June 21, 2007, the RTC resolved the First Gas Petition by issuing a Decision declaring the Assailed Ordinance null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, on June 29, 2007 the RTC rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this time resolving the PSPC and JG Summit petitions. The dispositive portion of said Decision reads:<br><blockquote>It is evident that from foregoing factual milieu and parameters, the questioned ordinance is INVALID, as it is hereby declared INVALID, in its entirety for want of necessity and for not conducting prior public hearing, and for violating the due process clause of the Constitution with respect to its (sic) Sec. 8, City Ordinance No.3, [s]. 2001.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC gave credence to the testimony of PSPC's witness Engineer Joeffrey Caranto (Engineer Caranto) who conducted a hydrogeology study on the Tabangao-Malitam watershed from which PSPC sources fresh ground water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The RTC summarized the findings of said study in this wise:<br><blockquote><ol><li>A water balance x x x calculation of the Tabangao-Malitam groundwater system shows that the natural recharge (replenishment) rate far exceeds the current demand for water in the area. Hence, <b>there is no threat of depletion of the groundwater resource[s] in the Tabangao-Malitam [w]atershed that purportedly may result from PSPC's deep well pumping</b>.<br><br></li><li><b>Water levels in the PSPC wells have not lowered significantly over the last three (3) decades, indicating that there is no substantial diminution of the supply of groundwater.</b><br><br></li><li>Among the four PSPC wells, only one [1] well shows very slightly elevated levels of chloride at 300 milligrams per liter which however is very low compared to seawater (which measures 20,000 milligrams of chloride per liter). The chloride levels in the other nearby PSPC wells are all within drinking water standards and have not increased in the last four (4) decades of usage. <b>This indicates that salt water intrusion is not occurring in the PSPC wells.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The RTC also noted that the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> failed to consult the NWRB before enacting the Assailed Ordinance, thereby encroaching upon its authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Anent Section 8, the RTC concluded that the power granted to the city mayor to cause the issuance of cease and desist orders against the use of ground water without prior notice and hearing constitutes a violation of the due process clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><i>Proceedings before the CA</i><br><br>Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> filed separate notices of appeal from the decisions resolving the PSPC, JG Summit and First Gas petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The appeals against JG Summit and First Gas were raffled to the Fourth Division (CA Fourth Division) and were docketed as CA-G.R.

Meanwhile, the appeal filed against PSPC and SPEX was raffled to the Tenth Division (CA Tenth Division), and docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 90373 (PSPC Appeal).<br><br>In the PSPC Appeal, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, as appellants, averred that the RTC failed to consider the testimonies of barangay captains Joel Caaway and Calixto Villena of Barangays Tabangao Aplaya and Pinamucan, respectively, who testified that some wells in their areas had dried up, while others had begun to produce salt water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> These testimonies, according to Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, serve as sufficient factual bases for the enactment of the Assailed Ordinance, as "there could be no higher degree of evidence than the actual experience of the inhabitants in the area."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 2009, the CA Fourth Division issued a Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> resolving the JG Summit and First Gas appeals. <b>The Joint Decision affirmed the RTC's decisions in SP Civil Case Nos. 7924-7925 (involving JG Summit and PSPC) and 7926 (involving First Gas).</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On October 15, 2009, the CA Tenth Division directed Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> on one hand, and PSPC and SPEX on the other, to file their respective memoranda on the filing of separate appeals, and the implications of the Joint Decision of the CA Fourth Division on the resolution of the PSPC Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In their Joint Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> PSPC and SPEX averred that the Joint Decision in the JG Summit and First Gas appeals bars a contrary decision in the PSPC Appeal, pursuant to the principle of judicial stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> PSPC and SPEX further contended that the filing of multiple appeals involving the same issues and parties was tantamount to forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In their defense, Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> claimed that the filing of separate appeals was made necessary by the fact that the separate decisions of the RTC in SP Civil Case Nos. 7924-7925 and 7926 were issued more than fifteen (15) days apart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the submissions of the parties, the CA Tenth Division issued the Assailed Decision dismissing the appeal filed against PSPC and SPEX for lack of merit. The relevant portions of the Assailed Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>City Ordinance No. 3, S. 2001 contravenes Presidential Decree No. 1067, better known as "<i>The Water Code of the Philippines</i>" as it is an encroachment into the authority of the [NWRB]. The use of water resources is under the regulatory power of the national government.</b> This is explicit from the provisions of the Water Code which states that -<br><blockquote>"The utilization, explo[i]tation, development, conservation and protection of water resources shall be subject to the control and regulation of the government through the [NWRB]".<br></blockquote>Although respondents-appellants insist that the city ordinance is not an absolute prohibition but merely a regulation on the use of fresh groundwater for cooling systems and industrial purposes the argument cannot justify the attempt to usurp the NWRB's power to regulate and control water resources. Moreover, not only does the city ordinance prohibit or regulate the use of fresh groundwater in disregard of previously granted water permits from the NWRB but also directs the installation of desalination plants for purposes of utilizing sea water, without the requisite water permit from the NWRB.<br><br>x x x The police power of the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i> is subordinate to the constitutional limitations that its exercise must be reasonable and for the public good. Without the concurrence of these two requisites, the ordinance will not muster the test of a valid police measure and should be struck down. The trial court aptly examined the city ordinance against the requirement of reasonable necessity and correctly concluded that the subject ordinance failed to prove that it was reasonably necessary to prohibit heavy industries from using ground water and requiring them instead to construct desalination plants. There must be a reasonable relation between the purposes of the police measure and the means employed for its accomplishment. Arbitrary invasion of personal rights and those pertaining to private property will not be allowed even under the guise of protecting public interest. It has not been sufficiently demonstrated that there exists no other means less intrusive of private rights that would equally be effective for the accomplishment of the same purpose.<br><br>With the foregoing premises considered, there is no more necessity to address the other errors raised in the instant appeal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>. The Decision dated 29 June 2007 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 84, in SP Civil Case No. 7924, declaring invalid City Ordinance No. 3, S. 2001 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (MR) dated June 21, 2010, which the CA Tenth Division subsequently denied through the Assailed Resolution.

Batangas City sought to correct this error in its Reply, thus:<br><blockquote>1. After diligent and careful review [of] the Petition for Review submitted by the undersigned, it was found out that there was an error which was inadvertently committed in the first paragraph of the fifth (5th) page of the Petition;<br><br>2. The first paragraph on page 5 of the Petition for Review on Certiorari x x x;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Should be amended to appear as:<br><blockquote>"On June 13, 2007, herein Petitioner City Government of Batangas received the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 84 of Batangas City ruling in favor of Respondents, [PSPC] and Intervenor [SPEX] x x x.

Time and again, the Court has ruled that in order for an ordinance to be valid, it must not only be within the corporate powers of the concerned LGU to enact, but must also be passed in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. Moreover, substantively, the ordinance (i) must not contravene the Constitution or any statute; (ii) must not be unfair or oppressive; (iii) must not be partial or discriminatory; (iv) must not prohibit, but may regulate trade; (v) must be general and consistent with public policy; and (vi) must not be unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Batangas City claims that the enactment of the Assailed Ordinance constitutes a valid exercise of its police power. This claim is erroneous.<br><br>Police power is the power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order, safety, and general welfare of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As an inherent attribute of sovereignty, police power primarily rests with the State. In furtherance of the State's policy to foster genuine and meaningful local autonomy, the national legislature delegated the exercise of police power to local government units (LGUs) as agents of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Such delegation can be found in Section 16<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the LGC, which embodies the general welfare clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Since LGUs exercise delegated police power as agents of the State, it is incumbent upon them to act in conformity to the will of their principal, the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Necessarily, therefore, ordinances enacted pursuant to the general welfare clause may not subvert the State's will by contradicting national statutes. Thus, in <i>Batangas CATV, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the Court struck down an ordinance enacted by Batangas City which granted the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> the power to fix subscriber rates charged by CATV providers operating within the former's territory, as this directly violated a general law which grants such power exclusively to the National Telecommunications Commission. In so ruling, the Court stressed that municipalities are precluded from regulating conduct already covered by a statute involving the same subject matter, hence:<br><blockquote>In <i>De la Cruz vs. Paraz</i>, we laid the general rule "that ordinances passed by virtue of the implied power found in the general welfare clause must be reasonable, consonant with the general powers and purposes of the corporation, and <i>not inconsistent with the laws or policy of the State</i>."<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>In this regard, it is appropriate to stress that where the state legislature has made provision for the regulation of conduct, it has manifested its intention that the subject matter shall be fully covered by the statute, and that a municipality, under its general powers, cannot regulate the same conduct. In <i>Keller vs. State</i>, it was held that: "<i>Where there is no express power in the charter of a municipality authorizing it to adopt ordinances regulating certain matters which are specifically covered by a general statute, a municipal ordinance, insofar as it attempts to regulate the subject which is completely covered by a general statute of the legislature, may be rendered invalid. x x x <u>Where the subject is o(statewide concern, and the legislature has appropriated the field and declared the rule, its declaration is binding throughout the State.</u></i><u>" A reason advanced for this view is that such ordinances are in excess of the powers granted to the municipal corporation.</u></b><br><br><b>Since E.O. No. 205, a general law, mandates that the regulation of CATV operations shall be exercised by the NTC, an LGU cannot enact an ordinance or approve a resolution in .violation of the said law.</b><br><br>It is a fundamental principle that municipal ordinances are inferior in status and subordinate to the laws of the state. An ordinance in conflict with a state law of general character and statewide application is universally held to be invalid. The principle is frequently expressed in the declaration that municipal authorities, under a general grant of power, cannot adopt ordinances which infringe the spirit of a state law or repugnant to the general policy of the state. In every power to pass ordinances given to a municipality, there is an implied restriction that the ordinances shall be consistent with the general law. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In this Petition, the Court is called upon to determine whether the control and regulation of the use of water may be made subject of a city ordinance under the regime of the Water Code - a national statute governing the same subject matter.<br><br>The Water Code governs the ownership, appropriation, utilization, exploitation, development, conservation and protection of water resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Under Article 3 thereof, water resources are placed under the control and regulation of the government through the National Water Resources Council, now the NWRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In turn, the privilege to appropriate and use water is one which is exclusively granted and regulated by the State through water permits issued by the NWRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Once granted, these water permits continue to be valid save only for reasons spelled out under the Water Code itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Conversely, the power to modify, suspend, cancel or revoke water permits already issued also rests with NWRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the avowed purpose of the Assailed Ordinance, as stated in its whereas clauses, is the protection of local aquifers for the benefit of the inhabitants of Batangas City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Accordingly, the Assailed Ordinance mandates all heavy industries operating along Batangas Bay to use seawater in the operation of their respective facilities, and install desalination plants for this purpose. Failure to comply with this mandatory requirement would have the effect of precluding continuous operation, and exposing non­compliant parties to penal and administrative sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>There is no doubt, therefore, that the Assailed Ordinance effectively contravenes the provisions of the Water Code as it arrogates unto Batangas City the power to control and regulate the use of ground water which, by virtue of the provisions of the Water Code, pertains solely to the NWRB. By enacting the Assailed Ordinance, Batangas City acted in excess of the powers granted to it as an LGU, rendering the Assailed Ordinance <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br>Being <i>ultra vires</i>, the Assailed Ordinance, in its entirety, is null and void. Thus, it becomes unnecessary to still determine if it complies with the other substantive requirements for a valid ordinance - <i>i.e.</i>, that the ordinance is fair and reasonable.<br><br>In any case, it bears emphasizing that the measure of the substantive validity of an ordinance is the underlying factual basis for which it was enacted. Hence, without factual basis, an ordinance will necessarily fail the substantive test for validity.<br><br>Batangas City's failure to prove the existence of factual basis to justify the enactment of the Assailed Ordinance had already been passed upon by the lower courts. The Court quotes, with approval, the Joint Decision of the CA Fourth Division:<br><blockquote>To prohibit an act or to compel something to be done, there must be a shown reason for the same. The purpose must also be cogent to the means adopted by the law to attain it. In this case, as seen in the "whereas clause," the purpose of the ordinance is to protect the environment and prevent ecological imbalance, especially the drying up of the aquifers of Batangas City. In effect, the drying up of aquifers is being blamed on the establishments and industries such as petitioners-appellees here. It would have been acceptable had there been a specific study or findings that the local government conducted (sic) and not just its reliance on the complaints of some constituents who merely made its conclusion that the drying up of wells or its salination was due to the "heavy industries" use of groundwater.<br><br>In addition, if appellants were convinced that those industries adversely affect the environment and specifically the water resource in Batangas City, there would be no exemptions, as provided in Section 5 of the Ordinance, as it would negate the purpose of the law.<br><br>It thus becomes apparent that the ordinance was come up with in an arbitrary manner, if not based purely on emotive or flawed premises. There was no scientific standard or any acceptable standard at all that the ordinance was based on. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>While the Joint Decision resolves the JG Summit and First Gas appeals, these cases, pertain to the same appeal filed by Batangas City and the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> from the Decision of the RTC nullifying the Assailed Ordinance. As aptly put by the CA in the present case:<br><blockquote>The factual antecedents and legal issues in the present CA-G.R. CV No. 90373 are identical to those of CA-G.R. CV Nos. 90324 and 90365. <b>The assignment of errors in the present appeal are but a restatement of the errors raised in the two consolidated appeals cases, which errors have already been exhaustively passed upon by the Court's Fourth Division in its Joint Decision dated May 28, 2009, weighing pieces of evidence that are now the very same pieces of evidence presented for consideration in this appeal.</b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court, not being a trier of facts, accords the highest degree of respect to the findings of fact of the trial court, especially where, as here, they have been affirmed by the CA; accordingly, these findings will not be disturbed. To be sure, such findings are binding and conclusive upon this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and it is not the Court's function in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> to examine, evaluate or weigh anew the probative value of the evidence presented before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> While there are recognized exceptions to this rule, the Court finds that none is present in this case.<br><br>Consequently, since it has been established that Batangas City did not have factual basis to justify the purpose of the Assailed Ordinance, Batangas City cannot invoke the presumption of validity. As held in <i>Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operators Association, Inc. v. City Mayor of Manila</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> which Batangas City itself cites in its Petition, <b>the presumption of validity ascribed to an ordinance prevails only in the absence of some factual foundation of record sufficient to overthrow the assailed issuance</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> In this case, the presumption of validity ascribed to the Assailed Ordinance had been overturned by documentary and testimonial evidence showing that no substantial diminution in the supply of ground water in the Tabangao­Malitam watershed had occurred in the last three (3) decades, and that no threat of depletion of ground water resources in said watershed existed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br><center><i>Final Note</i><br></center><br>While the Assailed Ordinance has been struck down as invalid, the pronouncements hereunder should not be misconstrued by heavy industries to be <i>carte blanche</i> to abuse their respective water rights at the expense of the health and safety of the inhabitants of Batangas City, the environment within which these inhabitants live, and the resources upon which these inhabitants rely. The Court recognizes fresh ground water as an invaluable natural resource, and deems it necessary to emphasize that Batangas City is not precluded from exercising its right to protect its inhabitants from injurious effects which may result from the misuse of natural water resources within its territorial jurisdiction, should these effects later arise, <i>provided</i> that such exercise is done within the framework of applicable national law, particularly, the Water Code.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
