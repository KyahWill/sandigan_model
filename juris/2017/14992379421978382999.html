It is this certification that makes the possession and use of the access device illegal. Therefore, the trial court determined that the access device could still be presented at trial since it merely formed part of an exhibit that had already been presented and marked during pre-trial.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Petitioner points out the alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of Ana Margarita Lim and Danilo Wong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Wong testified that the credit card presented in trial was not the same credit card that petitioner used in purchasing the Calvin Klein perfumes worth US$96.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The determination of the credibility of witnesses is a question of fact that should not be reviewed by this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> There are exceptions to this rule;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> however, none of those exceptions are present here.
