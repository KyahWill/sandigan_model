				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Lack of documentary evidence is not fatal to a claim for the deceased's lost earning capacity. Testimony from a competent witness familiar with his salary is a sufficient basis to determine the deceased's income before his death.<p> This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Court, praying that the April 3, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the May 28, 2009 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 71090 be partially modified. Petitioner Vivian B. Torreon (Vivian) prays that: (1) an award of actual or compensatory damages for loss of earning capacity worth P2,079,675.00 be granted; (2) the award of moral damages be increased to P1,000,000.00; (3) the award of exemplary damages be increased to P1,000,000.00; and (4) the awarded attorney's fees and litigation expenses be increased to P100,000.00 and P50,000.00, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> On November 1, 1989, Vivian's husband, Rodolfo Torreon (Rodolfo), and daughters, Monalisa Torreon (Monalisa) and Johanna Ava Torreon (Johanna), arrived with Felomina Abellana (Abellana) at the municipal wharf of Jetafe, Bohol. They came from Cebu City aboard M/B Island Traders, a motor boat owned and operated by Carmelo Simolde (Simolde).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> After they disembarked from the motor boat, they looked for a vehicle that would transport them from the wharf to the poblacion of Jetafe. A cargo truck entered the wharf and their fellow passengers boarded it. Abellana, Rodolfo, and his daughters chose not to board the already-overcrowded truck. Instead, they waited for a different vehicle to bring them to the poblacion. However, they were informed that only the cargo truck, which was also owned and operated by Simolde, would enter the wharf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> Approximately 10 minutes later, the same cargo truck returned to the wharf. Again, fellow passengers from M/B Island Traders started embarking it. This time, Rodolfo, Monalisa, Johanna, and Abellana also boarded it. Abellana was seated in front, while Rodolfo and his daughters were with the rest of the passengers at the back of the truck. Because there were no proper seats at the back of the truck, the 30 or more passengers were either standing or sitting on their bags.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> While passengers were getting on the truck, Simolde called Felix Caballes (Caballes), the official truck driver. Caballes approached Simolde but left the engine running. While Simolde and Caballes were talking, Generoso Aparra, Jr. (Aparra), Simolde's chief diesel mechanic, started driving the truck. Upon seeing the truck move, Caballes rushed to the truck and sat beside Aparra. However, instead of taking control of the vehicle, Caballes allowed Aparra to drive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Shortly thereafter, Aparra maneuvered the truck to the right side of the road to avoid hitting a parked bicycle. But as he turned, Aparra had to swerve to the left to avoid hitting Marcelo Subiano, who was allegedly standing on the side of the road. Because the road was only four (4) meters and 24 inches wide, rough, and full of potholes, Aparra lost control of the truck and they fell off the wharf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> Consequently, Rodolfo and Monalisa died while Johanna and Abellana were injured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> On April 3, 1990, Vivian and Abellana filed a criminal complaint for Reckless Imprudence resulting to Double Homicide, Multiple Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property against Aparra and Caballes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> docketed as Criminal Case No. 6555 before the Regional Trial Court, Tagbilaran City, Bohol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> On January 4, 1991, Vivian and Abellana filed a separate complaint for damages against Simolde, Caballes, and Aparra<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> docketed as Civil Case No. 3593 before Branch 3, Regional Trial Court, Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> Simolde, Caballes, and Aparra filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Suspend Proceedings (Motion to Dismiss) in Civil Case No. 3593. They argued that when Abellana instituted Criminal Case No. 6555 before the Regional Trial Court of Bohol, she failed to make a reservation to file an independent civil action for damages. Thus, Abellana was barred from instituting the civil action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> On January 22, 1992, the Regional Trial Court of Butuan City denied the Motion to Dismiss. However, upon reconsideration, the Regional Trial Court dismissed the case, ruling that the civil action was impliedly instituted with Criminal Case No. 6555.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> Abellana and Vivian filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, assailing the dismissal of the case. On June 18, 1993, the Court of Appeals reinstated Civil Case No. 3593 but only with respect to Vivian.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> During the trial for the civil case, SPO2 Federico T. Torniado (SPO2 Torniado) testified that he was the "acting traffic investigator of the PNP" assigned to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to SPO2 Torniado, he had previously seen the pick-up truck transport passengers from the wharf to the poblacion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The road, which was four (4) meters wide, could only accommodate one (1) vehicle. Other than the truck, there were no other vehicles that came in and out of the wharf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He further testified that on the day of the accident, he asked to see Aparra's license but Aparra only presented a student driver's permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> Abellana testified that Rodolfo was the General Manager of her businesses in Butuan City. As manager, Rodolfo was in charge of three (3) drugstores, an apartment, and rice fields. He was earning a basic salary of P10,000.00 and received a 20% commission on the profit of the businesses, thus, earning more or less P15,000.00. Abellana claimed that she could not present her accounting books to the court because she had already disposed of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> On November 17, 2000, the Regional Trial Court ruled that Caballes and Aparra committed acts constituting a quasi-delict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Since these acts were the proximate cause of the deaths of Rodolfo and Monalisa and the injuries sustained by Abellana and Johanna, Simolde, Caballes, and Aparra were held liable for damages. The dispositive portion of the trial court Decision stated: </p><blockquote> <p> Wherefore, on the basis therefore of the foregoing evidence, both [testimonial and documentary [,] [t]his Court does hereby render judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against defendants and hereby ordering the defendants as follows:</p> <ol><li> To pay jointly and severally to plaintiffs the amount of P300,000.00 as actual damages; <br><br></li><li> To pay jointly and severally to plaintiffs the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages; and to pay in solidum to plaintiffs by way of litigation expenses in the sum of P10,000.00; <br><br></li><li> To pay in solidum into plaintiffs [Vivian] Torreon and Felomina Abellana the sum of P25,000.00 and P10,000.00 by way of Attorney's fees; and <br><br></li><li> To pay in solidum into plaintiffs the sum of P10,000.00 as exemplary damages.</li></ol> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Simolde, Caballes, and Aparra filed a Notice of Appeal on November 27, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> On April 3, 2008, the Court of Appeals promulgated a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> holding Simolde solidarity liable with Caballes and Aparra. According to the Court of Appeals, Caballes and Aparra were clearly negligent in transporting the passengers. Given that the road was narrow and fall of pot holes, it was apparent that an experienced driver was needed to safely navigate the vehicle out of the wharf. In allowing Aparra to drive the truck despite having only a student driver's permit, Caballes risked the lives of the passengers on board the truck. The Court of Appeals also held Simolde solidarity liable with his employees for failing to exercise due diligence in supervising them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, the Court of Appeals deleted the award of actual damages for Rodolfo's loss of earning capacity. According to the Court of Appeals, documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for loss of earning capacity. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Court<em> a quo</em> in Civil Case No. 3593 is SET ASIDE and another one is RENDERED ordering appellants Carmelo T. Simolde, Felix Caballes and Generoso Aparra, Jr., to pay, solidarity, appellee Vivian Torreon the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as civil indemnity for the death of Rod[o]lfo Torreon; another Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as civil indemnity for the death of Monalisa Torreon; Twenty-five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos as temperate or moderate damages for pecuniary loss sustained due to the death of Rod[o]lfo Torreon and another Twenty-five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos as temperate or moderate damages for pecuniary loss sustained due to the death of Monalisa Torreon; Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages; Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos as exemplary damages; Ten Thousand . . . (P10,000.00) Pesos as attorney's fees and Twenty[-]Five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos as litigation expenses, with legal interest at the rate of SIX PERCENT(6%) per annum starting from the date of the promulgation of the court <em>a quo's Decision</em> or from 17 November 2000. A TWELVE PERCENT (12%) interest, in lieu of SIX PERCENT (6%), shall be imposed on such amount upon finality of this decision until actual payment thereof.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Vivian and Abellana filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> asking the Court of Appeals to modify its April 3, 2008 Decision by increasing the award of the damages to the following amounts: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="96%"> <div align="justify">Php2,079,675.00, as compensatory damages for loss or impairment of earning capacity (lucro cesant); instead of Php25,000.00.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Php300,000.00 as actual damages for funeral and burial expenses; or in the alternative, a reasonable or just amount as temperate damages. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Php1,000,000.00 as moral damages; instead of Php50,000.00.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Php1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages; instead of Php10,000.00.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(e)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Php100,000.00 and Php50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses; instead of Php10,000.00 and Php25,000.00, respectively[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>In its May 28, 2009 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied the motion.</p> <p> Hence, this Petition was filed before this Court. </p><p> Petitioner Vivian argues that the Court of Appeals gravely erred in deleting the compensatory damages awarded for Rodolfo's loss of earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> She posits that Abellana's testimony is enough to prove Rodolfo's income. As Rodolfo's employer, Abellana had direct and personal knowledge of the compensation that he was receiving prior to his death; thus, she is qualified to testify on his income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Petitioner Vivian cites <em>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to point out that the Court of Appeals gravely erred in concluding that Abellana's testimony, without any documentary evidence, did not suffice to claim damages for lack of earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Based on Abellana's testimony, Rodolfo had an estimated gross monthly income of P15,000.00 or an annual gross income of P195,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Using the formula<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> laid down in<em> Negros Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Rodolfo's lost earnings would amount to P2,079,675.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner Vivian cites four (4) reasons why the damages awarded to her should be increased. First, she points to the gravity of the loss she suffered. The difficulties she has gone through, following the death of her husband and her young daughter, are immeasurable and deserve a higher compensation. Second, the degree of the negligence committed by respondents, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, is gross and inexcusable, thereby warranting harsher penalties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Third, Simolde has an undisputable substantial financial capacity to pay more. Allegedly, Simolde has a "virtual monopoly of the business at Jetafe wharf."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He has the capacity to pay the increased amounts petitioner Vivian is praying for. Lastly, the length of the litigation, which spanned almost two (2) decades at the time this petition was filed to this Court, has whittled down the real value of the monetary award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, respondents argue that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in the assailed Decision. They claim that there is no sufficient proof to sustain the award of damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Respondents also contend that the inclusion of Abellana as a petitioner is baseless. The Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28859 already ruled that the present case is reinstated only with respect to Vivian.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p> In its February 17, 2010 Resolution, this Court required petitioners to file a Reply to respondents' Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> On April 28, 2010, petitioners filed their Reply and claimed that Abellana's inclusion as a petitioner is "a non-issue."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Abellana was only joined as a petitioner because she was already a co-petitioner in the lower courts. However, as seen "in the prayer of the Petition for Review, Felomina Abellana is not mentioned as being entitled [to] payment for damages from respondents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> The issues for this Court's resolution are as follows:</p><p> First, whether or not actual damages for loss of earning capacity should be awarded to petitioner Vivian B. Torreon; and</p><p> Second, whether or not the value of the other awarded damages should be increased.</p><p> Before proceeding with the discussion regarding civil damages, this Court will briefly discuss Abellana's standing in this case. Notably, the Court of Appeals already ruled on this matter. However, since respondents raised it in their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> it is best to address this concern.</p><p align="center"><strong>I</strong> </p><p> On April 3, 1990, petitioners instituted a criminal case against respondents. However, petitioner Abellana did not reserve her right to file a separate civil action for damages arising from the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Rule 111, Section 1(a) of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. — (a) When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.</p> <p> The reservation of the right to institute separately the civil action shall be made before the prosecution starts presenting its evidence and under circumstances affording the offended party a reasonable opportunity to make such reservation.</p> <p> When the offended party seeks to enforce civil liability against the accused by way of moral, nominal, temperate, or exemplary damages without specifying the amount thereof in the complaint or information, the filing fees therefor shall constitute a first lien on the judgment awarding such damages.</p> <p> Where the amount of damages, other than actual, is specified in the complaint or information, the corresponding filing fees shall be paid by the offended party upon the filing thereof in court.</p> <p> Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, no filing fees shall be required for actual damages.</p> <p> No counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party complaint may be filed by the accused in the criminal case, but any cause of action which could have been the subject thereof may be litigated in a separate civil action. </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28859 correctly reinstated the present case only with regard to Vivian. When Abellana did not reserve her right to institute a separate civil action, her cause of action for damages was deemed impliedly instituted with the criminal case. Rule 111, Section 3 of the Rules of Court prohibits offended parties from recovering damages twice for the act being prosecuted in the criminal action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Thus, Abellana is now barred from instituting this case.</p><p> This Court now moves to the discussion regarding damages.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Article 2176 of the Civil Code provides that those who commit acts constituting a quasi-delict are liable to pay damages: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Vergara v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> enumerated the elements necessary to establish a quasi-delict case: </p><blockquote> <p> These requisites are: (1) damages to the plaintiff; (2) negligence, by act or omission, of which defendant, or some person for whose-acts he must respond, was guilty; and (3) the connection of cause and effect between such negligence and the damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This Court affirms the finding of the Court of Appeals that Caballes and Aparra were grossly negligent in transporting the passengers. The Court of Appeals ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> Records bore that after appellant Aparra took over the control of the wheel of the cargo truck and drove the same, appellant Caballes merely rushed to get on the truck and only sat beside appellant Aparra. Appellant Caballes, despite the fact that appellant Aparra possessed only a student driver's permit, allowed him to continue driving the truck. Moreover, We cannot glean from the records that appellant Caballes cautioned appellant Aparra while the latter was driving the truck. It must be pointed out that the cargo truck had more than thirty (30) passengers on board at its back, who were either just standing or sitting on their bags, with nothing to hold on for support, while the truck was moving. Furthermore, the road was only four (4) meters wide, rough and with many pot holes. Obviously, these circumstances warrant that the driver be somebody of competence and experience in maneuvering a vehicle under such a precarious condition. Therefore, the acts of appellant Aparra in taking the wheel and of appellant Caballes in allowing the former to take the wheel are plain manifestations of negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Caballes was grossly negligent in allowing Aparra to drive the truck despite being an inexperienced driver. Aparra's inexperience caused the accident that led to the deaths of Rodolfo and Monalisa. It is undisputed that the deaths of Vivian's husband and daughter caused damage to her. Clearly, the requisites for a quasi-delict are present in this case.</p><p> In addition to Caballes and Aparra, the law also holds their employer, Simolde, liable. Article 2180 of the Civil Code provides that an employer is vicariously liable with his employees for any damage they cause while performing their duties. </p><blockquote> <p> Article 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.<br> . . . .</p> <p><strong> Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.<br> </strong>. . . . </p> <p> The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> <em>Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. v. C &amp; A Construction, Inc</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> explained that when an employee's negligence causes injury to another, a presumption against the employer arises. To avoid liability, the employer must prove he exercised due diligence in selecting as well as supervising his employees. </p><blockquote> <p> Whenever an employee's negligence causes damage or injury to another, there instantly arises a presumption<em> juris tantum</em> that the employer failed to exercise<em> diligentissimi patris familias</em> in the selection (<em>culpa in eligiendo</em>) or supervision (<em>culpa in vigilando</em>) of its employees. To avoid liability or a quasi-delict committed by his employee, an employer must overcome the presumption by presenting convincing proof that he exercised the care and diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of his employee.</p> <p> There is no question that petitioner, who is the owner/operator of M/V Delsan Express, is also the employer of Capt. Jusep who at the time of the incident acted within the scope of his duty. The defense raised by petitioner was that it exercised due diligence in the selection of Capt. Jusep because the latter is a licensed and competent Master Mariner<strong>. It should be stressed, however, that the required diligence of a good father of a family pertains not only to the selection, but also to the supervision of employees.</strong> It is not enough that the employees chosen be competent and qualified, inasmuch as the employer is still required to exercise due diligence in supervising its employees.</p> <p> In <em>Fabre, Jr. v. Court of Appeals</em>, it was held that <strong>due diligence in supervision requires the formulation of rules and regulations for the guidance of employees and the issuance of proper instructions as well as actual implementation and monitoring of consistent compliance with the rules</strong>. Corollarily, in <em>Ramos v.

Spouses Sumayang</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> this Court applied Article 2206 of the Civil Code and awarded compensation for the deceased's lost earning capacity in addition to the award of civil indemnity. The indemnity for the deceased's lost earning capacity is meant to compensate the heirs for the income they would have received had the deceased continued to live.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> <em>Pleyto v. Lomboy</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> provided the formula to compute a deceased's earning capacity: </p><blockquote> <p> It is well-settled in jurisprudence that the factors that should be taken into account in determining the compensable amount of lost earnings are: (1) the number of years for which the victim would otherwise have lived; and (2) the rate of loss sustained by the heirs of the deceased. Jurisprudence provides that the first factor, i.e., life expectancy, is computed by applying the formula (2/3 x [80 - age at death]) adopted in the American Expectancy Table of Mortality or the Actuarial Combined Experience Table of Mortality. As to the second factor, it is computed by multiplying the life expectancy by the net earnings of the deceased, i.e., the total earnings less expenses necessary in the creation of such earnings or income and less living and other incidental expenses. The net earning is ordinarily computed at fifty percent (50%) of the gross earnings. Thus, the formula used by this Court in computing loss of earning capacity is: <strong>Net Earning Capacity = [2/3 x (80 - age at time of death) x (gross annual income - reasonable and necessary living expenses)</strong>].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The reason behind the formula for loss of earning capacity was discussed in <em>Villa Rey Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [The award of damages for loss of earning capacity is] concerned with the determination of the losses or damages sustained by the Private respondents, as dependents and intestate heirs of the deceased, and that said damages consist, not of the full amount of his earnings, but of the support they received or would have received from him had he not died in consequence of the negligence of petitioner's agent. In fixing the amount of that support, We must reckon with the "necessary expenses of his own living", which should be deducted from his earnings. Thus, it has been consistently held that earning capacity, as an element of damages to one's estate for his death by wrongful act is necessarily his net earning capacity or his capacity to acquire money, "less the necessary expense for his own living." Stated otherwise, the amount recoverable is not loss of the entire earning, but rather the loss of that portion of the earnings which the beneficiary would have received. In other words, only net earnings, not gross earning, are to be considered that is, the total of the earnings less expenses necessary in creation of such earnings or income and less living and other incidental expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The formula provided in these cases is presumptive, i.e., it should be applied in the absence of proof in terms of statistics and actuarial presented by the plaintiff.</p><p> The Court of Appeals deleted the award of actual damages granted to petitioner for Rodolfo's lost earnings. According to the Court of Appeals, documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for the deceased's lost income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p><p> This Court disagrees.</p><p> In civil cases, Vivian is only required to establish her claim by a preponderance of evidence. Allowing testimonial evidence to prove loss of earning capacity is consistent with the nature of civil actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Rule 133, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. <i>Preponderance of evidence, how determined</i>. — In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence. In determining where the preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues involved lies, the court may consider all the facts and circumstances of the case, the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial. The court may also consider the number of witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number.</p> </blockquote> <p> In determining if this quantum of proof is met, this Court is not required to exclusively consider documentary evidence: </p><blockquote> <p> Nothing in the Rules of Court requires that only documentary evidence is allowed in civil cases. All that is required is the satisfaction of the quantum of evidence, that is, preponderance of evidence. In addition, the Civil Code does not prohibit a claim for loss of earning capacity on the basis that it is not proven by documentary evidence.</p> <p> Testimonial evidence, if not questioned for credibility, bears the same weight as documentary evidence. Testimonies given by the deceased's spouse, parent, or child should be given weight because these individuals are presumed to know the income of their spouse, child, or parent.</p> <p> If the amount of income testified to seemed incredible or unrealistic, the defense could always raise their objections and discredit the witness or, better yet, present evidence that would outweigh the evidence of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This Court has previously accepted a competent witness' testimony to determine the deceased's income.

Failure to present documentary evidence to support a claim for loss of earning capacity of the deceased need not be fatal to its cause. Testimonial evidence suffices to establish a basis for which the court can make a fair and reasonable estimate of the loss of earning capacity. Hence, the testimony of respondent Maria Lomboy, Ricardo's widow, that her husband was earning a monthly income of P8,000 is sufficient to establish a basis for an estimate of damages for loss of earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In a torts case, this Court also accepted testimony from co-workers of the deceased to establish his income before his death. </p><blockquote> <p> The witnesses Mate and Reyes, who were respectively the manager and auditor of Allied Overseas Trading Company and Padilla Shipping Company, were competent to testify on matters within their personal knowledge because of their positions, such as the income and salary of the deceased, Nicanor A.

As observed by the Court of Appeals, since they were cross-examined by petitioner's counsel, any objections to their competence and the admissibility of their testimonies, were deemed waived.

Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date of the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount of finally adjudged. </strong></p> <p> 3. When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Interest by way of damages, also known as moratory interest, is allowed in actions for breach of contract or tort.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Since the obligation in this case stems from a quasi-delict and not from a loan or forbearance of money, the interest awarded falls under the second paragraph illustrated in <i>Eastern Shipping</i>. This is in line with Article 2211 of the Civil Code which states that this Court may impose "interest as a part of the damages" in quasi-delict cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Awarding this interest is discretionary upon the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup></p><p> This is different from interest on interest imposed under Article 2212<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> of the Civil Code. Interest on interest is mandatory and is imposed as penalty for the delay in the payment of a sum of money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></p><p> Guided by<em> Eastern Shipping</em>, the Court of Appeals imposed a 6% interest on the award of damages starting from November 17, 2000, the date of the promulgation of the Regional Trial Court Decision. However, this award is not proper.</p><p> Generally, the Civil Code does not allow interest upon unliquidated claims or damages to be recovered unless they can be established with reasonable certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The rationale for this is because it would be unfair to require the liable person to pay interest on a sum that is yet to be determined. However, the courts, in the interest of justice, may impose interest on unliquidated claims or damages upon judgment.</p><p> In this case, there is no need to impose a moratory interest. Actual damages to compensate for the deceased's lost earnings are already granted. Payment for Rodolfo's lost earning capacity should be enough to cover the actual damages suffered by his heirs.</p><p> On the other hand, pursuant to <i>Eastern Shipping</i>, the Court of Appeals correctly imposed an interest on the judgment award. However, the 12% interest should be modified. Following Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas- Monetary Board Circular No. 796 dated May 16, 2013, the rate of legal interest is now 6%. <i>Nacar v. Gallery Frames</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> is instructive: </p><blockquote> <p> Recently, however, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board (BSP-MB), in its Resolution No. 796 dated May 16, 2013, approved the amendment of Section 2 of Circular No. 905, Series of 1982 and, accordingly, issued Circular No. 799, Series of 2013, effective July 1, 2013, the pertinent portion of which reads:</p> <blockquote> <p> The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 796 dated 16 May 2013, approved the following revisions governing the rate of interest in the absence of stipulation in loan contracts, thereby amending Section 2 of Circular No. 905, Series of 1982:</p> <p> Section 1. The rate of interest for the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or credits and the rate allowed in judgments, in the absence of an express contract as to such rate of interest, shall be six percent (6%) per annum.</p> <p> Section 2. In view of the above, Subsection X305.1 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks and Sections 4305Q.1, 4305S.3 and 4303P.1 of the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions are hereby amended accordingly.</p> </blockquote> <p> This Circular shall take effect on 1 July 2013.</p> <p> Thus, from the foregoing, in the absence of an express stipulation as to the rate of interest that would govern the parties, the rate of legal interest for loans or forbearance of any money, goods or credits and the rate allowed in judgments shall no longer be twelve percent (12%) per annum — as reflected in the case of <em>Eastern Shipping Lines</em> and Subsection X305.1 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks and Sections 4305Q.I, 4305S.3 and 4303P.1 of the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions, before its amendment by BSP-MB Circular No. 799 — but will now be six percent (6%) per annum effective July 1, 2013. It should be noted, nonetheless, that the new rate could only be applied prospectively and not retroactively. Consequently, the twelve percent (12%) per annum legal interest shall apply only until June 30, 2013. Come July 1, 2013 the new rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be the prevailing rate of interest when applicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, the guidelines laid down in<em> Eastern Shipping </em>have been amended as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> I. When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on "Damages" of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.</p> <p> II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> 1. When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.</p> <p> 2. When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.</p> <p> <strong>3. When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Since the judgment of this Court has not yet become final and executory, the interest rate applicable to the judgment award is 6% and not 12% as imposed by the Court of Appeals.</p><p> The interest on the judgment award discussed in <em>Eastern Shipping</em> is reckoned from finality of the judgment until full payment. It is designed to penalize non-payment of the judgment award. Thus, if the liable party immediately pays, no interest will be imposed.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the April 3, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
