(Underscoring and emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> As worded, Section 267 operates only within the purview of real property taxation (Title II). The pertinent tax involved is only real property tax or realty tax. Thus, the reason for the "sale at public auction of the real property or rights therein" in Section 267 is obviously because of non-payment of realty tax and no other. Accordingly, the precondition for the operation of Section 267 is the realty tax delinquency of the property. If the property is current in its realty tax or not realty tax delinquent, then it should not be the subject of a sale at public auction as contemplated in Section 267. The "taxpayer" referred to in the Section is none other than the declarant of the property in a real property tax declaration, who is generally its owner, and his declared property is realty tax delinquent. The "taxpayer" in Section 267 refers to no other person.</p><p> <i>National Housing Authority (NHA) v. Iloilo City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> <i>Gamilla v. Burgundy Realty Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and <i>Spouses Wong v. City of Iloilo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> deal with realty tax delinquency sale. Their import to this case requires a review of their factual backdrops.</p><p> In <i>Gamilla</i>, the auction sale was questioned because of the procedural lapses in the failure of the local government unit (LGU) concerned to comply with Sections 176<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and 178<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the LGC. There was no issue on the realty tax delinquency status of the property subject of the case.</p><p> In <i>Spouses Wong</i>, the auction sale was questioned for non-compliance with Section 73<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 464.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> There was also no dispute that the property subject of the case was tax delinquent. </p><p> The tax status of the property subject of <i>NHA</i> is different. While the LGU declared the property delinquent for non-payment of realty tax and sold it in a public auction sale, the validity of the auction sale was questioned by NHA for lack of notice to NHA as its registered owner and because NHA is a tax-exempt agency of the government.</p><p> In <i>NHA</i>, a motion to dismiss NHA's complaint was filed by the defendants therein on the basis of Section 267 for the failure of NHA (<i>i.e.</i>, the taxpayer) to make the deposit with the court. The motion to dismiss was granted by the lower court. The CA affirmed the order of dismissal. In its petition for review on certiorari before the Court, NHA argued that Section 267, requiring the taxpayer to deposit with the court the amount specified therein, should not apply to NHA and even assuming it did apply to NHA, it was not necessary given the fact that the government is always presumed to be solvent. While admitting that NHA is a tax-exempt entity, the issue posed and addressed by the Court was whether NHA's tax-exempt status vests it with immunity as well from the deposit requirement under Section 267. In resolving this, the Court explained the reason for the deposit requirement in Section 267, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> As is apparent from a reading of the foregoing provision, a deposit x x x is a condition - a "prerequisite," x x x - which must be satisfied before the court can entertain any action assailing the validity of the public auction sale. The law, in plain and unequivocal language, prevents the court from entertaining a suit unless a deposit is made. This is evident from the use of the word "shall" in the first sentence of Section 267. Otherwise stated, the deposit is a jurisdictional requirement the nonpayment of which warrants the failure of the action.</p> <p> x x x As expressed in Section 267 itself, <u>the amount deposited shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if the deed is declared invalid; otherwise, it shall be returned to the depositor</u>. <b><u>The deposit</u></b>, <u>equivalent to the value for which the real property was sold plus interest,</u><b><u> is essentially meant to reimburse the purchaser of the amount he had paid at the auction sale should the court declare the sale invalid</u></b>.</p> <p>Clearly, <b><u>the deposit precondition is an ingenious legal device to guarantee the satisfaction of the tax delinquency, with the local government unit keeping the payment on the bid price no matter the final outcome of the suit to nullity the tax sale</u></b>. Thus, the requirement is not applicable if the plaintiff is the government or any of its agencies as it is presumed to be solvent, and more so where the tax exempt status of such plaintiff as basis of the suit is acknowledged. x x x Perforce, <u>the bond mandated in Section 267, whose <b>purpose</b> it is to <b>ensure the collection of the tax delinquency</b></u> should not be required of NHA before it can bring suit assailing the validity of the auction sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Underscoring and emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, the <i>ratio</i> behind the deposit requirement as succinctly espoused in <i>NHA</i> is to ensure and guarantee the collection and satisfaction of the tax delinquency.</p> <p> In the present case, the very issue raised in the Petition is the invalidity of the auction sales <u><i>on the ground that the subject properties are<b> not</b> tax delinquent</i></u>. On the assumption that the subject two lots are<em><strong> not</strong></em> tax delinquent, then there is no need for the deposit requirement under Section 267 because the realty taxes due on the subject two lots have already been paid and there are no tax delinquencies to be collected or satisfied. </p><p> The unfairness of the deposit requirement as it is applied in this case is clear. There were two lots of BHC that were sold at public auction. Per the first Final Bill of Sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the lot with an area of 1,145 square meters located in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City, with an assessed value of P3,435,000.00, was advertised for sale at public auction to satisfy "all taxes and penalties due and the costs of sale in the amount of <b>P224,670.48</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> by reason that the real property tax accrued for the years 4<sup>th</sup> quarter 2005 - 2007 had not been paid and remained delinquent. At the public auction held on November 15, 2007, Litonjua was declared the highest bidder, with a bid amount of P6,901,523.00.</p><p> Per the second Final Bill of Sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the lot with an area of 1,137 square meters, also located in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City with an assessed value of P3,411,000.00, was also advertised for sale at public auction to satisfy "all taxes and penalties due and the costs of sale in the amount of <b>P223,100.73</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> by reason that the real property tax accrued for the years 4th quarter 2005 - 2007 had not been paid and remained delinquent. At the public auction held on November 15, 2007, Litonjua was declared the highest bidder, with a bid amount of P10,601,523.50. </p><p>For the first property, the deposit amount required under Section 267, if followed, is "the amount for which the real property was sold" - P6,901,523.00, "together with interest of two percent (2%) per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action" - P4,140,913.80. Interest per month is P138,030.46 or 2% of P6,901,523.00. P138,030.46 multiplied by 30 months<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> is P4,140,913.80, the interest component of the deposit. Thus, the required deposit is a staggering <b>P11,042,436.80</b> or <b><u>49 times the tax delinquency, penalty and costs of sale</u></b>. </p><p> For the second property, the deposit being required is so much more. Given that the bid amount is P10,601,523.50, the 2% interest per month amounts to P212,030.47. Total interest for 30 months is P6,360,914.10. Thus, the required deposit under Section 267 is a more staggering amount of <b>P16,962,437.60</b> or <b><u>76 times the tax delinquency, penalty and costs of sale</u></b>.</p><p> For both properties, the deposit being required from BHC is <b>P28,004,874.40</b>. </p><p>As illustrated above, Section 267 can indeed provide a lucrative business - a disguised legislated "usury" law. The guaranteed return to the highest bidder for his investment is not small, by any measure. In real terms, Litonjua's investment had earned more than P10.5 million in two and a half years. </p><p> The required deposit under Section 267 becomes jurisdictional <b><u>only if</u></b> there is no dispute that the real property is tax delinquent. In that instance, the deposit will serve its intended purpose. However, where the property sold at a public auction sale is not tax delinquent, then the envisioned purpose becomes irrelevant, if not oppressive.</p><p> In support of BHCs contention that the subject two lots are not real property tax delinquent, it specifically made the following averments in its Complaint: </p><blockquote> <p> 4. Per letters dated November 6, 2007, the City Government of Taguig billed plaintiff, the basic taxes due on subject properties, for the years 2005 to 2006 and the 4<sup>th</sup> Quarter of 2007, <b>for settlement within the month of November 2007</b> to avoid penalties of 2% per month, in the amounts of Php 414,132.18 and Php 411,238.68 based on the Statements of Accounts processed on November 5, 2007, reviewed by Teodoro S.

Failure to comply with this prerequisite deprives a court of jurisdiction and is deemed a sufficient ground for the outright dismissal of the action. In <i>National, Housing Authority (NHA) v.

The pronouncements therein were not dependent on the specific allegations of the taxpayers.

It argues:</p> <blockquote> <p> That with due respect. Section 267 itself would show that it refers to a delinquent taxpayer, thus there would be no basis to require the petitioner to make such deposit so that the lower court could take cognizance of the complaint for as above-shown, petitioner was not a delinquent taxpayer. Section 267 states - "x x x x Neither shall any court declare a sale at public auction invalid by reasons of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings unless the substantive rights of the <b>delinquent owner</b> of the real property or the person having legal interest therein have been impaired." x x x Clearly, Section 267 refers to a delinquent taxpayer. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner claims that the use of the word "delinquent" in this segment means that the entire Section 267, including the first paragraph requiring a deposit, may be applied only to a delinquent taxpayer.</p><p> I am not persuaded.</p><p> The plain language of the provision reveals that the law does not support petitioner's proposed interpretation. To begin with, the first paragraph of Section 267 speaks only of a "taxpayer" who brings an action to annul a tax sale conducted under Book III, Title II of the LGC, on real property taxation. By definition, a "taxpayer" is "one who pays or is subject to a tax."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Since the term is used in its general sense without qualification, the Court must consider it as referring to <i>any person</i> who (a) is subject to real property taxes under the LGC; and (b) seeks to challenge the validity of the sale at public auction of real property or rights. There is nothing in the provision to indicate that its application is limited to delinquent taxpayers. <i>Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemos</i>. Where the law does not distinguish, the court should not distinguish.</p><p> Further, it is an established principle of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to have known the meaning of the words in the statute and to have used these words advisedly to express its true intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Where general words are used, their natural meaning cannot be restricted by other words, unless the legislative intention to do so is clear and manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the general and encompassing term "taxpayer" must be held to embrace all those subject to tax under Section 267, unless there is proof that the legislature intended to limit the application of this provision to a certain type of taxpayer. However, other than the use of the phrase "delinquent owner" in the second paragraph of Section 267, petitioner has failed to present proof of that intent. Accordingly, this Court should not have gone beyond the plain meaning of the provision. </p><p>In my view, had the legislature intended the deposit requirement to apply only to a delinquent taxpayer, rather than to all taxpayers, it would have used appropriate words to convey this intention. In fact, the legislature utilized a distinct terminology in the two paragraphs of Section 267 to highlight the difference between the conditions imposed in actions seeking the annulment of tax sales. While the deposit requirement in the first paragraph was made applicable to a <em>taxpayer </em>in general, the second one referred specifically to the impairment of the substantive rights of a <em>delinquent owner </em>of real property or a person legally interested therein: </p><blockquote> <p> Sec. 267. Action Assailing Validity of Tax Sale. — <b>No court shall entertain any action assailing the validity of any sale at public auction of real property or rights therein under this Title until <u>the taxpayer</u> shall have deposited with the court the amount for which the real property was sold, together with interest of two percent (2%) per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action.</b> The amount so deposited shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if the deed is declared invalid but it shall be returned to the depositor if the action fails.</p> <p> Neither shall any court declare a sale at public auction invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings <b>unless the substantive rights of the <u>delinquent owner</u> of the real property or the <u>person having legal interest</u> therein have been impaired</b>. (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> There is no reason for the Court to deviate from the language of the statute. Petitioner is a taxpayer under the LGC, and it has initiated an action to annul a tax sale under Book III, Title II of the same code. Hence, it is covered by the language of Section 267 and must be required to comply with the deposit requirement in the first paragraph of the provision.</p><p> The interpretation accorded by the majority to Section 267 has effectively rendered the provision illogical and completely meaningless. The issue of delinquency is a factual matter that may only be resolved after the presentation of evidence of a taxpayer's failure to pay taxes within the period "authorized by law to make such payments without being subjected to the payment of penalties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Since courts are prohibited from entertaining an action to annul a tax sale <i>until </i>the taxpayer pays the required deposit, it would be impossible to hold the proceedings necessary to decide this question prior to compliance with the requirement.</p><p> By allowing the trial court to hold hearings even for the limited purpose of resolving the delinquency issue, the majority has sanctioned a violation of the express command in Section 267 for courts <b>not </b>to entertain an action unless the deposit requirement is first satisfied. Their interpretation of Section 267 has likewise rendered the provision inutile, as it allows litigants to easily circumvent the deposit requirement by the mere expedient of contesting the delinquent status of the property. I cannot agree to this interpretation.</p><p> Accordingly, I hereby <b>DISSENT</b>. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 166-174; penned by Associate Justice Franchito N.
