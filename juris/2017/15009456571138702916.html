City Prosecutor of Manila had no jurisdiction over the case as the alleged crime was committed in Kidapawan City.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated May 13, 2011 in Criminal Case No. 08-265540, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 55, denied petitioner's Motion to Quash, ruling that the ground relied upon by the petitioner in the said motion is not one of those enumerated under Section 3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court for quashing a complaint or information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As to the jurisdictional issue, the RTC ruled that it has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case, citing Section 9 of Republic Act No. 8042<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (RA 8042), which explicitly states that:<br><br><blockquote>A criminal action arising from illegal recruitment as defined herein shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court of the province or city where the offense was committed <b>or where the offended party actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense</b> xxx. <i>(underscoring supplied for emphasis)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Since complainant is a resident of Manila, the RTC ruled that the second ground interposed by the petitioner is devoid of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>In view of the foregoing, the Motion to Quash is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the said Order alleging that she just found out that there were two Informations filed against her, one for Illegal Recruitment in Criminal Case No. 08-265539<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and another for Estafa<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 08-265540. Petitioner maintained that the alleged crimes were committed in Kidapawan City, not in Manila as alleged in the Informations. Petitioner further alleged that there is no showing that respondent is an actual resident of Manila but as per her Reply-Affidavit, Manila is merely her postal address.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Hence, petitioner again raised a jurisdictional issue in the said motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated January 26, 2012, this time in Criminal Cases Nos. 08-265539-40, the RTC reconsidered its May 13, 2011 Order, finding that it had no jurisdiction to try the cases since the crimes of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa were not committed in its territory but in Kidapawan City, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the instant Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Order of this Court dated May 13, 2011 is hereby RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE.<br><br>This case is ordered returned to the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court for proper disposition.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On the same date, the RTC also issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> recalling the warrants of arrest issued against the petitioner, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Considering that this Court has no territorial jurisdiction over the above-entitled cases, the Order of this Court dated December 11, 2008, pertaining to the issuance of Warrants of Arrest against herein accused is hereby cancelled (and) set aside.<br><br>WHEREFORE, let the Warrants of Arrest issued in these cases be ordered RECALLED AND SET ASIDE.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Respondent, through the public prosecutor, then filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the said Order, averring that while it appears in the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) pro-forma complaint affidavit that the alleged recruitment activities took place in Kidapawan City, it also appears in her Reply-Affidavit, that she deposited certain amounts in several banks in Manila for the name and account of petitioner as payments for employment processing and placement fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, part of the essential elements of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa took place in Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Section 9 of RA 8042, above-quoted, which states that an illegal recruitment case may also be filed with the RTC of the province or city where the offended party actually resides at the time of the commission of the crime, was likewise invoked in the said motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Respondent averred that the records show that at the time of the incident up to the present, she resides in Sampaloc, Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed an Opposition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to the said motion. Respondent, through the public prosecutor, filed a Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> thereon and a Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> was then filed by the petitioner.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated March 16, 2012, the RTC denied respondent's motion for reconsideration, ruling that as stated in respondent's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay, </i>the essential elements of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa took place in Kidapawan City and not in Manila. The allegation that several deposits for the payment of the placement fees were made in Manila is of no moment, according to the RTC, considering that the main transaction actually took place in Kidapawan City, which is the basis for determining the jurisdiction of the court. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by the Prosecution is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The Orders of the Court both dated January 26, 2012 still stand.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></center><br><br>Undaunted, respondent filed a <i>Petition for Certiorari </i>before the CA.<br><br>In its assailed Decision, the CA discussed, first, the issue of respondent's legal personality to file the said petition and second, the RTC's jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On the first issue, the CA ruled that while it is only the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) that may represent the People or the State in criminal proceedings before this Court or the CA, the private offended party retains the right to bring a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>in his/her own name in criminal proceedings before the courts of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The CA cited Section 1, Rule 122, which provides that the right to appeal from a final judgment or order in a criminal case is granted to any party except when the accused is placed thereby in double jeopardy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It also cited this Court's ruling that the word party in the said provision must be understood to mean not only the government and the accused, but also other persons who may be affected by the judgment rendered in the criminal proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The private complainant, having an interest in the civil aspect of the case, thus, may file such action in his/her name to question the decision or action of the respondent court on jurisdictional grounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In line with this, the CA also ruled that there is no double jeopardy in this case as the charges were dismissed upon motion of the petitioner-accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>As to the issue on jurisdiction, the CA ruled that the RTC has jurisdiction over the cases of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa, citing Section 9 of RA 8042, which provides that a criminal action arising from illegal recruitment may be filed in the place where the offended party actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> According to the CA, it was established that herein respondent was residing in Sampaloc, Manila at the time of the commission of the crimes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Therefore, the two (2) Informations herein were correctly filed with the RTC of Manila, pursuant to Section 9 of RA 8042.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The CA disposed, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for certiorari is <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed <i>Order </i>dated January 26, 2012 and <i>Resolution </i>dated March 16, 2012 of the RTC, Manila, in Criminal Case No. 08-265539 for <i>estafa </i>and Criminal Case No. 08-265540 for <i>illegal recruitment </i>respectively, are <b>NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE.</b> The cases are <b>REINSTATED and REMANDED</b> to the court of origin for appropriate proceedings.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated November 6, 2013, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the <i>Motion for Reconsideration </i>is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the CA committed a reversible error and grave abuse of discretion in declaring that the respondent had the legal personality to assail the dismissal of the criminal cases as respondent is not the proper party to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Petitioner argues that the OSG is the appellate counsel of the People of the Philippines in all criminal cases and as such, the appeal in the criminal aspect should be taken solely by the State and the private complainant is limited only to the appeal of the civil aspect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> According to the petitioner, respondent's action before the CA does not concern the civil aspect of the case but the validity of the RTC's Orders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On the jurisdictional issue, the petitioner maintains that the RTC of Manila has no jurisdiction over the cases as the alleged acts constituting the crimes charged were committed in Kidapawan City and not in Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>For her part, respondent argues that the argument as regards her legal personality in filing the <i>petition for certiorari </i>before the CA reveals that petitioner misunderstood the difference between an appeal and a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In fact, respondent agrees with the petitioner that only the State, through the OSG, may file an appeal in a criminal case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As an appeal is not available for a private complainant in a criminal case, an independent action through a <i>petition for certiorari </i>under Rule 65, therefore, is available to the said aggrieved party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Anent the jurisdictional issue, respondent again invokes Section 9 of RA 8042 which allows the filing of an action arising from illegal recruitment with the RTC of the complainant's residence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The respondent further argues that as regards the charge of Estafa, considering that the same arose from the illegal recruitment activities, the said provision allows the filing thereof with the court of the same place where the Illegal Recruitment case was filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Besides, according to the respondent, since one of the essential elements of Estafa, <i>i.e., </i>damage or prejudice to the offended party, took place in Manila, as the offended party resides in Manila, the RTC of Manila has jurisdiction over the Estafa case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br><br><blockquote>1) Does the RTC of Manila have jurisdiction over the cases of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa?<br><br>2) Does the respondent, on her own, have legal personality to file the <i>petition for certiorari </i>before the CA?</blockquote><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The issues shall be discussed <i>ad seriatim.</i><br><br><b>The RTC of Manila has jurisdiction over the<br>cases of Illegal Recruitment and Estafa</b><br><br>Indeed, venue in criminal cases is an essential element of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As explained by this Court in the case of <i>Foz, Jr. v. People:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is a fundamental rule that for jurisdiction to be acquired by courts in criminal cases, the offense should have been committed or any one of its essential ingredients took place within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. Territorial jurisdiction in criminal cases is the territory where the court has jurisdiction to take cognizance or to try the offense allegedly committed therein by the accused. Thus it cannot take jurisdiction over a person charged with an offense allegedly committed outside of that limited territory. <b>Furthermore, the jurisdiction of a court over a criminal case is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information. And once it is so shown, the court may validly take cognizance of the case. However, if the evidence adduced during the trial show that the offense was committed somewhere else, the court should dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> <i>(emphasis ours)</i></blockquote><br><br>Section 15(a), Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 15. <i>Place where action is to be instituted. </i>- a) <b>Subject to existing laws,</b> the criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or territory where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients occurred. <i>(emphasis ours)</i></blockquote><br><br>At the risk of being repetitive, Sec. 9 of RA 8042, however, fixed an alternative venue from that provided in Section 15(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, <i>i.e., </i>a criminal action arising from illegal recruitment may also be filed where the offended party actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense and that the court where the criminal action is first filed shall acquire jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Despite the clear provision of the law, the RTC of Manila declared that it has no jurisdiction to try the cases as the illegal Recruitment and Estafa were not committed in its territory but in Kidapawan City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>We are, thus, one with the CA in finding that the RTC of Manila committed grave abuse of discretion and in fact, a palpable error, in ordering the quashal of the Informations. The express provision of the law is clear that the filing of criminal actions arising from illegal recruitment before the RTC of the province or city where the offended party actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense is allowed. It goes without saying that the dismissal of the case on a wrong ground, indeed, deprived the prosecution, as well as the respondent as complainant, of their day in court.<br><br>It has been found by both the RTC and the CA that the respondent resides in Manila; hence, the filing of the case before the RTC of Manila was proper. Thus, the trial court should have taken cognizance of the case, and if it will eventually be shown during trial that the offense was committed somewhere else, then the court should dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[67]</sup></font> As a matter of fact, the RTC is not unaware of the above-cited provision which allows the filing of the said case before the RTC of the city where the offended party resides at the time of the commission of the offense; hence, it originally denied petitioner's Motion to Quash. This Court is, thus, baffled by the fact that the RTC reversed itself upon the petitioner's motion for reconsideration on the same ground that it previously invalidated.<br><br>Likewise, with the case of Estafa arising from such illegal recruitment activities, the outright dismissal thereof due to lack of jurisdiction was not proper, considering that as per the allegations in the Information, the same was within the jurisdiction of Manila. During the preliminary investigation of the cases, respondent even presented evidence that some of the essential elements of the crime were committed within Manila, such as the payment of processing and/or placement fees, considering that these were deposited in certain banks located in Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, it bears stressing that the trial court should have proceeded to take cognizance of the case, and if during the trial it was proven that the offense was committed somewhere else, that is the time that the trial court should dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly, such erroneous outright dismissal of the case is a nullity for want of due process. The prosecution and the respondent as the private offended party were not given the opportunity to present and prosecute their case. Indeed, the prosecution and the private offended party are as much entitled to due process as the accused in a criminal case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><b>The respondent has the legal personality<br>to file a <i>petition for certiorari </i>under Rule 65.</b><br><br>This procedural issue is not novel. There is no question that, generally, the prosecution cannot appeal or bring error proceedings from a judgment rendered in favor of the defendant in a criminal case due to the final and executory nature of a judgment of acquittal and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Despite acquittal, however, the&nbsp; offended party or the accused may appeal, but only with respect to the civil aspect of the decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>This Court has also entertained petitions for <i> certiorari </i> questioning the acquittal of the accused in, or the dismissal of, criminal cases upon clear showing that the lower court, in acquitting the accused, committed not merely errors of judgment but also grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction or a denial of due process, thus rendering the assailed judgment void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> When the order of dismissal is annulled or set aside by an appellate court in an original special civil action via <i> certiorari, </i> the right of the accused against double jeopardy is not violated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In as early as the 1989 case of <i>People v. Santiago,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court has ruled that a private offended party can file a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> questioning the trial court's order acquitting the accused or dismissing the case, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In such special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, wherein it is alleged that the trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or on other jurisdictional grounds, the rules state that the petition may be filed by the person aggrieved. In such case, the aggrieved parties are the State and the private offended party or complainant. The complainant has an interest in the civil aspect of the case so he/she may file such special civil action questioning the decision or action of the respondent court <b>on jurisdictional grounds. In so doing, complainant should not bring the action in the name of the People of Philippines. The action may be prosecuted in the name of said complainant</b>.<i> (emphasis supplied)</i></blockquote><br><br>Moreover, there have been occasions when this Court has allowed the offended party to pursue the criminal action on his/her own behalf, as when there is a denial of due process as in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Indeed, the right of offended parties to appeal or question an order of the trial court which deprives them of due process has always been recognized, the only limitation being that they cannot appeal any adverse ruling if to do so would place the accused in double jeopardy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, We also uphold the CA's finding that double jeopardy does not exist in this case. Inasmuch as the dismissal of the charges by the RTC was done without regard to due process of law, the same is null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It is as if there was no acquittal or dismissal of the case at all, and the same cannot constitute a claim for double jeopardy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Also, it is elementary that double jeopardy attaches only when the following elements concur: (1) the accused is charged under a complaint or information sufficient in form and substance to sustain their conviction; (2) the court has jurisdiction; (3) the accused has been arraigned and has pleaded; and (4) he/she is convicted or acquitted, or the case is dismissed without his/her consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, as found by the CA, double jeopardy does not attach in this case as the dismissal was granted upon motion of the petitioner.
