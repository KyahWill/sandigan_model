Thereafter, two (2) men followed and similarly bought some drinks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>A delivery man from Fastpak suddenly came with a package for Pangan.

The two (2) men who struggled to detain her then returned to the store to continue the search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>After 15 minutes, more police arrived at the store to aid in the search. One (1) of the police officers approached Pangan and told her that her store was being searched.

In the evening of the same day, Tupaz came. Pangan instructed him to go to her store to check the money she had left in a bag on their bed. When Tupaz returned, he informed Pangan that her bag was "in disarray" without the money inside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The next day, Pangan caused the incident to be entered in the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Pangan claimed that the package was sealed when it was delivered. She asserted that she was already inside the vehicle when the search warrant was shown to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> According to her, the search warrant had an inaccurate account of its subject as her true and right name was Emma Bofill, not<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Emma Bofill Pangan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and that the name of her store, Imar Marketing, was not there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Pangan insisted that she did not know Jaime Castro, the indicated sender of the package.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> She asserted that she was not expecting any delivery that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> convicted Pangan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> It found that Pangan had <i>animus possidendi</i> as she appeared to know the contents of the Fastpak package she had received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>It also ruled that Pangan failed to rebut the claim that PO1 Carillo initially conducted a successful test-buy that led to the application for a search warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Considering that Pangan directed PO1 Carillo to return in the afternoon as more supply would allegedly be delivered to her through Fastpak, PO1 Carillo knew precisely what to find during the conduct of the search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, when Pangan realized that she was dealing with police officers, she tried to grab the package. The trial court inferred that if she really knew nothing about its contents, she would not have been concerned with its possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Contrary to Pangan's assertion that the presumption of regularity could not work in favor of the arresting team,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the trial court ruled that the police officers properly carried out their duties during the search, there being no proof of any misdeed or irregularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> It also ruled that although none of the prosecution witnesses testified where the seized articles were marked, this does not automatically mean that the articles were marked elsewhere and not at the place where the items were confiscated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> PO1 Carillo, SPO4 Revisa, and Barangay Kagawad Beluso identified the seized illicit drugs in court as the same ones recovered from Pangan during the implementation of the warrant. Considering that no evidence was presented to establish any improper motive on their part, their testimonies deserve full credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of its Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, accused EMMA BOFILL PANGAN is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of possession of 14.16 grams<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in the afternoon of April 10, 2003 at Roxas City, Philippines without being authorized by law to possess the same, defined and penalized by Section 11 sub paragraph (1), Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and is sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos, Philippine Currency, and the costs of this suit.<br><br>She will be credited with the full term of her detention period.<br><br>The illegal drugs are ordered confiscated to be turned over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for proper disposal.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Pangan appealed the conviction, attesting that the prosecution failed to prove the identity of the confiscated drugs. Allegedly, the police officers failed to observe the guidelines provided for under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. Neither the marking of the confiscated drugs or the signing of the inventory receipt was made in her presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>It found that failure to strictly conform to the requirements of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 does not immediately make the seized drugs inadmissible as evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> provided that the integrity and evidentiary worth of the seized articles were maintained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the Court of Appeals ruled that Pangan's absence during the marking and inventory was justified as she became "hysterical" after the search warrant was read to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Hence, the arresting officers needed to pacify Pangan to prevent her from harming herself and other people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of its Decision provided:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, the appeal filed in this case is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
