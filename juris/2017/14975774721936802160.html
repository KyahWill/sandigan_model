				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The abuse of moral influence is the intimidation required in rape committed by the common-law father of a minor.<br><br>This Court resolves this appeal filed by George Gacusan (Gacusan) from the August 31, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The evidence for the prosecution showed that victim AAA's mother was BBB and CCC was her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> When AAA was asked about her father, she claimed that her deceased father had abandoned them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Gacusan was BBB's common-law partner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> At the onset of their relationship, BBB moved in to Gacusan's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Within eight (8) months of BBB's common-law relationship with Gacusan, she died, leaving AAA an orphan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Even though AAA's paternal grandmother was still alive, AAA opted to stay with Gacusan "as life was harder living with her grandmother than with her stepfather."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>When BBB was still alive, AAA slept in a separate room in Gacusan's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When BBB died, AAA began sleeping beside Gacusan because of her fear of ghosts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>At around 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. of October 14, 2009, "AAA was trying to sleep beside [Gacusan] when" she felt Gacusan's hand touching her private parts inside her shorts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> DDD, Gacusan's 19-year old son, was sleeping on a folding bed in the same room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> AAA said that she did not attempt to remove Gacusan's hand because she was already used to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Gacusan "brought out his penis and inserted it through the leg opening of [AAA]'s shorts.

[S]he was afraid to lose [a] family and she depended on [Gacusan for] support[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> She also claimed that she "was already 15 years old [on the date of the alleged rape] and had been living with [Gacusan] for five years."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> AAA confessed that Gacusan was already molesting her two (2) years after BBB's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The next day after the rape incident, AAA confided to her teacher Aurora Fabia (Fabia).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Fabia informed the school principal, Delia Patalud, of A.ANs story, prompting them to report the case to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Gacusan was then brought to police custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, AAA was brought to the Medical Center of Dagupan City where she was examined by Dr. Marlene Quimoy (Dr. Quimoy).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Medico-Legal Report showed that AAA had multiple lacerations and spermatozoa in her vagina, as corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Quimoy as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>Dr. Quimoy testified that when she examined AAA, she discovered the presence of fresh erythema or redness and slight swelling around AAA's hymen. She explained that erythema [was] consistent with penetrating trauma caused by a finger or a penis. In addition to the erythema found around AAA's hymen, Dr. Quimoy also noted the presence of multiple healed lacerations consistent with infliction of trauma approximately 72 hours to 21 days prior to the examination. Although no fresh lacerations were discovered, Dr. Quimoy revealed that she found spermatozoa inside the vagina of AAA, which may have been caused by a shallow insertion of the penis and ejaculation into the vagina. Having only taken a sample of the sperm cell, Dr. Quimoy admitted that she did not preserve the spermatozoa sample. <b><i>Dr. Quimoy opined that based on her examination, AAA is a victim of sexual abuse.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the defense presented Gacusan as its sole witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He admitted that AAA was his deceased common-law partner's daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Gacusan, however, denied all the accusations against him. He identified his 21 and 15-year old sons and stated that all of them lived in the same house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> He insisted that he treated AAA as his own child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On the date of the rape incident, he claimed that all of them were watching television until 11:00 pm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He also disputed having raped AAA "several times prior to October 14, 2009."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On December 2, 2010, the Regional Trial Court convicted Gacusan of simple rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It found AAA's testimony as credible to establish the sordid acts committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> AAA's testimony was "clear, sincere, spontaneous and candid."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, it found no trace of improper motive for AAA to concoct an accusation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The trial court found that AAA only succumbed to Gacusan's act for fear that she might lose a family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The trial court also ruled that in rape committed by a father to his daughter, it is the father's moral ascendancy that replaces violation and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, this principle "applies in the case of a sexual abuse of a stepdaughter by her stepfather and of a goddaughter by a godfather in the sacrament of confirmation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Furthermore, the medico-legal findings were consistent with AAA's testimony that she was raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Hence, there is a sufficient basis to conclude that the essential requisites of carnal knowledge have been established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused <b>GEORGE GACUSAN GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of simple rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code as amended by [Republic Act No.] 8353 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <b>reclusion perpetua</b>.

The parties were then ordered to file their supplemental briefs, should they desire, within 30 days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On October 24, 2013, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated October 23, 2013 on behalf of the People of the Philippines stating that it would no longer file a supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> A similar manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> was filed by the Public Attorney's Office on behalf of accused-appellant Gacusan.<br><br>The sole issue for resolution is whether Gacusan's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the alleged failure of the prosecution to prove that Gacusan employed force, threat, or intimidation in raping AAA.<br><br>Gacusan claims that the employment of force, threat, or intimidation under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code was not satisfactorily proven by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>He insists that only when the offended party is either under twelve (12) years of age or is demented that the elements of force, threat or intimidation may be dispensed with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Since it was admitted that AAA was already fifteen (15) years old at the time of the alleged rape, the prosecution should have proven that the incident was accompanied by force, threat, or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Gacusan also asserts that he was unarmed and AAA just "let him do what he wanted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, he concludes:<br><blockquote>She, in effect, <b><i>consented to [Gacusan's] advances, inasmuch as, according to her, she was used to it as he always did it or he had done it many times before</i></b>. After the advances subsided, according to her again, she stood up to urinate and then went back to sleep-just the same­ beside him. She did not cry. She did not protest. She did not complain. She did not exhibit any sign of pain or physical suffering. She just went back to bed and slept, beside him, again, as if nothing happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General claims that Gacusan's argument has no merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It cites <i>People v. Corpuz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> which states that "[i]n rape committed by a close kin, such as the victim's father, stepfather, uncle, or the common-law spouse of her mother, it is not necessary that actual force or intimidation be employed; moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence or intimidation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It further asserts that "AAA's failure to show outward signs of resistance to appellant's sexual advances" does not equate to consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus,<br><blockquote>She was an orphan young girl, who was much insecure and embattled. In her misfortune, she tried to hang on with what little form of security and stability she could conceive. Unfortunately, it was under her so called savior's hand that her childhood innocence was torn apart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, it cites <i>People v.
