No. 201530</u></b><br><br><b><i>An application for tax abatement is considered approved only upon the issuance of a termination letter.</i></b><br><br>Section 204(B)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) empowers the CIR to abate or cancel a tax liability.<br><br>On Septembr 27, 2006 the BIR issued RR No. 15-06 prescribing tho guidelines on the implementation of the one-time administrative abatement of all penalties/surcharges and interest on delinquent accounts and assessments (preliminary or final, disputed or not) as of June 30, 2006. Section 4 of RR No. 15-06 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. <i>Who May Avail</i>. - Any person/taxpayer, natural or juridical, may settle thru this abatement program any delinquent account or assessment which has been released as of June 30, 2006, by paying an amount equal to One Hundred Percent (100%) of the Basic Tax assessed with the Accredited Agent Bank (AAB) of the Revenue District Office (RDO)/Large Taxpayers Service (LTS)/Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) that has jurisdiction over the taxpayer. In the absence of an AAB, payment may be made with the Revenue Collection Officer/Deputized Treasurer of the RDO that has jurisdiction over the taxpayer. After payment of the basic tax, the assessment for penalties/surcharge and interest shall be cancelled by the concerned BIR Office following existing rules and procedures. Thereafter, the docket of the case shall be fmwarded to the Office of the Commissioner, thru the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Group, for issuance of Termination Letter.<br></blockquote>Based on the guidelines, the last step in the tax abatement process is the issuance of the termination letter. The presentation of the termination letter is essential as it proves that the taxpayer's application for tax abatement has been approved. Thus, without a termination letter, a tax assessment cannot be considered closed and terminated.<br><br>In this case, Asiatrust failed to present a termination letter from the BIR. Instead, it presented a Certification issued by the BIR to prove that it availed of the Tax Abatement Program and paid the basic tax. It also attached copies of its BIR<br><br>'I'ax Payment Deposit Slips and a letter issued by RDO Nacar. These documents, however, do not prove that Asiatrust's application for tax abatement has been approved. If at all, these documents only prove Asiatrust's payment of basic taxes, which is not a ground to consider its deficiency tax assessment closed and terminated.<br><br>Since no tennination letter has been issued by the BIR, there is no reason tor the Court to consider as closed and terminated the tax assessment on Asiatrust's fmal withholding tax for fiscal year ending June 30, 1998. Asiatrust's application for tax abatement will be deemed approved only upon the issuance of a termination letter, and only then will the deficiency tax assessment be considered closed and terminated. However, in case Asiatrust's application for tax abatement is denied, any payment made by it would be applied to its out ding tax liability. For this reason, Asiatrust's allegation of double taxation must also fail.<br><br>Thus, the Court finds no error on the part of the CTA <i>En Banc</i> in affirming the said tax assessment.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 201680-81</u></b><br><br><b><i>An appeal to the CTA En Banc must be preceded by the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration or new trial with the CTA Division.</i></b><br><br>Section 1, Rule 8 of the Revised Rules of the CTA states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Review of cases in the Court en banc</i>. - In cases falling under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court en banc, the petition for review of a decision or resolution of the Court in Division must be preceded by the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration or new trial With the pivision.<br></blockquote>Thus, in order for the CTA <i>En Banc</i> to take cognizance of an appeal <i>via</i> a petition for review, a timely motion for reconsideration or new trial must first be filed with the CTA Division that issued the assailed decision or resolution.
