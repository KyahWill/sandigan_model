				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A perceived abuse cannot be cured by an abuse. Administrative agencies, such as the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), are not courts of law exercising judicial power. The power to issue writs of certiorari is an incident of judicial review. Thus, administrative agencies may not issue writs of certiorari to annul acts of officers or state organs even when they exercise supervisory authority over these officers or organs.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure praying that the assailed July 23, 2012 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and January 9, 2013 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals be reversed and set aside.

Zoleta, Venancio Q. Zoleta, and Milagros Q. Zoleta-Garcia (petitioners). This Decision found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of DARAB in issuing a resolution granting Landbank's Petition for Certiorari against an order and alias writ of execution issued by Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) Conchita C.

In doing so, this Court emphasized that jurisdiction over the subject matter must be provided by law. It noted that there was no law that vested DARAB with jurisdiction over petitions for <i>certiorari. </i>Rather than finding constitutional or statutory basis, DARAB's supposed <i>certiorari </i>power was provided only by its own rules of procedure:<br><br><blockquote>Jurisdiction, or the legal power to hear and determine a cause or causes of action, must exist as a matter of law. It is settled that the authority to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus involves the exercise of original jurisdiction which must be expressly conferred by the Constitution or by law. It is never derived by implication. Indeed, while the power to issue the writ of certiorari is in some instance conferred on all courts by constitutional or statutory provisions, ordinarily, the particular courts which have such power are expressly designated.<br><br>....<br><br>In general, the quantum of judicial or quasi-judicial powers which an administrative agency may exercise is defined in the enabling act of such agency. In other words, the extent to which an administrative entity may exercise such powers depends largely, if not wholly, on the provisions of the statute creating or empowering such agency. The grant of original jurisdiction on a quasi-judicial agency is not implied. There is no question that the legislative grant of adjudicatory powers upon the DAR, as in all other quasi-judicial agencies, bodies and tribunals, is in the nature of a limited and special jurisdiction, that is, the authority to hear and determine a class of cases within the DAR's competence and field of expertise. In conferring adjudicatory powers and functions on the DAR, the legislature could not have intended to create a regular court of justice out of the DARAB, equipped with all the vast powers inherent in the exercise of its jurisdiction. The DARAB is only a quasi-judicial body, whose limited jurisdiction does not include authority over petitions for certiorari, in the absence of an express grant in R.A. No. 6657, E.O. No. 229 and E.O. No. 129-A.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>This Court calibrates the pronouncements made in <i>Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board v. Lubrica. </i>It is true that the lack of an express constitutional or statutory grant of jurisdiction disables DARAB&nbsp; from exercising <i>certiorari </i>powers. Apart from this, however, is a more fundamental reason for DARAB's disability.<br><br>As an administrative agency exercising quasi-judicial but not consummate judicial power, DARAB is inherently incapable of issuing writs of <i>certiorari. </i>This is not merely a matter of statutorily stipulated competence but a question that hearkens to the separation of government's tripartite powers: executive, legislative, and judicial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>Conceived in England, transplanted into our jurisdiction during American occupation, and presently existing under the 1987 Constitution, the remedy of the writ of certiorari was and remains a means for superior <i>judicial </i>bodies to undo the excesses of inferior tribunals.<br><br>The writ of <i>certiorari </i>was a prerogative writ "issued by the King by virtue of his position as fountain of justice and supreme head of the whole judicial administration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The King of England was considered the "supreme head of the nation with power over life, limb, and property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, this status did not initially give him the absolute power to pronounce judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> By the tradition carried over in the transition of Anglo-Saxon chieftains "from the ducal to the royal dignity,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the power to pronounce judgment was reserved to the members of the community themselves, "in accordance with the Teutonic institution of popular courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The power that the King held was the appointment of persons, called sheriffs, "who[,] as royal representatives[,] called the popular courts together; to see that justice was rendered in case of its denial; personally to judge those powerful litigants who could not be controlled by the popular courts; and to execute or have executed the sentences of the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Despite these limitations on his right to pronounce judgment, the King reserved the power to decide on certain cases: first, those which affected the crown, such as criminal cases for violation of the King's peace; and second, cases involving the revenue.

The errors were of such a nature that, if allowed to stand, they would result in a substantial injury to the petitioner to whom no other remedy was available. If the inferior court acted without authority, the record was then revised and corrected in matters of law. The writ of <i>certiorari </i>was limited to cases in which the inferior court was said to be exceeding its jurisdiction or was not proceeding according to essential requirements of law and would lie only to review judicial or quasi-judicial acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>The United States of America carried this English tradition.

Climax Mining Ltd.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> explained the concept of a judicial question, provided an illustration of a controversy that involved a judicial question, and distinguished that example from another controversy that did not involve a judicial question:<br><br><blockquote>A judicial question is a question that is proper for determination by the courts, as opposed to a moot question or one properly decided by the executive or legislative branch. <i>A judicial question is raised when the determination of the question involves the exercise of a judicial function; that is, the question involves the determination of what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are with respect to the matter in controversy.</i><br><br>....<br><br>[W]hether the case involves void or voidable contracts is still a judicial question. It may, in some instances, involve questions of fact especially with regard to the determination of the circumstances of the execution of the contracts. But the resolution of the validity or voidness of the contracts remains a legal or judicial question as it requires the exercise of judicial function. <i>It requires the ascertainment of what laws are applicable to the dispute, the interpretation and application of those laws, and the rendering of a judgment based thereon. </i>Clearly, the dispute is not a mining conflict. It is essentially judicial. The complaint was not merely for the determination of rights under the mining contracts since the very validity of those contracts is put in issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>The non-judicial "mining conflict" which <i>Gonzales </i>referenced was explained to be a factual or technical dispute that was more properly considered an "administrative matter," rather than a judicial question:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, a mining dispute is a dispute involving (a) rights to mining areas, (b) mineral agreements, FTAAs, or permits, and (c) surface owners, occupants and claimholders/concessionaires. Under Republic Act No. 7942 (otherwise known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995), the Panel of Arbitrators has exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide these mining disputes. The Court of Appeals, in its questioned decision, correctly stated that the Panel's jurisdiction is limited only to those mining disputes which raise questions of fact or matters requiring the application of technological knowledge and experience.<br><br>In <i>Pearson v. Intermediate Appellate Court, </i>this Court observed that the trend has been to make the adjudication of mining cases a purely administrative matter. Decisions of the Supreme Court on mining disputes have recognized a distinction between (1) the primary powers granted by pertinent provisions of law to the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (and the bureau directors) of an executive or administrative nature, such as granting of license, permits, lease and contracts, or approving, rejecting, reinstating or canceling applications, or deciding conflicting applications, and (2) controversies or disagreements of civil or contractual nature between litigants which are questions of a judicial nature that may be adjudicated only by the courts of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Administrative agencies are created to aid the government in the regulation of the country's "ramified activities."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The creation of these agencies has become necessary because of "the growing complexity of the modern society."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> These agencies are considered specialists, which "can deal with the problems [in their respective fields] with more expertise and dispatch than can be expected from the legislature or the courts of justice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Administrative agencies are part of the executive branch of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> However, due to their highly specialized nature, they are not only vested executive powers but also with quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Quasi-judicial power is "the power to hear and determine <i>questions of fact </i>to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> It is limited to the adjudication of the rights of the parties that are <i>incidental </i>to the agency's functions under the law.

Unlike the 1989 and 1994 Rules, the 2003 and 2009 Rules no longer made reference to <i>certiorari </i>as the Board's vehicle for reviewing decisions of RARADs and PARADs. Instead, they merely stated that, in pursuit of its appellate jurisdiction, the Board has the power to "review, reverse, modify, alter, or affirm resolutions, orders and decisions of the Adjudicators."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br><center><b>V</b></center><br><br>The DARAB May 12, 2006 Resolution subject of the present appeal, which gave rise to the assailed Court of Appeals July 23, 2012 Decision, was issued in response to a pleading specifically denominated as a "petition for certiorari" by respondent Landbank:<br><br><blockquote>This is a petition for certiorari pursuant to paragraph 2, Section 3, Rule VIII of the DARAB New Rules of Procedure seeking to annul and set aside the Order dated January 16, 2001 (sic) as well as the Alias Writ of Execution dated February 15, 2000 issued by respondent RARAD Miñas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In conformity with the relief sought by Landbank's petition for <i>certiorari, </i>the DARAB May 12, 2006 Resolution "annulled" the January 16, 2001 Order and the February 15, 2001 Alias Writ of Execution issued by Regional Adjudicator Miñas:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby GRANTED.

The latter two exercise "delegated authority," while the first exercises appellate jurisdiction over resolutions, orders, decisions and other dispositions of the RARAD and the PARAD.</blockquote><br><br>In other words, respondent DARAB which has appellate jurisdiction over the resolutions and orders of RARAD and PARAD acted within the ambit of law when it annulled the highly irregular orders of the regional adjudicator allowing the issuance of a writ of execution for the purpose of enforcing the latter's October 3, 2000 Decision notwithstanding the glaring fact that the same has not yet become final and executory in view of [Landbank]'s appeal to the Special Agrarian Court in Lucena concerning the issue on the determination of the correct value of the just compensation of the subject property. The Supreme Court recognizes the supervisory authority of the DARAB over its delegates, namely, the RARADs and PARADs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Court of Appeals may have been correct in noting that DARAB has supervisory authority over RARADs, but it was mistaken in using it as basis for sanctioning DARAB's exercise of <i>certiorari </i>powers.<br><br>In <i>Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board v. Lubrica,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> DARAB similarly pleaded its authority over and supervision of RARADs as crafting an exception to the need for an express constitutional or statutory grant of jurisdiction. This Court rebuffed DARAB's reasoning:<br><br><blockquote>DARAB takes exception to the general rule that jurisdiction over special civil actions must be expressly conferred by law before a court or tribunal can take cognizance thereof. It believes that this principle is applicable only in cases where the officials/entities contemplated to be subject thereof are not within the administrative power/competence, or in any manner under the control or supervision, of the issuing authority.<br><br>This Court is not persuaded. The function of a writ of certiorari is to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction. In the instant case, the RARAD issued the order of finality and the writ of execution upon the belief that its decision had become final and executory, as authorized under Section 1, Rule XII of the DARAB Rules of Procedure. It is worth noting that in its petition, DARAB maintains that in preventing the RARAD from implementing its decision, it merely "exercised its residual power of supervision, to insure that the RARAD acted within the bounds of delegated authority and/or prevent/avoid her from committing grave and serious disservice to the Program." DARAB's action, therefore, is a rectification of what it perceived as an abuse of the RARAD's jurisdiction. By its own admission, DARAB took upon itself the power to correct errors of jurisdiction which is ordinarily lodged with the regular courts by virtue of express constitutional grant or legislative enactments.<br><br>This Court recognizes the supervisory authority of the DARAB over its delegates, namely, the RARADs and PARADs, but the same should be exercised within the context of administrative supervision and/or control. In the event that the RARADs or PARADs act beyond its adjudicatory functions, nothing prevents the aggrieved party from availing of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, which is ordinarily within the jurisdiction of the regular courts.<br><br>That the statutes allowed the DARAB to adopt its own rules of procedure does not permit it with unbridled discretion to grant itself jurisdiction ordinarily conferred only by the Constitution or by law. Procedure, as distinguished from jurisdiction, is the means by which the power or authority of a court to hear and decide a class of cases is put into action. Rules of procedure are remedial in nature and not substantive. They cover only rules on pleadings and practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>DARAB's reasoning failed to impress then; the same reasoning fails to impress now.<br><br>Not only are mere procedural rules incapable of supplanting a constitutional or statutory grant of jurisdiction, no amount of textual wrangling negates the basic truth that DARAB is an administrative agency belonging to the Executive, and not to the Judicial branch, of our government.<br><br>Determining whether an action was made without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion is a judicial question. In a petition for certiorari where these issues are raised, the public officers or state organs exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers are impleaded as respondents. They themselves become party-litigants and it is their own legal rights that are the subject of adjudication. A consideration of law is impelled to delineate their proper rights and prerogatives. The controversy that ensues is inexorably beyond the competence of administrative agencies. When presented with such a controversy, an administrative agency must recuse and yield to courts of law.<br><br>Well-meaning intentions at rectifying a perceived breach of authority cannot be cured by an actual breach of authority. As It was in <i>DARAB v. Lubrica, </i>so it is true here that DARAB's avowed good intentions cannot justify its exercise of powers that were never meant for it to exercise.<br><br>DARAB's exercise of the innately judicial <i>certiorari </i>power is an executive encroachment into the judiciary. It violates the separation of powers; it is unconstitutional.<br><br>With or without a law enabling it, DARAB has no power to rule on jurisdictional controversies via petitions for <i>certiorari. </i>DARAB's self-serving grant to itself of the power to issue writs of certiorari in the 1994 DARAB New Rules of Procedure is itself a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. It must be annulled for running afoul of the Constitution.<br><br><center><b>VI</b></center><br><br>It should suffice, to settle the present controversy, for us to state, as this Court did, that under no circumstance may an administrative agency arrogate unto itself the power of judicial review and to take cognizance of petitions for <i>certiorari. </i>However, it does not also escape our attention that the predicament that respondent Landbank finds itself in is no less the result of its own unrefined legal maneuver.<br><br>Landbank rendered ineffectual its own immediate recourse to the Special Agrarian Court. Before the Special Agrarian Court, it sought to restrain the looming actions of DARAB, acting through its RARAD, to enforce a judgment. Despite this, it still failed to implead DARAB as a respondent. Landbank's own oversight left the Special Agrarian Court with no reasonable recourse but the denial of Landbank's plea.<br><br>Failing at obtaining relief from the Special Agrarian Court, Landbank sought relief from an entirely different forum. Strikingly, this new forum is the same entity that it should have first impleaded as an adverse party before the Special Agrarian Court.

Lubrica </i>also stated:<br><br>The function of a writ of <i>certiorari </i>is to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction. In the instant case, the RARAD issued the order of finality and the writ of execution upon the belief that its decision had become final and executory, as authorized under Section 1, Rule XII of the DARAB Rules of Procedure. It is worth noting that in its petition, DARAB maintains that in preventing the RARAD from implementing its decision, it merely "exercised its residual power of supervision, to insure that the RARAD acted within the bounds of delegated authority and/or prevent/avoid her from committing grave and serious disservice to the Program." DARAB's action, therefore, is a rectification of what it perceived as an abuse of the RARAD's jurisdiction. By its own admission, DARAB took upon itself the power to correct errors of jurisdiction which is ordinarily lodged with the regular courts by virtue of express constitutional grant or legislative enactments. This Court recognizes the supervisory authority of the DARAB over its delegates, namely, the RARADs and PARADs, but the same should be exercised within the context of administrative supervision and/or control. In the event that the RARADs or PARADs act beyond its adjudicatory functions, nothing prevents the aggrieved party from availing of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, which is ordinarily within the jurisdiction of the regular courts.<br><br>That the statutes allowed the DARAB to adopt its own rules of procedure does not permit it with unbridled discretion to grant itself jurisdiction ordinarily conferred only by the Constitution or by law. Procedure, as distinguished from jurisdiction, is the means by which the power or authority of a court to hear and decide a class of cases is put into action. Rules of procedure are remedial in nature and not substantive. They cover only rules on pleadings and practice. (Citations omitted)<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Frank J.
