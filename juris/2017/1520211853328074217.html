				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is an appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed under Section 13, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 2, 2014 (assailed Decision) of the Court of Appeals (CA), First Division in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 05496. The assailed Decision affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated February 22, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Cavite City, Branch 88 (RTC), in Crim. Case No. 160-09, finding herein accused-appellant Paul M. Duran, Jr. (Duran) guilty of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).<p> The Information charging Duran with Murder states as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>That on or about the 9<sup>th</sup> day of January, 2009, in the Municipality of Rosario, Cavite, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, using an unlicensed firearm, employing treachery and nocturnity, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot GILBERT GRIMALDO Y NERA on the back of his head and thereafter as the victim lay helpless and wounded on the ground with abuse of superior strength shot him another three times, inflicting upon the latter multiple gunshot wounds which cause (sic) his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of the latter's heirs.</i></p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Upon his arraignment, Duran entered a plea of "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p align="center"> <i>The Facts </i> </p><p> <i>Version of the Prosecution</i></p><p> The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: Beverly C. Quilana (Quilana), eyewitness; Berly L. Grimaldo (Mrs. Grimaldo), the widow of the victim, Gilbert N. Grimaldo (Grimaldo), and Dr. Jocelyn Dignos (Dr. Dignos), the municipal health officer who performed the autopsy on the victim.</p><p> Quilana's testimony, as summarized by the RTC, is as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Beverly C. Quilana testified that on January 9, 2009 at around 1:48 in the morning, she was awakened by someone calling for her, uttering "Ninang". At that time she was inside her house located in Ligtong 3, Rosario, Cavite. She recognized the voice of the person as her godson named Gilbert Grimaldo. She then asked why. Grimaldo replied from outside saying "Ninang tulungan mo ako yung taong ito ay kinukursunada ako," "kinukursunada ako ng taong ito, me dala siyang baril". Then she opened the door for her godson. She then saw the accused Paul Duran shot Grimaldo with a .38 caliber revolver from behind at a distance of 2 1/2 feet. Grimaldo was hit at the nape, and then fell to the ground lying with his face down. Duran then left the place passing between their houses. Moments later accused returned and shot Grimaldo three more times to make sure that the latter was dead. Witness then started shouting and asking for help. At this point in time, witness saw the accused Duran ran away. They then called the police. According to this witness, Grimaldo was hit on the nape, back and head.</p> <p> Witness further clarified that Grimaldo did not know that Duran was behind him because he was surprised when he was shot.</p> <p> Witness identified the accused in open court. She is familiar with the accused for they were neighbors for six (6) years. She clarified, that she was able to see the accused because the place was illuminated by a fluorescent bulb placed outside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Mrs. Grimaldo's testimony was stipulated upon and dispensed with as her testimony covered only her claim for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Dr. Dignos' testimony regarding the autopsy, the findings as to the cause of death and nature, location, and gravity of the injuries sustained by the victim, and the preparation and issuance of the death certificate, were also stipulated upon and admitted by the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p align="center"> <i>Version of the Defense</i> </p><p> Duran invoked self-defense. His testimony, as summarized by the RTC, is as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Witness testified that he used to peddle fish in Rosario, Cavite. On January 9, 2009 at around 2:15 to 2:45 a.m. while on his way to buy fish in Para√±aque, he was blocked by two persons whose identity he did not know. One of this (<em>sic</em>) men who turned out to be the victim Gilbert Grimaldo poked a gun at him, and said that they only needed his money. That when Grimaldo attempted to get the money from his belt bag, he was able to hold the victim's right hand which was then holding the gun. Grimaldo then used his left hand to box his nape. Then they wrestled for the possession of the gun for more or less thirty seconds. Then he (Duran) was able to take the gun away from Grimaldo. When Grimaldo moved backward, he pulled the trigger of the gun and hit Grimaldo. At that time he was worried that the other guy might retaliate and that's the reason why he was able to pull the trigger of the .38 caliber revolver gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Ruling of the RTC</i> </p><p> The RTC found Duran guilty of the crime of Murder, qualified by treachery, and sentenced him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In arriving at its decision, the trial court ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> Like alibi, self-defense is inherently a weak defense and can easily be fabricated. When the accused interposes self-defense, he thereby admits having caused the injuries of the victim. The burden of proof then shifts on him to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, the confluence of the essential requisites for such a defense, namely: a.) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; b.) reasonable necessity of the means employed and to prevent or repel it; and c.) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. The accused must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the prosecution's, for even if the latter is weak, it cannot be disbelieved after the accused has admitted the killing xxx.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> This Court is convinced that there was no unlawful aggression. Assuming that Grimaldo and his unidentified companion really tried to hold-up Duran, the latter's testimony shows that the aggression had already ceased when he (Duran) was able to successfully take the gun from the possession of Grimaldo.</p> <p> Having now the possession of the gun, there was obviously no reason for him to shoot the victim successively because the unlawful aggression from the victim has stopped. Duran by his own admission stated that he shot Grimaldo four times. Hence, no unlawful aggression by the victim was shown. Be it remembered that the presence of said primary requisite is a condition sine qua non of the justifying circumstance of self-defense. Absent such, there could be no self[-] defense to speak of. The other two requisites need not be discussed.</p> <p> On the part of the prosecution, it clearly proved the presence of intent to kill on the part of the accused. The fact that the shots fired by the accused were directed to the vital body parts of the victim, namely on the head and the chest, shows intent to kill.</p> <p> In addition thereto, the testimony of eye witness Quilana is very credible. Witness saw vividly how the shooting incident happened, who the victim was - Gilbert Grimaldo and the perpetrator of the crime - herein accused Paul Duran.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> The qualifying circumstance of treachery is present in this case because accused shot the victim in a manner that the latter would not be able to defend himself, and the location and severity of the wounds inflicted on the victim belies the claim of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Duran was further ordered to pay the heirs of the victim One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) as moral damages and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) in exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> Duran appealed to the CA via Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated March 12, 2012. Duran then filed his Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated September 25, 2012, while the plaintiff-appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed its Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated February 4, 2013. Thereafter, the appeal was submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> <i>Ruling of the CA</i></p><p> The CA affirmed Duran's conviction<em> in toto</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On June 26, 2014, Duran brought the instant case before this Court via Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of even date. </p><p> In lieu of supplemental briefs, Duran and plaintiff-appellee filed separate manifestations respectively dated April 13, 2015<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and April 15, 2015,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> foregoing their right to file the same. </p><p align="center"> <i>Issue</i> </p><p> Whether or not Duran's guilt for the crime of Murder was proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p align="center"> <i>The Court's Ruling </i> </p><p> The appeal is partly meritorious. </p><p> <i>There was no unlawful aggression</i></p><p> An accused who pleads self-defense admits the commission of the act charged as a crime. The burden of proving self-defense rests on the accused. He must prove by clear and convincing evidence the concurrence of the following elements: (1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself or at least any provocation executed by the accused claiming self-defense was not the proximate and immediate cause of the victim's aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Unlawful aggression is an indispensable element of self-defense. Without unlawful aggression, self-defense cannot and will not be appreciated, even if the other elements are present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As held in <em>People v. Dolorido</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> Unlawful aggression is an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury, upon a person. In case of threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the wrongful intent to cause injury. It "presupposes actual, sudden, unexpected or imminent danger - not merely threatening and intimidating action." It is present "only when the one attacked faces real and immediate threat to one's life." x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>People v. Nugas</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court expounded on the kinds of unlawful aggression: </p><blockquote> <p> Unlawful aggression is of two kinds: (<em>a</em>) actual or material unlawful aggression; and (<em>b</em>) imminent unlawful aggression. Actual or material unlawful aggression means an attack with physical force or with a weapon, an offensive act that positively determines the intent of the aggressor to cause the injury. Imminent unlawful aggression means an attack that is impending or at the point of happening; it must not consist in a mere threatening attitude, nor must it be merely imaginary, but must be offensive and positively strong (like aiming a revolver at another with intent to shoot or opening a knife and making a motion as if to attack). Imminent unlawful aggression must not be a mere threatening attitude of the victim, such as pressing his right hand to his hip where a revolver was holstered, accompanied by an angry countenance, or like aiming to throw a pot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The Court agrees with the RTC and CA that Duran was unable to prove the presence of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. Even if Duran's account of an attempted robbery against him is to be believed, his testimony also shows that Grimaldo, albeit the initial aggressor, ceased to be the aggressor as Duran had successfully wrested the weapon from him. Thereafter, Duran shot the gun at Grimaldo four times; three of which hit Grimaldo on vital parts of his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> At this moment, actions of the accused were already done in retaliation and not self-defense. In retaliation, the aggression initiated by the victim had already ceased when the accused attacked him; in self-defense, the aggression from the victim is continuing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> Duran's own testimony is illustrative of the absence of unlawful aggression: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><b>[Atty.

As admitted by Duran himself, the unlawful aggression from Grimaldo had ceased when he had been disarmed and had been shot.

Time and again, this Court has held that when an unlawful aggression that has begun has ceased to exist, the one who resorts to self-defense has no right to kill or even to wound the former aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Aggression, if not continuous, does not constitute aggression warranting defense of one's self.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The condition<em> sine qua non</em> of unlawful aggression being absent, self-defense cannot be appreciated in favor of the accused.</p> <p> <i>The prosecution failed to prove treachery</i></p><p> The Court modifies the findings of the RTC as affirmed by the CA, with regard to the qualifying circumstance of treachery. Under Article 14, paragraph 16 of the RPC, there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means and methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend to directly and specially ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make. To qualify an offense, the following conditions must exist: (1) the assailant employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the criminal act which give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (2) said means, methods or forms of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted by the assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission without risk of himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> It was error for the RTC to rule that treachery was present as said finding is not supported by the evidence. Moreover, the RTC did not fully discuss its appreciation of the circumstance of treachery. The trial court merely held: </p><blockquote> <p>x x x <b>[T]reachery is present in this case because accused shot the victim in a manner that the latter would not be able to defend himself</b>, and the location and severity of the wounds inflicted on the victim belies the claim of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Treachery must be unequivocally proven as the crime itself. As held in the case of <i>People v. Obzunar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x<strong> It is an almost immutable rule of evidence that treachery must be proven as clearly as the crime itself, and "absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded, as in this case, treachery cannot be appreciated.</strong>" The prosecution's sole eyewitness Lydia Zilmar saw what transpired only from the time the victim was already being chased by the accused-appellants. Hence, not having seen how the assailants commenced the execution of the felony, she gave no testimony as to, and there is no sufficient evidence available to prove conclusively, the use of treachery in the commission thereof. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The prosecution did not prove that Duran intentionally sought the victim for the purpose of killing him. The confrontation between Duran and Grimaldo appears to have been a chance encounter. It was also not proven that Duran deliberately and consciously employed means, methods, or forms in the execution of the criminal act to ensure that Grimaldo could not defend himself. </p><p> In <i>People v. Caratao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Repeatedly upheld has been the rule that chance encounters, impulse killing or crimes committed at the spur of the moment, x x x are generally not attended by treachery, for lack of opportunity of the accused deliberately to employ a treacherous mode of attack. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Notably, eyewitness Quilana only witnessed the moment of the actual shooting but did not witness the inception of the fatal altercation. The prosecution failed to establish that Duran had deliberately adopted a treacherous mode of attack for the purpose of depriving the victim of a chance to fight or retreat. In this case, Grimaldo was aware of the impending attack and was even able to seek help from eyewitness Quilana. </p><p> As the Court held in <em>People v. Latag</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> Treachery cannot be presumed where the lone witness has not actually seen the commencement of the attack, as we held in <em>People v. Narit</em>: </p> <blockquote> <p> "x x x [Treachery] cannot be presumed; it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself. For, as held in <em>U.S. vs. Perdon</em> where no particulars are known as to the manner in which aggression was made or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed, it can in no way be established from mere suppositions, drawn from circumstances prior to the very moment of the aggression, that an accused perpetrated the killing with treachery. <b>Accordingly, treachery cannot be considered where the lone witness did not see the commencement of the assault."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In the case of<em> People v. Rapanut</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> xxx <b>[W]here the lone eyewitness did not see how the attack was carried out and he can not testify on how it began, the trial court cannot merely surmise from the circumstances of the case that treachery attended the commission of the crime.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, there was no other circumstance attendant to the shooting that shows that Duran carefully and deliberately planned the killing in a manner that would ensure his safety and success. It was not proven that he had deliberately chosen the place, time, and method of killing, or that the meeting between him and Grimaldo was planned. In fact, the location was disadvantageous to him, as it was right in front of the house of Quilana, Grimaldo's godmother. </p><p> The prosecution had attempted to prove treachery with the testimony of Quilana who stated that Duran had shot Grimaldo from behind. Thereafter, he left the crime scene yet returned to shoot Duran three more times. However, upon questions from the Court, the statement was clarified: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>COURT [(clarificatory questions for eyewitness Quilana)]:</b></p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="96%"> <div align="justify">What do you mean returned, you mean to say that after shooting Gilbert Grimaldo this Paul Duran left away and then returned later on?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor, he made sure that this Gilbert was already dead.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Where did Paul Duran go after shooting Gilbert Grimaldo at the nape?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">In between our houses, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">x x x x </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Between your house and whose house? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And my nephew's house, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And how far is that spot from the place where he shot Gilbert Grimaldo?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>One step away only, your Honor.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">So Paul Duran made one step back and then moved forward again to shoot Gilbert Grimaldo?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Quilana's testimony that Duran left and "returned" after shooting Grimaldo is contradicted by her own testimony that Duran only made one step.

Thus, Duran's testimony that he was able to wound Grimaldo twice in the front and once in the back is consistent with the Post-Mortem Report.</p> <p> Generally, findings of fact of the trial courts are accorded great weight, particularly in the determination of credibility of witnesses as said courts have the opportunity to observe the witness and the manner in which they testified.
