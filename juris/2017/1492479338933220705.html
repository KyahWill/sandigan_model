Yap Chua's objections, passed a Board Resolution indefinitely postponing Alliance's&nbsp; 2015 ASM pending complete subscription to its Stock Rights Offering (SRO) consisting of shares with total value of Pl Billion which was earlier approved in a Board Resolution passed on February 17, 2015. As per Alliance's Disclosure dated May 29, 2015 filed before the Philippine Stock Exchange, such postponement was made "to give the stockholders of [Alliance] better representation in the annual meeting, after taking into consideration their subscription to the [SRO] of [Alliance]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; This prompted Harvest All,<i> et al.</i> to file the instant Complaint (with Application for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and Temporary Restraining&nbsp; Order/Writ&nbsp; of Preliminary&nbsp; Injunction)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; involving&nbsp; an&nbsp; intraÂ­-corporate&nbsp; controversy&nbsp; against&nbsp; Alliance, and&nbsp; its other&nbsp; Board&nbsp; members, namely, George E. Sycip, Jonathan Y. Dee, Raymund K.H. See, Mary Grace T. Vera- Cruz, Antonio C. Pacis, Erwin M. Elechicon, and Barbara Anne C. Migallos (Alliance Board). In said complaint, Harvest All,<i> et al</i>. principally claimed that the subscription to the new shares through the SRO cannot be made a condition precedent to the exercise by the current stockholders of their right to vote in the 2015 ASM; otherwise, they will be deprived of their full&nbsp; voting&nbsp; rights&nbsp; proportionate&nbsp; to&nbsp; their&nbsp; existing&nbsp; shareholdings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thus, Harvest All,<i> et al.</i>, prayed for,<i> inter alia,</i> the declaration of nullity of the Board Resolution dated May&nbsp; 29, 2015&nbsp; indefinitely&nbsp; postponing&nbsp; the&nbsp; 2015 ASM, as well as the Board Resolution dated February 17, 2015 approving the SR0.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The Clerk of Court of the RTC assessed Harvest All, <i>et al.</i> with filing fees amounting to P8,860.00 which they paid accordingly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Later on, Harvest All, <i>et al</i>. filed an Amended Complaint:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; (a) deleting its prayer to declare&nbsp; null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board&nbsp; Resolution&nbsp; dated&nbsp; February&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 2015 approving the SRO; and (b) instead, prayed that the Alliance Board be enjoined from implementing and carrying out the SRO prior to and as a condition for the holding of the 2015 ASM.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>For its part, the Alliance Board raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction on the ground of Harvest All, <i>et al.</i>' s failure to pay the correct filing fees. It argued that the latter should have paid P20 Million, more or less, in filing fees based on the SRO which was valued at P1 Billion. However, Harvest All, <i>et al</i>. did not mention such capital infusion in their prayers and, as such, were only made to pay the measly sum of P8,860.00. On the other hand, Harvest&nbsp; All,&nbsp; <i>et&nbsp; al</i>.&nbsp; maintained&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; paid the&nbsp; correct&nbsp; filing&nbsp; fees, considering that the subject of their complaint is the holding of the 2015 ASM and not a claim on the aforesaid value of the SRO.

In <i>Lu</i>, the Court&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; that in view of A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC dated July 20, 2004 which introduced Section 21 (k)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; to&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 141&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; it&nbsp; seemed that&nbsp; "an&nbsp; intra-corporate controversy always involves a property in litigation" and that "there&nbsp; can be no case of intra-corporate&nbsp; controversy where the value of the subject matter cannot be estimated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <br><br>However, after a careful reading of <i>Lu</i>, it appears that Harvest All, <i>et al</i>. correctly pointed out<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; that the foregoing statements were in the nature of an<i> obiter dictum.</i><br><br>To recount, in <i>Lu</i>, the Court ruled, <i>inter alia</i>, that the case involving an intra-corporate controversy instituted therein, i.e., declaration of nullity of share&nbsp; issuance,&nbsp; is incapable&nbsp; of pecuniary estimation&nbsp; and, thus, the correct docket&nbsp; fees were paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Despite&nbsp; such pronouncement,&nbsp; the Court still went on to say that had the complaint therein been filed during the effectivity of A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, then it would have ruled otherwise because the amendments&nbsp; brought about by the same "seem to imply that there can be no case&nbsp; of&nbsp; intra-corporate&nbsp; controversy&nbsp; where&nbsp; the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; subject matter cannot be estimated,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>The&nbsp; new&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 21&nbsp; (k)&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 141&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; as amended by A.M.

The latest amendments seem to imply that there can be&nbsp; no&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; intra-corporate controversy where the&nbsp; value of the subject matter cannot be estimated</u>. Even one for a mere inspection of corporate books.<br><b><br><u>If the complaint were&nbsp; filed&nbsp; today,&nbsp; one could safely find&nbsp; refuge in the express phraseology of Section 21 (k) of Rule 141&nbsp; that paragraph (a) alone applies.</u></b><br><br><u><b>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case, however, the original Complaint was filed on August 14, 2000 during which&nbsp; time Section&nbsp; 7, without qualification, was the applicable provision.</b></u> Even the Amended Complaint was filed on March 31, 2003 during which time the applicable rule expressed that paragraphs (a) and (b) 1 &amp; 3 shall be the basis for computing the filing fees&nbsp; in&nbsp; intra-corporate&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; recognizing that&nbsp; there&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; an&nbsp; intraÂ­-corporate controversy where the value of the subject matter cannot be estimated, such&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; action&nbsp; for&nbsp; inspection&nbsp; of&nbsp; corporate books.&nbsp; <u><b>The immediate illustration shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; no mistake can even be attributed to the RTC clerk of court in the assessment of the docket fees.</b></u> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Accordingly, the passages in <i>Lu</i> that "an intra-corporate controversy always involves a property&nbsp; in litigation" and that "there&nbsp; can be no case of intra-corporate controversy where the value of the subject matter cannot be estimated" are clearly non-determinative&nbsp; of the antecedents&nbsp; involved in that case and, hence, cannot be controlling jurisprudence to bind our courts when it&nbsp; adjudicates&nbsp; similar cases&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; principle&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>stare&nbsp; decisis</i>.&nbsp; As&nbsp; it&nbsp; is evident,&nbsp; these&nbsp; passages&nbsp; in Lu only constitute&nbsp; an opinion&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; by the Court as a "by the way" in relation to a hypothetical scenario (i.e., if the complaint was filed during the effectivity of A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, which it was not) different from the actual case before it.<br><br>In&nbsp; <i>Land&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines v.&nbsp; Santos</i>, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; had&nbsp; the opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; define&nbsp; an <i>obiter&nbsp; dictum</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; discuss&nbsp; its&nbsp; legal&nbsp; effects&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[An obiter dictum] "x x x <u><b>is a remark made,&nbsp; or opinion&nbsp; expressed, by a judge, in his decision&nbsp; upon&nbsp; a cause by the way, that is, incidentally or collaterally, and not directly upon&nbsp; the question before&nbsp; him,&nbsp; or&nbsp; upon&nbsp; a point not necessarily involved in the determination of the cause,&nbsp; or introduced by way&nbsp; of illustration, or analogy&nbsp; or&nbsp; argument.&nbsp; It does not embody&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution or determination of the&nbsp; court, and&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; without argument, or full consideration of the&nbsp; point.

However, <u><b>where the basic&nbsp; issue&nbsp; is&nbsp; something other than the&nbsp; right to&nbsp; recover a&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of money, where&nbsp; the&nbsp; money&nbsp; claim is purely&nbsp; incidental&nbsp; to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought, this Court has considered such&nbsp; actions&nbsp; as&nbsp; cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject of the litigation may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be estimated in terms&nbsp; of money</b></u>, and are cognizable exclusively by [C]ourts of&nbsp; [F]irst [I]nstance (now Regional Trial Courts). <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>This&nbsp; case&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; precise illustration as&nbsp; to&nbsp; how&nbsp; an&nbsp; intra-corporate controversy may be classified as an action whose subject matter is <b>incapable of pecuniary&nbsp; estimation</b>.&nbsp; A&nbsp; cursory perusal&nbsp; of&nbsp; Harvest All,&nbsp; <i>et&nbsp; al</i>.'s Complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; Amended&nbsp; Complaint&nbsp; reveals&nbsp; that&nbsp; <u><b>its&nbsp; main purpose is&nbsp; to have Alliance&nbsp; hold its 2015 ASM on the date&nbsp; set in the corporation's&nbsp; byÂ­ laws</b></u>, or at the time when Alliance's SRO has yet to fully materialize, so that their&nbsp; voting&nbsp; interest&nbsp; with&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; would&nbsp; somehow&nbsp; be&nbsp; preserved. Thus,&nbsp; Harvest&nbsp; All,&nbsp; <i>et&nbsp; al</i>.&nbsp; sought&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; nullity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Alliance&nbsp; Board Resolution passed on May 29, 2015 which indefinitely postponed the corporation's 2015 ASM pending completion&nbsp; of subscription&nbsp; to the SR0.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Certainly, Harvest All, <i>et al.</i>'s prayer for nullity, as well as the concomitant relief of holding the 2015 ASM as scheduled in the by-laws, do <b>not </b>involve the recovery of sum of money. The mere mention of Alliance's&nbsp; impending SRO valued at P1 Billion cannot transform the nature of Harvest All, <i>et al</i>.'s action to one capable of pecuniary estimation, considering&nbsp; that: (<i>a</i>) Harvest All, <i>et al</i>. do not claim ownership of, or much less entitlement to, the shares subject of&nbsp; the SRO; and (<i>b</i>) such mention was&nbsp; merely narrative or descriptive in order to emphasize the severe dilution that their voting interest as minority shareholders would suffer if the 2015 ASM were to be held after the SRO was completed. If, in the end, a sum of money or anything capable of pecuniary estimation would be recovered by virtue of Harvest All, <i>et al</i>.'s complaint, then it would simply be the consequence of their principal action. Clearly therefore, Harvest All, <i>et al</i>.'s action was one incapable of pecuniary estimation.<br><br>At this juncture,&nbsp; it should be mentioned that the Court passed A.M. No. 04-02-04-SC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; dated October 5, 2016, which introduced amendments to the&nbsp; schedule&nbsp; of&nbsp; legal&nbsp; fees&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; collected&nbsp; in&nbsp; various commercial&nbsp; cases, including those involving intra-corporate controversies. Pertinent portions of A.M.

CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court thoroughly explained the retroactive&nbsp; effectivity&nbsp; of procedural&nbsp; rules, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>The general&nbsp; rule that statutes&nbsp; are prospective&nbsp; and&nbsp; not retroactive does&nbsp; not&nbsp; ordinarily&nbsp; apply&nbsp; to procedural&nbsp; laws.&nbsp; It&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; "a retroactive law, in a legal sense, is one which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under laws, or creates a new obligation and imposes a new duty, or attaches&nbsp; a new&nbsp; disability,&nbsp; in respect&nbsp; of transactions&nbsp; or considerations&nbsp; already past. <u><b>Hence,&nbsp; remedial&nbsp; statutes&nbsp; or statutes relating to remedies or&nbsp; modes of procedure, which&nbsp; do not create new or&nbsp; take&nbsp; away&nbsp; vested rights, but&nbsp; only&nbsp; operate in&nbsp; furtherance of&nbsp; the remedy&nbsp; or confirmation of rights&nbsp; already existing,&nbsp; do not come within the&nbsp; legal&nbsp; conception of a&nbsp; retroactive law, or&nbsp; the&nbsp; general rule&nbsp; against the&nbsp; retroactive operation of statutes.</b></u>" The general&nbsp; rule against giving statutes retroactive operation whose effect is to impair the obligations of contract&nbsp; or&nbsp; to disturb&nbsp; vested&nbsp; rights&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; the application&nbsp; of statutes to proceedings&nbsp; pending at the time of their enactment&nbsp; where they neither&nbsp; create&nbsp; new&nbsp; nor&nbsp; take&nbsp; away&nbsp; vested&nbsp; rights.&nbsp; <u><b>A&nbsp; new statute&nbsp; which deals&nbsp; with&nbsp; procedure only is presumptively applicable to all actions&nbsp; - those which have accrued or are&nbsp; pending.</b></u><br><br>Statutes regulating the procedure of the courts will be construed as applicable to&nbsp; actions&nbsp; pending and&nbsp; undetermined at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of&nbsp; their passage.&nbsp; Procedural&nbsp; laws are retroactive&nbsp; in that sense and to that extent. The fact that procedural&nbsp; statutes may somehow affect the litigants'&nbsp; rights may not preclude their retroactive application to pending actions. <u><b>The retroactive application of procedural laws is not violative&nbsp; of any&nbsp; right of&nbsp; a&nbsp; person who&nbsp; may&nbsp; feel&nbsp; that he&nbsp; is adversely affected. Nor&nbsp; is&nbsp; the retroactive application of procedural statutes constitutionally objectionable. The&nbsp; reason is that&nbsp; as a general rule no vested&nbsp; right&nbsp; may attach to,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; arise from, procedural laws.</b></u>&nbsp; It has&nbsp; been&nbsp; held&nbsp; that "a person has no vested right in any particular remedy, and a litigant cannot insist on the application to the trial of his case, whether civil or criminal, of&nbsp; any&nbsp; other&nbsp; than&nbsp; the&nbsp; existing&nbsp; rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; procedure." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; and&nbsp; having&nbsp; classified&nbsp; Harvest&nbsp; All,&nbsp; <i>et al.</i>'s action as one incapable of pecuniary&nbsp; estimation, the Court finds that Harvest All, <i>et al</i>. should&nbsp; be made&nbsp; to pay the appropriate docket&nbsp; fees in accordance with&nbsp; the applicable fees provided&nbsp; under&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 7 (b) (3) of Rule&nbsp; 141 [fees for all other actions not involving&nbsp; property]&nbsp; of the Revised Rules of Court, in conformity with&nbsp; A.M. No. 04-02-04-SC dated&nbsp; October&nbsp; 5, 2016.&nbsp; The matter is therefore&nbsp; remanded&nbsp; to the RTC in order:<br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; to&nbsp; first determine&nbsp; if Harvest,&nbsp; <i>et&nbsp; al.</i>'s payment&nbsp; of filing fees in the amount of P8,860.00, as initially assessed&nbsp; by the Clerk of Court, constitutes sufficient compliance with&nbsp; A.M. No. 04-02-04- SC;<br><br>(b) if Harvest All, et al.'s&nbsp; payment of P8,860.00 is insufficient, to require Harvest,&nbsp; <i>et al</i>.'s payment&nbsp; of any discrepancy&nbsp; within&nbsp; a period&nbsp; of fifteen&nbsp; (15)&nbsp; days&nbsp; from&nbsp; notice, and after such payment, proceed with the regular proceedings of the case with dispatch; or<br><br>(c)&nbsp; if Harvest&nbsp; All,&nbsp; <i>et&nbsp; al.</i>'s payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; P8,860.00&nbsp; is already sufficient, proceed with the regular proceedings of the case with dispatch.</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>,&nbsp; the petition in <b>G.R.
