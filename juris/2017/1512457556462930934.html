				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The suspension of rules of procedure may only be considered under a very narrow band of compelling reasons and always in consideration that due process of law must be accorded to both parties—the prosecution and the accused. <p> This is a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, assailing the December 4, 2009 Joint Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and May 9, 2011 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C-08-0343-H and OMB-C-A-08-0383-H. The Office of the Ombudsman dismissed petitioner Edward Thomas F. Joson's (Joson) administrative and criminal complaints against Aurelio M. Umali (Umali), Giovanni G. Agtay (Agtay), Alejandro R. Abesamis (Abesamis), Edilberto M. Pancho (Pancho), and Jaime P. Pallanan (Pallanan) (collectively, private respondents) for graft and corruption, malversation, fraud, and grave misconduct, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> This case arose from the alleged payment to a caterer that did not provide meals for an event and the consequent misappropriation of the amount paid.</p><p> In his Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Complaint) dated August 6, 2008, petitioner Joson charged private respondents before the Office of the Ombudsman with the following: </p><blockquote> <p> 2.a GROSS VIOLATION OF [REPUBLIC ACT NO.] 3019 (ANTI-GRAFT AND CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT), particularly Section 3 thereof; and/or</p> <p> 2.b VIOLATION OF ART. 213 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE; and/or </p> <p>2.c VIOLATION OF ART. 215 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE; and/or </p> <p>2.d VIOLATION OF ART. 216 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE; and/or </p> <p>2.e VIOLATION OF ART. 217 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE; and/or</p> <p> 2.f VIOLATION OF [REPUBLIC] ACT NO. 6713; and/or </p> <p>2.g GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE, AND IRREGULARITY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DU[T]IES, and/or </p> <p>2.h COMMISSION OF A CRIME INVOLVING MORAL T[U]RPITUDE, and/or </p> <p>2.i SUCH OTHER CRIMES OR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AS THIS HONORABLE OFFICE MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE IN THE PREMISES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The criminal case was docketed as OMB-C-C-08-0343-H, while the administrative case was docketed as OMB-C-A-08-0383-H.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p>At the time of filing the Complaint, Joson was then Nueva Ecija's Vice Governor and its Sangguniang Panlalawigan's Presiding Officer, while Umali was Nueva Ecija's Governor. Agtay, Abesamis, and Pancho served as Nueva Ecija's Provincial Trade and Industry Officer, OIC-Provincial Administrator, and Treasurer, respectively. Pallanan was the former Provincial Administrator of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p>Joson alleged that on September 21, 2006, a Memorandum of Agreement was executed by the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija and Ryan Angelo Sweets and Catering Services (Ryan Angelo Catering), which was owned by Cleopatra Gervacio (Cleopatra). Under this Agreement, Ryan Angelo Catering's services for two (2) years “shall include regular serving of meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks at the canteen and the convention center, special meals and catering services shall be provided as may be required."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Joson claimed that another caterer was hired during Umali's oath-taking ceremony on July 4, 2007. However, Agtay asked Ryan Angelo Catering, through Cleopatra, for a receipt of P1,272,000.00 under the name of the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija, Joson claimed that Agtay made this request to make it appear that Ryan Angelo Catering actually catered and to justify the withdrawal of P1,344,000.00 from the treasury of Nueva Ecija's provincial government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> According to Joson, the misrepresentations committed by Agtay caused the issuance of a P1,272,000.00 check to Ryan Angelo Catering. The check was received by Cleopatra's daughter-in-law, Jocelyn R. Gervacio (Jocelyn).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> Joson cited Cleopatra's Sworn Statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where she stated that after the P1,272,000.00 check was cleared, Jocelyn gave the proceeds of the check to Agtay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Joson stated that Jocelyn deposited P734,000.00 in Agtay's account with Equitable-PCI Bank, Cabanatuan City branch and delivered the remaining amount to him personally. In depositing the P734,000.00, Jocelyn used a Banco San Juan check under the account name of Cleopatra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> Joson contended that the fraudulent transaction committed by Agtay "was consummated with the knowledge and participation of, and in conspiracy with"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Umali, Pallanan, and Pancho, through the following acts: </p><blockquote> <p> 13.a Respondent Gov. Aurelio M. Umali made it appear that he ordered meals from Ryan Angelo Catering as shown by the Purchase Order. . . </p> <p>13.b An Obligation Request was issued and signed by respondent Jaime Pallanan for the meals eaten during the oath-taking ceremonies of respondent Gov. Aurelio M, Umali certifying that the supporting documents thereof are valid, proper and legal . . . </p> <p>13.c A Resolution was rendered by the Bids and Awards Committee fraudulently stating that "<em>the pronouncement of meals was directly procured from Ryan Angelo Sweets and Catering Services</em>" and recommended the use of Direct Contracting Method for the procurement of meals worth P1,244,000.00 .. . </p> <p>13.d A Disbursement Voucher was issued and signed by the following officials of the provincial government of Nueva Ecija: (a) respondent Edilberto Pancho who certified that "<em>Funds (are) available</em>"; and (b) respondent Governor Aurelio M. Umali who signed under the caption "<em>Approved for Payment</em>". This disbursement voucher was issued in favor of Ryan Angelo Catering as "<em>payment of meals during the Oath Taking Ceremony for the use of Governor's Office</em> ". . . </p> <p>13.e DBP Check No. 23570768-69 in the amount of ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND (P1,272,000.00) was issued by respondents Jaime P. Pallanan and Edilberto M. Pancho in favor of Ryan Angelo Catering . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Copies of the Purchase Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Obligation Request,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the Bids and Awards Committee, and the Disbursement Voucher<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> were attached to Joson's Complaint. </p><p> Joson alleged that Abesamis persuaded Cleopatra to agree with the Memorandum of Agreement's early termination in exchange for the immediate payment of the provincial government's outstanding obligations with Ryan Angelo Catering. Despite this condition, the provincial government failed to pay Ryan Angelo Catering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p>Joson maintained that the acts of Agtay and Abesamis and the documents that Umali, Pallanan, and Pancho issued in their official capacities facilitated the illegal disbursement of public funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> Joson also mentioned that the number of packed lunches that was allegedly delivered to the Nueva Ecija Convention Center was about 7,000 units more than the number of persons that the center could accommodate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> Finally, he alleged that the disbursement voucher did not have the provincial accountant's signature, which would have certified that an allotment from the public funds was made and that the documents were complete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p>Pallanan, Umali, Agtay, and Abesamis filed their respective counter-affidavits while Pancho failed to submit his counter-affidavit despite receiving notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p>In his Counter-Affidavit dated September 11, 2008, Pallanan stated that the receipt under the name of Nueva Ecija's provincial government was evidence that Ryan Angelo Catering supplied the food for Umali's oath-taking ceremony. Likewise, he pointed out that neither Joson nor Cleopatra had personal knowledge regarding the deposit of the proceeds of the alleged check to Agtay's account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> In his Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated October 8, 2008, Umali argued that his signing of the Purchase Order and related papers was justified considering that "the documents had been certified to be in order and no discrepancy was apparent therein, and [he] had no reason to doubt the validity of the bidding process and subsequent disbursement of funds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> In his Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated October 16, 2008, Agtay denied the allegations of Joson against him. He countered that he was not yet an employee of the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija when it secured the services of Ryan Angelo Catering,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He attached to his Counter-Affidavit his appointment paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> showing that it was only on August 1, 2007 that he assumed office as Provincial Trade and Industry Officer. Agtay also denied receiving any amount from Jocelyn or maintaining a bank account with Equitable-PCI Bank. Lastly, he noted that Cleopatra's sworn statement did not state the amount allegedly deposited nor did it mention the Banco San Juan check.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> In his Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated October 20, 2008, Abesamis denied having knowledge of the Memorandum of Agreement between the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija and Ryan Angelo Catering. However, he knew that Ryan Angelo Catering operated the canteen inside the new provincial capitol compound. Abesamis also noted that the copy of the Memorandum of Agreement attached to Joson's Complaint contained Cleopatra's signature only and was not notarized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p>Abesamis further averred that after being appointed as provincial administrator in February 2008, Cleopatra asked for his help regarding her catering's collectibles from the provincial government. Upon inquiry with the accounting department, he found out that they had already told Cleopatra to submit the required documents. He advised her to complete the requirements as requested by the accounting department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Abesamis claimed that he did not persuade Cleopatra to prematurely terminate the Memorandum of Agreement. He narrated that due to Ryan Angelo Catering's non-payment of electricity, the power supply of the canteen was cut off. Cleopatra told him that she could not open the canteen since she could not afford to pay the bills. She also informed him to get another canteen operator as she no longer wanted to operate it. The Provincial General Services Office told Abesamis that it could negotiate the situation with the power supplier. However, Abesamis realized that if the result of the negotiation were favorable to the power supplier, the existence of the Memorandum of Agreement would present a legal issue. Abesamis discussed the situation with Cleopatra, who stated that she was amenable to prematurely terminate the Memorandum of Agreement. She also requested Abesamis to prepare the termination notice, which he did. Cleopatra presented the notice to her lawyer and gave the signed copy back to Abesamis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Abesamis contended that prior to his appointment on October 19, 2007, he had neither known nor met Agtay. For the charges imputed against him, Abesamis charged Joson with malicious prosecution and perjury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> Joson filed his Reply-Affidavits dated October 24, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and November 11, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> where he denied the allegations of Umali, Pallanan, and Abesamis. He noted that there was no denial from Umali or Pallanan that Ryan Angelo Catering did not supply the packed food for the event. According to Joson, Pallanan blamed Agtay alone, while Umali shifted the blame to his subordinates. There was also no denial from Umali, Pallanan, Agtay, or Abesamis that the number of food provided was not proportional to the maximum capacity of the oath-taking ceremony venue. Furthermore, Umali and Pallanan's signing of the Purchase Order, Obligation Request, and Disbursement Voucher showed that they participated and prepared the documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> On December 4, 2009, Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer I Francis Euston R. Acero (Prosecutor Acero) of the Office of the Ombudsman issued a Joint Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dismissing all charges against Umali, Abesamis, Agtay, Pancho, and Pallanan. He cited lack of probable cause for dismissing the criminal charges and lack of merit for dismissing the administrative charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Prosecutor Acero found that Joson's allegations were not supported by evidence and were merely based on conjectures and suppositions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> On the violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019, Prosecutor Acero held that the evidence was insufficient to prove undue injury on Cleopatra or on the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Likewise, Joson's allegation on the terms of the Purchase Order being "grossly disadvantageous to the government" was unsubstantiated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Prosecutor Acero noted that the subject Purchase Order complied with the standard Purchase Order form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p>On the violation of Article 213 of the Revised Penal Code, Prosecutor Acero found that there was not enough evidence to prove that private respondents committed fraud to use public funds for their personal benefit. Joson failed to establish the existence of the other catering supplier that supposedly provided the food during the event, and of deposit slips proving that the proceeds of the check were deposited to Agtay's account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> On the violations of Section 3(h) of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 6713, and Article 215 of the Revised Penal Code, Prosecutor Acero held that there was no sufficient evidence that could establish private respondents' prohibited material or pecuniary interest in the unnamed caterer. Again, aside from the uncorroborated allegation of Joson, there was no indication that another caterer served the meals in the convention center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p>On the allegation of grave misconduct, Prosecutor Acero found that Joson was not able "to demonstrate that [private] respondents, in the performance of their functions, have engaged in intentional wrongdoing or have committed a deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p>On Abesamis' counter-charge of perjury against Joson, Prosecutor Acero held that there was no sufficient basis to conclude that Joson's statements on Abesamis and Agtay's conspiracy was "a deliberate assertion of a falsehood."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Joson did not mention in his complaint any circumstance which could show that Cleopatra and Abesamis met before the latter assumed office. Cleopatra also stated in her sworn affidavit that her meeting with Abesamis occurred when he was already serving as an officer in the provincial government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p>The dispositive portion of the Joint Resolution read: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the undersigned Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer respectfully recommends that:</p> <ol><li> The charges against respondents Aurelio M.

He prays that the December 4, 2009 Joint Resolution and the May 9, 2011 Order of the Office of the Ombudsman be set aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner argues that Cleopatra's testimony "remained rock solid."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> There was no denial from respondents Umali and Pallanan on the truthfulness of Cleopatra's allegations in her sworn statement. Both respondents evaded responsibility by blaming their subordinates or fellow private respondents. Moreover, respondent Umali was "not only a mere signatory to the documents but a principal who acted in conspiracy with his co-respondents to commit fraud and corruption against the coffers of the provincial government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner also stresses the excessive quantity of packed lunches that was allegedly delivered to the Nueva Ecija Convention Center for the oath-taking ceremony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p>With respect to private respondent Abesamis, petitioner claims that he made contradicting statements in his Counter-Affidavit. Private respondent Abesamis stated that the Memorandum of Agreement was legally defective for not being signed by the former governor and the witnesses and for not being notarized, yet he recognized its validity when he was trying to arrange a new canteen operator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Further, respondent Abesamis admitted that he talked to Cleopatra several times regarding the early termination of the Memorandum of Agreement and that he prepared the termination notice for Cleopatra's signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner points out that private respondent Agtay's acknowledgment of his lack of participation to the catering transaction and of the documents' lack of his signature implies that the private respondents who signed these documents were principals of the complained acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, petitioner avers that Cleopatra had no motive to implicate private respondents Abesamis and Agtay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Thus, the allegations in her sworn statement are "the truth and nothing else.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p> On October 14, 2011, private respondents Umali, Abesamis, Pancho, and Pallanan filed their consolidated Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> They argue that petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration filed with the Ombudsman was not timely filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Also, petitioner lacked personality to sue considering that Cleopatra was the one allegedly prejudiced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Furthermore, petitioner should have appealed the Decision of the Office of the Ombudsman, regarding the administrative case, to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court instead of filing a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p>Private respondents assert, that the re-election of Umali as governor of Nueva Ecija for the second time “operated as a condonation of his purported administrative infractions and the right to remove him from office."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Private respondents Umali, Pancho, and Pallanan add that they merely performed their usual duties when they signed the documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p> On November 14, 2011, public respondent Office of the Ombudsman filed its Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> It maintains that petitioner should have elevated the administrative case to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> It argues that the dismissal of private respondents' cases was based on sufficient basis; hence, it did not commit grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p><p>On February 3, 2012, private respondent Agtay filed his Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> He contends that petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was filed out of time and that the Office of the Ombudsman did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the cases against private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> On October 22, 2012, petitioner filed his Consolidated Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> He asserts that his Motion for Reconsideration before the Office of the Ombudsman and the Petition for Certiorari before this Court were both filed on time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He also argues that the Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 is proper since the remedy under Rule 43 ''can only be availed of in ail other cases except in the case when the respondent is absolved of the charge, among others."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Petitioner insists that the Office of the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the charges considering that "[t]he evidence on hand sufficiently supports a finding of probable cause."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> He notes that private respondents did not deny the existence of another caterer; thus, they impliedly admitted that another caterer provided the meals in the event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p><p>On January 30, 2013, this Court issued a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> giving due course to the petition and requiring the parties to file their respective memoranda. </p><p> Respondents (1) Office of the Ombudsman; (2) Umali, Abesamis, and Pancho; (3) Agtay; and (4) Pallanan filed their respective Memoranda on May 15, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> May 24, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> May 27, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and October 1, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> respectively.

Goodland Company, Inc.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> this Court clarified; </p><blockquote> <p> The emerging trend of jurisprudence is more inclined to the liberal and flexible application of the Rules of Court. However, we have not been remiss in reminding the bench and the bar that zealous compliance with the rules is still the general course of action. Rules of procedure are in place to ensure the orderly, just, and speedy dispensation of cases; to this end, inflexibility or liberality must be weighed. The relaxation or suspension of procedural rules or the exemption of a case from their operation is warranted only by compelling reasons or when the purpose of justice requires it.</p> </blockquote> <p> As early as 1998, in <em>Hon. Fortich v. Hon. Corona</em>, we expounded on these guiding principles: </p><blockquote> <p> Procedural rules, we must stress, should be treated with utmost respect and due regard since they are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases to remedy the worsening problem of delay in the resolution of rival claims and in the administration of justice. The requirement is in pursuance to the bill of rights inscribed in the Constitution which guarantees that "all persons shall have a right to the speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative bodies." The adjudicatory bodies and the parties to a case are thus enjoined to abide strictly by the rules. While it is true that a litigation is not a game of technicalities, it is equally true that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure to ensure an orderly and speedy administration of justice. There have been some instances wherein this Court allowed a relaxation in the application of the rules, but this flexibility was "never intended to forge a bastion for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity," A liberal interpretation and application of the rules of procedure can be resorted to only in proper cases and under justifiable causes and circumstances.</p> <p> In <em>Sebastian v. Hon. Morales</em>, we straightened out the misconception that the enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it would prejudice the substantive rights of litigants:</p> <blockquote> <p> Under Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, liberal construction of the rules is the controlling principle to effect substantial justice. Thus, litigations should, as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities. This does not mean, however, that procedural rules are to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism, or whimsicality in the settlement of disputes. Hence, it is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as often suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it would result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.</p> <p> . . . Hence, rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only when for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. ..</p> </blockquote> <p> Indeed, the primordial policy is a faithful observance of the Rules of Court, and their relaxation or suspension should only be for persuasive reasons and only in meritorious cases, to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed. Further, a bare invocation of "the interest of substantial justice" will not suffice to override a stringent implementation of the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, this Court has allowed the relaxation of procedural rules to ensure the realization of substantial justice in several instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> In <em>Barnes v. Hon. Quijano Padilla</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he Rules of Court itself calls for its liberal construction, with the view of promoting their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding. The Court is fully aware that procedural rules are not to be belittled or simply disregarded for these prescribed procedures insure an orderly and speedy administration of justice. However, it is equally true that litigation is not merely a game of technicalities. Law and jurisprudence grant to courts the prerogative to relax compliance with procedural rules of even the most mandatory character, mindful of the duty to reconcile both the need to put an end to litigation speedily and the parties' right to an opportunity to be heard. In numerous cases, the Court has allowed liberal construction of the Rules of Court with respect to the rules on the manner and periods for perfecting appeals, when to do so would serve the demands of substantial justice and in the exercise of equity jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, As the Court has expounded in <em>Aguam vs. Court of Appeals</em>: . . . </p> <blockquote> <p>The court has the discretion to dismiss or not to dismiss an appellant's appeal. It is a power conferred on the court, not a duty. The "discretion must be a sound one, to be exercised in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, having in mind the circumstances obtaining in each case." Technicalities, however, must be avoided. The law abhors technicalities that impede the cause of justice. The court's primary duty is to render or dispense justice."A litigation is not a game of technicalities." "Lawsuits unlike duels are not to be won by a rapier's thrust. Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts." <em>Litigations must be decided on their merits and not on technicality</em>. Every party litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the unacceptable plea of technicalities. Thus, dismissal of appeals purely on technical grounds is frowned upon where the policy of the court is to encourage hearings of appeals on their merits and the rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure, not override substantial justice. <em>It is a far better and more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal to attain the ends of justice rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>. . . . .</p> <blockquote> <p> In the <em>Ginete</em> case, the Court held:</p> <p> . . . . </p> <p>Let it be emphasized that the rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. Even the Rules of Court reflect this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be final, as we are now constrained to do in the instant case. </p> <p> <i>The emerging trend in the rulings of this Court is to afford every party litigant the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities. Time and again, this Court has consistently held that rules must not be applied rigidly so as not to override substantial justice.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Although a motion for reconsideration is required before this Court can entertain a petition for certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> this rule admits of certain exceptions, which were enumerated in <i>Tan v.

Gervacio or the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija. The evidence shows that there was, for the benefit of the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija, a catered reception in the Nueva Ecija Convention Center, for which payment was made by the Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija to Ryan Angelo Sweets &amp; Catering pursuant to a Purchase Order dated 4 July 2007, and under the terms specified therein.</p> <p> On the other hand, the assertions of complainant (1) that there was another catering service actually providing catering services that day; and (2) that respondent Agtay received any of the proceeds of DBP Check . . . both remain uncorroborated, In other words, there has been no showing of a cause of action on the part of Cleopatra G. Gervacio sufficient for her to claim actual damages by the acts or omissions of respondents, aside from the bare say-so of complainant. For these reasons, the evidence submitted is also insufficient to show precisely what actual damages on the part of Provincial Government of Nueva Ecija were caused by the acts or omissions of respondents.</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> As regards the grant of unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to a private party, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that a caterer other than Ryan Angelo Sweets &amp; Catering provided the meals, as to assume otherwise would be to delve in surmise and speculation.</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> As regards the Purchase Order dated 4 July 2007, complainant has offered no evidence to support [his] assertion why the terms of the Purchase Order dated 4 July 2007 is grossly disadvantageous to the government. It is noted that the terms of the Purchase Order were made through the standard Purchase Order form[.]</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> The evidence is insufficient to establish fraud on the part of respondents. Although the reception for respondent Umali's induction as Governor has been established, the existence of a catering service provider other than Ryan Angelo Sweets &amp; Catering at the Nueva Ecija Convention Center on 4 July 2007 has not been established by the evidence. What the evidence supports is a finding that it was Ryan Angelo Sweets &amp; Catering that provided the meals on that day. What is more, the deposit and/or constructive receipt of respondent Agtay of the proceeds of DBP Check . . . remains uncorroborated by a person with personal knowledge that the proceeds of the said check have been deposited into an account of respondent Agtay, or by deposit slips indicating that such a deposit has in fact been made.</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p>A finding that respondents have violated [Article 215 of the Revised Penal Code, Section 3(h) of Republic Act No. 3019, and Section 7 of Republic Act No. 6713] cannot be made because such undue interest is an essential element for criminal liability under these provisions of law. The evidence bears no indication of the existence of a caterer other than Ryan Angelo Sweets &amp; Catering operating in the Nueva Ecija Convention Center at the induction of respondent Umali, save from barefaced supposition of complainant based on an alleged transaction between Cleopatra G.
