They assert that Bahian sustained the injury on his forehead through his own fault; thus, they could not be held liable for acting with intent to kill Bahian.<br><br>On July 24, 2013, respondent People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed its Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It insisted that it was supposedly improper for this Court to re-evaluate the factual findings of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals in the context of the present Rule 45 Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Apart from pleading the nature of a Rule 45 Petition, the five (5)-page Comment devoted a singular paragraph to arguing that the positive identification of the petitioners as Bahian's supposed attackers must prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On May 12, 2014, petitioners filed their Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> noting that respondent failed to directly confront the factual issues they had raised.<br><br>For resolution is the sole issue of whether petitioners are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of frustrated murder.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Petitioners seek relief from this Court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. It is basic that Rule 45 petitions may only raise pure questions of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and that the factual findings of lower courts are generally binding and conclusive on this Court. Still, there are recognized exceptions permitting this Court to overturn the factual findings with which it is confronted. These exceptions are:<br><blockquote>(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures;<br><br>(2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;<br><br>(3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion;<br><br>(4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;<br><br>(5) When the findings of fact are conflicting;<br><br>(6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;<br><br>(7) When the findings are contrary to those of the trial court;<br><br>(8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;<br><br>(9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and<br><br>(10) When the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Specifically concerning criminal cases, this Court has stated that "in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters . . . this Court will re-calibrate and evaluate the factual findings of the [lower courts]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>A careful review of this case and of the body of evidence that was available for the Regional Trial Court's perusal reveals that there has been a gross misapprehension of facts on the part of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. Thus, we reverse and acquit petitioners Capistrano Daayata, Dexter Salisi, and Bregido Malacat, Jr.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The defense points out several facts, which lend greater plausibility to its claim that the possibly fatal injury sustained by Bahian on his forehead was not inflicted by any of the petitioners, and that petitioners did not initiate an assault against Bahian. Negating the fact of the alleged perpetrators' assault and infliction of a potentially fatal injury negates the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense charged.<br><br>First, it appears that the location where the altercation occurred between Bahian and Kagawad Abalde, on the one hand, and petitioners, on the other, is not as plain and austere as the prosecution made it seem. The prosecution merely claimed that Bahian and Kagawad Abalde were on their way to Barangay Captain Yañez's house when they were suddenly blocked and assaulted by petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, it was actually settled during trial - consistent with the defense's contention - that the confrontation took place in the vicinity of the house of Vicente.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>This detail does not intrinsically weigh in favor of either the prosecution or the defense. For indeed, it may simply have been necessary to pass by Vicente's house en route to Barangay Captain Yañez's house and, consistent with what the prosecution claimed, that it may have merely been the spot where Bahian's attackers chose to launch their assault. But while specificity of location may ultimately be inconsequential to the prosecution's case, it is the genesis of the defense's case. As the defense asserts, the altercation was precipitated by Bahian and Kagawad Abalde's arrival outside Vicente's residence, where Bahian then called out and challenged Salisi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Second, while the prosecution painted a picture of a relentless assault that lasted for as much as 30 minutes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> - with petitioners supposedly not content with Bahian falling onto a parked jeep, but even attacking him until he lay on the pavement, and thereafter still continuing to punch and kick him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> - Bahian's "medical certificate showed no injury other than that on [his] forehead."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>"Physical evidence is evidence of the highest order. It speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> They have been characterized as "that mute but eloquent manifestations of truth which rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, in <i>People v. Vasquez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> this Court refused to undiseemingly lend credence to the incriminating assertions of prosecution witnesses as to an alleged mauling, and stated that "[t]his Court cannot be persuaded by the prosecution's claim of perpetration of physical violence in the absence of any marked physical injuries on the various parts of the victim's face and body."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>As the defense correctly points out, if the prosecution's assertion of a relentless assault were true, the greater probability was that Bahian must have been "black and blue all over."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Quite contrary to the sort of physical evidence that a purported relentless and prolonged assault should have reasonably yielded, however, there was but one injury that Bahian was noted to have sustained.<br><br>Third, Bahian himself was noted to have admitted that his head injury was "caused by [him] hitting the edge of the concrete pavement." As the following excerpt from Bahian's cross-examination reveals:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> And on February of 1995, your forehead was operated on by a certain Dr. John Mata, is that correct?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify">And you told Dr. Mata that the wound on your forehead was caused by you hitting the edge of the concrete pavement, is that correct?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, I told him a lie so that I could be treated.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify">But nobody in the German Doctors told you that you would not be operated if that was caused by a stone or in a fight?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify">He asked me the reason why I got this injury?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify">And then?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Then I told him the reason how I got this injury.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify"> That you hit the edge of the concrete pavement?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify"> And that was the first time you talked to him before the operation?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td><td><div align="justify">The first time you talked to him, you lied to him?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A - </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, I told a lie because I wanted to be operated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citations omitted)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As the Court of Appeals has pointed out, it is true that the prosecution has sought to extenuate the weight of Bahian's admission by having him explain that he only lied to Dr. Mata because otherwise, "he would not have been admitted to the hospital and his injury would have not been operated on."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> However, even this extenuating explanation does not completely diminish the significance of his admission.<br><br>As the same excerpt from Bahian's cross-examination indicated, nobody intimated to Bahian that he would not have been operated on if his injury arose from a violent altercation. Confronted with this detail, Bahian never offered a direct response, and instead appeared to have evaded the question. He merely reiterated that, "Yes, I told a lie because I wanted to be operated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Thus, the defense's revelation that Bahian's alleged lie was not predicated on a rational basis stands unrefuted.<br><br>Moreover, in the present Petition, the defense points out the curious parallelism between, on the one hand, the admission or otherwise lie made by Bahian to Dr. Mata, and on the other hand, the defense's main contention that Bahian sustained a head injury through his own fault:<br><blockquote>There is no showing that petitioners knew that complainant told his doctor that he hit his head on the edge of the concrete pavement.

Rule 133, Section 2 of the Revised Rules on Evidence states:<br><blockquote>Section 2. Proof beyond reasonable doubt. — In a criminal case, the accused is entitled to an acquittal, unless his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<br></blockquote>While not impelling such a degree of proof as to establish absolutely impervious certainty, the quantum of proof required in criminal cases nevertheless charges the prosecution with the immense responsibility of establishing moral certainty, a certainty that ultimately appeals to a person's very conscience. While indeed imbued with a sense of altruism, this imperative is borne, not by a mere abstraction, but by constitutional necessity:<br><blockquote>This rule places upon the prosecution the task of establishing the guilt of an accused, relying on the strength of its own evidence, and not banking on the weakness of the defense of an accused. Requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt finds basis not only in the due process clause of the Constitution, but similarly, in the right of an accused to be "presumed innocent until the contrary is proved." "Undoubtedly, it is the constitutional presumption of innocence that lays such burden upon the prosecution." Should the prosecution fail to discharge its burden, it follows, as a matter of course, that an accused must be acquitted. As explained in <i>Basilio v. People of the Philippines</i>:<br><br>We ruled in <i>People v. Ganguso</i>:<br><blockquote>An accused has in his favor the presumption of innocence which the Bill of Rights guarantees. Unless his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt, he must be acquitted. This reasonable doubt standard is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution which protects the accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and unless it discharges that burden the accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf, and he would be entitled to an acquittal. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not, of course, mean such degree of proof as, excluding the possibility of error, produce absolute certainty. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind. The conscience must be satisfied that the accused is responsible for the offense charged.<br></blockquote>Well-entrenched in jurisprudence is the rule that the conviction of the accused must rest, not on the weakness of the defense, but on the strength of the prosecution. The burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, not on the accused to prove his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The details pointed out by the defense reveal how the prosecution failed to establish the moral certainty and conscientious satisfaction that attends proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. While not per se demonstrating the veracity and blamelessness of the defense's entire version of events, they nevertheless disclose how the prosecution's case is unable to stand on its own merits.<br><br>They cast doubt on whether the complainant and his companion were actually stopped in their tracks to be assaulted, and support the possibility that they may have instead deliberately intended to bring themselves to Vicente's house to provoke or challenge one (1) of the petitioners.<br><br>They also cast doubt on whether the complainant was relentlessly assaulted, with the specific purpose of ending his life; whether the ostensible fatal blow was dealt to complainant by one (1) of the petitioners or was dealt upon him by his own violent imprudence; and whether petitioners had actually brandished implements for maiming and killing.<br><br>Not only do these doubts persist, details disclosed by the prosecution itself - taken together with how the defense accounted for the events of December 16 and 17, 1995 - demonstrate the dubiety of the prosecution's claims.<br><br>As Bahian himself recalled to Kagawad Abalde, it was he who threatened Salisi that "he would just get even with him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> By his own recollection too, he acknowledged that it was only upon his utterance of that threat that Malacat and Daayata responded with correlative aggression. He conceded having been put in a situation where he had to back off. By his own recollection, the clash between him and petitioners could have ended there, yet it did not. It appears that, rather than letting the better part of reason and modesty prevail, Bahian elected to make good on his threat to eventually just get even with his adversaries. Along the way, it even appears that he enlisted the aid of Kagawad Abalde, whose participation in the clash in the morning of December 17, 1995, as the defense recounted, was not as a pacifier but also as an aggressor. Unfortunately for Bahian, it appears that his own hubris and lack of fighting prowess not only prolonged his quarrel, but even brought him potentially fatal physical harm.<br><br>Taking off from the events in the basketball game of December 16, 1995, the prosecution unravelled a narrative of petitioners' supposed vindictiveness. Yet the contrary is apparent. The confluence of Bahian's admissions of a prior altercation, his self-issued threat, how he was constrained to desist, and his own account to Dr. Mata of how he sustained his injury, as well as the glaring dissonance noted by the defense and backed by physical evidence, demonstrate how the prosecution has fallen far too short of discharging its burden of proving petitioners' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
