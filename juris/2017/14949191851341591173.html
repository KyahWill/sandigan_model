More specifically, this Court is asked to determine whether there was sufficient evidence: first, to prove that justifying circumstances existed, and second, to convict the petitioners.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Petitioners' defense centers on their claim that they acted in defense of themselves, and also in defense of Mercedes, Nicolas' wife and Victor's mother. Thus, they invoke the first and second justifying circumstances under Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 11. Justifying Circumstances. — The following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><ol><li>Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">First. Unlawful aggression;<br><br>Second. Reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it;<br><br>Third. Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br></div><br></li><li>Anyone who acts in defense of the person or rights of his spouse, ascendants, descendants, or legitimate, natural or adopted brothers or sisters, or of his relatives by affinity in the same degrees, and those by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree, provided that the first and second requisites prescribed in the next preceding circumstance are present, and the further requisite, in case the provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making defense had no part therein.<br></li></ol></blockquote>A person invoking self-defense (or defense of a relative) admits to having inflicted harm upon another person - a potential criminal act under Title Eight (Crimes Against Persons) of the Revised Penal Code. However, he or she makes the additional, defensive contention that even as he or she may have inflicted harm, he or she nevertheless incurred no criminal liability as the looming danger upon his or her own person (or that of his or her relative) justified the infliction of protective harm to an erstwhile aggressor.<br><br>The accused's admission enables the prosecution to dispense with discharging its burden of proving that the accused performed acts, which would otherwise be the basis of criminal liability. All that remains to be established is whether the accused were justified in acting as he or she did. To this end, the accused's case must rise on its own merits:<br><blockquote>It is settled that when an accused admits [harming] the victim but invokes self-defense to escape criminal liability, the accused assumes the burden to establish his plea by credible, clear and convincing evidence; otherwise, conviction would follow from his admission that he [harmed] the victim. Self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated when uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence or when it is extremely doubtful by itself. Indeed, in invoking self-defense, the burden of evidence is shifted and the accused claiming self-defense must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>To successfully invoke self-defense, an accused must establish: "(1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Defense of a relative under Article 11 (2) of the Revised Penal Code requires the same first two (2) requisites as self-defense and, in lieu of the third "in case the provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making the defense had no part therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The first requisite - unlawful aggression - is the condition <i>sine qua non</i> of self-defense and defense of a relative:<br><blockquote>At the heart of the claim of self-defense is the presence of an unlawful aggression committed against appellant. Without unlawful aggression, self-defense will not have a leg to stand on and this justifying circumstance cannot and will not be appreciated, even if the other elements are present. Unlawful aggression refers to an attack amounting to actual or imminent threat to the life and limb of the person claiming self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>The second requisite - reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the aggression - requires a reasonable proportionality between the unlawful aggression and the defensive response: "[t]he means employed by the person invoking self-defense contemplates a rational equivalence between the means of attack and the defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This is a matter that depends on the circumstances:<br><blockquote>Reasonable necessity of the means employed does not imply material commensurability between the means of attack and defense. What the law requires is rational equivalence, in the consideration of which will enter as principal factors the emergency, the imminent danger to which the person attacked is exposed, and the instinct, more than the reason, that moves or impels the defense, and the proportionateness thereof does not depend upon the harm done, but rests upon the imminent danger of such injury . . . As WE stated in the case of People vs. Lara, in emergencies of this kind, human nature does not act upon processes of formal reason but in obedience to the instinct of self-preservation; and when it is apparent that a person has reasonably acted upon this instinct, it is the duty of the courts to sanction the act and hold the act irresponsible in law for the consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The third requisite - lack of sufficient provocation - requires the person mounting a defense to be reasonably blameless. He or she must not have antagonized or incited the attacker into launching an assault. This also requires a consideration of proportionality. As explained in <i>People v. Boholst-Caballero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> "[p]rovocation is sufficient when it is proportionate to the aggression, that is, adequate enough to impel one to attack the person claiming self-defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>We find petitioners' claims of self-defense and defense of their relative, Mercedes, to be sorely wanting.<br><br>Petitioners' entire defense rests on proof that it was Jesus who initiated an assault by barging into the premises of petitioners' residences, hacking Victor's door, and threatening physical harm upon petitioners and their companions. That is, that unlawful aggression originated from Jesus.<br><br>Contrary to what a successful averment of self-defense or defense of a relative requires, petitioners offered nothing more than a self-serving, uncorroborated claim that Jesus appeared out of nowhere to go berserk in the vicinity of their homes. They failed to present independent and credible proof to back up their assertions. The Regional Trial Court noted that it was highly dubious that Jesus would go all the way to petitioners' residences to initiate an attack for no apparent reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The remainder of petitioners' recollection of events strains credulity. They claim that Jesus launched an assault despite the presence of at least seven (7) antagonists: petitioners, Mercedes, and the four (4) other accused. They further assert that Jesus persisted on his assault despite being outnumbered, and also despite their and their co-accused's bodily efforts to restrain Jesus. His persistence was supposedly so likely to harm them that, to neutralize him, they had no other recourse but to hit him on the head with stones for at least three (3) times, and to hit him on the back with a bamboo rod, aside from dealing him with less severe blows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As the Regional Trial Court noted, however:<br><blockquote>The Court takes judicial notice of (the) big difference in the physical built of the private complainant and accused Victor Velasquez, Sonny Boy Velasquez, Felix Caballeda and Jojo del Mundo, private complainant is shorter in height and of smaller built than all the accused. The said accused could have had easily held the private complainant, who was heavily drunk as they claim, and disarmed him without the need of hitting him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>The injuries which Jesus were reported to have sustained speak volumes:<br><blockquote>3 cms lacerated wound fronto-parietal area left<br>1 cm lacerated wound frontal area left <br>Abrasion back left multi linear approximately 20 cm <br>Abrasion shoulder left, confluent 4x10 cm <br>Depressed skull fracture parietal area left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Even if it were to be granted that Jesus was the initial aggressor, the beating dealt to him by petitioners and their co-accused was still glaringly in excess of what would have sufficed to neutralize him. It was far from a reasonably necessary means to repel his supposed aggression. Petitioners thereby fail in satisfying the second requisite of self-defense and of defense of a relative.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>In addition to their tale of self-defense, petitioners insist that the testimony of Maria Teresita is not worthy of trust because she parted ways with Ana while searching for Jesus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> They characterize Maria Teresita as the prosecution's "lone eyewitness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> They make it appear that its entire case hinges on her. Thus, they theorize that with the shattering of her credibility comes the complete and utter ruin of the prosecution's case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Petitioners claim that Maria Teresita is the prosecution's lone eyewitness at the same time that they aclmowledge Jesus' testimony, which they dismissed as laden with inconsistencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>These contentions no longer merit consideration.<br><br>Petitioners' averment of justifying circumstances was dispensed with the need for even passing upon their assertions against Maria Teresita's and Jesus' testimonies. Upon their mere invocation of self-defense and defense of a relative, they relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving the acts constitutive of the offense. They took upon themselves the burden of establishing their innocence, and cast their lot on their capacity to prove their own affirmative allegations. Unfortunately for them, they failed.<br><br>Even if we were to extend them a measure of consideration, their contentions fail to impress.<br><br>Petitioners' primordial characterization of Maria Teresita as the "lone eyewitness," upon whose testimony the prosecution's case was to rise or fall, is plainly erroneous. Apart from her, Jesus testified about his own experience of being mauled by petitioners and their co-accused. Maria Teresita's testimony was only in support of what Jesus recounted.<br><br>Moreover, we fail to see how the mere fact of Maria Teresita's having parted ways with Ana while searching for Jesus diminishes her credibility. No extraordinary explanation is necessary for this. Their having proceeded separately may be accounted for simply by the wisdom of how independent searches enabled them to cover more ground in less time.<br><br>Regarding Jesus' recollection of events, petitioners' contention centers on Jesus' supposedly flawed recollection of who among the six (6) accused dealt him, which specific blow, and using which specific weapon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> These contentions are too trivial to even warrant an independent, point by point audit by this Court.<br><br>Jurisprudence is replete with clarifications that a witness' recollection of crime need not be foolproof: "Witnesses cannot be expected to recollect with exactitude every minute detail of an event. This is especially true when the witnesses testify as to facts which transpired in rapid succession, attended by flurry and excitement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This is especially true of a victim's recollection of his or her own harrowing ordeal. One who has undergone a horrifying and traumatic experience "cannot be expected to mechanically keep and then give an accurate account"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of every minutiae.<br><br>Certainly, Jesus' supposed inconsistencies on the intricacies of who struck him which specific blow can be forgiven. The merit of Jesus' testimony does not depend on whether he has an extraordinary memory despite being hit on the head multiple times. Rather, it is in his credible narration of his entire ordeal, and how petitioners and their co-accused were its authors. On this, his testimony was unequivocal.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.
