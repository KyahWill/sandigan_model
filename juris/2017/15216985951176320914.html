				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">An employee who has already qualified for optional retirement but dies before the option to retire could be exercised is entitled to his or her optional retirement benefits, which may be claimed by the qualified employee's beneficiaries on his or her behalf.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the June 21, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the October 4, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 126781, sustaining the National Labor Relations Commission's finding that Cesario Bernadas' (Cesario) beneficiaries were entitled to his optional retirement benefits.<br><br>On July 17, 1986, Cesario started working as an orderly in United Doctors Medical Center's housekeeping department. He was eventually promoted as a utility man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>United Doctors Medical Center and its rank-and-file employees had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), under which rank-and-file employees were entitled to optional retirement benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On retirement pay, the CBA provided:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE XI<br>RETIREMENT AND SEVERANCE PAY<br></div><br>SECTION 1. RETIREMENT AND SEVERANCE PAY. The CENTER shall grant each employee retirement and severance pay in accordance with law. It shall also continue its present policy on optional retirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Under the optional retirement policy, an employee who has rendered at least 20 years of service is entitled to optionally retire. The optional retirement pay is equal to a retiree's salary for 11 days per year of service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In addition to the retirement plan, employees are also provided insurance, with United Doctors Medical Center paying the premiums. The employees' family members would be the beneficiaries of the insurance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On October 20, 2009, Cesario died from a "freak accident"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> while working in a doctor's residence. He was 53 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Leonila Bernadas (Leonila), representing her deceased husband, Cesario, filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for payment of retirement benefits, damages, and attorney's fees with the National Labor Relations Commission. Leonila and her son also claimed and were able to receive insurance proceeds of P180,000.00 under the CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 31, 2011, the Labor Arbiter dismissed Leonila's Complaint. According to the Labor Arbiter, Cesario should have applied for optional retirement benefits during his lifetime, the benefits being optional. Since he did not apply for it, his beneficiaries were not entitled to claim his optional retirement benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Leonila appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In its April 30, 2012 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the National Labor Relations Commission reversed the Labor Arbiter's Decision. It found that the optional retirement plan was never presented in this case, casting a doubt on whether or not the plan required an application for optional retirement benefits before an employee could become entitled to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Considering the "constitutional mandate to afford full protection to labor,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the National Labor Relations Commission resolved the doubt in favor of Cesario. The dispositive portion of its Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated August 31, 2011 is REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. Judgment is hereby rendered finding complainant Cesario M. Bernadas is entitled to optional retirement benefit in the amount of P98,252.55 and ordering respondent United Doctors Medical Center to pay the said amount to the complainant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>United Doctors Medical Center's Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> was denied;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> hence, it filed a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On June 21, 2013, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> sustaining the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission. According to the Court of Appeals, the retirement plan and the insurance were two (2) "separate and distinct benefits"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that were granted to the employees. It held that Leonila's receipt of insurance proceeds did not bar her from being entitled to the retirement benefits under the CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>United Doctors Medical Center moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> but was denied in the Court of Appeals October 4, 2013 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Hence, this Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was filed before this Court.<br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent Cesario's beneficiaries do not have legal capacity to apply for Cesario's optional retirement benefits since respondent himself never applied for it in his lifetime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It asserts that even assuming respondent Cesario was already qualified to apply for optional retirement three (3) years prior to his death, he never did. Thus, there would have been no basis for respondent Cesario's beneficiaries to be entitled to his optional retirement benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Petitioner likewise argues that to grant respondent Cesario's beneficiaries optional retirement benefits on top of the life insurance benefits that they have already received would be equal to "double compensation and unjust enrichment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Leonila counters that had her husband died "under normal circumstances,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> he would have applied for optional retirement benefits. That Cesario was unable to apply before his death "is a procedural technicality"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that should be set aside so that "full protection to labor"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> is afforded and "the ends of social and compassionate justice"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> are met.<br><br>This Court is tasked to resolve the issue of whether or not Leonila Bernadas as her husband's representative, may claim his optional retirement benefits. However, to resolve this issue, this Court must first resolve the issue of whether or not Cesario Bernadas is entitled to receive his optional retirement benefits despite his untimely death.<br><br>This Court denies the Petition.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Jurisprudence characterizes retirement as "the result of a bilateral act of the parties, a voluntary agreement between the employer and the employee whereby the latter, after reaching a certain age, agrees to sever his or her employment with the former."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>At the outset, retirement benefits must be differentiated from insurance proceeds. One is in the concept of an indemnity while the other is conditioned on age and length of service. "A 'contract of insurance' is an agreement whereby one undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> On the other hand, retirement plans,<br><blockquote>while initially humanitarian in nature, now concomitantly serve to secure loyalty and efficiency on the part of employees, and to increase continuity of service and decrease the labor turnover, by giving to the employees some assurance of security as they approach and reach the age at which earning ability and earnings are materially impaired or at an end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, the grant of insurance proceeds will not necessarily bar the grant of retirement benefits. These are two (2) separate and distinct benefits that an employer may provide to its employees.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Within this jurisdiction, there are three (3) types of retirement plans available to employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The first is compulsory and contributory. This type of plan is embodied in Republic Act No. 8282<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> for those in the private sector and Republic Act No. 8291<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> for those in the government. These laws require a mandatory contribution from the employer as well as the employee, which shall become a pension fund for the employee upon retirement. Considering that the mandatory employee contribution is deducted from the employee's monthly income,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> "retirement packages are usually crafted as 'forced savings' on the part of the employee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Under this type of retirement plan, the pension is not considered as mere gratuity but actually forms part of the employee's compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> An employee acquires a vested right to the benefits that have become due upon reaching the compulsory age of retirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, the beneficiaries of the retired employee are entitled to the pension even after the retired employee's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The second and third types of retirement plans are voluntary. They may not even require the employee to contribute to a pension fund. The second type of retirement plan is by agreement between the employer and the employee, usually embodied in the CBA between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> "The third type is one that is voluntarily given by the employer, expressly as in an announced company policy or impliedly as in a failure to contest the employee's claim for retirement benefits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The rules regarding the second and third types of retirement plans are provided for in Article 302 [287]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the Labor Code, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which read:<br><blockquote>Article 302. [287] Retirement. - Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract.<br><br>In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: Provided, however, That an employee's retirement benefits under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided therein.<br><br>In the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.<br></blockquote>However, these types of retirement plans are not meant to be a replacement to the compulsory retirement scheme under social security laws but must be understood as a retirement plan in addition to that provided by law. <i>Llora Motors, Inc. v. Drilon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> explained:<br><blockquote>Article 287 of the Labor Code also recognizes that employers and employees may, by a collective bargaining or other agreement, set up [a] retirement plan in addition to that established by the Social Security law, but prescribes at the same time that such consensual additional retirement plan cannot be substituted for or reduce the retirement benefits available under the compulsory scheme established by the Social Security law. Such is the thrust of the second paragraph of Article 287 which directs that the employee shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits earned "under existing laws and any collective bargaining or other agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Unlike the fixed retirement ages in social security laws, Article 302 [287] of the Labor Code allows employers and employees to mutually establish an early retirement age option. The rationale for optional retirement is explained in <i>Pantranco North Express v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>In almost all countries today, early retirement, i.e., before age 60, is considered a reward for services rendered since it enables an employee to reap the fruits of his labor - particularly retirement benefits, whether lump-sum or otherwise at an earlier age, when said employee, in presumably better physical and mental condition, can enjoy them better and longer. As a matter of fact, one of the advantages of early retirement is that the corresponding retirement benefits, usually consisting of a substantial cash windfall, can early on be put to productive and profitable uses by way of income-generating investments, thereby affording a more significant measure of financial security and independence for the retiree who, up till then, had to contend with life's vicissitudes within the parameters of his fortnightly or weekly wages. Thus we are now seeing many CBAs with such early retirement provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>Optional retirement may even be done at the option of the employer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> for as long as the option was mutually agreed upon by the employer and the employee. Thus:<br><blockquote>Acceptance by the employees of an early retirement age option must be explicit, voluntary, free, and uncompelled. While an employer may unilaterally retire an employee earlier than the legally permissible ages under the Labor Code, this prerogative must be exercised pursuant to a mutually instituted early retirement plan. In other words, only the implementation and execution of the option may be unilateral, but not the adoption and institution of the retirement plan containing such option. For the option to be valid, the retirement plan containing it must be voluntarily assented to by the employees or .at least by a majority of them through a bargaining representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br></div><br>The issue in this case concerns the second type of retirement plan, or that which was provided under the employer and employees' CBA. To wit, the CBA between the parties provides:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE XI <br>RETIREMENT AND SEVERANCE PAY<br></center><br>SECTION 1. RETIREMENT AND SEVERANCE PAY. The CENTER shall grant each employee retirement and severance pay in accordance with law. It shall also continue its present policy on optional retirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>The terms and conditions of a CBA "constitute the law between the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> However, this CBA does not provide for the terms and conditions of the "present policy on optional retirement." Leonila merely alleged before the Labor Arbiter that petitioner "grants an employee a retirement or separation equivalent to eleven (11) days per year of service after serving for at least twenty (20) years,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which was not disputed by petitioner. Therefore, doubt arises as to what petitioner's optional retirement package actually entails.<br><br>It is settled that doubts must be resolved in favor of labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Moreover, "retirement laws should be liberally construed and administered in favor of the persons intended to be benefited and all doubts as to the intent of the law should be resolved in favor of the retiree to achieve its humanitarian purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Optional, by its ordinary usage, is the opposite of compulsory. It requires the exercise of an option. For this reason, petitioner insists that respondent Cesario would not have been entitled to his optional retirement benefits as he failed to exercise the option before his untimely death.<br><br>However, retirement encompasses even the concept of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This Court has considered death as a form of disability retirement as "there is no more permanent or total physical disability than death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Compulsory retirement and death both involve events beyond the employee's control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Petitioner admits that respondent Cesario was already qualified to receive his retirement benefits, having been employed by petitioner for 23 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> While the choice to retire before the compulsory age of retirement was within respondent Cesario's control, his death foreclosed the possibility of him making that choice.<br><br>Petitioner's optional retirement plan is premised on length of service, not upon reaching a certain age. It rewards loyalty and continued service by granting an employee an earlier age to claim his or her retirement benefits even if the employee has not reached his or her twilight years. It would be the height of inequity to withhold respondent Cesario's retirement benefits despite being qualified to receive it, simply because he died before he could apply for it. In any case, the CBA does not mandate that an application must first be filed by the employee before the right to the optional retirement benefits may vest. Thus, this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the retiree.<br><br>Retirement benefits are the property interests of the retiree and his or her beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The CBA does not prohibit the employee's beneficiaries from claiming retirement benefits if the retiree dies before the proceeds could be released. Even compulsory retirement plans provide mechanisms for a retiree's beneficiaries to claim any pension due to the retiree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus, Leonila, being the surviving spouse of respondent Cesario,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> is entitled to claim the optional retirement benefits on his behalf.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
