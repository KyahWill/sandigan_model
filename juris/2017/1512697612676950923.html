Rene Boy was only two (2) arms' length from Simeon when the former threatened the latter. From their position, Magdalena and Simeon saw Rene Boy beat Diego as there was no obstruction to their view.

Together with Junnel and his wife, they rode a tricycle and reached their destination at around 10:00 a.m. After lunch, Rene Boy claimed that he and his wife immediately went home to check on the charcoal he was making.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It was only when he was arrested on October 6, 2007 that he discovered that he was one (1) of the suspects for Diego's death.

However, he later admitted that he learned about Junnel's apprehension but not his father's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> During trial, Rene Boy alleged that Junnel suggested leaving the party as only pancit and juice were served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> He gave inconsistent answers on the actual time of Junnel's invitation to leave.

The parties were then ordered to file their supplemental briefs, should they so desired, within 30 days from notice. </p><p> On May 6, 2014, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> on behalf of the People of the Philippines stating that it would no longer file a supplemental brief. A similar Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> was filed on May 9, 2014 by the Public Attorney's Office on behalf of Rene Boy. </p><p> The sole issue for resolution is whether or not Rene Boy Dimapilit's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. </p><p> Rene Boy underscores the material inconsistencies in Magdalena's testimony and insists that they cannot serve as a basis for finding him guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> 1) Magda[lena] stated that she saw accused Junnel as the one who boxed Diego which statement she negated during the next hearing when she claimed that it was Joel; 2) Magda[lena] was insistent that she was with Simeon, the victim's brother, when she went to the place of the incident, which is in contradiction to her initial report wherein she never mentioned of Simeon; 3) Magda[lena] hid herself behind a mango tree because she feared for her life and still managed to witness what really transpired on that fateful afternoon which according to the defense is inconsistent to human experience because if it were true, she should have been too afraid to peek and see for herself what was happening; and 4) She never asked anyone for help which is contrary to human experience that a person whose loved one is being assaulted will just stand, wait and do nothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Furthermore, Rene boy argues that the trial court erred in equating the idea that Magdalena could have no other motive than to ensure justice to "the conclusion that a witness is credible because the defense has not shown any ill motive that would motivate him or her to falsely testify."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Citing <em>People v. Rodrigo</em>, the conclusion only pertains to "third parties who are detached from and who have no personal interest in the incident that gave rise to the trial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> In this case, he claimed that a common-law wife is not a detached witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Her testimony "should be handled with the realistic thought that they have . . . material and emotional ties to the subject of litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Her testimony cannot be readily accepted as credible merely because the defense failed to prove any ill motive on her part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> Accordingly, he argues, the trial court could not automatically disregard his defense of denial since "not all denials should be regarded as fabricated, emphasizing that if the accused is truly innocent, he [or she] can have no other defense but denial and alibi."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p><p> He then concludes that "not all the elements of [murder] were proven with moral certainty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General maintains that the minor inconsistencies in Magdalena's testimony do not affect her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> Magdalena herself was shocked when she narrated that it was Junnel, not Joel, who boxed Diego. At that time, Magdalena was emotional when she recounted the traumatic incident that happened. Hence, Magdalena did not deliberately intend to commit the alleged contradictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Provided that the witness' testimonies conform to material points, "the slight clashing statements dilute neither the witness' credibility nor the veracity of [his or her] testimonies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p> Furthermore, Magdalena's testimony on how Diego was hit with a crow bar and a piece of wood was substantiated by the medico-legal report. Similarly, PO3 Bulaclac's testimony corroborated Magdalena's narration of events regarding the injuries sustained by Diego and regarding Simeon's presence in the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p><p> Nevertheless, regardless of who really overtook Diego, Magdalena's testimony "as a whole is sufficient to support [Rene Boy's] conviction. There could be no mistake as to the identity of all the assailants, since the killing happened at daytime and Magdalena was just two arms['] length or more away from the crime scene."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the relationship itself of a witness to an accused or complainant does not automatically discredit him or her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> On the contrary, "kinship by blood or marriage to the victim would deter one from implicating innocent persons, as one's natural interest would be to secure conviction of the real culprit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the Solicitor General asserts that denial cannot overcome a credible witness' positive identification of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Given that all the elements of murder were present and proven in this case, Rene Boy's conviction is warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></p><p> The appeal lacks merit. </p><p align="center"><strong> I</strong> </p><p> Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> prescribes murder.

Magdalena directed to the accused as one (1) of the (4) offenders. She testified that on February 11, 2007, Pastor, Junnel, Rene Boy, and Joel "mutually helped each other in beating and stabbing" Diego. On the other hand, Rene Boy denies participation asserting that he knew nothing about Diego's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> In resolving Diego's appeal, this Court necessarily ' ascertains the credibility of Magdalena's testimony as a witness for the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> </p><p> It is already established that "assignment of values to the testimony of a witness is virtually left, almost entirely, to the trial court which has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness on the stand."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Except for significant matters "that might have been overlooked or discarded, the findings of credibility by the trial court will not generally be disturbed on appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p><p> The trial court explicitly stated that Magdalena's testimony was categorical and consistent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Based on the evidence presented before it, the trial court sustained the prosecution's stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Given that the trial court ruling on the credibility of Magdalena's testimony was also affirmed by the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> this Court does not see any reason to deviate from the general rule. Hence, this Court is persuaded that Rene Boy participated in the killing since Magdalena has given a detailed account of the incident and has positively identified him as one (1) of the assailants. </p><p> However, Rene Boy hinges on the purported inconsistencies in Magdalena's testimony to assail her credibility. </p><p> The alleged inconsistencies in Magdalena's testimony only pertain to minor details. Hence, they do not affect her credibility. What is essential is that there are no material contradictions in her "complete and vivid narration [on] the principal occurrence and the positive identification" of the accused as one (1) of the main offenders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> </p><p> Admittedly, there were discrepancies between Magdalena's testimony before the court and her sworn statement. While she mentioned in court that she went with Simeon to follow Diego at Pastor's house, she failed to disclose this information in her sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This failure, however, does not automatically cast doubt on her credibility as a witness. As explained in <em>People v. Nelmida</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Inconsistencies between the sworn statement and direct testimony given in open court do not necessarily discredit the witness. <em><strong>An affidavit, being taken ex-parte, is oftentimes incomplete and is generally regarded as inferior to the testimony of the witness in open court.</strong></em> Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that testimonies given during trial are much more exact and elaborate than those stated in sworn statements, which are usually incomplete and inaccurate for a variety of reasons. More so, because of the partial and innocent suggestions, or for want of specific inquiries. In addition, an extrajudicial statement or affidavit is generally not prepared by the affiant himself [or herself] but by another who uses his [or her] own language in writing the affiant's statement, hence, omissions and misunderstandings by the writer are not infrequent. Indeed, the prosecution witnesses' direct and categorical declarations on the witness stand are superior to their extrajudicial statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Whether Magdalena was alone or with Simeon in following Diego to Pastor's house does not really matter. "An inconsistency, which has nothing to do with the elements of a crime, is not a ground to reverse a conviction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> </p><p> Magdalena's confusion with the names of the accused also does not affect her credibility as a witness. It is possible that she might have interchanged the name of "Junnel" to "Joel" due to their vivid similarity. This Court cannot assume that Magdalena would deliver errorless narrations while recalling the details of the harrowing killing incident. Instead of weakening her credibility, the trivial lapses strengthen her statements as they indicate that she was not "coached or [her] answers contrived."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the fact that Magdalena did not ask for help is not contrary to human experience. She clearly saw how the four (4) assailants took turns in beating Diego to death as the incident happened in broad daylight. Similarly, she heard how Rene Boy threatened Simeon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Probably, out of fear for her life, Magdalena was constrained to be mum and helpless. "Witnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> Hence, the trivial inconsistencies in Magdalena's testimony do not affect the fact that she witnessed how Rene Boy participated in killing Diego. </p><p> Furthermore, Magdalena's testimony on how the assailants took turns in beating and injuring Diego with their weapons was substantiated by the testimony and medico-legal report of Dr. Valientes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> </p><p> Magdalena recounted that Diego became unconscious when Pastor hit his head with a piece of wood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Concomitantly, Dr. Valientes concluded that some of Diego's wounds were "caused by a bladed weapon considering that the edges of these wounds were smooth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> </p><p> Similarly, Magdalena also narrated how Rene Boy hit Diego's face with a crowbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Accordingly, Dr. Valientes also found that the other wounds sustained by Diego were due to a "hard object like a piece of wood or an iron bar."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals correctly pointed out that Magdalena's statements were corroborated by the testimony of PO3 Bulaclac regarding the following: </p><blockquote> <p> 1) the receipt of a report of a killing incident; 2) finding victim sprawled on the road with wounds on his face from a bladed weapon; 3) the victim sustained injury in his jaw and hematoma in the left side of his body and left arm; 4) victim's tricycle of more or less twenty (20) meters away from the cadaver; and 5) they found Magdalena together with Simeon, her brother, in the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Magdalena's testimony was irrefutably supported by evidence. Hence, this cannot be outweighed by Rene Boy's baseless denial. This Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Denial, like alibi, as an exonerating justification, is inherently weak and if uncorroborated, regresses to blatant impotence. Like alibi, it also constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><strong> II</strong> </p><p> In a further attempt to evade liability, Rene Boy asserts that the trial court erred in automatically accepting Magdalena's testimony as credible merely because the defense allegedly failed to prove that she had basis to falsely charge him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Citing <em>People v. Rodrigo</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> he concludes that this assumption cannot apply to Magdalena as it only applies to detached third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> </p><p> The factual milieu of <em>Rodrigo</em> is different from the case at bar. </p><p> In <em>Rodrigo</em>, a restaurant owned by spouses Paquito (Paquito) and Rosita (Rosita) Buna was robbed by three (3) armed men. One (1) of the assailants fired at Paquito three (3) times, causing his death. Based on the sworn statement of Rosita, Lee Rodrigo (Rodrigo) was one (1) of the assailants. The two (2) others, however, remained at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> </p><p> An Information for special complex crime of robbery with homicide was filed against Rodrigo.

The Court of Appeals, however, modified the award of civil indemnity. It underscored that Rosita had positively identified him from the photo given to her at the police station. Then months later, she saw him at San Jose del Monte Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Also, Rosita pointed to Rodrigo in court as one (1) of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> </p><p> Rodrigo appealed before this Court, pointing out the inconsistencies in Rosita's testimony. Allegedly, Rosita's inconsistencies coupled by Rodrigo's defense of denial corroborated that he was not at the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> He also asserted that the recognition made through photograph was not enough to prove that he was one (1) of the assailants because this kind of identification impaired the witness' credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> </p><p> Purportedly, Rosita's action was only "expected from someone who had just lost a loved one unexpectedly."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> He insisted that before claiming that "positive identification prevails over denial or alibi." the identification must be "positive and beyond question."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> </p><p> This Court <em><strong>acquitted </strong></em>Rodrigo of the charge since his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> This Court ruled that since Rosita's identification would be the <em><strong>sole </strong></em>basis for Rodrigo's conviction, it should be handled with great caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Thus, the flawed procedure in the photographic identification made the witness' recognition undependable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> This Court concluded that: </p><blockquote> <p> In the context of this case, the investigators might not have been fair to Rodrigo if they themselves, purposely or unwittingly, fixed in the mind of Rosita, or at least actively prepared her mind to, the thought that Rodrigo was one of the robbers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Among others, this Court also considered the fact that "Rosita did not know the robbers" and "she [only] saw them for the first time during the robbery."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Hence, </p><blockquote> <p> This fact can make a lot of difference as human experience tells us: in the recognition of faces, the mind is more certain when the faces relate to those already in the mind's memory bank; conversely, it is not easy to recall or identify someone we have met only once or whose appearance we have not fixed in our mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Nothing in the records revealed that the witnesses' statements were instantly gathered after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Thus, there was no point of comparison between Rosita's immediate memory of the assailants' description and her subsequent identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Further, this Court also discussed that: </p><blockquote> <p> <em><strong>Separately from these considerations</strong></em>, we entertain serious doubts about the validity of the reasoning, made by both the trial and the appellate courts, that a <em><strong>widow's testimony — <u>particularly, her identification of the accused</u> — should be accepted and held as credible simply because the defense failed to show by evidence that she had reasons to falsify.</strong></em> </p> <p> Arguably, a widow who testifies about the killing of her husband has no motive other than to see that justice is done so that her testimony should be considered totally credible. This assumption, however, is not the same as the conclusion that a witness is credible because the defense has not shown any ill motive that would motivate him or her to falsely testify. Strictly speaking, this conclusion should apply only to third parties who are detached from and who have no personal interest in the incident that gave rise to the trial. Because of their presumed detachment, the testimonies of these detached parties can be presumed credible unless impugned by the adverse party through a showing of an ill or ulterior motive on the part of the witnesses. </p> <p> The presumed detachment that applies to third parties obviously cannot apply to a widow whose husband has been killed, or for that matter, to a relative whose kin is the victim, when the testimony of the widow or the relative is offered in the trial of the killer. The widow or the relatives are not detached or disinterested witnesses; they are parties who suffered and experienced pain as a result of the killing. In fact, they are better characterized as <em>aggrieved parties</em> as even the law recognizes them as such through the grant of indemnities and damages ... </p> <p> Thus, the testimonies from aggrieved parties should not simplistically be equated to or treated as testimonies from detached parties. Their testimonies should be handled with the realistic thought that they come from parties with material and emotional ties to the subject of the litigation so that they cannot be accepted and held as credible simply because the defense has not adduced evidence of ill-motivation. <em><strong>It is in this light that we have examined Rosita's identification of Rodrigo, and we hold as unpersuasive the lower courts' conclusion that Rosita deserved belief because the defense had not adduced any evidence that she had motives to falsely testify. <u>The better rule, to our mind, t is that the testimony of Rosita, as an aggrieved party, must stand, on its independent merits, not on any failure of the defense to adduce evidence of ill-motivation</u>.</strong></em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>Rodrigo</em>, the procedure in the photographic identification was already flawed from the beginning. Accordingly, in that case, this Court was constrained to doubt the lower court ruling that the witness' testimony, <em><u>especially her identification of the accused</u></em>, "should be accepted and held as credible" for the failure of the defense to adduce evidence that Rosita had reasons to fabricate such allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> </p><p> Unlike the witness in <em>Rodrigo</em>, Magdalena's testimony can stand on its own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Her identification of Rene Boy was <em><strong>unquestionable</strong></em> since she knew the accused even before the incident happened. She even referred to them as known troublemakers in their place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> </p><p> Contrary to Rene Boy's imputation, the trial court in this case did not automatically accept Magdalena's testimony as credible on the ground that the defense failed to show any proof that Magdalena had reasons to falsely testify against him. A perusal of its decision showed that after considering the pertinent elements of the charge, the trial court merely added that conclusion: </p><blockquote> <p> <em><strong>Untarnished with ill motive to falsely testify against the accused</strong></em>, witness Magdalena Apasan is certainly a credible witness whose testimony should be, as it has been, accorded due weight and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, the fact that Magdalena had no apparent motives against Rene Boy <em><strong>only corroborated</strong></em> the totality of evidence which favored the prosecution's case. After considering Magdalena's well-substantiated testimony and reliable identification of the accused, the trial court accordingly gave more credence to her as a witness rather than Rene Boy's baseless denial. </p><p align="center"><strong> III</strong> </p><p> Diego's killing was qualified by treachery.</p><p> Treachery exists "when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> For treachery to be appreciated, two (2) elements should be proven: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) [T]he employment of means of execution that gives the persons attacked no opportunity to defend themselves or retaliate; and (2) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Diego went to Pastor's house, believing in good faith that Pastor would just borrow his tricycle. Diego was never forewarned that danger awaits his destination, He even assured Magdalena that he would immediately return since he would be sending off his brother to Mindoro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> Not expecting any peril for his life, he proceeded to Pastor's house "<em><strong>unarmed and alone</strong></em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> </p><p> The four (4) accused took turns in beating and hitting him.

Joel then punched him on the face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> Consequently, Pastor hit him with a piece of wood rendering him <em><strong>unconscious</strong></em>. Despite this, however, Rene Boy still proceeded to hit him with a crowbar. Rene Boy seemingly assured himself that Diego would not be able to endure the attack. With these, the four (4) accused succeeded in killing him "without risk to themselves."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> Collectively, these are indicative of treachery. Hence, the means employed by the assailants were knowingly sought to ensure Diego's death. </p><p> As to evident premeditation, the following must concur to ascertain its presence: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) [T]he time when the accused determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between such determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the circumstances of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> "The essence of evident premeditation is that the execution of the criminal act must be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the prosecution failed to present any evidence showing that the acts of the assailants "were preceded by a reflection that led to a determined plan to kill [Diego] after sufficient time had passed from the [inception] of the plan."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> "In the absence of clear and positive evidence, mere presumptions and inferences of evident premeditation, no matter how logical and probable, are insufficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> </p><p> Abuse of superior strength, however, attended Diego's killing. </p><p> There is abuse of superior strength "whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor/s that is plainly and obviously advantageous to the aggressor/s and purposely selected or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> </p><p> Abuse of superior strength means "to purposely <em><strong>use force excessively out of proportion</strong></em> to the means of defense available to the person attacked."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Thus, in considering this aggravating circumstance, this Court looks into "the age, size and strength of the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> </p><p> Diego was 72 years old when he was killed. His assailants, namely, Pastor, Rene Boy, and Junnel were respectively 50, 27, and 18 years old. Given the disparity in their ages, the assailants were physically stronger than the victim.
