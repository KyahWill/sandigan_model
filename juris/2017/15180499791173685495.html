Emily and Pong were walking ahead of them and did not notice that they were already arrested. When Emily and Pong looked back, the two did not concern themselves with what transpired. They were taken to a parking lot near the Makati Tower Hotel. Inside the Innova, he saw through the back mirror that Pong and Emily were talking to the operatives;<br><br></li><li>On their way to BSP, their cellphones were taken.

The assailed Decision dated February 6, 2014 is AFFIRMED in all respects.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br></blockquote>Initially, Romeo signified his intention to appeal his case. However, he decided to withdraw his appeal through a letter dated March 16, 2017.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On October 7, 2016, Edwina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Whether or not the CA erred in affirming the conviction of petitioner Edwina Rimando.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of this Court</b><br></center><br>Inarguably, the resolution of the issues raised by petitioner in her Brief requires us to inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence presented, including the credibility of the witnesses, a course of action which this Court, as a general rule, will not do, consistent with our repeated holding that this Court is not a trier of facts. Well-settled is the rule that only questions of law should be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45. This Court is not a trier of facts and will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the appellate court, when supported by substantial evidence, are fmal, binding or conclusive on the parties and upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>But where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is the unique nature of an appeal in a criminal case that the appeal throws the whole case open for review and it is the duty of the appellate court to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After a careful review of the records of the case, we sustain the ruling of the CA with respect to the validity of the entrapment operation conducted by the BSP agents and its findings as to the existence of all the elements of the crime of illegal possession and use of false treasury bank notes as defined under Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code. The CA did not also commit grave abuse of discretion in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and on the basis thereof, convicted Romeo.<br><br>Having charged that petitioner acted in conspiracy with Romeo, it was, however, incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that both the accused had come to an agreement concerning the commission of the crime and decided to execute the agreement.<br><br>In holding that petitioner conspired with Romeo, the CA quoted with approval the trial court's observation, to wit:<br><blockquote>Notwithstanding that Edwina's part1c1pation on September 14, 2012 seemed merely to accompany her husband Romeo, the commonality of intent to pass on and sell counterfeit US$ notes was evident and inferable from the following circumstances: (1) it was husband Romeo who offered to sell the counterfeit US$ notes to the agent of the BSP; (2) Edwina accompanied her husband to Makati City coming all the way from their residence in Quezon City; (3) upon arrival at the designated meeting place, which was in front of the Original Savory restaurant along Makati Avenue, she merely distanced herselffrom her husband and Agent Muñez but did not leave them alone entirely; (4) when her husband handed over to her the marked money, she willingly accepted and placed it inside her handbag; (5) upon receipt of the marked money she and her husband proceeded to leave the place together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>We do not agree.<br><br>It bears stressing that conspiracy requires the same degree of proof required to establish the crime beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, mere presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission without proof of cooperation or agreement to cooperate is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In this regard, our ruling in <i>Bahilidad v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> is instructive, thus:<br><blockquote>There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy is not presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, all taken together, however, the evidence must be strong enough to show the community of criminal design. For conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense. Conspiracy is the product of intentionality on the part of the cohorts.<br><br>It is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt act as a direct or indirect contribution to the execution of the crime committed. The overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators. Hence, the mere presence of an accused at the discussion of a conspiracy, even approval of it, without any active participation in the same, is not enough for purposes of conviction.<br></blockquote>In the instant case, we find petitioner's participation in the crime not adequately proved with moral certainty. There were no overt acts attributed to her adequate to hold her equally guilty of the crime proved.<br><br>Article 168 of the RPC, under which petitioner was charged, provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 168. <i>Illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit</i>. Unless the act be one of those coming under the provisions of any of the preceding articles, any person who shall knowingly use or have in his possession, with intent to use any of the false or falsified instruments referred to in this section, shall suffer the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed in said articles.<br></blockquote>The elements of the crime charged for violation of said law are: (1) that any treasury or bank note or certificate or other obligation and security payable to bearer, or any instrument payable to order or other document of credit not payable to bearer is forged or falsified by another person; (2) that the offender knows that any of the said instruments is forged or falsified; and (3) that he either used or <i>possessed with intent to use</i> any of such forged or falsified instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>None of these elements are present in the case of petitioner. The prosecution was not able to prove that she was even aware of the counterfeit US$ notes. Moreover, there was no showing that petitioner had a hand or active participation in the consummation of the illegal transaction. In fact, petitioner was not present during the test-buy operation conducted by the team of Alex Muñez nor was she spotted during the surveillance.<br><br>Mere presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission is not, by itself, sufficient to establish conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> To establish conspiracy, evidence of actual cooperation rather than mere cognizance or approval of an illegal act is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Nevertheless, mere knowledge, acquiescence or approval of the act, without the cooperation or agreement to cooperate, is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy, but that there must be intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The fact that petitioner accompanied her husband at the restaurant and allowed her husband to place the money inside her bag would not be sufficient to justify the conclusion that conspiracy existed. In order to hold an accused liable as co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he or she must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or in furtherance of conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>This Court has held that an overt or external act<br><blockquote>is defined as some physical activity or deed, indicating the intention to commit a particular crime, more than a mere planning or preparation, which if carried out to its complete termination following its natural course, without being frustrated by external obstacles nor by the spontaneous desistance of the perpetrator, will logically and necessarily ripen into a concrete offense. The <i>raison d'etre</i> for the law requiring a direct overt act is that, in a majority of cases, the conduct of the accused consisting merely of acts of preparation has never ceased to be equivocal; and this is necessarily so, irrespective of his declared intent. It is that quality of being equivocal that must be lacking before the act becomes one which may be said to be a commencement of the commission of the crime, or an overt act or before any fragment of the crime itself has been committed, and this is so for the reason that so long as the equivocal quality remains, no one can say with certainty what the intent of the accused is. It is necessary that the overt act should have been the ultimate step towards the consummation of the design. It is sufficient if it was the first or some subsequent step in a direct movement towards the commission of the offense after the preparations are made. The act done need not constitute the last proximate one for completion. It is necessary, however, that the attempt must have a causal relation to the intended crime.
