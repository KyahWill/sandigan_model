Acting on the said tip, Intelligence Agent 1 Joshua V. Arquero (IA1 Arquero) immediately organized a buy-bust operation, which was coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Regional Office and the Philippine National Police (PNP). IA1 Arquero then instructed the informant to order P500.00 worth of<em> shabu</em> from Geronimo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> At around nine (9) o'clock in the evening, the buy-bust team composed of IA1 Arquero, Intelligence Officer (IO) 1 Crisanto Lorilla (IO1 Lorilla), IO 2 Lorenzo Advincula (IO2 Advincula),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> a certain IO1 Camayang, and one IO1 Mellion reached the target area in Narra Street, Barangay 171, Caloocan City and conducted a quick surveillance thereof. Moments later, Geronimo arrived, took out from his right pocket a transparent plastic sachet containing a suspected shabu, and handed it over to the poseur-buyer, IO1 Lorilla, who, in turn, paid him with the buy-bust money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Shortly after, IO1 Lorilla lit a cigarette to signal the rest of the team that the transaction was completed, prompting IO2 Advincula to rush towards the scene to arrest Geronimo. Subsequently, IO1 Lorilla and IO2 Advincula frisked Geronimo's pockets. IO1 Lorilla recovered the buy-bust money, while IO2 Advincula recovered the marijuana leaves wrapped in a newspaper and gave them to the former. The team proceeded to the headquarters in Quezon City, and the confiscated items were supposedly marked, photographed, and inventoried by IO1 Lorilla in the presence of Geronimo and Barangay <em>Kagawad</em> Jose Y. Ruiz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> After conducting the inventory, IO1 Lorilla secured the letter-request for laboratory examination from IO1 Jay son R. Albao and delivered the specimens to the PNP Crime Laboratory for testing. Consequently, the specimens were received and examined by Forensic Chemist Jappeth M. Santiago, who later on revealed that the substance found in the plastic sachet tested positive for the presence of <em>methamphetamine hydrochloride</em> and<em> mefenorex</em>, while the other wrapped specimen tested positive for the presence of marijuana, all dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> For his part, Geronimo interposed the defenses of denial and frame-up, maintaining that at the time of the incident, he was drinking at the house of his friend Julian Faura, Jr. (Faura) when three (3) unidentified armed men suddenly arrived and forced him to board a white Toyota Revo. There, he noticed that his girlfriend Elaine Cabral (Cabral), whom he recently had an argument with, was inside the vehicle as well. According to Geronimo, Cabral suddenly slapped him, while the other men repeatedly hit him. Geronimo claimed that he was then brought to the PDEA office, where he was forced to drink something and urinate in a small bottle. Subsequently, the police officers allegedly brought out several plastic sachets, placed them on the table, and instructed Geronimo to stand before it while they took pictures of the same. During trial, Geronimo pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged and presented Faura as his witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated October 7, 2013, the RTC found Geronimo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165 and, accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (<em>a</em>) in Crim. Case No. C-83928, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00; and (<em>b</em>) in Crim. Case No. C-83929, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It held that all the essential elements of the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs were duly proven. On the other hand, Geronimo's defenses of denial and frame-up failed to create reasonable doubt in view of his positive identification as the culprit, as well as the presumption of regularity accorded to police officers in the discharge of their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the RTC declared that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were shown to have been preserved from the time of seizure to receipt by the forensic chemist up to presentation in court. It added that the requisite marking of seized items immediately upon their confiscation at the place of arrest is not absolute and can thus be done at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team, given that there is no exact definition of the phrase "immediately upon confiscation in Philippine Jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> Aggrieved, Geronimo elevated his conviction to the Court of Appeals (CA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated December 18, 2014, the CA affirmed<em> in toto</em> the ruling of the RTC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> finding that all the necessary elements of the crimes charged have been adequately proven. Moreover, Geronimo failed to prove that the evidence was tampered or meddled with, and that the police officers improperly performed their duties; and on the contrary, it was shown that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Hence, this appeal.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Geronimo's conviction for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, as respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165, should be upheld.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p>At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review and, thus, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> In this case, Geronimo was charged with the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. For the successful prosecution of unauthorized sale of dangerous drugs, it is necessary that the essential elements thereof are proven beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: (<em>a</em>) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (<em>b</em>) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On the other hand, in cases wherein an accused is charged with illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements to warrant his conviction: (<em>a</em>) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (<em>b</em>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<em>c</em>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> In both cases, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established with moral certainty. Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubts on the identity of the dangerous drugs, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same. It must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the <em>corpus delicti</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Relatedly, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 provides the chain of custody rule, outlining the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the seized drugs, in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Under the said section, the apprehending team shall, among others, <b><u>immediately after seizure and confiscation</u> conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items <u>in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, and any elected public official</u></b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same; and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28</sup> In the case of <em>People v. Mendoza</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court stressed that "<b><u>[w]ithout the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the Department of Justice, or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' or contamination of the evidence</u></b> that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA No. 6425 (<i>Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972</i>) again reared their ugly heads as to <b><u>negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugs] that were evidence herein of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.</u></b> Indeed, the x x x presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 - which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> - provide that <b>the said inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless seizure</b>, and that <b>non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 - <u>under justifiable grounds</u> -will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items <u>so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR does not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<em>a</em>) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; <b><u>and</u></b> (<em>b</em>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In <em>People v. Almorfe</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <b>the Court explained that <u>for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Also, in <em>People v. De Guzman</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> it was emphasized that <b><u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact</u>, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Geronimo prayed for his acquittal in light of the police officers' non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR and their failure to proffer a plausible explanation therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In particular, he claims that the inventory and certification was neither done in the presence of nor signed by a representative from the DOJ and the media.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> The appeal is meritorious. </p><p> An examination of the records reveals that although the requisite inventory and photography of the seized items were conducted in the presence of Geronimo and an elected public official, the same was not done in the presence of the representatives from the DOJ and the media. In an attempt to justify such absence, IA1 Arquero testified that: </p><blockquote> <p> ATTY QUILAS: </p> <p>Q: You said you are a team leader and you knew for a fact the requirements that in the subsequent inventory, an elected official, a representative from the Media, a representative from the Department of Justice, you know for a fact that they are required, is not that correct? </p> <p> [IA1 ARQUERO]:</p> <p> A: In Section 21 of RA 9165 that is a requirement and prior to that operation is a buy-bust operation. <u>So, in the buy-bust operation we don't need to comply with the requirements, we don't need to call the Media Representative, an elected official and a Representative from the D.O.J. unless there is a search warrant were taken briefly to go with the apprehending officers in entering the house. In the buy-bust operation we don't do that, sir</u>.</p> <p> x x x x (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the foregoing testimony, the justification given by IA1 Arquero was grossly insufficient and without legal basis. It appears that he clearly misunderstood the law and its application in buy-bust operations. The law mandates the apprehending team to follow the prescribed procedure under Section 21 of RA 9165 mainly to ensure the proper chain of custody and avoid the possibility of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence. There is nothing in the law which exempts the apprehending officers from securing the presence of an elected public official and a representative from the DOJ or media, particularly in instances when they are not equipped with a search warrant as claimed by IA1 Arquero. In fact, RA 9165 and its IRR explicitly provide that non-compliance with the required procedure can only be allowed under exceptional circumstances, provided that justifiable grounds are given and proven as a fact therefor by the apprehending officers, which IA1 Arquero likewise failed to show in this case. </p><p> Moreover, records reveal that the said inventory and photography of the seized items were not done at the place of arrest but at the office of the apprehending officers in Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City. During IA1 Arquero's direct examination, he maintained that since the area of operation was "so dark" and "risky," he decided to instruct the buy-bust team to conduct said processes at their office, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> PROS CANSINO:</p> <p> Q: You said after effecting the arrest and apprising the accused of his violation and constitutional rights and you proceeded to your office, why did you not conduct the required inventory, photograph and marking at the place of operation? </p> <p> [IA1 ARQUERO:]</p> <p> A: <u>Because the area is so dark and there are many people there may be the cohorts of the suspect so being the team leader and the area may be risky, I ordered them to withdraw and conduct the inventory and photography of the said item to the nearest station which is in our office at [Brgy.l Pinyahan, Quezon City, sir.</u> x x x x (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On the contrary, I02 Advincula earlier testified that the apprehending team went directly to their office to conduct the inventory even if there was no threat to their security and safety at the place of Geronimo's arrest: </p><blockquote> <p> [ATTY. QUILAS:]</p> <p> Q: And despite of the fact that you were armed you just left the area after the arrest of the suspect?</p> <p> [IO2 ADVINCULA:] A: Yes, sir.</p> <p> Q: And went ahead directly to your office and conduct inventory? </p> <p>A: Yes, sir.</p> <p> Q: <u>There was not even a threat, serious threat on your team after the arrest of the suspect, is not that right?</u></p> <p> A: <u>None, sir.</u></p> <p> x x x x (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, there were inconsistencies in the statements of the members of the apprehending team as to why the requisite inventory and photography were not done immediately after seizure and confiscation of the dangerous drugs and at the place of Geronimo's arrest. While the law allows that the same may be done at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team, the police officers must nevertheless provide justifiable grounds therefor in order for the saving clause to apply. Here, the apprehending officers failed to discharge that burden.</p><p> Accordingly, the plurality of the breaches of procedure committed by the police officers, unacknowledged and unexplained by the State, militate against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against the accused, as the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> had been compromised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It is well-settled that the procedure in Section 21 of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As such, since the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, as well as its IRR, Geronimo's acquittal is perforce in order.</p><p> As a final note, it is fitting to mention that "the Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy their intentions. Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. Order is too high a price for the loss of liberty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
