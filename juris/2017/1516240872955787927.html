Tejano (Tejano) against Presiding Judge Antonio D. Marigomen (Judge Marigomen) and Utility Worker Emeliano C. Camay, Jr. (Camay), both of Branch 61, Regional Trial Court, Bogo City, Cebu.

Trinidad (Judge Trinidad) of Branch 64, Regional Trial Court, Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental was designated as the new Assisting Judge of Branch 61, Regional Trial Court, Bogo City, Cebu. As Assisting Judge, Judge Trinidad was directed to take cognizance of all the cases handled by the former Assisting Judge, Judge Himalaloan. Judge Trinidad was likewise directed to take cognizance of cases where Presiding Judge Marigomen inhibited, those newly filed, and those where trial had not yet begun, i.e., where "the accused or any of the accused in a criminal case ha[d] not yet been arraigned," and civil cases where pre-trial had yet to be conducted or terminated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In 2013 and during the pendency of the civil case, Tejano filed a criminal complaint for violation of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act against Andrino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This criminal case was raffled to Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City presided by Judge Bienvenido R.

When this Administrative Order was issued on September 17, 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> trial in the civil case had not yet begun, with the pre-trial allegedly conducted only on January 7, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On her charge of gross ignorance of the law, Tejano alleged that Judge Marigomen issued the Order of Release on May 9, 2013 with no standing warrant of arrest against Andrino, in violation of Rule 114, Section 1 of the Rules of Court. The Warrant of Arrest was issued by Judge Saniel only on May 30, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>As for Camay, Tejano charged him with violating the Anti-Red Tape Act for allegedly fixing Andrino's bail application and facilitating police assistance to Andrino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It was also Camay who allegedly convinced Andrino to file the civil case against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Judge Marigomen and Camay filed their respective Comments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on September 17, 2013.<br><br>According to Judge Marigomen, he granted Andrino's Motion to try the civil case because the former Assisting Judge, Judge Himalaloan, had not been conducting hearings since 2012. He also did not anticipate that a new Assisting Judge would be assigned to Branch 61. Therefore, he continued on hearing the civil case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>As to Andrino's bail bond, Judge Marigomen approved it in the exercise of his sound discretion. He argued that in applications for bail, the stringent application of the Rules of Court may be relaxed in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>For his part, Camay admitted that he assisted Andrino in posting bail but only because he was a public employee obliged to do so. He denied that he was a fixer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and claimed that he had no personal interest in the outcome of the civil case filed by Andrino against Tejano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator found Judge Marigomen guilty of gross ignorance of the law and of violating Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars. However, it dismissed the complaint for violation of the Anti-Red Tape Act against Camay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>According to the Office of the Court Administrator, Judge Marigomen violated Administrative Order Nos. 113-2011 and 137-2012 by taking cognizance of the civil case for declaration of absolute nullity of deed of sale cognizable only by Assisting Judge Himalaloan and, subsequently, by Judge Trinidad. That Judge Himalaloan had not been hearing cases since 2012 was not an excuse for granting Andrino's Motion to handle and try the case. The Office of the Court Administrator stated that Judge Marigomen could have sought guidance from this Court on how to remedy the continued delay in the proceedings. Furthermore upon the designation of Judge Trinidad as the new Assisting Judge, Judge Marigomen should have transferred the civil case, considering that it was still at its pre-trial stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>For violating Supreme Court Administrative Order Nos. 113-2011 and 137-2012, Judge Marigomen was found guilty of an offense considered a less serious charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The Office of the Court Administrator recommended that Judge Marigomen be fined the amount of P10,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In addition, Judge Marigomen was found guilty of improperly applying the rules on bail bond applications. Under Rule 114, Section 17(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, bail may be posted in another court only if the judge where the case is pending is absent or unavailable. The Office of the Court Administrator found that Judge Marigomen failed to prove that Judge Saniel, the judge of the court where the criminal case against Andrino was pending, was absent or unavailable. In addition, there was no standing warrant of arrest against Andrino at the time he posted bail on May 9, 2013. The Warrant of Arrest was issued only on May 30, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For granting Andrino's bail despite the absence of a warrant of arrest, Judge Marigomen was found guilty of gross ignorance of the law. Considering that it was his second offense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Judge Marigomen was fined with the maximum amount allowable, specifically, P40,000.00 and was sternly warned that repeating the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Without discussing the reasons for its finding, the Office of the Court Administrator found no merit in the Complaint against Camay, and hence, recommended its dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Office of the Court Administrator made the following recommendations in its Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated April 4, 2016:<br><br><blockquote><b><u>RECOMMENDATION</u></b>: It is respectfully recommended for the consideration of the Honorable Court that:<br><ol><li>the instant administrative complaint against Hon.

However, Judge Marigomen granted Andrino's Motion to try the civil case, m violation of this Administrative Order.<br><br>Assuming that Judge Himalaloan had repeatedly postponed hearings, Judge Marigomen should have instead sought the guidance of this Court on how to address the delay in the proceedings. After all, the Constitution grants this Court the power of administrative supervision over all courts and their personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Worse, despite the designation of Judge Trinidad as Assisting Judge under Administrative Order No. 137-2012, Judge Marigomen usurped Judge Trinidad's authority by failing to transfer the civil case to him.<br><br>For violating Administrative Order Nos. 113-2011 and 137-2012, Judge Marigomen is guilty of violating Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars, a less serious charge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> punishable by either suspension for not less<br><br>than one (1) month but not more than three (3) months, or fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Under the circumstances, the fine of P20,000.00 is proper.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The charge of gross ignorance of the law against Judge Marigomen merits a more serious sanction.<br><br>Bail, as defined in Rule 114, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, is "the security given for the release of a person in custody of the law, furnished by him [or her] or a bondsman, to guarantee his [or her] appearance before any court as required under the conditions hereinafter specified." Based on this definition, the accused must be in custody of the law or otherwise deprived of his or her liberty to be able to post bail.<br><br>Generally, bail is filed before the court where the case is pending. However, if bail cannot be filed before the court where the case is pending­ as when the judge handling the case is absent or unavailable, or if the accused is arrested in a province, city, or municipality other than where the case is pending-Rule 114, Section 17(a) of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section 17. <i>Bail, Where Filed</i>. - (a) Bail in the amount fixed may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or <u>in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with any regional trial judge, metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge in the province, city, or municipality. If the accused is arrested in a province, city, or municipality other than where the case is pending, bail may also be filed with any regional trial court of said place, or if no judge thereof is available. with any metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge therein</u>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The text of Rule 114, Section 17(a) of the Rules of Court shows that there is an order of preference with respect to where bail may be filed. In the absence or unavailability of the judge where the case is pending, the accused must first go to a judge <i>in the province, city, or municipality where the case is pending</i>. Furthermore, a judge of another province, city, or municipality may grant bail <i>only if</i> the accused has been <i>arrested</i> in a province, city, or municipality other than where the case is pending.<br><br>A judge not assigned to the province, city, or municipality where the case is pending but approves an application for bail filed by an accused not arrested is guilty of gross ignorance of the law. The last sentence of Rule 114, Section 17(a) is clear that for purposes of determining whether or not the accused is in custody of the law, the mode required is arrest, not voluntary surrender,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> before a judge of another province, city, or municipality may grant a bail application. In the same vein, it is gross ignorance of the law if a judge grants an application for bail in a criminal case outside of his or her jurisdiction without ascertaining the absence or unavailability of the judge of the court where the criminal case is pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Judge Marigomen was <i>not</i> a judge in the province, city, or municipality where the case was pending. Neither was Andrino <i>arrested</i> in a province, city, or municipality other than where the case was pending precisely because no warrant of arrest had yet been issued when he posted bail on May 9, 2013. Judge Marigomen violated Rule 114, Section 17(a) and is guilty of gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>Moreover, Judge Marigomen did not ascertain the absence or unavailability of Judge Saniel. This duty to ascertain is a consequence of Judge Marigomen not being the judge of the place where the criminal case was pending and could have been satisfied by inquiring and coordinating with the court personnel belonging to Branch 20, where the criminal case was pending. Had Judge Marigomen done his duty, Judge Saniel would have already been informed of the grant of bail on May 9, 2013, and therefore, would not have superfluously issued a Warrant of Arrest 21 days later. Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> cannot be appreciated in favor of Judge Marigomen.<br><br>Under Rule 140, Section 11(A) of the Rules of Court on the Discipline of Judges of Regular and Special Courts and Justices of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan, a serious charge such as gross ignorance of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> is punishable by a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, considering that this was Judge Marigomen's second offense, as he had been previously found guilty of gross ignorance of the law in <i>Salazar v. Judge Marigomen</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> this Court fines him with an amount more than P40,000.00, specifically, P100,000.00. This is allowed under Rule 140, Section 11(A), which uses the permissive "may" in enumerating the imposable sanctions for serious charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>While it is true that Tejano filed an Affidavit withdrawing her Complaint against Judge Marigomen, withdrawal of an administrative complaint "does not divest [this Court] of [its] disciplinary authority over court personnel."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This Court "cannot be bound by the unilateral decision of a complainant to desist from prosecuting a case involving the discipline of parties subject to its administrative supervision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As elaborated in <i>Nones v. Ormita</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>[T]he faith and confidence of the people in their government and its agencies and instrumentalities need to be maintained. The people should not be made to depend upon the whims and caprices of complainants who, in a real sense, are only witnesses. To rule otherwise would subvert the fair and prompt administration of justice, as well as undermine the discipline of court personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>This doctrine applies especially in this case where respondent is not just any other court personnel. Respondent is a judge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> who is supposedly knowledgeable of the law but has been found grossly ignorant of it, not just once but twice.<br><br>In sum, the penalty recommended by the Office of the Court Administrator is increased. Instead of fining Judge Marigomen the amount of P40,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law, he is ordered to pay the amount of P100,000.00. Adding the P20,000.00 fine for his vio1ation of Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars, Judge Marigomen is liable in the total amount of P120,000.00.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>This Court sustains the dismissal of the administrative charge for violation of the Anti-Red Tape Act against Camay.
