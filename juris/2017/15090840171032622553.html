				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The requirement for publication of a Notice of Sale in an extrajudicial foreclosure is complied with when the publication is circulated at least in the city where the property is located.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the May 31, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and October 7, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 97748. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, which dismissed the complaint filed by petitioner Gotesco Properties, Inc. (Gotesco) for the annulment of the foreclosure proceeding. The Court of Appeals also upheld the issuance of a writ of possession for respondent Solidbank Corporation (Solidbank), now Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank).<br><br>In 1995, Gotesco obtained from Solidbank a term loan of P300 million through its President, Mr. Jose Go (Mr. Go). This loan was covered by three (3) promissory notes. To secure the loan, Gotesco was required to execute a Mortgage Trust Indenture (Indenture) naming Solidbank-Trust Division as Trustee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Indenture, dated August 9, 1995, obliged Gotesco to mortgage several parcels of land in favor of Solidbank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> One (1) of the lots mortgaged and used as a collateral was a property located in San Fernando, Pampanga, which was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 387371-R.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A stipulation in the Indenture also irrevocably appointed Solidbank-Trust Division as Gotesco's attorney-in-fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Under the Indenture, Gotesco also agreed to "at all times maintain the Sound Value of the Collateral."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When the loan was about to mature, Gotesco found it difficult to meet its obligation because of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On January 24, 2000, Gotesco sent a letter to Solidbank proposing to restructure the loan obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The loan restructuring agreement proposed to extend the payment period to seven (7) years. The suggested period included a two (2)-year grace period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its February 9, 2000 letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Solidbank informed Gotesco of a substantial reduction in the appraised value of its mortgaged properties. Based on an appraisal report submitted to Solidbank, the sound value of the mortgaged properties at that time was at P381,245,840.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Since the necessary collateral to loan ratio was 200%, Solidbank held that there was a deficiency in the collateral, which Gotesco had to address. Solidbank required Gotesco to replace or add to the mortgaged properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Gotesco construed the February 9, 2000 letter as Solidbank's implied agreement to the loan restructuring proposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, Gotesco found it unnecessary to address the alleged deficiency in the collateral. It insisted that the aggregate sound value of the mortgaged properties had not changed and was still at P1,076,905,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Solidbank sent a demand letter dated June 7, 2000 to Gotesco as the loan became due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Despite having received this demand letter, Gotesco failed to pay the outstanding obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Solidbank then filed a Petition for the Extrajudicial Foreclosure of the lot covered by TCT No. 387371-R through Atty. Wilfrido Mangiliman (Atty. Mangiliman), a notary public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the Notice of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated July 24, 2000, the public auction of the land located in Pampanga, covered by TCT No. 387371-R, was announced to be held on August 24, 2000 at 10:00 a.m. However, pursuant to paragraph 5 of A.M. No. 99-10-05-0 dated December 14, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Notice of Sale indicated that if the minimum requirement of two (2) bidders was not met, the sale was to be postponed and rescheduled on August 31, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The public auction was held on August 31, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and Solidbank was declared the winning bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>On February 5, 2001, Gotesco filed a complaint before Branch 42, Regional Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga for Annulment of Foreclosure Proceedings, Specific Performance, and Damages against Solidbank, Atty. Mangiliman, and the Register of Deeds of San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Gotesco assailed the validity of the foreclosure proceeding claiming that it was premature and without legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> According to Gotesco, the jurisdictional requirements prescribed under Act No. 3135 were not complied with. First, Solidbank did not furnish Gotesco copies of the petition for extrajudicial foreclosure, notice of sale, and certificate of sale. Second, the filing fees were not paid. Lastly, even assuming the original period for loan payment was not extended, the prerequisites for the foreclosure proceeding provided in the Indenture were not met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Section 5.02 of the Indenture provided:<br><blockquote>5.02. Foreclosure. <b>If any event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee [Solidbank-Trust Division], on written instruction by the Majority Creditors [Solidbank], shall within three (3) Banking Days from receipt of such notice, give written notice to the Company [appellant], copy furnished all Creditors, declaring all obligations secured by this Indenture due and payable and foreclosing the Collateral. Upon such declaration, the [appellant] shall pay to the [Solidbank-Trust Division], within ten (10) days from receipt of such notice</b>, the amount sufficient to cover costs and expenses of collection, including compensation for the [Solidbank-Trust Division], its agents and attorneys.<br><br><b>In default of such payment, the [Solidbank-Trust Division] may proceed to foreclose this Indenture, judicially or extra-judicially under Act No. 3135, as amended.</b> Thereupon, on demand of the [Solidbank-Trust Division], the appellant shall immediately turn over possession of the Collateral to any party designated as the duly authorized representative of the [Solidbank-Trust Division], free of all charges. (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>In their Answer with Counterclaim, Solidbank alleged that it never entered into a restructuring agreement with Gotesco. Solidbank claimed that it complied with the publication and posting requirements laid down by Act No. 3135. It also asserted that Gotesco's complaint was insufficient because it failed to state a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On October 31, 2001, Solidbank filed an Ex-Parte Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of Possession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> before Branch 48, Regional Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The two (2) cases were consolidated before Branch 42, Regional Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, the presiding judge of Branch 42 recused himself after disclosing that he was a depositor in Metrobank, previously Solidbank. The case was re-raffled to Branch 47.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In its May 4, 2011 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Branch 47, Regional Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga dismissed Gotesco's complaint for the annulment of the foreclosure proceeding and granted the Writ of Possession in Solidbank's favor:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the plaintiff's Complaint in Civil Case No. 12212 is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br>On the other hand, the Ex-Parte Petition in LRC No. 762 is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, let a writ of possession over the property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 387371-R be issued against Gotesco Properties, Inc., and all persons claiming rights under it.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Gotesco filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied on September 6, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>Gotesco appealed the rulings before the Court of Appeals. It argued that contrary to the trial court's finding, the restructuring agreement was perfected. The foreclosure was premature because Gotesco was not in default. Solidbank also failed to adhere to the stipulation which required that in the event of default, a notice shall be given to Gotesco. Moreover, Mr. Go allegedly was not authorized to appoint Solidbank as an attorney-in-fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In its May 31, 2013 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court. It ruled that there was no perfected restructuring agreement between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It cited Article 1319 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which requires absolute acceptance of the offer before it can be considered a binding contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It found that Gotesco failed to prove that Solidbank clearly and unequivocally accepted the proposal for loan restructuring.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also declared that Gotesco was in default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It quoted Section 4.03 of the Indenture, which provided:<br><blockquote><u>The Company [<u>Gotesco/appellant</u>] shall at all times maintain the Sound Value of the Collateral</u> at a level equal to that provided for under Sec. 2.01 of this Indenture and, for such purpose, shall make such substitutions, replacements, and additions for or to the Collateral.<br><br><u>If at any time, in the opinion of the Trustee [<i>Solidbank-Trust Division</i>] and the Majority Creditors [<i>Solidbank/appellee</i>]</u>, the Sound Value of the Collateral is impaired, or there is substantial and imminent danger of such impairment, the [<i>appellant</i>] shall, upon demand of [<i>Solidbank-Trust Division</i>], effect the substitution of the Collateral or part thereof with another or others and/or execute additional mortgages on other properties and/or deposit cash with the [<i>Solidbank-Trust Division</i>] satisfactory to the [<i>Solidbank-Trust Division</i>] and [<i>Solidbank</i>].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Under the Indenture, Gotesco agreed to provide additional collateral "[i]f at any time, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Majority Creditors, the Sound Value of the Collateral is impaired."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Gotesco should have provided the additional security demanded by Solidbank after learning that the value of the properties used as collateral had been reduced significantly. When Gotesco "chose to rely on its opinion, over and above and contrary to the opinion of the Trustee and the Creditor," it defaulted on its obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, the Court of Appeals ruled that Gotesco's refusal to address the inadequacy of the collateral was sufficient reason for Solidbank to foreclose the property.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the requisites under Section 3 of Act No. 3135 were satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The Notice of Sale was physically posted in the Office of the Clerk of Court, the Registry of Deeds, and the Capitol Grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Alongside the posting, the Notice of Sale was published in <i><i>Remate</i></i> in its issues dated July 29, 2000, August 5, 2000, and August 12, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The Court of Appeals rejected Gotesco's allegation that the publication was invalid for being published in a newspaper not printed in the city where the property was located. According to the Court of Appeals, the fact that <i><i>Remate</i></i> was published in Metro Manila, not in Pampanga, did not mean that it was not a newspaper of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It was still a newspaper of general circulation; thus, the publication was valid. The Court of Appeals ruled, "[t]he Notice of Sale, Affidavit of Publication, and Affidavit of Posting sufficiently prove that the jurisdictional requirements regarding publication of the Notice were complied with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> There was also documentary evidence proving that contrary to Gotesco's claim, it received a demand letter from Solidbank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also determined that Mr. Go had the authority to agree to the conditions related to securing the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It examined the Secretary's Certificate which quoted verbatim the Board Resolution authorizing Mr. Go to enter into the loan agreement:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><blockquote><center>Resolution No. 95-015<br></center><br>RESOLVED, AS IT HEREBY RESOLVED, that the Corporation [appellant] be as it is hereby authorized, to enter into a Mortgage Trust Indenture (MTI) arrangement with Solidbank Corporation-Trust Division.<br><br>RESOLVED FURTHER, that the [appellant], be as it is hereby authorized to secure a loan in the amount of THREE HUNDRED MILLION only (P300,000,000.00) PESOS from Solidbank Corporation [appellant] under said Mortgage Trust Indenture on such items, conditions, and stipulations that the [appellant] may think fit for the purpose of the loan and to mortgage the [appellant]'s assets as security and/or collateral for the loan and other credit facilities.<br><br>RESOLVED FURTHER, that JOSE C. GO, be, as he is hereby authorized, to negotiate and accept the terms and conditions and to sign, execute and deliver any and all promissory notes, bonds, mortgages and all other documents necessary in the execution of the aforesaid resolutions with the said banks, for and in behalf of the [appellant].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>Lastly, since there was no third party with adverse interest that occupied the property, the issuance of the Writ of Possession was ministerial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals May 31, 2013 Decision provided:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>. The Decision dated May 4, 2011, and the Order dated September 6, 2011, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 47, San Fernando, Pampanga in the consolidated cases docketed as Civil Case No. 12212 and LRC No. 726, are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>. Costs against appellant Gotesco Properties Incorporated.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Gotesco filed a Motion for Reconsideration but it was denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> promulgated on October 7, 2013.<br><br>Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari was filed on November 28,2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In this Petition, petitioner Gotesco maintains that the foreclosure proceeding is null and void. It insists that respondent Solidbank agreed to restructure its loan, granting a "payment period of seven (7) years with two (2) years grace period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> It continues to argue that respondent impliedly accepted petitioner's proposal when it asked for an increase in the collateral.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Respondent reneged on the restructuring agreement when it caused the foreclosure of the property prematurely.<br><br>Petitioner claims that it was not notified that it was in default. Under the Indenture, the foreclosure proceeding can only be initiated upon petitioner's failure to pay within 10 days after receipt of the notice of default. Allegedly, respondent did not send any notice. Respondent's failure to prove that it sent a demand letter means the obligation is not yet due and demandable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>Petitioner avers that the mortgage is void because the principal obligation it secured was still inexistent when the Indenture was signed. The mortgage was executed on August 9, 1995. The promissory notes representing the loans were dated August 14, 1995, August 21, 1995, and August 28, 1995. Since the mortgage was only an accessory contract, "it cannot stand alone absent a principal obligation to secure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>Petitioner alleges that Mr. Go was not sanctioned by Gotesco's Board of Directors "to appoint the bank as the attorney-in-fact to conduct an extra-judicial foreclosure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Thus, the subsequent proceedings are void.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner insists that Section 3 of Act No. 3135 was violated. The law requires that the Notice of Sale be posted for not less than 20 days before the day of the auction sale. According to the Affidavit of Posting by Janet Torres, Atty. Mangiliman's law clerk,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Notice of Sale was posted on August 15, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Since the auction sale was conducted on August 31, 2000, the 20-day period was not followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further contends that the publication of the Notice of Sale in <i>Remate</i> was defective. Petitioner is of the opinion that the Notice of Sale should have been published in newspapers published, edited and circulated" in the same city or province where the foreclosed property was located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Since the land being sold was situated at San Fernando, Pampanga and <i>Remate</i> was printed and published in Manila, petitioner suggests that the publication requirement was violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Consequently, since the foreclosure proceeding was void, there was no basis for the issuance of the Writ of Possession. Possession of the property must revert back to petitioner.<br><br>Thereafter, respondent filed a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and a Supplemental Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> to the Petition. Respondent denies that it agreed to restructure petitioner's loan. It emphasized that petitioner has not shown any concrete proof that respondent accepted the proposal. Moreover, the alleged restructuring agreement was not offered in evidence and cannot be considered by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In its Comment, respondent explains that it is of no moment that the mortgage agreement was executed before the promissory notes. Jurisprudence has recognized that a mortgage can secure present and future obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In any case, since petitioner is arguing that the obligation was restructured, it is now estopped from questioning the validity of the Indenture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that petitioner cannot claim that it was not notified of the default. Respondent submitted a return card which indicated that the demand letter dated June 7, 2000 informing Gotesco of its default was received by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> There is also a provision in the promissory note, which states that failure to pay the amounts due makes the obligation immediately due, without need for notice or demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Respondent took the position that Mr. Go was clearly authorized by the Board of Directors to sign the Indenture. Since the appointment of Solidbank-Trust Division as an attorney-in-fact was an integral part of the agreement, petitioner was bound by Mr. Go's assent. In any case, this contention was not alleged in the Complaint; hence, it is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>According to respondent, Section 3 of Act No. 3135 was complied with. <i>Remate</i> is a newspaper of general circulation. It is among the newspapers accredited by the Regional Trial Court where a notice of sale can be published.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Petitioner also cannot raise for the first time on appeal the allegation that the Notice of Sale was defective for being posted less than 20 days before the auction sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Respondent holds that the Writ of Possession was validly issued because its issuance was ministerial.<br><br>A Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> was filed by petitioner on May 20, 2014 in compliance with this Court's March 17, 2014 Resolution.<br><br>On August 28, 2015, petitioner filed a Motion for Voluntary Inhibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> of the ponente. Petitioner sought the inhibition of Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, former Dean of the College of Law of the University of the Philippines, for his ties with Metrobank Foundation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The ponente allegedly had a working relationship with respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> First, he was an awardee of the professorial chair of the Metrobank Foundation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Second, he was chosen as a speaker in the Metrobank Professorial Chair and Metrobank's Country's Outstanding Police Officers in Service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Respondent opposed the Motion for Voluntary Inhibition as "none of the grounds for mandatory inhibition exist[s] in the present instance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In this Court's January 25, 2016 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Motion for Inhibition was denied for lack of merit. The Internal Rules of the Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> provide several grounds for inhibition in addition to those stated under Rule 137, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of the Rules of Court. There was no need for the ponente to inhibit since none of the enumerated circumstances was attendant in this case. Justices are not given unfettered discretion to desist from hearing a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Mere imputation of bias or partiality is not enough; there must be a just and valid cause for inhibition to prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>On March 20, 2017, respondent filed a Motion for Resolution claiming the case is ripe for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>There are three (3) issues to be resolved before this Court: First, whether the foreclosure was premature;<br><br>Second, whether the requirements under Section 3 of Act No. 3135 were complied with; and<br><br>Finally, whether the Writ of Possession was properly issued.<br><br><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.A</span><br></center><br>Petitioner defaulted in its obligation. Thus, respondent was within its rights to foreclose the property.<br><br>Section 5 of the Indenture provided:<br><blockquote>5.01 Events of Default. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture:<br><br>(a) <b>the Company shall fail to pay at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise to any Creditor any amount due and owing under a Secured Principal Document;</b><br><br>(b) any event of default under the Secured Principal Documents shall occur;<br><br>(c) any representation or warranty or statement made or furnished to this Trustee by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Indenture shall prove to have been false in any material respect when made or furnished or deemed made;<br><br>(d) the Company shall default in the due performance or observance of any provision contained herein and such default continues unremedied for thirty (30) days after notice to the Company by the Trustee; or<br><br>(e) <b>the lien created by this Indenture shall be lost or impaired</b> or shall cease to be a first and preferred lien upon the Collateral.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner defaulted in its obligation twice. First, when it failed to pay the loan according to the terms of the promissory note. Second, when it failed to provide the additional collateral demanded by respondent.<br><br>Petitioner never refuted that it defaulted in its payment of the loan. In its Stipulation of Facts/Admissions and Proposed Marking of Exhibits, petitioner admitted to proposing the loan restructuring because of its inability to meet the loan payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The loan restructuring agreement would have given Petitioner an additional "payment period of seven (7) years with two (2) years grace period on principal payment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>However, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, that there was no perfected restructuring agreement between the parties. The Civil Code requires absolute acceptance of the offer before it can be considered a binding contract:<br><blockquote>Article 1319. Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. The offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute. A qualified acceptance constitutes a counter-offer.<br><br>Acceptance made by letter or telegram does not bind the offerer except from the time it came to his knowledge. The contract, in such a case, is presumed to have been entered into in the place where the offer was made.<br></blockquote><i>Mendoza v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> tells us that "[o]nly an absolute and unqualified acceptance of a definite offer manifests the consent necessary to perfect a contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>For a proposal to bind a party, there must be proof that it consented to all the terms on offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> To prove that the original period of payment was extended, petitioner must show that respondent unequivocally accepted the offer. In this case, petitioner did not present any shred of evidence which would prove that respondent agreed to restructure the loan. At best, petitioner only alleged that it sent a letter to respondent to ask for a debt restructuring. However, sending a proposal is not enough.

Basic considerations of due process underlie this rule. It would be unfair to the adverse party who would have no opportunity to present evidence <i>in contra</i> to the new theory, which it could have done had it been aware of it at the time of the hearing before the trial court.

But this is not the interpretation given by the courts. For what is important is that a paper should be in general circulation in the place where the properties to be foreclosed are located in order that publication may serve the purpose for which it was intended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup></blockquote>If notices are only published in newspapers printed in the city where the property is located, even newspapers that are circulated nationwide will be disqualified from announcing auction sales outside their city of publication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> This runs contrary to the spirit of the law which is to attain wide enough publicity so all parties interested in acquiring the property can be informed of the upcoming sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> This Court ruled:<br><blockquote>We take judicial notice of the fact that newspaper publications have more far-reaching effects than posting on bulletin boards in public places. There is a greater probability that an announcement or notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, which is distributed nationwide, shall have a readership of more people than that posted in a public bulletin board, no matter how strategic its location may be, which caters only to a limited few. Hence, the publication of the notice of sale in the newspaper of general circulation alone is more than sufficient compliance with the notice-posting requirement of the law. By such publication, a reasonably wide publicity had been effected such that those interested might attend the public sale, and the purpose of the law had been thereby subserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></blockquote>The crucial factor is not where the newspaper is printed but whether the newspaper is being circulated in the city where the property is located. Markedly, what the law requires is the publication of the Notice of Sale in a "newspaper of general circulation," which is defined as:<br><blockquote>To be a newspaper of general circulation, it is enough that "it is published for the dissemination of local news and general information; that it has a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers; that it is published at regular intervals" . . . The newspaper need not have the largest circulation so long as it is of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br></blockquote>Verily, there is clear emphasis on the audience reached by the paper; the place of printing is not even considered.<br><br>The Court of Appeals pointed out that <i>Remate</i> is an accredited publication by the Regional Trial Court of Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> As argued by respondent:<br><blockquote>94.
