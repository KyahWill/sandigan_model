				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Before the Court is a petition for <em>mandamus</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioners Representatives Teddy Brawner Baguilat, Jr., (Rep. Baguilat), Edcel C. Lagman (Rep. Lagman), Raul A. Daza, Edgar R. Erice, Emmanuel A. Billones, Tomasito S. Villarin, and Gary C. Alejano (collectively, petitioners), all members of the House of Representatives, essentially praying that respondents Speaker Pantaleon D. Alvarez (Speaker Alvarez), Majority Leader Rodolfo C. Fariñas (Rep. Fariñas), and Representative Danilo E. Suarez (Rep. Suarez; collectively, respondents), also members of the House of Representatives, be compelled to recognize: (a) Rep. Baguilat as the Minority Leader of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress of the House of Representatives; and (b) petitioners as the legitimate members of the Minority.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b></p><p> The petition alleges that prior to the opening of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress on July 25, 2016, several news articles surfaced about Rep. Suarez's announcement that he sought the adoption or anointment of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte's Administration as the "Minority Leader" to lead a "cooperative minority" in the House of Representatives (or the House), and even purportedly encamped himself in Davao shortly after the May 2016 Elections to get the endorsement of President Duterte and the majority partisans. The petition further claims that to ensure Rep. Suarez's election as the Minority Leader, the supermajority coalition in the House allegedly "lent" Rep. Suarez some of its members to feign membership in the Minority, and thereafter, vote for him as the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p> On July 25, 2016, which was prior to the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, then-Acting Floor Leader Rep. Fariñas and Rep. Jose Atienza (Rep. Atienza) had an interchange before the Plenary, wherein the latter elicited the following from the former:<b> <u>(<i>a</i>) all those who vote for the winning Speaker shall belong to the Majority and those who vote for the other candidates shall belong to the Minority; (<i>b</i>) those who abstain from voting shall likewise be considered part of the Minority; and (<i>c</i>) the Minority Leader shall be elected by the members of the Minority.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thereafter, the Elections for the Speakership were held, "[w]ith 252 Members voting for [Speaker] Alvarez, eight [(8)] voting for Rep. Baguilat, seven [(7)] voting for Rep. Suarez, 21 abstaining and one [(1)] registering a no vote,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> thus, resulting in Speaker Alvarez being the duly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress. </p><p> Petitioners hoped that as a "long-standing tradition" of the House – where the candidate who garnered the second (2<sup>nd</sup>)-highest number of votes for Speakership automatically becomes the Minority Leader - Rep. Baguilat would be declared and recognized as the Minority Leader. However, despite numerous follow-ups from respondents, Rep. Baguilat was never recognized as such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p> On August 1, 2016, one of the "abstentionists," Representative Harlin Neil Abayon, III (Rep. Abayon), manifested before the Plenary that on July 27, 2016, those who did not vote for Speaker Alvarez (including the 21 "abstentionists") convened and elected Rep. Suarez as the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p> Thereafter, on August 15, 2016, Rep. (now, Majority Leader) Fariñas moved for the recognition of Rep. Suarez as the Minority Leader. This was opposed by Rep. Lagman essentially on the ground that various "irregularities" attended Rep. Suarez's election as Minority Leader, particularly: (a) that Rep. Suarez was a member of the Majority as he voted for Speaker Alvarez, and that his "transfer" to the Minority was irregular; and (b) that the "abstentionists" who constituted the bulk of votes in favor of Rep. Suarez's election as Minority Leader are supposed to be considered independent members of the House, and thus, irregularly deemed as part of the Minority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, Rep. Lagman's opposition was overruled, and consequently, Rep. Suarez was officially recognized as the House Minority Leader.</p><p> Thus, petitioners filed the instant petition for <i>mandamus</i>, insisting that Rep. Baguilat should be recognized as the Minority Leader in light of: (<i>a</i>) the "long-standing tradition" in the House where the candidate who garnered the second (2<sup>nd</sup>)-highest number of votes for Speakership automatically becomes the Minority Leader; and (<i>b</i>) the irregularities attending Rep. Suarez's election to said Minority Leader position.</p><p> For his part, Rep. Suarez maintains that the election of Minority Leader is an internal matter to the House of Representatives. Thus, absent any finding of violation of the Constitution or grave abuse of discretion, the Court cannot interfere with such internal matters of a coequal branch of the govemment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the same vein, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on behalf of Speaker Alvarez and Majority Leader Fariñas contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that the election of Minority Leader is within the exclusive realm of the House of Representatives, which the Court cannot intrude in pursuant to the principle of separation of powers, as well as the political question doctrine. Similarly, the OSG argues that the recognition of Rep. Suarez as the House Minority Leader was not tainted with any violation of the Constitution or grave abuse of discretion and, thus, must be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The essential issue for resolution is whether or not respondents may be compelled via a writ of <i>mandamus </i>to recognize: (<i>a</i>) Rep. Baguilat as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives; and (<i>b</i>) petitioners as the only legitimate members of the House Minority. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is without merit. </p><p> "<i>Mandamus</i> is defined as a writ commanding a tribunal, corporation, board or person to do the act required to be done when it or he unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office or which such other is entitled, there being no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In <i>Special People, Inc. Foundation v. Canda</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court explained that the peremptory writ of <i>mandamus</i> is an extraordinary remedy that is issued only in extreme necessity, and the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford an adequate and speedy relief <b><u>to one who has a clear legal right to the performance of the act to be compelled</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> After a judicious study of this case, the Court finds that petitioners have no clear legal right to the reliefs sought. Records disclose that prior to the Speakership Election held on July 25, 2016, then-Acting Floor Leader Rep. Fariñas responded to a parliamentary inquiry from Rep. Atienza as to who would elect the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. Rep. Fariñas then articulated that: <b>(<i>a</i>) all those who vote for the winning Speaker shall belong to the Majority and those who vote for other candidates shall belong to the Minority; (<i>b</i>) those who abstain from voting shall likewise be considered part of the Minority; and (<i>c</i>) the Minority Leader shall be elected by the members of the Minority.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thereafter, the election of the Speaker of the House proceeded <b><u>without any</u></b> <b><u>objection</u></b> from any member of Congress, including herein petitioners. Notably, the election of the Speaker of the House is the essential and formative step conducted at the first regular session of the 17<sup>th </sup>Congress to determine the constituency of the Majority and Minority (and later on, their respective leaders), considering that the Majority would be comprised of those who voted for the winning Speaker and the Minority of those who did not. The unobjected procession of the House at this juncture is reflected in its Journal No. 1 dated July 25, 2016,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which, based on case law, is conclusive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as to what transpired in Congress: </p><blockquote> <p><b>PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY OF REP. ATIENZA</b> </p> <p> Recognized by the Chair, Rep. Atienza inquired as to who would elect the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. </p> <p> <b>REMARKS OF REP. FARIÑAS</b> </p> <p> <i><u>In reply, Rep. Fariñas referred to Section 8 of the Rules of the house on membership to the Majority and the Minority. He explained that the Members who voted for the winning candidate for the Speaker shall constitute the Majority and shall elect from among themselves the Majority Leader, while those who voted against the winning Speaker or did not vote at all shall belong to the Minority and would thereafter elect their Minority Leader.</u></i> </p> <p> <b>NOMINAL VOTING ON THE NOMINEES FOR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE</b> </p> <p> Thereafter, on motion of Rep. Fariñas,<b><i><u> there being no objection</u></i></b>, the <u>Members proceeded to the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives</u>. The Presiding Officer then directed Deputy Secretary General Adasa to call the Roll for nominal voting for the Speaker of the House and requested each Member to state the name of the candidate he or she will vote for. </p> <p> The result of the voting was as follows: </p> <p> <i>For Rep. Pantaleon D. Alvarez:</i> </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> <i>For Rep. Teddy Brawner Baguilat Jr.</i> </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> <i>For Rep. Danilo E. Suarez</i> </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> <i>Abstained</i> </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> With 252 Members voting for Rep. Alvarez (P.), eight voting for Rep. Baguilat, seven voting for Rep. Suarez, 21 abstaining and one registering a no vote, the Presiding Officer declared Rep. Alvarez (P.) as the duly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 17<sup>th </sup>Congress. </p> <p> <b>COMMITTEE ON NOTIFICATION</b> </p> <p> On motion of Rep. Fariñas, there being no objection, the Body constituted a committee composed of the following Members to notify Rep. Alvarez (P.) of his election as Speaker of the House of Representatives and to escort the Speaker-elect to the rostrum for his oath-taking: Reps. Eric D. Singson, Mercedes K. Alvarez, Fredenil "Fred" H. Castro, Raneo "Ranie" E. Abu, Lucy T. Gomez, Nancy A. Catamco, Elenita Milagros "Eileen" Ermita-Buhain, Rose Marie "Baby" J. Arenas, Mylene J. Garcia-Albano, Gwendolyn F. Garcia, Marlyn L. Primicias-Agabas, Emmeline Aglipay-Villar, Sarah Jane I. Elago and Victoria Isabel G. Noel. </p> <p> <b>SUSPENSION OF SESSION</b> </p> <p> The Presiding Officer <i>motu proprio</i> suspended the session at 12:43 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> After Speaker Alvarez took his oath of office, he administered the oath of office to all Members of the House of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On the same day, the Deputy Speakers, and other officers of the House (among others, the Majority Leader) were elected and all took their respective oaths of office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> During his privilege speech delivered on July 26, 2016, which was a full day after all the above-mentioned proceedings had already been commenced and completed, Rep. Lagman questioned Rep. Fariñas' interpretation of the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Aside from the belated timing of Rep. Lagman's query, Rep. Suarez aptly points out that the Journal for that session does not indicate any motion made, seconded and carried to correct the entry in the Journal of the previous session (July 25, 2016) pertinent to any recording error that may have been made, as to indicate that in fact, a protest or objection was raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Logically speaking, the foregoing circumstances would show that the House of Representatives had effectively adopted Rep. Fariñas' proposal anent the new rules regarding the membership of the Minority, as well as the process of determining who the Minority Leader would be. More significantly, this demonstrates the House's deviation from the "legal bases" of petitioners' claim for entitlement to the reliefs sought before this Court, namely: (<em>a</em>) the "long-standing tradition" of automatically awarding the Minority Leadership to the second placer in the Speakership Elections, <em>i.e</em>., Rep. Baguilat; and (<em>b</em>) the rule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that those who abstained in the Speakership Elections should be deemed as independent Members of the House of Representatives, and thus, they could not have voted for a Minority Leader in the person of Rep. Suarez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As will be explained hereunder, the deviation by the Lower House from the aforesaid rules is not averse to the Constitution. </p><p> Section 16 (1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 16. (1) The Senate shall elect its President and the House of Representatives, its Speaker, by a majority vote of all its respective Members. </p> <p> Each house shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary. </p> </blockquote> <p> Under this provision, the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall be elected by a majority vote of its entire membership. Said provision also states that the House of Representatives may decide to have officers other than the Speaker, and that the method and manner as to how these officers are chosen is something within its sole control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the case of <em>Defensor-Santiago v. Guingona</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which involved a dispute on the rightful Senate Minority Leader during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress (1998-2001), this Court observed that "[w]hile the Constitution is explicit on the manner of electing x x x [a Speaker of the House of Representative,] it is, however, dead silent on the manner of selecting the other officers [of the Lower House]. All that the Charter says is that '[e]ach House shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary.' [As such], the method of choosing who will be such other officers is merely a derivative of the exercise of the prerogative conferred by the aforequoted constitutional provision. Therefore, such method must be prescribed by the [House of Representatives] itself, not by [the] Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> Corollary thereto, Section 16 (3), Article VI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Constitution vests in the House of Representatives the sole authority to, <em>inter alia</em>, "determine the rules of its proceedings." These "legislative rules, unlike statutory laws, do not have the imprints of permanence and obligatoriness during their effectivity. In fact, they 'are subject to revocation, modification or waiver at the pleasure of the body adopting them.' Being merely matters of procedure, their observance are of no concern to the courts, for said rules may be waived or disregarded by the legislative body at will, upon the concurrence of a majority [of the House of Representatives]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Hence, as a general rule, "[t]his Court has no authority to interfere and unilaterally intrude into that exclusive realm, without running afoul of [C]onstitutional principles that it is bound to protect and uphold x x x. Constitutional respect and a becoming regard for the sovereign acts of a coequal branch prevents the Court from prying into the internal workings of the [House of Representatives]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> Of course, as in any general rule, there lies an exception. While the Court in taking jurisdiction over petitions questioning an act of the political departments of government, will not review the wisdom, merits or propriety of such action, it will, however, strike it down on the ground of grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This stems from the expanded concept of judicial power, which, under Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, expressly "includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government." Case law decrees that "[t]he foregoing text emphasizes the judicial department's duty and power to strike down grave abuse of discretion on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government including Congress. It is an innovation in our political law. As explained by former Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he judiciary is the final arbiter on the question of whether or not a branch of government or any of its officials has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or so capriciously as to constitute an abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction. This is not only a judicial power but a duty to pass judgment on matters of this nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, this Court "will not shirk, digress from or abandon its sacred duty and authority to uphold the Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse of discretion brought before it in appropriate cases, committed by any officer, agency, instrumentality or department of the government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> However, as may be gleaned from the circumstances as to how the House had conducted the questioned proceedings and its apparent deviation from its traditional rules, the Court is hard-pressed to find any attending grave abuse of discretion which would warrant its intrusion in this case. By and large, this case concerns an internal matter of a coequal, political branch of government which, absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion, cannot be judicially interfered with. To rule otherwise would not only embroil this Court in the realm of politics, but also lead to its own breach of the separation of powers doctrine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Verily, "[i]t would be an unwarranted invasion of the prerogative of a coequal department for this Court either to set aside a legislative action as void [only] because [it] thinks [that] the House has disregarded its own rules of procedure, or to allow those defeated in the political arena to seek a rematch in the judicial forum when petitioners can find their remedy in that department itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>DISMISSED</strong>. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong> </p><p><em>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Mendoza, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Martires, Tijam,</em> and<em> Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur. <br> <em>Leonen, J.</em>, see separate opinion. <br><br></p><p> </p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"> <div align="center"><strong><br> <br> NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</strong> </div> <p> Sirs/Mesdames: </p><p> Please take notice that on <u>July 25, 2017</u> a <u>Decision</u>/Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on August 17, 2017 at 2:12 p.m. </p><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%" height="23">&nbsp;</td> <td width="50%"><div align="center">Very truly yours,</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><strong>(SGD.)

There is also an established parliamentary practice of the House of Representatives, evidencing their current collective interpretation, which makes Representative Teddy Brawner Baguilat, Jr. (Representative Baguilat) of the Lone District of Ifugao Province automatically the Minority Leader. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> The 1973 Constitution under Ferdinand E. Marcos abolished Congress, changed the presidential form of government to a modified parliamentary form of government, and instituted a unicameral legislature known as the National Assembly or <em>Batasang Pambansa</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> During the 1986 EDSA Revolution, his ouster ushered in new political institutions. The 1987 Constitution abolished the unicameral legislature and installed a bicameral Congress, which is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. </p><p> For nearly three (3) decades since the promulgation of 1987 Constitution, the House of Representatives has practiced the tradition of having the second placer for House Speaker automatically become the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> From what was then the 8<sup>th</sup> Congress (1987-1992) to the 16th Congress (2013-2016), this practice was enshrined not only in the Rules that the House adopted for all of its sessions but also in the traditions and precedents of the House of Representatives itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioners quote the Body's ruling during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress: </p><blockquote> <p> "Rules, traditions and precedents of the House provide that the losing candidate for Speaker with the second highest number of votes becomes the Minority Leader."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> For instance, during the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress, four (4) candidates ran for House Speaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Representative Jose De Venecia, Jr. (Representative De Venecia) bested the other candidates, namely, Representative Francis Escudero (Representative Escudero), Representative Jacinto Paras, and Representative Ronaldo Zamora (Representative Zamora), in the bid for House speakership. The second placer, then Representative Escudero, automatically became the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> Within these past 30 years, there were only two (2) instances when the runner-up for House speakership did not sit as Minority Leader. During the 9<sup>th</sup> Congress, second placer Representative Jose Cojuangco gave up his Minority Leadership in favor of his party mate, Representative Hernando Perez. During the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress, Representative De Venecia ran unopposed, leaving out the possibility of having any second placer become the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Both circumstances do not apply here: the second placer, Representative Baguilat, has not given up his seat in favor of his party mate, and the winning speaker, Representative Alvarez, did not run unopposed. </p><p> An unopposed candidate for Speaker during the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress presented a challenge for the determination of a Minority Leader. Thus, the House amended the Rules of the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress so that the Minority Leader could be voted for separately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Under the amendment, "[t]he Minority Leader shall be elected by the members of the Minority and can be changed by a majority vote of all the Minority members at any time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The Minority members elected Representative Zamora as the Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> The express provision on electing the Minority Leader during the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress did not prevent the House from continuing the practice of making the second placer<i> ipso facto</i> its Minority Leader during the subsequent 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Congresses. Thus, the current interpretation is that when there are several candidates for Speaker, the same election is also the selection for the Minority Leader. Those who voted for the second placer became the Minority. </p><p> Thus, the 15<sup>th</sup> Congress (2010-2013) adopted the Rules of the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress. The long-standing parliamentary practice constituting the interpretation of the Rules of the House prevailed. Three (3) members then contended for speakership: Representative Feliciano R. Belmonte, Jr. (Representative Belmonte), Representative Edcel C. Lagman (Representative Lagman), and Representative Martin Romualdez (Representative Romualdez).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Representative Belmonte won as Speaker while Representative Lagman placed second in the election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The House gave weight to tradition and precedent and recognized second placer Representative Lagman as its Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> The same thing happened during the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress (2013-2016),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> where the House respected the tradition and interpretation by the body that the second placer will be the House Minority Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> This is a clear indication that the House itself accords due reverence to its established practices and traditions as its collective interpretation of its rules. Where there can be an ambiguity, practice and tradition should also be read into its Rules. Rule XXV, Section 161 of the Rules of the House of Representatives also provides that "[t]he parliamentary practices of ... the House of Representatives ... shall be suppletory to these Rules." </p><p> The House collectively considers the votes for the second placer for House Speaker as the votes of the Minority for its Minority Leader. Insofar as having the second placer automatically become the Minority Leader, this parliamentary practice was not merely suppletory to the Rules of the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Congresses—rather, it took primacy over the Rules themselves. There is no reason to treat the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress differently. Like the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Congresses, the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress involves a race among many candidates for Speaker and not simply one (1) unopposed candidate as in the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> On July 25, 2016, the House opened the First Regular Session of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress (2016-2019).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The Presiding Officer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> designated Representative Fariñas as Acting Floor Leader<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Upon Representative Fariñas' motion, the Body adopted the Rules of the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress as the Provisional Rules of the House of Representatives (Rules),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> with the minor amendment particularly related only to the dress code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The Rules took effect on the date of its adoption on July 25, 2016.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> There was no amendment relating to the process of selecting the Minority Leader. </p><p> The Body then proceeded with the period of nominations for the position of Speaker of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Three (3) persons were nominated: respondent Representative Alvarez, respondent Representative Suarez, and petitioner Representative Baguilat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Petitioner Representative Raul A.

In the weeks preceding the opening of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress on 25 July 2016, incessant reports were afloat, which were not seriously denied, that the supermajority coalition would lend to Rep.

Representative Marcoleta stated that the members who attended the election for Minority Leader on July 27, 2016 were the same members who abstained during the election for House Speaker.

[Joker P.] Arroyo was effectively prevented from questioning the presence of a quorum. Rep. Arroyo's earlier motion to adjourn for lack of quorum had already been defeated, as the roll call established the existence of a quorum. The question of quorum cannot be raised repeatedly—especially when the quorum is obviously present—for the purpose of delaying the business of the House.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In contrast, the petitioners have ably established the presence of grave abuse of discretion. Truly, the justiciability of the issue is anchored on the capricious, whimsical, and arbitrary judgment committed by respondents in neglecting and refusing to recognize Representative Baguilat as the <i>ipso facto </i>Minority Leader, in accordance with a long-established parliamentary practice and Rules of the House of Representatives. </p><p> There was also grave abuse of discretion in counting the votes of Representative Suarez and those of the independent members in the election for Minority Leader. On July 27, 2016, the day of the election for Minority Leader, Representative Suarez himself belonged to the Majority and was thus disqualified from being the Minority Leader. Likewise, the 20 abstaining members and the one (1) who registered a no-vote were independent members. Not being part of the Minority, these independent members were disqualified from electing a Minority Leader. </p><p> Rule II, Section 8 of the Rules states in full: </p><blockquote> <p> Members who vote for the winning candidate for Speaker shall constitute the Majority in the House and they shall elect from among themselves the Majority Leader. The Majority Leader may be changed, at any time, by a majority vote of all the Majority Members. </p> <p> The Minority Leader shall be elected by the Members of the Minority and can be changed, at any time, by a majority vote of all the Minority Members. </p> <p> The Majority and Minority shall elect such number of Deputy Majority and Minority Leaders as the rules provide. </p> <p> A Member may transfer from the Majority to the Minority, or vice versa, at any time: Provided, That: </p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> The concerned Member submits a written request to transfer to the Majority or Minority, through the Majority or Minority Leaders, as the case may be.

They may, however, choose to join the Majority or Minority upon written request to and approval thereof by the Majority or Minority, as the case maybe. </p> </blockquote> <p> Rule II, Section 8 has two (2) major components: (a) the first, second, and last paragraphs provide for the different kinds of members of the House of Representatives, and (b) the fourth to eighth paragraphs provide for the manner by which a Majority, Minority, or independent member may change affiliation. </p><p> The first paragraph of Rule II, Section 8 states that the representatives who vote for the winning candidate for Speaker shall constitute the Majority. The second paragraph declares that the Minority Leader shall be elected by Members of the Minority. The last paragraph confirms that "[m]embers who choose not to align themselves with the Majority or the Minority [i.e. those who abstained or registered a no-vote] shall be considered as independent Members of the House." Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Members who vote for the winning candidate for Speaker shall constitute the<em> Majority</em> in the House and they shall elect from among themselves the Majority Leader ... </p> <p> The Minority Leader shall be elected by the Members of the<em> Minority</em> and can be changed, at any time, by a majority vote of all the Minority Members. </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> Members who choose not to align themselves with the Majority or the Minority shall be considered as<em> independent </em>Members of the House. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Even the official website of the House of Representatives gives notice to the public that the Minority members are only those who voted for the Speaker's opponent but do not include those who abstained from voting: </p><blockquote> <p> Those who voted for the Speaker belong to the Majority while those who voted for the Speaker's opponent belong to the Minority. Representatives belonging to the Majority choose the Majority Floor Leader who automatically chairs the Committee on Rules, and those in the Minority choose the Minority Floor Leader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It is a basic legal principle that those not included in the enumeration are deemed excluded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> A person or thing omitted from an enumeration must be held to have been omitted intentionally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> As the definition of Minority omitted those representatives who abstained or opted for a "no­ vote," then they are deemed intentionally omitted from the definition. </p><p> Representative Fariñas himself mentioned the importance of following the Rules. According to him, "[a] law or a regulation is not repealed by non-observance. It can only be repealed by express repeal. <i>Kung hindi sinusunod iyan, batas pa rin iyan</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> </p><p> Ironically, in insisting on his July 25, 2016 interpretation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> of Rule II, Section 8, the Majority Leader was flouting the Rules himself. He cannot simply cling to a mistaken opinion without running afoul of the express provisions of the Rules. Neither Representative Fariñas' erroneous interpretation of Rule II, Section 8 nor petitioners' alleged silence cured the violation of the Rules and parliamentary practice of the House. </p><p> First, the records do not show that Representative Fariñas' own interpretation of Rule II, Section 8 was submitted for adoption by the requisite number of members or was ruled upon by the Presiding Officer on July 25, 2016. Rather, the records show that after giving his own interpretation of Rule II, Section 8, Representative Fariñas simply moved to proceed to the election for House Speaker without asking for a vote on whether the Body would adopt his opinion or not. </p><p> The House of Representatives Journal No. 1 dated July 25, 2016 narrates the events that transpired: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>DESIGNATION OF REP. FARIÑAS AS ACTING FLOOR LEADER</b> </p> <p> In the interest of orderly proceedings, the Presiding Officer designated Representative Rodolfo C. Fariñas of the First District of Ilocos Norte as Acting Floor Leader. </p> <p> <b>ADOPTION OF THE RULES OF THE HOUSE, AS AMENDED </b> </p> <p> On motion of Rep. Fariñas, there being no objection, the Body adopted the Rules of the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress as the Provisional Rules of the House to govern its proceedings until the adoption of the Rules for the 17<sup>th </sup>Congress, subject to the amendment that the first sentence of Section 94, Rule 12, entitled, "Conduct and Attire During Sessions and Committee Meetings," shall read as follows: MEMBERS SHALL WEAR PROPER ATTIRE WHICH IS BARONG FILIPINO OR COAT AND TIE OR BUSINESS ATTIRE FOR MEN, AND FILIPINA DRESS OR BUSINESS SUIT FOR WOMEN, AND OBSERVE PROPER DECORUM DURING SESSIONS AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. </p> <p> <b>PERIOD OF NOMINATIONS FOR THE POSITION OF THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE</b> </p> <p> In accordance with the constitutional duty of the House to organize and receive the President's State of the Nation Address later in the day, on motion of Rep. Fariñas, there being no objection, the Body proceeded to the period of nominations for the position of Speaker of the House. </p> <p> <b>POINT OF CLARIFICATION OF REP. ATIENZA</b> </p> <p> Upon recognition by the Chair, Rep. Jose L. Atienza Jr. said that he wanted to ask clarificatory questions on the election process. Rep. Fariñas said that he will entertain the same after the nomination period which the Chair thereafter adopted. </p> <p> <b>POINT OF ORDER OF REP. FUENTEBELLA</b> </p> <p> Recognized by the Chair, Rep. Arnulfo P. Fuentebella asked that the Chamber proceed to the oath-taking of the Members before the election of the Speaker, as was stated in the Order of Business. </p> <p> <b>RULING OF THE CHAIR</b> </p> <p> The Chair ruled that in accordance with (1) parliamentary tradition and practice and (2) the amended Rules of the House that the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress had adopted, it is the Speaker of the House that administers the oath to the new Members. She added that the oath-taking before the Speaker at the commencement of the First Regular Session is an affirmation of the oaths they had already taken before noontime of June 30, 2016. She explained that in accordance with several Supreme Court decisions, the Members had already complied with the three requirements for membership into the Chamber, namely, a valid certificate of proclamation; oath-taking before any duly authorized officer; and assumption into office without any question by noontime of June 30[,] 2016. She also stressed that the House's highest constitutional privilege was to organize itself before proceeding with its business. </p> <p> <b>MOTION OF REP. FUENTEBELLA</b> </p> <p> As he appealed the ruling of the Chair, Rep. Fuentebella said that it was anomalous for the House to elect the Speaker before the oath-taking of the Members. He then asked for a suspension of session as well as a voting on his point of order. </p> <p> <b>REMARKS OF REP. FARIÑAS</b> </p> <p> Upon recognition by the Chair, Rep. Fariñas read into the records Section 1, Rule 1 of the aforecited House Rules as he observed that Rep. Fuentebella did not cite any rule that was being violated. </p> <p> Thereupon, Rep. Fariñas moved that the Body recognize Rep. Feliciano Belmonte Jr. from the Fourth District of Quezon City for his nomination speech. </p> <p> <b>MANIFESTATION OF REP.

Under Rule XIV, Sections 111, 112, and 114: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 111. Authority to Move - Only the Committee on Rules can move for the suspension of the rules. </p> <p> Section 112. Vote Requirement - A voting of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members present, there being a quorum, is required to suspend any rule. </p> <p> Section 114. Debate; Effect of Suspension. - A motion to suspend the rules for the passage of a measure may be debated on for one (1) hour, which shall be divided equally between those in favor and those against. </p> <p> The House shall proceed to consider the measure after voting to suspend the rules. A two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Members present, there being a quorum, shall be necessary for the passage of said measure. </p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise, Rule XXVII, Section 164 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 164. Amendments to the Rules. - Any provision of these Rules, except those that are also embodied in the Constitution, may be amended by a majority vote of all the Members of the House. </p> </blockquote> <p> In ignoring the third category of independent membership and in allowing the independent members to intrude into the prerogative of the Minority to select its Minority Leader, Representative Fariñas clearly wanted to suspend or amend Rule II, Section 8 of the Rules. </p><p> Unfortunately, there was neither a Committee on Rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> that moved to suspend the Rules, as required by Section 111, nor a voting of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members present, as required by Section 112 of Rule XIV. There was also no vote taken by all members of the House to amend the Rules, as required by Rule XXVII, Section 164. Thus, Representative Fariñas' mere insistence on a different set of governing rules is invalid. </p><p> Third, there is no "estoppel by silence" that could amount to an amendment of the Rules. </p><p> Certainly, petitioners have not been silent. On July 26, 2016, a day immediately following Representative Fariñas' own interpretation of Rule II, Section 8, Representative Lagman raised a question of personal and collective privilege assailing such interpretation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> Representative Erice also made a manifestation and a parliamentary inquiry opposing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> </p><p> On July 27, 2016, after Representative Suarez clinched the position of Minority Leader with the help of the abstaining members' votes, Representative Marcoleta questioned how these abstaining members could have validly elected Representative Suarez as Minority Leader under the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> </p><p> On August 1, 2016, Representative Lagman also wrote to Speaker Alvarez, pointing out that Representative Fariñas erroneously interpreted Rule II, Section 8.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> </p><p> On August 15, 2016, Representative Lagman differed from Representative Fariñas' view on how one becomes part of the Majority or the Minority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> </p><p> Then finally, before this Court, petitioners point to the irregular procedure by which Representative Suarez obtained the position as Minority Leader. Thus, in repeatedly making such inquiries, petitioners cannot be estopped by their alleged silence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> especially since there was no such silence. </p><p> Fourth, the Rules of the House of Representatives do not cover the doctrine of estoppel. </p><p> Estoppel bars a person who admitted or represented something from later on denying or disproving that thing in <em>any litigation</em> arising from such admission or representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> The sessions before the House are not litigations; the election of its Minority Leader does not approximate a proceeding in court. </p><p> Article VI, Section 16(3) of the Constitution allows the House to determine its own rules during its deliberations. In view of this, the Body adopted the Rules of the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress as the Provisional Rules of the House of Representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> The proceedings in the House are guided by the Rules to which the House "has pledge[d] faithful obedience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> </p><p> In contrast, estoppel is a civil law concept found under Article 1431<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> of the Civil Code and Rule 131, Section 2(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> of the Revised Rules on Evidence. Neither of these provisions on estoppel forms part of the House Rules, whether directly or by reference. </p><p> Rule XXV, Section 161 explicitly states that only parliamentary practices of the Philippine Assembly, Congress, and the Batasang Pambansa apply suppletorily to the Rules. </p><p> Fifth, even assuming that "estoppel by silence" is recognized in House proceedings, this doctrine does not apply to the situation at bar. In <em>Santiago Syjuco, Inc. v. Castro</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p>[A]n estoppel may arise from silence as well as from words. "Estoppel by silence" arises where a person, who by force of circumstances is under a duty to another to speak, refrains from doing so and thereby leads the other to believe in the existence of a state of facts <em>in reliance on which [a person] acts to his [or her] prejudice</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Estoppel by silence may only be invoked if the person's failure to speak out caused prejudice or injury to the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> For instance, a property owner who knowingly allows another to sell the property without objecting to the transaction is estopped from setting up his title as against a third person who was misled by and suffered an injury from that transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> </p><p> Representative Fariñas failed to show how his reliance on petitioners' alleged silence to his wrong interpretation of the Rules on July 25, 2016 prejudiced him. Petitioners' silence did not injure his rights; rather, it was his insistence on this mistaken interpretation that has injured petitioners' rights. </p><p> Neither was Speaker Alvarez nor Representative Suarez prejudiced by petitioners' lack of objection to Representative Fariñas' opinion on July 25, 2016. On that day, Speaker Alvarez's election for House Speaker was already guaranteed while Representative Suarez had yet to become Minority Leader. The election for a Minority Leader would arrive only two (2) days later, on June 27, 2016. </p><p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><p> Majority Leader Representative Fariñas accepted the transfer of the 10 abstaining members to the<em> Majority</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> and that of Representative Suarez to the <em>Minority</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> Curiously, in both instances of transfer of membership, the Majority Leader had a say in the matter. </p><p> Unfortunately, under Rule II, Section 8, while the Majority Leader has discretion to accept a representative applying to be a member of the Majority, he or she does not have the same discretion when a representative applies to be part of the Minority. </p><p> The fourth to eighth paragraphs, which constitute the second major component of Rule II, Section 8, state: </p><blockquote> <p> A Member may transfer from the Majority to the Minority, or vice versa, at any time: Provided, That: </p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> The concerned Member submits a written request to transfer to the Majority or Minority, through the Majority or Minority Leaders, as the case may be.

The phrase, "as the case may be," implies that there are alternative scenarios here—a member may be transferring from the Majority to the Minority, from the Minority to the Majority, or from independent membership to the Minority or Majority. Whatever course of action he or she takes will flow through to the sentences that follow. </p><p> Under the fourth to eighth paragraphs of Rule II, Section 8, a Member may transfer from the Majority to the Minority, provided that: </p><ol start="" type="a"><li> The concerned [Majority] Member submits a written request to transfer to the ... Minority, through the ... Minority Leader[.] The Secretary General shall be furnished a copy of the request to transfer; <br><br></li><li> The ... Minority ... accepts the concerned Member in writing; and <br><br></li><li> The Speaker shall be furnished by the ... Minority [Leader] ... a copy of the acceptance in writing of the concerned Member. </li></ol> <p> Stated otherwise, the Majority member seeking to transfer to the Minority must write to the Minority Leader and ask to be accepted in the Minority. The Minority must accept the applicant-representative in writing, with the Minority Leader copy-furnishing to the House Speaker his or her letter of acceptance. The same is true for independent members seeking to transfer to the Minority. </p><p> Under the first, second, and last paragraphs of Rule II, Section 8, the 20 abstaining Members are independent members. The fourth to eighth paragraphs further reveal that these abstaining members are considered independent until they are accepted in the Minority by the <i>ipso facto</i> Minority Leader Representative Baguilat. Moreover, Representative Suarez, who voted for Speaker Alvarez, is himself considered part of the Majority. His request to transfer to the Minority needed the permission of Minority Leader Representative Baguilat and not that of Majority Leader Representative Fariñas. </p><p> The Majority Leader's contrary observation is incongruous to the purpose of a Minority. It is absurd to require the permission of the Majority Leader before a member may be accepted in the Minority. </p><p> One cannot imagine the kind of Minority that is created when the Majority Leader, instead of the Minority Leader, is the deciding person on who would constitute the Minority. Such undermines the opposition. It yields the absurd result of having the opposition subject to the discretion of the dominant group. </p><p> Words ought to be more subservient to the intent and not the intent to the words.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> In<em> Ty Sue v.

While the intention of the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, <em>the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law should not be sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words</em>.

Although these eight (8) representatives were not formally suspended, the House nevertheless excluded them from participating for the same reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> Due to the suspension of the Senators and Representatives, only 16 out of the required 18 Senators and 68 out of the 72 Representatives voted in favor of the Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> </p><p> <em>Mabanag </em>recognized that had the excluded members of Congress been allowed to vote, then the parity amendment that gave the Americans rights to our natural resources, which this Court ruled impacted on our sovereignty, would not have been enacted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> </p><p> Nevertheless, the absence of the necessary votes of three-fourths (3/4) of either branch of Congress, voting separately, did not prevent Congress from passing the Resolution. Petitioners thus assailed the Resolution for being unconstitutional. This Court, ruling under the 1935 Constitution, upheld the enactment despite the patent violation of Article XV, Section 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> </p><p> <em>Mabanag </em>ruled that Congress in joint session already certified that both Houses adopted the Resolution, which was already an enrolled bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> Thus, this Court had no more power to review as it was a political question: </p><blockquote> <p> In view of the foregoing considerations, we deem it unnecessary to decide the question of whether the senators and representatives who were ignored in the computation of the necessary three-fourths vote were members of Congress within the meaning of Section 1 of Article XV of the Philippine Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Justice Perfecto's dissent, however, considered the matter a constitutional question—that is to say, deciding whether respondents violated the requirements of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution was<em> within</em> this Court's jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> </p><p> Subsequent rulings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> have since delimited and clarified the political question doctrine, especially under the 1987 Constitution. It bears stressing that Article VIII, Section 1 explicitly grants this Court the power "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of<em> any </em>branch or instrumentality of the Government." </p><p> We cannot again shy away from this constitutional mandate. </p><p>The rule of law must still prevail in curbing any attempt to suppress the minority and eliminate dissent. </p><p> In <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> To a great degree, the 1987 Constitution has narrowed the reach of the political question doctrine when it <em>expanded the power of judicial review of this [C]ourt</em> not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Heretofore, the judiciary has focused on the "thou shalt not's" of the Constitution directed against the exercise of its jurisdiction. With the new provision, however,<em> courts are given a greater prerogative to determine what it can do to prevent grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government.</em> Clearly, the new provision did not just grant the Court power of doing nothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Any attempt by the dominant to silence dissent and take over an entire institution finds no room under the 1987 Constitution. Parliamentary practice and the Rules of the House of Representatives cannot be overruled in favor of personal agenda. </p><p> It is understandable for the majority in any deliberative body to push their advantages to the consternation of the minority. However, in a representative democracy marked with opportunities for deliberation, the complete annihilation of any dissenting voice, no matter how reasonable, is a prelude to many forms of authoritarianism. While politics speaks in numbers, many among our citizens can only hope that those political numbers are the result of mature discernment. Maturity in politics is marked by a courageous attitude to be open to the genuine opposition, who will aggressively point out the weaknesses of the administration, in an orderly fashion, within parliamentary forums. After all, if the true interest of the public is in mind, even the administration will benefit by criticism. </p><p align="center"> <b>VIII</b> </p><p> The remedy petitioners have chosen is a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus. To succeed, however, they should not only be able show that respondents' acts acknowledging Representative Suarez as the Minority Leader are null and void; they must also show that at the time this Court acts, petitioner Representative Baguilat still has the clear and unmistakable right to be recognized as the Minority Leader. </p><p> In my view, writs of mandamus against Congress should only be granted when this Court is satisfied, with an abundance of caution, that petitioner still has a clear legal right. The House of Representatives is a political forum where alliances change as soon as the Majority reveals its position on pressing issues, which may have ripened after the House's opening session and which its members may not have anticipated then. </p><p> Certainly, at the beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress, the right of Representative Baguilat was clear. However, since then, several significant votes, such as those on the death penalty bill and the extension of Martial Law, have been taken. The proper recourse in a case like this should just have been an action for certiorari or prohibition to annul the actions of the respondents. The House would then proceed to allow its Minority to convene and select its leader in accordance with the Rules. </p><p> The best kinds of dissents are those that are voiced from a platform of principle. By its very nature, dissents are carried by minorities. If history is to be properly understood, the persistent but often drowned out voices of the minority may be heard better in the future. </p><p> For the minority, the present may be unforgiving: for they will be shunned and often times shamed by powerful forces. Yet, dissents by minorities are always expressions of hope. In the near future, with the benefit of hindsight, their views will attain clarity to most, sooner rather than later. The creativity and wisdom of those who took a stand will then be truly appreciated. </p><p> It will be then that they will take their turn to be the majority. </p><p> With deep regret, in the absence of a showing of a clear and unmistakable present right on the part of petitioners, considering the possibility of shifting political alliances, I cannot vote to issue the writ of mandamus, even as I find that there was grave abuse of discretion. </p><p> Accordingly, I vote to<strong> DISMISS </strong>the petition but only because it was the wrong remedy. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Avelino v.
