SP No. 98112.<br><br><i><b>The Antecedent Facts</b></i><br><br>Respondent Lilibeth S. Chan owns a three-story commercial building located along A. Linao Street, Paco, Manila: covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 208782<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On May 10, 2000, she leased said commercial building to petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) for a period of five years from December 15, 1999 to December 14, 2004, with a monthly rental of P76,160.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> When the lease expired, PNB continued to occupy the property on a month-to­ month basis with a monthly rental of P116,788.44. PNB vacated the premises on March 23, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>Meanwhile, on January 22, 2002, respondent obtained a P1,500,000.00 Joan from PNB which was secured by a Real Estate Mortgage constituted over the leased property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, respondent executed a Deed of Assignment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; over the rental payments in favor of PNB.<br><br>The amount of the respondent's loan was subsequently increased to P7,500,000.00. Consequently, PNB and the respondent executed an "Amendment to the Real Estate Mortgage by Substitution of Collateral" on March 31, 2004, where the mortgage over the leased property was released and substituted by a mortgage over a parcel of land located in Paco, Manila, covered by TCT No. 209631.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>On August 26, 2005, respondent filed a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 7, Manila against PNB, alleging that the latter failed to pay its monthly rentals from October 2004 until August 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>In its defense, PNB claimed that it applied the rental proceeds from October 2004 to January 15, 2005 as payment for respondent's outstanding Joan which became due and demandable in October 2004. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> As for the monthly rentals from January 16, 2005 to February 2006, PNB explained that it received a demand letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; from a certain Lamberto Chua (Chua) who claimed to be the new owner of the leased property and requested that the rentals be paid directly to him, reckoned from January 15, 2005 until PNB decides to vacate the premises or a new lease contract with Chua is executed. PNB thus deposited the rentals in a separate non­ drawing savings account for the benefit of the rightful party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>The MeTC held a hearing on April 25, 2006 where the parties agreed to apply the rental proceeds&nbsp; from October&nbsp; 2004&nbsp; to January&nbsp; 15, 2005 to the respondent's outstanding loan".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> PNB, too, consigned the amount of P1,348,643.92, representing the rentals due from January 16, 2005 to February 2006, with the court on May 31, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court</b></i><br><br>In its August 9, 2006 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; the MeTC ordered PNB to pay respondent accrued rentals in the amount of P1,348,643.92<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; with interest at 6% per annum from January 16, 2005 up to March 23, 2006, when PNB finally vacated the leased property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The MeTC likewise directed PNB to pay attorney's fees in the amount of P20,000.00 and the cost of suit.<br><br>PNB appealed the August 9, 2006 MeTC Decision to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 14, Manila, insisting that respondent is not entitled to the disputed rental proceeds amounting to P1,348,643.92.&nbsp; According to PNB, the money should be applied to offset respondent's outstanding loan pursuant to the Deed of Assignment the latter executed in its favor.&nbsp; PNB also argued that it is not liable to pay any interest on the lease rentals since it did not incur any delay in the payment of rent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <br><br>While the appeal was pending before the RTC, PNB initiated foreclosure proceedings on the mortgaged property covered by TCT No. 209631.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The property was sold on October 31, 2006 for P15,311,000.00 to PNB as the highest bidder.

Thus, PNB claimed that it is entitled to a deficiency claim amounting to 2,705,300.71 to which the rental proceeds of P1,348,643.92 can be applied.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[24]</sup></font><br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</b></i><br><br>The RTC affirmed the MeTC ruling in its December 7, 2006 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; It found that respondent's obligation to PNB "has already been paid, notwithstanding the belated claim of [the latter] that there remains a deficiency."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The RTC noted that the P11,211,283.53 amount of indebtedness stated in the Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; dated August 9, 2006 as of May 15, 2006 plus penalties, expenses, charges, attorney's fees and expenses could have been easily covered by the P15,311,000.00 bid price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <br><br>In addition, the RTC held that PNB incurred delay "when despite demand, it refused to pay and vacate the premises.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "&nbsp; As such, the RTC ruled that the respondent is entitled to legal interest at 6% per annum and attorney's fees for having been compelled to litigate to protect her interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><br>The respondent then moved for tie issuance of a Writ of Execution which was granted by the RTC in its December 18, 2006 Order?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Sheriff's Report of Execution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; dated January&nbsp; 2, 2007, the amount of P1,348,643.92, representing the monthly rentals from January 16, 2005 up to March 23, 2006 was turned over to the respondent on December 20, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <br><br>PNB filed a motion for reconsideration of the December 7, 2006 Decision and for the quashal of the Writ of Execution, but the RTC denied the motion in its Order dated February 6, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Following the denial, PNB filed a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court before the CA, challenging the RTC's December 7, 2006 Decision and February 6, 2007 Order.<br><br><i><b>Ruling of the CourT of Appeals</b></i><br><br>Title CA pointed out that PNB's entitlement to the rental proceeds in the amount of P1,348,643.92 is dependent on whether there is a deficiency in payment after the foreclosure sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35] </sup>It, however, found no sufficient evidence on record that the amount of respondent's liability as of October 31, 2006 is indeed P18,016,300.71, PNB claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Consequently, the CA remanded the case the MeTC for the proper reception of evidence and determination, if any, of the deficiency on the foreclosure sale with the following guidelines:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote>(1) From October 2004 to January 15, 2005: Principal+ Interest+ Penalties­ Monthly Rentals (from October 2004 to January 15, 2005 by virtue of the Deed of Assignment) New Principal<br><br>(2) From January 16, 2005 to October 31, 2006: New Principal + Interest + Penalties - Interest Earned by PNB from the Savings Account&nbsp;&nbsp; Outstanding Obligation as of October 31, 2006<br><br>(3) Outstanding Obligation as of October 31, 2006 - P15,311,000.00 = Deficiency<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </blockquote>As regards the payment of legal interest, the CA noted that PNB merely opened a non-drawing savings acc01mt wherein it deposited the monthly rentals from January 16, 2005 to February 2006. Such deposit of the rentals in a savings account, however, is not the consignation contemplated by law. Thus, the CA found PNB liable to pay the 6% legal interest rate prescribed under Article 2209 of the Civil Code tor having defaulted in the payment of its monthly rentals to the respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <br><br>Finally, the CA deleted the award of attorney's fees, pursuant to the general rule that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the public policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <br><br>PNB filed a partial Motion for Reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution dated February 21, 2013.

Although it is true that consignment has a retroactive effect, such payment is deemed to have been made only at the time of the deposit of the thing in court or when it was placed at the disposal of the judicial authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Based on these premises, PNB's payment of the monthly rentals can only be considered to have been made not earlier than May 31, 2006.<br><br>Given its <i>belated</i> consignment of the rental proceeds in court, <b>PNB clearly defaulted in the payment of monthly rentals to the respondent for the period January 16, 2005 up to March 23, 2006, when it finally vacated the leased property</b>. As such, it is liable to pay interest in accordance with Article 2209 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Article 2209 provides that if the debtor incurs delay in the performance of an obligation consisting of the payment of a sum of money, he shall be liable to pay the interest agreed upon and in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest at 6% per annum. There being no stipulated interest in this case, PNB is liable to pay legal interest at 6% per annum, from January 16, 2005 up to May 30, 2006.<br><br>As for the issue on PNB's entitlement to the subject rental proceeds to cover the deficiency in payment after the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property, we agree with the CA's finding that there is no sufficient evidence on record to show that such a deficiency exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Statement of Account <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> submitted by PNB is not enough to prove this claim, considering that it is unsupported by any corroborating evidence. Besides, the copy of the document in our records, both in the CA <i>rollo</i> and the Supreme Court <i>rollo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; consists of illegible pages.<br><br>We likewise agree with the CA's conclusion that the RTC seriously erred when it categorically stated that the loan was fully paid by virtue of the foreclosure sale <i>without determining the extent of the respondent's liability as of October 31, 2006</i>, the date of the foreclosure sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; Specifically, the RTC held that:<br><blockquote>x x x In this regard, the amount of the indebtedness, was clearly stated in the Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale dated August 9, 2006 as P11,211,283.53,<b> as of May 15, [2006]</b>, exclusive of penalties, expenses, charges, attorney's fees and expenses. And since the property was sold to the bank as the winning bidder at P15,311,000.00, obviously,<b> the difference could have easily covered the said penalties,</b> etc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </blockquote>This is clearly an error. It is settled that a mortgagee has the right to recover the deficiency resulting from the difference between the amount obtained in the sale at public auction and the outstanding obligation of the mortgagor at the time of the foreclosure proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC failed to consider that the amount of indebtedness indicated in the Notice ofEx1ra-Judicial Sale<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; dated August 9, 2006 was computed by PNB as of May 15, 2006.&nbsp; Surely, the respondent's liability would have significantly increased by the time the foreclosure sale was held on October 31, 2006.<br><br>It also appears that the RTC merely <i>assumed </i>that the bid price would cover the deficiency in payment, without actually making a determination of whether such a deficiency exists and how much it really is.<br><br>In these lights, we uphold the CA's ruling remanding the case to the MeTC for the proper reception of evidence and computation of respondent's total indebtedness a of October 31, 2006, in order to determine whether there exists a deficiency in payment as PNB insist.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>and <b>AFFIRM</b> the Decision dated May 28, 2012 and the Resolution dated February 21, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
