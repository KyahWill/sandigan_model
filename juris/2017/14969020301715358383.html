				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On July 19, 2016, the Court promulgated its decision, disposing:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petitions for <i>certiorari</i>; <b>ANNULS</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the resolutions issued in Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0174 by the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> on April 6, 2015 and September 10, 2015; <b>GRANTS</b> the petitioners' respective demurrers to evidence; <b>DISMISSES</b> Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0174 as to the petitioners <b>GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO</b> and <b>BENIGNO AGUAS</b> for insufficiency of evidence; <b>ORDERS</b> the immediate release from detention of said petitioners; and <b>MAKES</b> no pronouncements on costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>On August 3, 2016, the State, through the Office of the Ombudsman, has moved for the reconsideration of the decision, submitting that:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li><b>THIS HONORABLE COURT'S GIVING DUE COURSE TO A CERTIORARI ACTION ASSAILING AN INTERLOCUTORY ORDER DENYING DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE <u>VIOLATES RULE 119, SECTION 23</u> OF THE RULES OF COURT, WHICH PROVIDES THAT AN ORDER DENYING THE DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE SHALL <u>NOT BE REVIEWABLE</u> BY APPEAL OR BY CERTIORARI <i>BEFORE</i> JUDGMENT.</b><br><br></li><li><b>THE HONORABLE COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ERRORS WHICH AMOUNT TO A VIOLATION OR DEPRIVATION OF THE STATE'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW.</b><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li><b>THE DECISION REQUIRES <i>ADDITIONAL</i> ELEMENTS IN THE PROSECUTION Of PLUNDER, <i>VIZ</i>. <u>IDENTIFICATION OF THE MAIN PLUNDERER</u> AND <u>PERSONAL BENEFIT TO HIM/HER</u>, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NOT PROVIDED IN THE TEXT OF REPUBLIC ACT (R.A.)

Macapagal-Arroyo (Arroyo) points out that the State miserably failed to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of plunder; that the Court correctly required the identification of the main plunderer as well as personal benefit on the part of the raider of the public treasury to enable the successful prosecution of the crime of plunder; that the State did not prove the conspiracy that justified her inclusion in the charge; that to sustain the case for malversation against her, in lieu of plunder, would violate her right to be informed of the accusation against her because the information did not necessarily include the crime of malversation; and that even if the information did so, the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy already barred the re-opening of the case for that purpose.<br><br>Petitioner Benigno B. Aguas echoes the contentions of Arroyo in urging the Court to deny the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>In reply, the State avers that the prohibition against double jeopardy does not apply because it was denied its day in court, thereby rendering the decision void; that the Court should re-examine the facts and pieces of evidence in order to find the petitioners guilty as charged; and that the allegations of the information sufficiently included all that was necessary to fully inform the petitioners of the accusations against them.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The Court <b>DENIES</b> the motion for reconsideration for its lack of merit.<br><br>To start with, the State argues that the consolidated petitions for <i>certiorari</i> were improper remedies in light of Section 23, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court expressly prohibiting the review of the denial of their demurrer prior to the judgment in the case either by appeal or by <i>certiorari</i>; that the Court has thereby limited its own power, which should necessarily prevent the giving of due course to the petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, as well as the undoing of the order denying the petitioners' demurrer to evidence; that the proper remedy under the <i>Rules of Court</i> was for the petitioners to proceed to trial and to present their evidence-in-chief thereat; and that even if there had been grave abuse of discretion attending the denial, the Court's <i>certiorari</i> powers should be exercised only upon the petitioners' compliance with the stringent requirements of Rule 65, particularly with the requirement that there be no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, which they did not establish.<br><br>Section 23, Rule 119 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, pertinently provides:<br><blockquote>Section 23. <i>Demurrer to evidence</i>. - x x x <br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The order denying the motion for leave of court to file demurrer to evidence or the demurrer itself shall not be reviewable by appeal or by certiorari before judgment.</b> (n)<br></blockquote>The argument of the State, which is really a repetition of its earlier submission, was squarely resolved in the decision, as follows:<br><blockquote>The Court holds that it should take cognizance of the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> because the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, as shall shortly be demonstrated, gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>The special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is generally not proper to assail such an interlocutory order issued by the trial court because of the availability of another remedy in the ordinary course of law. Moreover, Section 23, Rule 119 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> expressly provides that "the order denying the motion for leave of court to file demurrer to evidence or the demurrer itself shall not be reviewable by appeal or by <i>certiorari</i> before judgment." It is not an insuperable obstacle to this action, however, that the denial of the demurrers to evidence of the petitioners was an interlocutory order that did not terminate the proceedings, and the proper recourse of the demurring accused was to go to trial, and that in case of their conviction they may then appeal the conviction, and assign the denial as among the errors to be reviewed. Indeed, it is doctrinal that the situations in which the writ of <i>certiorari</i> may issue should not be limited, because to do so -<br><blockquote>x x x would be to destroy its comprehensiveness and usefulness. So wide is the discretion of the court that authority is not wanting to show that <i>certiorari</i> is more discretionary than either prohibition or <i>mandamus</i>. <b>In the exercise of our superintending control over other courts, we are to be guided by all the circumstances of each particular case 'as the ends of justice may require.' So it is that the writ will be granted where necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice.</b><br></blockquote>The Constitution itself has imposed upon the Court and the other courts of justice the duty to correct errors of jurisdiction as a result of capricious, arbitrary, whimsical and despotic exercise of discretion by expressly incorporating in Section 1 of Article VIII the following provision:<br><blockquote>Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.<br></blockquote><b>The exercise of this power to correct grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government cannot be thwarted by rules of procedure to the contrary or for the sake of the convenience of one side. This is because the Court has the bounden constitutional duty to strike down grave abuse of discretion <i>whenever</i> and <i>wherever</i> it is committed. Thus, notwithstanding the interlocutory character and effect of the denial of the demurrers to evidence, the petitioners as the accused could avail themselves of the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> when the denial was tainted with grave abuse of discretion. As we shall soon show, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> as the trial court was guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it capriciously denied the demurrers to evidence despite the absence of competent and sufficient evidence to sustain the indictment for plunder, and despite the absence of the factual bases to expect a guilty verdict.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>We reiterate the foregoing resolution, and stress that the prohibition contained in Section 23, Rule 119 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> is not an insuperable obstacle to the review by the Court of the denial of the demurrer to evidence through <i>certiorari</i>. We have had many rulings to that effect in the past. For instance, in <i>Nicolas v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Court expressly ruled that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was the proper remedy to assail the denial of the demurrer to evidence that was tainted with grave abuse of discretion or excess of jurisdiction, or oppressive exercise of judicial authority.<br><br>Secondly, the State submits that its right to due process was violated because the decision imposed additional elements for plunder that neither Republic Act No. 7080 nor jurisprudence had theretofore required, <i>i.e.</i>, the identification of the main plunderer, and personal benefit on the part of the accused committing the predicate crime of raid on the public treasury. The State complains that it was not given the opportunity to establish such additional elements; that the imposition of new elements further amounted to judicial legislation in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers; that the Court nitpicked on the different infirmities of the information despite the issue revolving only around the sufficiency of the evidence; and that it established all the elements of plunder beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The State cites the plain meaning rule to highlight that the crime of plunder did not require personal benefit on the part of the raider of the public treasury. It insists that the definition of <i>raids on the public treasury</i>, conformably with the plain meaning rule, is the taking of public money through fraudulent or unlawful means, and such definition does not require enjoyment or personal benefit on the part of plunderer or on the part of any of his co-conspirators for them to be convicted for plunder.<br><br>The submissions of the State are unfounded.<br><br>The requirements for the identification of the main plunderer and for personal benefit in the predicate act of <i>raids on the public treasury</i> have been written in R.A. No. 7080 itself as well as embedded in pertinent jurisprudence. This we made clear in the decision, as follows:<br><blockquote>A perusal of the information suggests that what the Prosecution sought to show was an implied conspiracy to commit plunder among all of the accused on the basis of their collective actions prior to, during and after the implied agreement. It is notable that the Prosecution did not allege that the conspiracy among all of the accused was by express agreement, or was a wheel conspiracy or a chain conspiracy.<br><br>This was another fatal flaw of the Prosecution.<br><br>In its present version, under which the petitioners were charged, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080 (Plunder Law) states:<br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties</i>. - Any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense. In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court. The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State. [As Amended by Section 12, Republic Act No. 7659 (The Death Penalty Law)]<br></blockquote>Section 1(d) of Republic Act No. 7080 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Definition of terms</i>. - As used in this Act, the term:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>d. "<i>Ill-gotten wealth</i>" means any asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of any person within the purview of Section two (2) hereof, acquired by him directly or indirectly through dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and/or business associates by any combination or series of the following means or similar schemes:<br><br>1. Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse, or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<br><br>2. By receiving, directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks or any/or entity in connection with any government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of the public officer concerned;<br><br>3. By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the National Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities or government­ owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries;<br><br>4. By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation including the promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;<br><br>5. By establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combinations and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular persons or special interests; or<br><br>6. By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.<br></blockquote><b>The law on plunder requires that a particular public officer must be identified as the one who amassed, acquired or accumulated ill-gotten wealth because it plainly states that plunder is committed by any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill­ gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of at least P50,000,000.00 through a <i>combination</i> or <i>series</i> of overt criminal acts us described in Section 1(d) hereof. Surely, the law requires in the criminal charge for plunder against several individuals that there must be a main plunderer and her co-conspirators, who may be members of her family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons. In other words, the allegation of the wheel conspiracy or express conspiracy in the information was appropriate because the main plunderer would then be identified in either manner. Of course, implied conspiracy could also identify the main plunderer, but that fact must be properly alleged and duly proven by the Prosecution.</b><br><br>This interpretation is supported by <i>Estrada v. Sandiganbayan</i>, where the Court explained the nature of the conspiracy charge and the necessity for the main plunderer for whose benefit the amassment, accumulation and acquisition was made, thus:<br><blockquote>There is no denying the fact that the "plunder of an entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy" is made up of a complex and manifold network of crimes. In the crime of plunder, therefore, different parties may be united by a common purpose. In the case at bar, the different accused and their different criminal acts have a commonality - to help the former President amass, accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth. Sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) in the Amended Information alleged the different participation of each accused in the conspiracy. <b>The gravamen of the conspiracy charge, therefore,</b> is not that each accused agreed to receive protection money from illegal gambling, that each misappropriated a portion of the tobacco excise tax, that each accused ordered the GSIS and SSS to purchase shares of Belle Corporation and receive commissions from such sale, nor that each unjustly enriched himself from commissions, gifts and kickbacks; rather, it <b>is that each of them, by their individual acts, agreed to participate, directly or indirectly, in the amassing, accumulation and acquisition of ill-gotten wealth of and/or <u>for</u> former President Estrada</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> [bold underscoring supplied for emphasis]<br></blockquote></blockquote>Indeed, because plunder is a crime that only a public official can commit by amassing, accumulating, or acquiring ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of at least P50,000,000.00, the identification in the information of such public official as the main plunderer among the several individuals thus charged is logically necessary under the law itself. In particular reference to Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0174, the individuals charged therein - including the petitioners were 10 public officials; hence, it was only proper to identify the main plunderer or plunderers <i>among the 10 accused</i> who herself or himself had amassed, accumulated, or acquired ill-gotten wealth with the total value of at least P50,000,000.00.<br><br>The phrase <i>raids on the public treasury</i> as used in Section 1(d) of R. A. No. 7080 is itself ambiguous. In order to ascertain the objective meaning of the phrase, the act of raiding the public treasury cannot be divided into parts. This is to differentiate the predicate act of <i>raids on the public treasury</i> from other offenses involving property, like robbery, theft, or <i>estafa</i>. Considering that R.A. No. 7080 does not expressly define this predicate act, the Court has necessarily resorted to statutory construction. In so doing, the Court did not adopt the State's submission that personal benefit on the part of the accused need not be alleged and shown because doing so would have defeated the clear intent of the law itself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which was to punish the amassing, accumulating, or acquiring of ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of at least P50,000,000.00 by any combination or series of acts of misappropriation, conversion, misuse, or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury.<br><br>As the decision has observed, the rules of statutory construction as well as the deliberations of Congress indicated the intent of Congress to require personal benefit for the predicate act of <i>raids on the public treasury</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The phrase <i>raids on the public treasury</i> is found in Section 1(d) of R.A. No. 7080, which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. - x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>d) Ill-gotten wealth means any asset, property, business<br><br>enterprise or material possession of any person within the purview of Section Two (2) hereof, acquired by him directly or indirectly through dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and/or business associates by any combination or series of the following means or similar schemes:<br><br>1) Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse, or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><b>To discern the proper import of the phrase <i>raids on the public treasury</i>, the key is to look at the accompanying words: <i>misappropriation, conversion, misuse</i> or <i>malversation of public funds</i>. This process is conformable with the maxim of statutory construction <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, by which the correct construction of a particular word or phrase that is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings may be made by considering the company of the words in which the word or phrase is found or with which it is associated. Verily, a word or phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or phrases, and its meaning may, therefore, be modified or restricted by the latter.</b><br><br><b><i>To convert</i> connotes the act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own; <i>to misappropriate</i> means to own, to take something for one's own benefit; <i>misuse</i> means "a good, substance, privilege, or right used improperly, unforeseeably, or not as intended;" and <i>malversation</i> occurs when "any public officer who, by reason of the duties of his office, is accountable for public funds or property, shall appropriate the same or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, through abandonment or negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds, or property, wholly or partially." The common thread that binds all the four terms together is that the public officer <i>used</i> the property taken. Considering that <i>raids on the public treasury</i> is in the company of the four other terms that require the use of the property taken, the phrase <i>raids on the public treasury</i> similarly requires such use of the property taken. Accordingly, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> gravely erred in contending that the mere accumulation and gathering constituted the forbidden act of <i>raids on the public treasury</i>. Pursuant to the maxim of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, <i>raids on the public treasury</i> requires the raider to use the property taken impliedly for his personal benefit.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Prosecution asserts that the Senate deliberations removed <i>personal benefit</i> as a requirement for plunder. In not requiring personal benefit, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> quoted the following exchanges between Senator Enrile and Senator Tañada, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Senator Enrile. The word here, Mr. President, "such public officer or person who conspired <b>or knowingly benefited</b>". <b>One does not have to conspire or rescheme.</b> The only element needed is that he "knowingly benefited". A candidate for the Senate for instance, who received a political contribution from a plunderer, knowing that the contributor is a plunderer and therefore, he knowingly benefited from the plunder, would he also suffer the penalty, Mr. President, for life imprisonment?<br><br>Senator Tañada. In the committee amendments, Mr. President, we have deleted these lines 1 to 4 and part of line 5, on page 3. But, in a way, Mr. President, it is good that the Gentleman is bringing out these questions, I believe that under the examples he has given, the Court will have to...<br><br>Senator Enrile. How about the wife, Mr. President, he may not agree with the plunderer to plunder the country but because she is a dutiful wife or a faithful husband, she has to keep her or his vow of fidelity to the spouse. And, of course, she enjoys the benefits out of the plunder. Would the Gentleman now impute to her or him the crime of plunder simply because she or he knowingly benefited out of the fruits of the plunder and, therefore, he must suffer or he must suffer the penalty of life imprisonment?<br><br>The President. That was stricken out already in the Committee amendment.<br><br>Senator Tañada. Yes, Mr. President. Lines 1 to 4 and part of line 5 were stricken out in the Committee amendment. But, as I said, the examples of the Minority Floor Leader are still worth spreading the <i>Record</i>. And, I believe that in those examples, the Court will have just to take into consideration all the other circumstances prevailing in the case and the evidence that will be submitted.<br><br>The President. In any event, 'knowingly benefited' has already been stricken off.<br></blockquote>The exchanges between Senator Enrile and Senator Tañada reveal, therefore, that what was removed from the coverage of the bill and the final version that eventually became the law was a person who was not the main plunderer or a co-conspirator, but one who personally benefited from the plunderers' action. The requirement of personal benefit on the part of the main plunderer or his co-conspirators by virtue of their plunder was not removed.<br><br>As a result, not only did the Prosecution fail to show where the money went but, more importantly, that GMA and Aguas had personally benefited from the same. Hence, the Prosecution did not prove the predicate act of <i>raids on the public treasury</i> beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Thirdly, the State contends that the Court did not appreciate the totality of its evidence, particularly the different irregularities committed in the disbursement of the PCSO funds, <i>i.e.</i>, the commingling of funds, the non-compliance with LOI No. 1282, and the unilateral approval of the disbursements. Such totality, coupled with the fact of the petitioners' indispensable cooperation in the pilfering of public funds, showed the existence of the conspiracy to commit plunder among all of the accused.<br><br>The contention lacks basis.<br><br>As can be readily seen from the decision, the Court expressly granted the petitioners' respective demurrers to evidence and dismissed the plunder case against them for insufficiency of evidence because:<br><blockquote>x x x the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> as the trial court was guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it capriciously denied the demurrers to evidence <b>despite the absence of competent and sufficient evidence to sustain the indictment for plunder, and despite the absence of the factual bases to expect a guilty verdict</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Such disposition of the Court fully took into consideration <i>all</i> the evidence adduced against the petitioners. We need not rehash our review of the evidence thus adduced, for it is enough simply to stress that the Prosecution failed to establish the <i>corpus delicti</i> of plunder - that any or all of the accused public officials, particularly petitioner Arroyo, had amassed, accumulated, or acquired ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of at least P50,000,000.00.<br><br>Fourthly, in accenting certain inadequacies of the allegations of the information, the Court did not engage in purposeless nitpicking, and did not digress from the primary task of determining the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the State against the petitioners. What the Court thereby intended to achieve was to highlight what would have been relevant in the <i>proper</i> prosecution of plunder and thus enable itself to discern and determine whether the evidence of guilt was sufficient or not. In fact, the Court categorically clarified that in discussing the essential need for the identification of the main plunderer it was not harping on the sufficiency of the information, but was only enabling itself to search for and to find the relevant proof that unequivocally showed petitioner Arroyo as the "mastermind" - which was how the Sandiganbayan had characterized her participation in the context of the implied conspiracy alleged in the information. But the search came to naught, for the information contained nothing that averred her commission of the <i>overt act</i> necessary to implicate her in the supposed conspiracy to commit the crime of plunder. Indeed, the Court assiduously searched for but did not find the sufficient incriminatory evidence against the petitioners. Hence, the Sandiganbayan capriciously and oppressively denied their demurrers to evidence.<br><br>Fifthly, the State posits that it established at least a case for malversation against the petitioners.<br><br>Malversation is defined and punished under Article 217 of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, which reads thusly:<br><blockquote>Article 217. <i>Malversation of public funds or property; Presumption of malversation</i>. - Any public officer who, by reason of the duties of his office, is accountable for public funds or property, shall appropriate the same or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, through abandonment or negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds, or property, wholly or partially, or shall otherwise be guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property, shall suffer:<br><br>1. The penalty of <i>prison correccional</i> in its medium and maximum periods, if the amount involved in the misappropriation or malversation does not exceed two hundred pesos.<br><br>2. The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount involved is more than two hundred pesos but does not exceed six thousand pesos.<br><br>3. The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its maximum period to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> in its minimum period, if the amount involved is more than six thousand pesos but is less than twelve thousand pesos.<br><br>4. The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, in its medium and maximum periods, if the amount involved is more than twelve thousand pesos but is less than twenty-two thousand pesos. If the amount exceeds the latter, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In all cases, persons guilty of malversation shall also suffer the penalty of perpetual special disqualification and a fine equal to the amount of the funds malversed or equal to the total value of the property embezzled.<br><br>The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use. (As amended by RA 1060).<br></blockquote>The elements of malversation are that: (a) the offender is an accountable public officer; (b) he/she is responsible for the misappropriation of public funds or property through intent or negligence; and (c) he/she has custody of and received such funds and property by reason of his/her office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The information in Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0174<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> avers:<br><blockquote>The undersigned Assistant Ombudsman and Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer III, Office of the Ombudsman, hereby accuse GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, ROSARIO C.

The omission from the information of factual details descriptive of the aforementioned elements of malversation highlighted the insufficiency of the allegations. Consequently, the State's position is entirely unfounded.<br><br>Lastly, the petitioners insist that the consideration and granting of the motion for reconsideration of the State can amount to a violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy because their acquittal under the decision was a prior jeopardy within the context of Section 21, Article III (<i>Bill of Rights</i>) of the 1987 Constitution, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 21. No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. If an act is punished by a law and an ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the same act.<br></blockquote>The insistence of the petitioners is fully warranted. Indeed, the consideration and granting of the motion for reconsideration of the State will amount to the violation of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.<br><br>The Court's consequential dismissal of Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0174 as to the petitioners <i>for insufficiency of evidence</i> amounted to their <i>acquittal</i> of the crime of plunder charged against them. In <i>People v. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court shows why:<br><blockquote>In <i>People v. Sandiganbayan</i>, this Court explained the general rule that the grant of a demurrer to evidence operates as an acquittal and is, thus, final and unappealable, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>The demurrer to evidence in criminal cases, such as the one at bar, is "<i>filed after the prosecution had rested its case</i>," and when the same is granted, it calls "for an appreciation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and its sufficiency to warrant conviction beyond reasonable doubt, resulting in a <i>dismissal of file case on the merits, tantamount to an acquittal of the accused</i>." Such dismissal of a criminal case by the grant of demurrer to evidence may not be appealed, for to do so would be to place the accused in double jeopardy. The verdict being one of acquittal, the case ends there.</b><br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>The rule on double jeopardy, however, is not without exceptions. In <i>People v. Laguio, Jr.</i>, this Court stated that the only instance when double jeopardy will not attach is when the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion, thus:<br><blockquote><b>... The only instance when double jeopardy will not attach is when the <u>trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</u>, such as where the prosecution was denied the opportunity to present its case or where the trial was a sham.</b> However, while <i>certiorari</i> may be availed of to correct an erroneous acquittal, the petitioner in such an extraordinary proceeding must clearly demonstrate that the trial court blatantly abused its authority to a point so grave as to deprive it of its very power to dispense justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The constitutional prohibition against placing a person under double jeopardy for the same offense bars not only a new and independent prosecution but also an appeal in the same action after jeopardy had attached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As such, every <i>acquittal</i> becomes final <i>immediately upon promulgation</i> and cannot be recalled for correction or amendment. With the acquittal being immediately final, granting the State's motion for reconsideration in this case would violate the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy because it would effectively reopen the prosecution and subject the petitioners to a second jeopardy <i>despite their acquittal</i>.<br><br>It is cogent to remind in this regard that the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy provides to the accused three related protections, specifically: <i>protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and protection against multiple punishments for the same offense</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The rationale for the three protections is expounded in <i>United States v. Wilson</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote><b>The interests underlying these three protections are quite similar. When a defendant has been once convicted and punished for a particular crime, principles of fairness and finality require that he not be subjected to the possibility of further punishment by being again tried or sentenced for the same offense.</b> <i>Ex parte Lange</i>, 18 Wall 163 (1874); <i>In re Nielsen</i>, 131 U.S. 176 (1889). <b>When a defendant has been acquitted of an offense, the Clause guarantees that the State shall not be permitted to make repeated attempts to convict him,</b><br><blockquote><b>"thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal, and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though innocent, he may be found guilty."</b><br></blockquote><i>Green v. United States</i>, 355 U.S. 184, 187-188 (1957).<br><blockquote><b>The policy of avoiding multiple trials has been regarded as so important that exceptions to the principle have been only grudgingly allowed. Initially, a new trial was thought to be unavailable after appeal, whether requested by the prosecution or the defendant.</b> See <i>United States v. Gibert</i>, 25 F. Cas. 1287 (No. 15,204) (CCD Mass. 1834) (Story, J.). <b>It was not until 1896 that it was made clear that a defendant could seek a new trial after conviction, even though the Government enjoyed no similar right.</b> <i>United States v.

It effectively requires new elements to the crime of plunder that are not sustained by the text of the Anti-Plunder Law. In doing so, this Court sets itself upon the course of encroaching on Congress' plenary power to make laws. It also denies the State the opportunity to adequately present its case. Likewise, it unwittingly licenses the most cunning plunderers to prey upon public funds with impunity.<br><br>This is <i>not</i> what the Anti-Plunder Law intends.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Republic Act No. 7080 or the Anti-Plunder Law was adopted in the wake of the Marcos dictatorship, when the pilferage of the country's wealth by former President Ferdinand E.

Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties. - Any <i>public officer</i> who, <i>by himself or in connivance</i> with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or <i>acquires ill-gotten wealth</i> through a <i>combination or series of overt or criminal acts</i> as described in Section 1(d) hereof, in the aggregate amount or total value <i>of at least Fifty million pesos</i> (P50,000,000.00), shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by life imprisonment with perpetual absolute disqualification from holding any public office. Any person who participated with said public officer in the commission of plunder shall likewise be punished. In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances shall be considered by the court. The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stock derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This statutory definition may be divided into three (3) main parts.<br><br>The first part identifies the persons who may be liable for plunder and the central acts around which plunder revolves. It penalizes "[a]ny public officer who, by himself or <i>in connivance with</i> members of his family, relatives... or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth[.]"<br><br>The law only requires a showing that a person holds public office. He or she may act alone or in conspiracy with others. Thus, the Anti-Plunder Law explicitly recognizes that plunder may be committed collectively "in connivance with" others. In doing so, it makes no distinction between the conspirators. Glaringly absent is any mention of a so-called "main plunderer" or specific "personal benefit" gained by any confederate to the crime.<br><br>It is also silent on the manner by which conspirators organized themselves, or otherwise went about committing the offense. Thus, there is no need to show that plunder is centralized. All that Section 2 requires is proof that the accused acted out of a common design to amass, accumulate, or acquire ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>The second part specifies the means through which plunder is committed, that is, "through a <i>combination</i> or <i>series</i> of overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) of Republic Act No. 7080."<br><br>"Combination," as used in Section 2 of the Anti-Plunder Law, was explained in <i>Estrada vs. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to refer to "at least any two different predicate acts in any of said items" in Section 1(d).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> "Series" was explained as synonymous to "on several instances"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or a "repetition of the same predicate act in any of the items in Section 1(d) of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The "overt or criminal acts described in Section 1(d)" are the following:<br><ol type="a"><li>Misappropriating, converting, misusing, or malversing public funds; or <i>raiding on the public treasury</i>;<br><br></li><li>Receiving any commission or kickbacks from a government contract or project, or by reason of one's office or position;<br><br></li><li><i>Fraudulently disposing government assets</i>;<br><br></li><li>Obtaining any interest or participating in any business undertaking;<br><br></li><li>Establishing monopolies or implementing decrees that benefit particular persons or interests; and<br><br></li><li><i>Taking undue advantage of one's official position or influence to enrich oneself at the expense of the People and the Republic.</i><br></li></ol>Like Section 2, Section 1(d) does not speak of any "main plunderer" or any "personal benefit" obtained. In defining "ill-gotten wealth," it merely speaks of acquisitions made through a "combination or series" of any, some, or all of the six (6) identified schemes. Thus, for example, two (2) instances of raiding on the public treasury suffice to sustain a finding of plunder.<br><br>As I noted in my dissent to the majority's July 19, 2016 Decision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 2 does not require plunder to be centralized, whether in terms of its planning and execution, or in terms of its benefits.

It must be "in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00)[.]" The law speaks of an "aggregate amount." It also uses the term, "total value," to highlight how the amount must be counted in its whole and not severed into parts. How this Court has replaced the statutory requirement of "aggregate amount" or "total value" to mere "aliquot" shares<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> is bewildering.<br><br>It is not for this Court to repeal or modify statutes in the guise of merely construing them.

Sandiganbayan</i>, where the Court explained the nature of the conspiracy charge and the necessity for the main plunderer for whose benefit the amassment, accumulation and acquisition was made, thus:<br><blockquote>There is no denying the fact that the "plunder of an entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy" is made up of a complex and manifold network of crimes. In the crime of plunder, therefore, different parties may be united by a common purpose. In the case at bar, the different accused and their different criminal acts have a commonality - to help the former President amass, accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth. Sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) in the Amended Information alleged the different participation of each accused in the conspiracy. <b>The gravamen of the conspiracy charge, therefore,</b> is not that each accused agreed to receive protection money from illegal gambling, that each misappropriated a portion of the tobacco excise tax, that each accused ordered the GSIS and SSS to purchase shares of Belle Corporation and receive commissions from such sale, nor that each unjustly enriched himself from commissions, gifts and kickbacks; rather, it <b>is that each of them, by their individual acts, agreed to participate, directly or indirectly, in the amassing, accumulation and acquisition of ill-gotten wealth of and/or <u>for</u> former President Estrada</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The majority's sweeping reliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on the 2002 <i>Estrada</i> case is misplaced. It fails to account for nuances that engendered the pronouncements made in <i>Estrada</i>.<br><br>The 2002 <i>Estrada</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> case referred to one (1) of five (5) cases filed against former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, his family, and associates. It explicitly acknowledged that the five (5) criminal complaints were "an offshoot of the impeachment proceedings against [former President] Estrada."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>More specifically, the 2002 <i>Estrada</i> case involved a separate charge of plunder against President Estrada's son, Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada. Thus, it became necessary to state in the information that Jinggoy Estrada engaged in a conspiracy with his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> That case needed to specifically establish the conspiracy linkage between former President Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada:<br><blockquote>From a reading of the Amended Information, the case at bar appears similar to a "wheel" conspiracy. The hub is former President Estrada while the spokes are all the accused [Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada, et al.], and the rim that encloses the spokes is the common goal in the overall conspiracy, i.e., the amassing, accumulation and acquisition of ill-gotten wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Notwithstanding these nuances in the 2002 <i>Estrada</i> case, it remains that, in a conspiracy:<br><blockquote>[T]he act of one is the act of all the conspirators, and a conspirator may be held as a principal even if he did not participate in the actual commission of every act constituting the offense. In conspiracy, all those who in one way or another helped and cooperated in the consummation of the crime are considered co-principals since the degree or character of the individual participation of each conspirator in the commission of the crime becomes immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no need to identify a "main conspirator" and a "co­-conspirator." For the accused to be found liable as a co-principal, prosecution must only show:<br><blockquote>[A]n overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, either by actively participating in the actual commission of the crime, or by lending moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the scene of the crime, or by exerting moral ascendancy over the rest of the conspirators as to move them to executing the conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Unlike in the 2002 <i>Estrada</i> case, all of the accused here are charged in the same information; not in five (5) separate informations that were explicit "offshoots of the impeachment proceedings against former President Estrada."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The present case is more akin to that involved in the 2015 <i>Enrile</i> Decision. There, the accused public officer, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, along with his Chief of Staff, Jessica Lucila G. Reyes, as well as Janet Lim Napoles, Ronald John Lim, and John Raymund de Asis were charged in the same information with conspiring to commit plunder. <i>Enrile</i> never required the identification of a "main plunderer" or the showing of any "personal benefit" obtained. It is the more appropriate benchmark for this case.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>The July 19, 2016 Decision's requirement of a specification of a "main plunderer" and of "personal benefit," which was imposed only after the prosecution presented its case before the Sandiganbayan, makes it necessary for the prosecution to, at least, be given an opportunity to address this novel requirement. Otherwise, the prosecution shall have been deprived of due process to adequately ventilate its case. Thus, a favorable action on the prosecution's Motion for Reconsideration is not a violation of petitioners' right against double jeopardy.<br><br>Section 9 of Rule 117 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> identifies three (3) elements of double jeopardy: (1) a first jeopardy must have attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy must have been validly terminated; and, (3) a second jeopardy must be for the same offense as that in the first.<br><br>Legal jeopardy attaches only (a) upon a valid indictment, (b) before a competent court, (c) after arraignment, (d) when a valid plea has been entered, and (e) when the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><i>Gorion v.

Any such acquittal is "no acquittal at all, and thus can not constitute a proper basis for a claim of former jeopardy":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><blockquote>[The dismissal] unquestionably deprived the State of a fair opportunity to present and prove its case. Thus, its right to due process was violated.

This is the rule obtaining in this jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Due process requires that both parties have a real and fair opportunity to be heard.

The interests of society and the offended parties [including the State] which have been wronged must be equally considered. Verily, a verdict of conviction is not necessarily a denial of justice; and an acquittal is not necessarily a triumph of justice; for, to the society offended and the party wronged, it could also mean injustice. Justice then must be rendered even-handedly to both the accused, on one hand, and the State and offended party, on the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The state must be afforded the right to prosecute, present, and prove its case. Just as importantly, the prosecution must be able to fully rely on expressed legal provisions, as well as on settled and standing jurisprudential principles. It should not be caught in a bind by a sudden and retroactive imposition of additional requirements for successful prosecution.<br><br>In <i>Serino v. Zosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the judge announced that he would first hear the civil aspect of the case before he criminal aspect of the case. The public and private prosecutors then stepped out of the courtroom. After trial in the civil case was finished, the criminal case was called. By then, the prosecutors were unavailable. The judge dismissed the case for failure to prosecute. This Court held that double jeopardy did not attach as the order of dismissal was void for having been issued without due process.<br><br>In <i>People v.

However, there was no actual joint trial in these two (2) criminal cases and no hearing in the light threats case. This Court nullified the judgment of acquittal for light threats.<br><br>In <i>People v.

The assistant city prosecutor arrived for trial, but the special prosecutor did not, as he did not know of the hearing. The records, however, were with the special prosecutor. Not ready to appear, the assistant city prosecutor moved to postpone the hearing. The trial court denied the motion and proceeded to dismiss the case due to alleged delays. This Court overruled the dismissal for depriving the State of a fair opportunity to prosecute and convict.<br><br>In <i>People v. Pablo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the prosecution's last witness failed to arrive. The prosecution moved to postpone the hearing as that witness' testimony was indispensable. The judge denied the motion. The defense, in turn, filed a motion to consider the prosecution's case rested and to dismiss the case. The judge granted the motion and acquitted all the accused on the same day, "without giving the prosecution a chance to oppose the same, and without reviewing the evidence already presented for a proper assessment as to what crime has been committed by the accused of which they may properly be convicted thereunder[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This Court overturned the acquittal, declaring that courts must be fair to both parties:<br><blockquote>There are several actions which the respondent judge could and should have taken if he had wished to deal with the case considering the gravity of the crime charged, <i>with fairness to both parties</i>, as is demanded by his function of dispensing justice and equity. But he utterly failed to take such actions. Thus, <i>he should have first given warning</i> that there will definitely be no further postponement after that which he reasonably thought should be the last.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In these cases, the State was denied vital avenues for the adequate prosecution of offenses, and was not given a fair chance to fully present and prove its case. Thus:<br><blockquote>A purely capricious dismissal of an information, as herein involved, moreover, deprives the State of fair opportunity to prosecute and convict. It denies the prosecution its day in court. Accordingly, it is a dismissal without due process and, therefore, null and void. A dismissal invalid for lack of a fundamental prerequisite, such as due process, will not constitute a proper basis for the claim of double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>Here, the import of identifying the "main plunderer" and the "personal benefit" obtained was not emphasized upon the prosecution at the onset. At the minimum, this Court's July 19, 2016 Decision should be considered an admonition, and then applied only prospectively.<br><br>Such a consideration would be analogous to the course taken by this Court in <i>Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> There, this court abandoned the condonation doctrine, but expressly made its ruling applicable only to future cases, and not to the case at hand. Respecting the people's reliance on "good law,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we stated:<br><blockquote>Hence, while the future may ultimately uncover a doctrine's error, it should be, as a general rule, <i>recognized as "good law" prior to its abandonment</i>. Consequently, <i>the people's reliance thereupon should be respected</i>. The landmark case on this matter is <i>People v. Jabinal</i>, wherein it was ruled:<br><blockquote>[W]hen a doctrine of this Court is overruled and a different view is adopted, the new doctrine should be applied prospectively, and <i>should not apply to parties who had relied on the old doctrine and acted on the faith thereof</i>.<br></blockquote>Later, in <i>Spouses Benzonan v. CA</i>, it was further elaborated:<br><blockquote>[P]ursuant to Article 8 of the Civil Code "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines." But while our decisions form part of the law of the land, they are also subject to Article 4 of the Civil Code which provides that "laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided." This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim <i>lex prospicit, non respicit</i>, the law looks forward not backward. The rationale against retroactivity is easy to perceive. The retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested ... and hence, is unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>V</b><br></div><br>There is ample evidentiary basis for trial in the Sandiganbayan to proceed:<br><br>The prosecution underscores that funds were diverted to the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Citing the April 6, 2015<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Sandiganbayan Resolution, it also emphasizes that petitioner former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's approvals for the letter-requests of petitioner Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) General Manager Rosario C.

It implies both knowledge and assent that may either be active or passive.<br><br>Since the crime of plunder may be done in connivance or in conspiracy with other persons, and the Information filed clearly alleged that Enrile and Jessica Lucila Reyes <b>conspired</b> with one another and with Janet Lim Napoles, Ronald John Lim and John Raymund De Asis, then it is unnecessary to specify, as an essential element of the offense, whether the ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least P172,834,500.00 had been acquired by one, by two or by all of the accused. <b><i>In the crime of plunder, the amount of ill-gotten wealth acquired by each accused in a conspiracy is immaterial for as long as the total amount amassed, acquired or accumulated is at least P50 million.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 2 of the Anti-Plunder Law focuses on the "aggregate amount or total value" amassed, accumulated, or acquired, not its severed distributions among confederates.

As pointed out in the prosecution's Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> malversation under Article 220<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code does not require that the offender personally benefited from the crime. It only requires that he or she used the funds for a purpose different from that for which the law appropriated them.<br><br>This finds further support in the Congress' deletion of the phrase, "knowingly benefited," from the final text of Republic Act No. 7080.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>This Court can also apply by analogy the principles governing the crime of theft. Like in plunder, theft involves the unlawful taking of goods belonging to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> In theft, the mere act of taking-regardless of actual gain-already consummates the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Valenzuela v. People</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><blockquote>Unlawful taking, which is the deprivation of one's personal property, is the element which produces the felony in its consummated stage...<br><br>....<br><br>...The presumed inability of the offenders to freely dispose of [i.e. gain from] the stolen property does not negate the fact that the <i>owners have already been deprived of their right to possession</i> upon the completion of the taking.<br><br>[T]he taking has been completed, causing the unlawful deprivation of property, and ultimately the consummation of the theft.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br></blockquote>This standard for theft takes on greater significance in plunder. <i>Valenzuela</i> reminds us to not lose sight of the owners' deprivation of their property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Here, public funds were taken from the government. Theft involves larceny against individuals; plunder involves pillage of the State. Certainly, it is much more depraved and heinous than theft:<br><blockquote>Finally, any doubt as to whether the crime of plunder is a <i>malum in se</i> must be deemed to have been resolved in the affirmative by the decision of Congress in 1993 to include it <i>among the heinous crimes</i> punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote>Plunder is a betrayal of public trust. Thus, it cannot require an element that a much lesser crime of the same nature does not even require.

It was first used during the Great Depression, when the United States Congress sought to pass several' bills, such as an appropriation of $35 million to feed people and livestock,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> in an attempt to directly lift Americans from squalor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Then President Herbert Hoover did not see wisdom in government intervention.

In the context of the Anti-Plunder Law, this may be committed by a public officer through fraud, stealth, or secrecy, done over a period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> The Sandiganbayan's November 5, 2013 Resolution in this case is enlightening:<br><blockquote>[A] "raid on the public treasury" can be said to have been achieved thr[ough] the pillaging or looting of public coffers either through misuse, misappropriation or conversion, without need of establishing gain or profit to the raider.

In ruling on a demurrer to evidence, this Court only needs to ascertain whether there is "competent or sufficient evidence to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case to sustain the indictment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>The prosecution should have been given the chance to present this <i>prima facie</i> case against the accused. As I noted in my dissent to the majority's July 19, 2016 Decision:<br><blockquote>First, evidence was adduced to show that there was co-mingling of PCSO's Prize Fund, Charity Fund, and Operating Fund. In the A1mual Audit Report of PCSO for 2007, the Commission on Audit already found this practice of having a "combo account" questionable. The prosecution further alleged that this co-mingling was "to ensure that there is always a readily accessible fund from which to draw [Confidential and Intelligence Fund] money." <br><br>....<br><br>Second, the prosecution demonstrated through Former President Arroyo's handwritten notations that she personally approved PCSO General Manager Rosario C. Uriarte's (Uriarte) "requests for the allocation; release and use of additional [Confidential and Intelligence Fund.]" <b><i>The prosecution stressed that these approvals were given despite Uriarte's generic one-page requests, which ostensibly violated Letter of Instruction No. 1282's requirement that, for intelligence funds to be released, there must be a specification of: (1) specific purposes for which the funds shall be used; (2) circumstances that make the expense necessary; and (3) the disbursement's particular aims. The prosecution further emphasized that Former President Arroyo's personal approvals were necessary, as Commission on Audit Circular No. 92-385's stipulates that confidential and intelligence funds may only be released upon approval of the President of the Philippines.</i></b> Unrefuted, these approvals are indicative of Former President Arroyo's indispensability in the scheme to plunder.<br><br>....<br><br>Third, the prosecution demonstrated that Uriarte was enabled to withdraw from the CIF solely on the strength of Former President Arroyo's approval and despite not having been designated as a special disbursing officer, pursuant, to Commission on Audit Circulars 92-385 and 03-002.<br><br>....<br><br>Fourth, there were certifications on disbursement vouchers issued and submitted by Aguas, in his capacity as PCSO Budget and Accounts Manager, which stated that: there were adequate funds for the cash advances; that prior cash advances have been liquidated or accounted for; that the cash advances were accompanied by supporting documents; and that the expenses incurred through these were in order. As posited by the prosecution, these certifications facilitated the drawing of cash advances by PCSO General Manager Uriarte and Chairperson Sergio Valencia.<br><br>....<br><br>Fifth, officers from the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the National Bureau of Investigation gave testimonies to the effect that no intelligence activities were conducted by PCSO with their cooperation, contrary to Uriarte's claims. . . <i>The prosecution added that no contracts, receipts, correspondences, or any other documentary evidence exist to support expenses for PCSO's intelligence operations. These suggest that funds allocated for the CIF were not spent for their designated purposes, even as they appeared to have been released through cash advances.</i> This marks a critical juncture in the alleged scheme of the accused. The disbursed funds were no longer in the possession and control of PCSO and, hence, susceptible to misuse or malversation.<br><br>....<br><br>Sixth, another curious detail was noted by the prosecution: that Former President Arroyo directly dealt with PCSO despite her having issued her own executive orders, which put PCSO under the direct control and supervision of other agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The matters established by the prosecution belie any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan when it ruled that trial must proceed. This is especially considering that the Anti-Plunder Law does not even require proof of every single act alleged to have been committed by the accused. What it penalizes is the overarching scheme characterized by <i>a series, or combination of overt or criminal acts</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> In <i>Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada v.

The Anti­-Plunder Law was enacted in the aftermath of the <i>Marcos regime</i> where charges of ill-gotten wealth were filed against former President Marcos and his alleged cronies. <i>Government prosecutors found no appropriate law to deal with the multitude and magnitude of the acts allegedly committed by the former President to acquire illegal wealth.</i> They also found that under the then existing laws such as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Revised Penal Code and other special laws, the acts involved different transactions, different time and different personalities. <i>Every transaction constituted a separate crime and required a separate case and the over-all conspiracy had to be broken down into several criminal and graft charges.</i> The preparation of multiple Informations was a legal nightmare but eventually, thirty-nine (39) separate and independent cases were filed against practically the same accused before the Sandiganbayan.

Nevertheless, even through a prima facie review, the prosecution adduced evidence of a combination or series of events that appeared to be means in a coherent scheme to effect a design to amass, accumulate, or acquire ill-gotten wealth. Without meaning to make conclusions on the guilt of the accused, specifically of petitioners, these pieces of evidence beg, at the very least, to be addressed during trial. Thus, there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>IX</b><br></div><br>Even granting that the prosecution has failed to establish as case for plunder, trial must nevertheless proceed for malversation.<br><br>This Court has consistently held<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> that the lesser offense of malversation can be included in plunder when the amount amassed reaches at least P50,000,000.00. The predicate acts of bribery and malversation do not need to be charged under separate informations when a person has already been charged with plunder.<br><br>I reiterate the following from my dissent from the majority's July 19, 2016 Decision:<br><blockquote>This Court's statements in <i>Estrada v. Sandiganbayan</i> are an acknowledgement of how the predicate acts of bribery and malversation (if applicable) need not be charged under separate informations when one has already been charged with plunder:<br><blockquote>A study of the history of R.A. No. 7080 will show that the law was crafted to avoid the mischief and folly of filing multiple informations. The Anti-Plunder Law was enacted in the aftermath of the Marcos regime where charges of ill-gotten wealth were filed against former President Marcos and his alleged cronies. <i>Government prosecutors found no appropriate law to deal with the multitude and magnitude of the acts allegedly committed by the former President to acquire illegal wealth.</i> They also found that under the then existing laws such as the Anti­-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Revised Penal Code and other special laws, the acts involved different transactions, different time and different personalities. <i>Every transaction constituted a separate crime and required a separate case and the over-all conspiracy had to be broken down into several criminal and graft charges.</i> The preparation of multiple Informations was a legal nightmare but eventually thirty-nine (39) separate and independent cases were filed against practically the same accused before the Sandiganbayan. Republic Act No. 7080 or the Anti-Plunder Law was enacted precisely to address this procedural problem. (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Atty. Serapio v. Sandiganbayan</i>, the accused assailed the information for charging more than one offense: bribery, malversation of public funds or property, and violations of Sec. 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. 6713. This Court observed that "the acts alleged in the information are not separate or independent offenses, but are predicate acts of the crime of plunder." The Court, quoting the Sandiganbayan, clarified:<br><blockquote>It should be stressed that the Anti-Plunder law specifically Section 1(d) thereof does not make any express reference to any specific provision of laws, other than R.A. No. 7080, as amended, which coincidentally may penalize as a separate crime any of the overt or criminal acts enumerated therein. The said acts which form part of the combination or series of act are described in their generic sense. Thus, aside from 'malversation' of public funds, the law also uses the generic terms 'misappropriation,' 'conversion' or 'misuse' of said fund. The fact that the acts involved may likewise he penalized under other laws is incidental. The said acts are mentioned only as predicate acts of the crime of plunder and the allegations relative thereto are not to be taken or to be understood as allegations charging separate criminal offenses punished under the Revised Penal Code, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.<br></blockquote>The observation that the accused in these petitions may be made to answer for malversation was correctly pointed out by Justice Ponferrada of the Sandiganbayan in his separate concurring and dissenting opinion:<br><blockquote>There is evidence, however, that certain amounts were released to accused Rosario Uriarte and Sergio Valencia and these releases were made possible by certain participatory acts of accused Arroyo and Aguas, as discussed in the subject Resolution. Hence, there is a need for said accused to present evidence to exculpate them from liability which need will warrant the denial of their Demurrer to Evidence, as under the variance rule they maybe held liable for the lesser crimes which are necessarily included in the offense of plunder.<br></blockquote>Significantly, the Sandiganbayan's Resolution to the demurrers to evidence includes the finding that the PCSO Chairperson Valencia, should still be made to answer for malversation as included in the Information in these cases. Since the Information charges conspiracy, both petitioners in these consolidated cases still need to answer for those charges. Thus, the demurrer to evidence should also he properly denied. It would be premature to dismiss and acquit the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>X</b><br></div><br>The Anti-Plunder Law penalizes the most consummate larceny and economic treachery perpetrated by repositories of public trust. The majority's Decision—which effectively makes more stringent the threshold for conviction by implying elements not supported by statutory text—­cripples the State's capacity to exact accountability.

However, the accomplishment report submitted by Aguas shows that P137, 500,000 was spent on non-related PCSO activities, such as "bomb threat, kidnapping, terrorism and bilateral and security relations." All the cash advances made by Uriarte in 2010 were made in violation of LOI 1282, and COA Circulars 2003-002 and 92-385. These were thus improper use of the additional CIF funds amounting to raids on the PCSO coffers and were ill-gotten because Uriarte had encashed the checks and came into possession of the monies, which she had complete freedom to dispose of, but was not able to properly account for.
