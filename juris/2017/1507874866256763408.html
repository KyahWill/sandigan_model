				<BR><STRONG>DEL CASTILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative matter refers to the report on the preliminary results of the spot audit conducted by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 170, Malabon City.<br><br><b><i>The Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>On April 26, 2016, the OCA sent a team to conduct a spot audit of search warrant applications raffled to Branch 170, due to persistent reports pertaining to the alleged irregular issuance of search warrants by Presiding Judge Zaldy B. Docena (Judge Docena).<br><br><b><i>The Report on the Preliminary Results of the Spot Audit</i></b><br><br>On May 26, 2016, the OCA submitted to the Court its Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 23, 2016 on the preliminary results of the spot audit. In the Report, the OCA made the following observations:<br><br><i>First</i>, a total of 938 applications for search warrants were filed before the RTC of Malabon City from January 2015 up to April 13, 2016. These applications were distributed among the following judges: Judge Docena, Branch 170, with 761 applications; then Executive Judge Celso Raymundo L. Magsino, Jr. (Judge Magsino), Branch 74, with 175 applications; and Judge Jimmy Edmund G. Batara (Judge Batara), Branch 172, with two applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, the RTC of Malabon City exceeded the number of search warrants issued by the RTC of Manila (with 56 branches) and the RTC of Quezon City (with 48 branches), notwithstanding the fact that the latter courts are allowed to issue search warrants which are enforceable nationwide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The data provided by the Statistical Reports Division of the Court Management Office show the number of search warrants issued by selected RTCs in the National Capital Judicial Region from January 2015 up to March 2016:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0"

in violation of Section 2(a) of Rule 126 of the Rules of Court which provides that an application for a search warrant shall be filed with "[a]ny court within whose territorial jurisdiction a crime was committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, Judge Docena issued 418 search warrants which are also enforceable outside the territorial jurisdiction of the RTC of Malabon City, but this time the applicants specifically invoked Section 2(b) of Rule 126 which allows, for compelling reasons, the filing of the application with any court within the judicial region where the crime was committed or where the warrant shall be enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The OCA, however, pointed out that said search warrant applications merely cited the bare allegations of possible leakage of information and/or that the person subject of the application is influential in the area, or has friends working in the local government offices and the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><i>Fifth</i>, Branch 170 has admitted returns on search warrants where the seizing officer did not proceed with the operation because of new developments and/or information that the subject has already moved out, when the proper procedure is for the applicant to file a motion to set aside the search warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>There are also several cases where the returns have yet to be submitted to the court despite the lapse of the 10-day period within which to do so. The OCA considered this to be a failure on the part of Branch 170 "to ascertain if the return has been made, and if none, [to] summon the person to whom the warrant was issued and require him to explain why no return was made."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>And <i>sixth</i>, the OCA noted that Branch 170:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">xxx issues search warrants even [though] the application is not accompanied with pertinent papers to establish that the applicant [had] conducted a surveillance prior to the filing of said application xxx;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> xxx issues search wan-ants even when the authority of the head of the agency to file the application is a mere photocopy;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">[admits] mere photocopies of the inventory of the seized items and inventories that are not under oath; and,</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> xxx always grants custody of the seized items to the applicant and/or his agency for forensic examination or due to lack of space in the court premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Upon the OCA's recommendation, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated May 31, 2016 placing Judge Docena under immediate preventive suspension for a period of six months. Thus:<br><blockquote>xxx The Court resolved, upon the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), to:<br><br>(a) <b>PREVENTIVELY SUSPEND</b>, effective immediately, Judge Zaldy B.

This case is pursuant to the spot audit conducted by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) on the distribution and/or raffle of applications for and issuance of search warrants in the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 170, Malabon City.<br><br>The procedural and factual antecedents of the present case are as follows:<br><br>On April 26, 2016, the OCA sent a team to conduct a spot audit of search warrant applications raffled to Branch 170 of the Malabon RTC brought about by persistent reports on the alleged irregular issuance of search warrants by Presiding Judge Zaldy B. Docena. The team, likewise, examined the Office of the Clerk of Court (<i>OCC</i>) since a significant number of applications were being raffled to Branch 170 despite the existence of four (4) other branches at that time.<br><br>On May 26, 2016, the OCA submitted to the Court its initial Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 23, 2016 on the preliminary results of the spot audit. Upon the OCA's recommendation, the Court <i>En Banc</i> issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 31, 2016, thus:<br><blockquote>The Court Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), to<br><br>(a) <b>PREVENTIVELY SUSPEND</b>, effective immediately, Judge Zaldy B. Docena, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 170, Malabon City, for six (6) months pending the completion of a more comprehensive and detailed investigation on the issuance of search warrants;<br><br>(b) <b>RELIEVE</b> Judge Celso Raymundo L. Magsino, Jr., Branch 74, same court, from his duties as Executive Judge of RTC, Malabon City, and <b>INCLUDE</b> him <b>IN THE INVESTIGATION</b> in view of the apparent irregularity in the raffle of applications for search warrants;<br><br>(c) <b>DESIGNATE</b> Judge Jimmy Edmund G. Batara, Branch 72, same court, and Judge Emmanuel D. Laurea, Branch 169, same court, as Executive Judge and Vice-Executive Judge, respectively, of RTC, Malabon City; and<br><br>(d) <b>DIRECT</b> the OCA to <b>IMMEDIATELY SEAL/SECURE</b> all records/folders pertaining to applications for search warrant received by Judge Docena.<br><br>Let this resolution be personally and immediately served on the parties concerned.<br></blockquote>On August 4, 2016, the Audit Team rendered its final report. It found out that there was an unusual volume and inequitable distribution of the applications for search warrants in the Malabon RTC by the OCC and the Office of the Executive Judge. A total of 984 applications for search warrants were filed before the RTC of Malabon City from January 2015 up to May 10, 2016. These applications were distributed among the following judges: 795 for Judge Docena, Branch 170; 185 for Judge Celso Raymundo L. Magsino, Jr., Branch 74; and four (4) applications for Jimmy Edmund G. Batara, Branch 72.<br><br>According to Atty. Esmeralda G. Dizon, Clerk of Court VI, OCC, Malabon RTC, only two (2) out of the five (5) branches, specifically, Branches 74 (Special Commercial Court) and 170 (Environmental Court), took cognizance of search warrant applications, since Branches 72 (Drugs Court), 73 (Family Court), and 169 (Family Court and Agrarian Court) are excluded from the raffle of said applications because they exclusively handle drugs and family court cases.<br><br>After an exhaustive examination of the records of the OCC, Branch 74, and Branch 170, the Audit Team made the following findings:<br><br>1. There was non-observation of existing rules in the distribution of the applications involving ordinary criminal cases provided in Chapter V<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Guidelines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on the Selection and Designation of Executive Judges (<i>the Guidelines</i>).<br><br>In January 2016, Branch 170 received all the sixteen (16) search warrant applications filed in the Malabon RTC. In February 2016, forty-four (44) search warrant applications were assigned to Branch 170, while only five (5) ordinary criminal cases were given to Branch 74. And in March 2016, eighty-seven (87) applications went to Branch 170, while only three (3) were given to Branch 74.<br><br>2. An application involving violation of two (2) offenses (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act), which are both covered by Section 11, Chapter V of the Guidelines, was assigned to Branch 170.<br><br>3. A Notice of Special Raffle would be prepared even in cases covered by Section 11,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Chapter V of the Guidelines.<br><br>4. Lack of minutes of the special raffle for applications for search warrant to prove that a raffle was indeed conducted.<br><br>5. There were discrepancies between the date the application was received by the OCC, as reflected in its logbook, and the date stamped on the application, as received by Branch 170.<br><br>For instance, SW15-120-MN appears to have been received by the OCC on May 6, 2015 at 9:00 a.m. and, thereafter, raffled to Branch 170 on the same day, based on the date stamped on the face of the application. However, the case was registered as filed in the OCC's logbook only on May 7, 2015. The corresponding search warrant was also issued on May 7, 2015.<br><br>The same observation is true for the following applications: SW15-427 to SW15-432 - logged as filed with the OCC on September 9, 2015, but the applications were all stamped received on September 8, 2015 at 10:30 a.m., and SW15-592 to SW15-596 - logged as filed with the OCC on November 27, 2015, but the applications were stamped received on November 26, 2015, at 1:00 p.m.<br><br>6. One application even has no docket number, date of receipt by the OCC, date of raffle, and date received by the court branch to which it was raffled.<br><br>7. In some cases, the heading of the application would already indicate that it was being filed with Branch 170 and Judge Docena's name would already be typewritten at the bottom of said application, even before the actual raffle was made.<br><br>8. The search warrants issued by the Malabon RTC even exceeded the number of search warrants issued by the RTCs of Manila (with 56 branches) and of Quezon City (with 48 branches), notwithstanding the fact that the latter courts are allowed to issue search warrants which are enforceable nationwide.<br><br>The following data provided by the Statistical Reports Division of the Court Management Office would show the number of search warrants issued by selected RTCs in the National Capital Judicial Region from January 2015 up to March 2016:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="49%"><div align="center"><strong>ISSUING COURT</strong></div></td><td width="51%"><div align="center"><strong>NUMBER OF SEARCH WARRANTS ISSUED</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>Malabon City (5 branches)</td><td><div align="center">763</div></td></tr><tr><td>Manila (56 branches)</td><td><div align="center">675</div></td></tr><tr><td>Makati City (30 branches)</td><td><div align="center">75</div></td></tr><tr><td>Quezon City (48 branches)</td><td><div align="center">68</div></td></tr><tr><td>Pasig City (21 branches)</td><td><div align="center">9</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>9. Sudden decrease in the applications filed with the Malabon RTC during the dates when the OCA requested for statistical data on search warrants and the week, when it became clear that the object of the spot audit was to investigate on search warrant applications<br><br>After consolidating all the search warrant applications which Branches 170 and 74 acted upon, the Audit Team discovered that out of the 980 applications filed and acted upon by said branches from January 2015 to May 10, 2016, only 45 or 4.6% actually involves offenses committed within its territorial jurisdiction. The rest, or 95.4% of the applications, involves offenses committed outside Malabon.<br><br>The Audit Team noted that Branches 170 and 74 granted the following number of applications for search warrant despite the fact that the commission of the crimes was in a place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Malabon RTC:<br><ol type="a"><li>With no compelling reason in the application: Branch 170-130; Branch 74-33<br><br></li><li>With compelling reason/s: Branch 170- 628; Branch 74-106<br></li></ol>There was likewise a high incidence of negative results, unserved warrants, and no returns, translating to 56% (Branch 170) and 42% (Branch 74) of the issued search warrants enforceable outside Malabon, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote><table  =""

He clarified that he had no control over which search warrant applications will be filed in the RTC of Malabon City, much less those that will be raffled to Branch 170. Also, he or the court personnel under him did not have any hand in the implementation of the search warrants which he issued or in its outcome or results. He likewise contended that there was nothing irregular in his issuance of the 192 John/Jane Doe search warrants, considering that the crimes involved therein are mostly violations of the Cybercrime Prevention Act and the e-Commerce Act, where there is difficulty in obtaining the identities of the alleged perpetrators.<br><br>As for his issuance of search warrants involving crimes committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the RTC of Malabon City, Judge Docena denied having violated Section 2(a) of Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and Section 12, Chapter V of the Guidelines, given that the issuance of search warrants is inherent in all courts, and venue in search warrant applications is merely procedural and not jurisdictional. He further argued that he could not consider the issues of improper venue and the absence of compelling reasons in the search warrant applications as grounds to outrightly deny said applications, since these should have been duly raised by the respondent/accused in a motion to quash. In addition, Judge Docena maintained that he granted the search warrant applications in good faith, believing that the compelling reasons provided by the applicants were meritorious. He insisted that his determination should be respected unless it is shown that he was guilty of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction. The rule requiring judges to conduct a probing and exhaustive inquiry is applicable only to the determination of probable cause and not to the compelling reasons cited by an applicant in a search warrant application, as the existence of compelling reasons does not relate to the existence of probable cause which is the basis for the issuance of the search warrant.<br><br>As to the search warrants that appear to have been issued ahead of the date of filing of their respective applications, Judge Docena claimed that the incorrect dates on said warrants were mere typographical errors that are attributable to honest mistake and inadvertence.<br><br>After a careful review and evaluation of the case, the OCA, in a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated February 20, 2017, made the following recommendations:<br><blockquote><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, it is respectfully recommended for the consideration of the Honorable Court that:<br><br>1. <b>Hon.

Dizon, Clerk of Court, Malabon RTC, however, failed to observe the pertinent portion of Section 6, Chapter V of the Guidelines, which requires that the cases/search warrant applications assigned to a branch during the special raffle be deducted from the number of cases allotted to it on the next scheduled regular raffle. Instead, no off-setting was made. Worse, Atty. Dizon even claims that they simply adopted the policy of the previous Executive Judges of counting any number of applications as one (1), as long as these were filed by a single applicant.<br><br>Judge Magsino and Atty. Dizon also failed to observe the ratio for the raffling of cases prescribed under paragraph 1, Chapter V of Administrative Order No. 6.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> According to Judge Magsino, he rejected the suggestion to apply the 1:2 ratio since it would remove the unpredictability of the raffling process because applications would have to be assigned to a branch to equalize the number, and any such attempt to equalize would require human intervention, which, in turn, would be more prejudicial. But the Executive Judge has no discretion to deviate from the prescribed ratio for raffling without prior approval of the Court. On the other hand, Atty. Dizon maintains that they observed the prescribed 1:2 ratio, only that the counting is made per applicant, regardless of the number of search warrant applications applied for. The Court finds this improvised system simply unacceptable.<br><br>The OCA likewise pointed out the following observations further indicating a violation of the Guidelines:<br><ol><li>Lack of documentation of the special raffles for search warrant applications;<br><br></li><li>The heading of some applications would already indicate that it was being filed with Branch 170 and Judge Docena's name would already be typewritten at the bottom of the jurat, even before the actual raffle was made;<br><br></li><li>Discrepancies between the dates stamped on the face of some applications that were received by Branch 170 and those entered in the OCC logbook; and<br><br></li><li>The face of the application against one Xiao Long acted upon by Branch 170 did not bear any docket number, date of receipt by the OCC, date of raffle, and date received by Branch 170.<br></li></ol><b><i>Judge Docena</i></b><br><br>Section 2, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court provides for the proper venue where applications for search warrant should be filed:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Court where applications for search warrant shall be filed</i>. - An application for search warrant shall be filed with the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Any court within whose jurisdiction a crime was committed.<br><br>(b) <b>For compelling reasons stated in the application</b>, <i>any court within the judicial region</i> where the crime was committed if the place of commission of the crime is known, or nay court within the judicial region where the warrant shall be enforced.<br></blockquote>However, if the criminal action has already been filed, the application shall only be made in the court where the criminal action is pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Judge Docena and Judge Magsino maintain that they may take cognizance of applications for search warrants enforceable outside the territorial jurisdiction of their courts pursuant to the rulings in <i>Malaloan v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> where the Court ruled that a search warrant is a special criminal process, which is inherent in all court, and in <i>Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation v. Romars International Gases Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> where it was held that the rule that venue is jurisdictional does not apply to search warrant applications.<br><br>What both judges are missing, however, is the fact that in <i>Malaloan v. CA</i>, while the Court indeed ruled that a court may take cognizance of an application for search warrant in connection with an offense committed outside its territorial jurisdiction, it clearly stated that the executive judge (of the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the crime was committed), or the lawful substitute in the area, shall have primary jurisdiction. The rest of the courts may take cognizance of the same only when compelling reasons of urgency, subject, time, and place, are extant. Hence:<br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>It is, therefore, incorrect to say that only the <i>court</i> which has jurisdiction over the criminal case can issue the search warrant, as would be the consequence of petitioners' position that only the <i>branch</i> of the court with jurisdiction over the <i>place to be searched</i> can issue a warrant to search the same. It may be conceded, as a matter of policy, that where a criminal case is pending, the court wherein it was filed, or the assigned branch thereof, has <i>primary</i> jurisdiction to issue the search warrant; and <b>where no such criminal case has yet been filed, that the executive judges or their lawful substitutes in the areas and for the offenses contemplated in Circular No. 19 shall have <i>primary</i> jurisdiction</b>.<br><br>This should not, however, mean that a court whose territorial jurisdiction does not embrace the place to be searched cannot issue a search warrant therefor, where the obtention of that search warrant is <b>necessitated and justified by compelling considerations of urgency, subject, time and place</b>. Conversely, neither should a search warrant duly issued by a court which has jurisdiction over a pending criminal case, or one issued by an executive judge or his lawful substitute under the situations provided for by Circular No. 19, be denied enforcement or nullified just because it was implemented outside the court's territorial jurisdiction.<br><br>xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Also, <i>Malaloan</i> was promulgated in 1994, when the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure still governed. At that time, Section 2 of Rule 126 of the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure, specifically providing for the Courts where applications for search warrant shall be filed, was yet to be inserted in the Rules. Therefore, whatever was held in <i>Malaloan</i> has already been modified by the promulgation of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.<br><br>Further, when granting or denying a search warrant, <i>Pilipinas Shell</i> should be treated as an exception rather than the general rule. In that case, the Court merely resolved the issue of whether or not the court of origin was correct when it reconsidered its Order of denial of the Motion to Quash the search warrant on the ground that the application should have been filed with the RTC of Iriga City. Holding that the issue is not one involving jurisdiction, the Court ruled that the court of origin should not have taken cognizance of the same since the respondent raised the issue for the first time in his Motion for Reconsideration, violating the Omnibus Motion rule.<br><br>Note that, while the court in Pilipinas Shell upheld the validity of the questioned search warrants despite the lack of a statement of compelling reasons in the application since the objection pertaining thereto was never duly raised in a motion to quash, such remedy of filing a motion to quash cannot be availed of in this case because here, a criminal case was yet to be filed, or the search warrants yielded negative results, remained unserved or wrere never returned to the court.<br><br>It has been adequately shown that Judge Magsino and Judge Docena violated Section 2, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court when they took cognizance of applications for search warrant that involved offenses committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Malabon RTC, Judge Docena issued (1) 130 search warrants involving crimes committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Malabon RTC, without any compelling reason for him to take cognizance of the applications and (2) search warrants involving crimes committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Malabon RTC, with compelling reasons, but such that a reasonably prudent man would not right away accept without propounding further questions to dispel any doubt on their soundness or relevance.<br><br>An exhaustive and probing inquiry is necessary in order to enable the court to verify the genuine existence of a compelling reason, by examining the affiant, through searching questions. It is only through this process that the court can be assured that there is an actual reason to believe that the applicant's operations might be compromised if the application was filed with the court having primary jurisdiction over the same. This step will ultimately guide the court on whether or not it should take cognizance of said application.<br><br>Moreover, it is settled that the determination of compelling reasons is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. The general rule is that an application for a search warrant should be filed in the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the crime was committed. It is only when there is a good or compelling reason that said application can be filed in any court within the judicial region of the place where the crime was committed, if known, or before any court within the judicial region where the warrant shall be enforced. <b>Indeed, the issuance of a search warrant by a court outside the territorial jurisdiction where the crime was committed is the exception rather than the general rule. A judge, therefore, should exercise prudence and caution in granting applications for a search warrant and in ascertaining the actual presence of a good or compelling reason to warrant the application of the exception.</b> In the present case, however, the court did not even bother to exercise its sound judicial discretion as it would readily and regularly accept bare allegations of possible leakage of information as valid compelling reasons, notwithstanding that the respondents named in the applications are all John/Jane Does. The Court cannot simply sustain Judge Magsino's position that the court may rely on the unsubstantiated allegation that the respondents may have informants inside the court. Otherwise, this would render the requirements provided under the Rules futile. And besides, while said allegation of possible insiders may also be conveniently claimed with respect to any other court, interestingly, the applicants for search warrants would always seem to choose the Malabon RTC over the others. This, to the Court, is, in itself, highly dubious and gives an impression of irregularity.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that, unless the acts were committed with fraud, dishonesty, corruption, malice or ill-will, bad faith, or deliberate intent to do an injustice, the respondent judge may not be administratively liable for gross misconduct, ignorance of the law, or incompetence of official acts in the exercise of judicial functions and duties, particularly in the adjudication of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, however, the following attendant circumstances would reveal that Judge Docena's blatant violation of the Rules in the issuance of the subject search warrants clearly contradicts any claim of good faith:<br><br>1. The high incidence of operations that yielded negative results, unserved warrants, and those that were never returned to the court, which constituted around 55.95% or 442 out of the 790 search warrants that were issued.<br><br>Judge Docena argues that his branch, as the issuing court, has no participation in the implementation of the search warrants, thus, it has nothing to do with the high number of negative results and unserved warrants. Also, his failure to summon the applicants in the 155 search warrants and submit the respective returns should simply be considered as a failure to monitor the submission of returns in 39 warrants, since the orders he was supposed to issue would involve only 39 applicants for the 172 search warrants he issued. With regard to his failure to monitor the ten (10)-day period within which to submit the returns, the same was due to the extraordinarily high number of search warrant applications he received and the cases pending in his court. Also, he would always try to remind his staff to monitor the submission of the returns, but the latter would sometimes fail to do so due to the load of his court's search warrants and other regular matters that they would need to attend to.<br><br>True, the court has no participation in the implementation of search warrants. However, a reasonably prudent man would be alerted by the high rate of unsuccessful returns and failure to file returns before his court. This should have prompted Judge Docena to be stricter and more careful in the application of the rules on the issuance of search warrants, which primarily exist to protect the rights of the respondents in <i>ex parte</i> proceedings. Moreover, a judge's duty to summon the applicants to whom the warrants were issued and require them to explain why no return was made within the prescribed period is one of the most important safeguards against possible abuses in the implementation of warrants. His failure to comply with these requirements clearly violates Section 12(b),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and seriously casts doubt on his motive since several applicants had repeatedly secured warrants from his court without ever bothering to file a return.<br><br>Judge Docena's practice of issuing search warrants to the same applicant who would not file the required returns for previous warrants is highly suspicious. To illustrate, he issued the following: twenty-two (22) search warrants in three (3) successive appearances of an applicant at a four (4)-month interval; nineteen (19) search warrants in three (3) successive appearances of an applicant at a two (2)-to three (3)-month interval; thirteen (13) search warrants in three (3) successive appearances of an applicant at a one (1)-to three (3)-month interval; and seven (7) search warrants in two (2) successive appearances of an applicant.<br><br>Also, Judge Docena would allow the submission of inventory sheets without the required verification under oath despite the high rate of unsuccessful implementation of warrants, in utter violation of Section 12(a),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Rule 126. By doing this, the court allowed the submission of inventory sheets which could have possibly been tampered. Thus, Judge Docena rendered the devised safeguards ineffectual, to the prejudice of the citizens, whose rights might have been transgressed.<br><br>Surely, he cannot simply put the blame on his staff or on the court's workload. A judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or mismanagement of his very own court personnel. Certainly, a judge is responsible, not only for the dispensation of justice, but also for managing his court efficiently to ensure the prompt delivery of court services. In the discharge of the functions of his office, a judge must always strive to act in a manner that puts him and his conduct above reproach and beyond any dubiety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>More importantly, the number of search warrants, <i>i.e.</i>, 790, that he issued within the short span of January 2015 to May 10, 2016 is ridiculously excessive. On the average, assuming that during that period there were twenty (20) working days per month and there were no holidays, it would then mean that Judge Docena was issuing at least two (2) search warrants per day, further assuming that he was never absent even just for a single day.<br><br>2.

The issue on the validity of Judge Docena's issuance of search wan-ants that were enforceable outside his court's territorial jurisdiction had already been passed upon by the CA on May 29, 2015 in a decision which eventually became final and executory, to wit:<br><blockquote>In the same manner, the requirement of territorial jurisdiction in the issuance of search warrant can also be excused upon showing of "compelling reasons" as stated in paragraph (b) of Section 2, Rule 126 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. However, this circumstance is absent in the instant case. It bears stressing that the "compelling reasons" for filing an application for a search warrant outside the territorial jurisdiction, where the same is to be enforced, is determined based on factors of urgency, subject, time and place. <b>Here, there is no sufficient allegation of "compelling reasons" stated in respondents' application for search warrants which justify the procurement of the same outside the territorial jurisdiction of respondent judge, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, from the RTC of Malabon instead of RTC of Makati or Quezon City.</b><br><br>xxxx<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition for certiorari and prohibition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>, and Search Warrant No. 13-160-MN, Search Warrant No. MN-13-161-MN, Search Warrant No. MN-13-162, and Search Warrant No. MN-13-163 are declared <b>NULL</b> and <b>VOID</b>. Accordingly, any transaction canned out pursuant to, or in connection thereto are <b>SET ASIDE</b> and likewise declared <b>VOID</b> without any <b>FORCE</b> and <b>EFFECT</b>. The articles seized by virtue thereof are declared inadmissible in evidence and the same should be returned to petitioners. The Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued in this case is hereby <b>MADE PERMANENT</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, he could not feign ignorance of the rules and utilize his own interpretation of the same.<br><br>4. Several search warrants were issued ahead of the dates when the same were filed and some were released to the witness despite the fact that the search warrant was clearly addressed to a peace officer. Worse, there were search warrants issued on the date that the same were filed but the applicant had received copies of the same a day before the date of said warrants.<br><br>Judge Docena explains that his branch would document templates and that his staff would merely enter the new information. He avers that the typographical errors resulted from honest mistake and inadvertence on his part and that of his staff. His Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Jesus S. Hernandez, further explained that, in all probability, the encoder had used the search warrant documents in SW15-383 and SW15-384 issued on August 20, 2015, which likewise involved a violation of the Cybercrime Law, and the dates indicated in SWl5-388 to SWl5-389 had not been corrected to August 24, 2015, the date when its corresponding applications were filed. Atty. Hernandez, however, was not able to identify the supposed specific template that was used for SWl5-401 on September 1, 2015, with the filing made the day after or on September 2, 2015.<br><br>While Judge Docena claims that he has no personal knowledge of any witness being allowed to receive a copy of the warrant, Atty. Hernandez stated that when in the company of the applicant, a witness to the application should not be allowed to receive the search warrant for and in behalf of the team. As to the applicant's receipt of copies of the warrant a day before the date of its issuance, Judge Docena explains that the applicant actually received the copies on September 17, 2015; he merely wrote September 16, 2015 because he thought that it was still the 16<sup>th</sup>.<br><br>The Court might have accepted said lame excuses if it occurred only once and under ordinary circumstances. However, the fact is that the applicant in SW15-449 to SW15-453 was the same applicant who was given nineteen (19) search warrants in three (3) successive appearances at two (2)-to three (3)-month interval, without first submitting the returns for the previous warrants that had been issued in its favor.<br><br>Judge Docena likewise miserably failed to satisfactorily explain the following findings:<br><br>1. The case records had no minutes of the proceedings that should have reflected the attendance of the applicants and their witnesses. This serves as the primary proof that, a hearing was conducted and would dispel any suspicion that the application was not set for hearing or that the applicants did not present any witnesses;<br><br>2. The absence of stenographic notes and/or transcript of stenographic notes in fifty (50) search warrant applications;<br><br>3. There were two (2) sets of stenographic notes in some applications;<br><br>4. Despite page 3 of the application in SW15-588 was missing, Judge Docena still signed it, which he did on the page containing the sketch of the place to be searched;<br><br>5. There were some applications which were not under oath, but Judge Docena still signed the affidavits. He also signed the <i>jurat</i> of some of the witnesses' affidavits despite the absence of the affiants' signatures;<br><br>6. Some affidavits of various witnesses were repeatedly replicated by simply changing the dates and addresses for the conduct of the supposed surveillance. All contained the verbatim allegation that "the group always reminds me, from time to time, not to disclose to anyone about their operation in the Philippines, otherwise, something bad will happen to me. They also boast that they are well connected with authorities in the area."<br><br>7. In some cases, the required authority to file the search warrant application, which is issued by the respective heads of the agencies, were mere photocopies. The court's act of accepting mere photocopies could lead to unauthorized filing of applications;<br><br>8. In most applications, there were no searching questions and answers under oath and in writing, in violation of Section 5, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court. Instead, Judge Docena would sign the <i>jurat</i> at the bottom of the application and the affidavits of the witnesses. Some of said affidavits, however, were subscribed and sworn to before another officer authorized by law;<br><br>9. Most of the returns were filed beyond the ten (10)-day period;<br><br>10. There were returns which were belatedly acted upon. Most of these were presented to the audit team only upon demand. There were also several returns which are yet to be acted upon;<br><br>11. In some cases, the court honored mere photocopies of the inventory of the seized items, inventories that were not under oath, those with signatures of unidentified witnesses because no printed names were indicated, and/or inventories with only one (1) witness appearing in the inventory sheet;<br><br>12. The court accepts the justification presented for warrants which were not implemented even without the supporting documents. For instance, when a search warrant was not served simply upon information that the area had already been vacated;<br><br>13. Judge Docena does not also observe Section 12(a), Rule 126 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and Sections 15<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and 16,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Chapter IV of Republic Act 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act; and<br><br>14. There were some pending incidents which were already due for resolution, considering that the respective periods within which to submit the comment had already lapsed.<br><br>In most of the above-cited instances, Judge Docena would attribute the lapses to his alleged work overload. But the flimsiness in his excuse only shows how lackadaisically the search warrant proceedings are being done in his court, without regard to the essential right of every person against unreasonable searches and seizure.<br><br>Further, when SW15-615 and SW15-621 were ordered withdrawn without stating any reason for the same, Judge Docena argued that there was nothing irregular about it because it was issued in good faith for the prompt dispatch of the pending matter before the court. But it must be stressed that the withdrawn applications were duly stamped as received by the OCC. As such, even if the applications were not returned to the applicants, the receiving copies (duplicate copies) left with the applicants likewise bear the OCC stamp, and therefore, could possibly be used for extortion. Hence, there is a need to take particular attention to the reasons why the application is being withdrawn and to briefly discuss said reasons in the order.<br><br>There were also applications for search warrant filed before the OCC which were not under oath. It was only during the examination of the applicants and their witnesses that the defect was cured by Judge Docena himself by signing the <i>jurat</i>. Judge Docena maintains that he is authorized to administer oath under the law. The issue here, however, is not his authority to administer oaths, but the propriety of regularly accepting applications for search warrants which are not even sworn under oath, as required under the rules.<br><br>Corollarily, the Court finds Judge Docena guilty of gross ignorance of the law, gross neglect of duty, and gross misconduct.<br><br>Gross ignorance of the law is the disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence. A judge may also be administratively liable if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence. Though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law and that, if committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, the same applies only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment. Such, however, is not the case with Judge Docena. Where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it. or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. A judge is presumed to have acted with regularity and good faith in the performance of judicial functions. But a blatant disregard of the clear and unmistakable provisions of a statute, as well as Rules of Court enjoining their strict compliance, upends this presumption and subjects the magistrate to corresponding administrative sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, gross neglect of duty or gross negligence refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, in so far as other persons may be affected. In cases involving public officials, there is gross negligence when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is important to stress, however, that the term gross neglect of duty does not only include willful neglect or intentional wrongdoing. It can also arise from situations where such neglect which, from the gravity of the case or the frequency of instances, as in Judge Docena's case, becomes so serious in its character that it ends up endangering or threatening the public welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For liability to attach for ignorance of the law, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive. Judges are expected to exhibit more than just cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws. They must know the laws and apply them properly in all good faith. Judicial competence requires no less. Thus, unfamiliarity with the rules is a sign of incompetence. Basic rules must be at the palm of his hand. When a judge displays utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he betrays the confidence of the public in the courts. Ignorance of the law is the mainspring of injustice. Judges owe it to the public to be knowledgeable, hence, they are expected to have more than just a modicum of acquaintance with the statutes and procedural rules; they must know them by heart. When the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority. In both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Indubitably, Judge Docena, motivated by bad faith, issued search warrants outside of his court's territorial jurisdiction, in violation of Section 2, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court. He likewise violated the Code of Judicial Conduct ordering judges to ensure that his or her conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public, the legal profession and litigants in the impartiality of the judge and of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The blatant breach of duty in this case is all over the records. Judge Docena simply used as convenient excuses oversight, inadvertence, honest mistake, lack of sufficient time to scrutinize the inventory sheets, adoption of policies implemented by previous judges, heavy caseload, and that he would always remind his staff to comply with the rules. By constantly disregarding the rules on the issuance of search warrants, Judge Docena has rendered the court rules futile. He acted with conscious indifference to the possible undesirable consequences to the parties involved.<br><br>It has been said that of all the rights of a citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves the exemption of his private affairs, books and papers from inspection and scrutiny of others. While the power to search and seize is necessary to the public welfare, still it must be exercised and the law enforced without transgressing the constitutional rights of the citizens, for the enforcement of no statute is of sufficient importance to justify indifference to the basic principles of government. Thus, in issuing a search warrant, the judge must strictly comply with the requirements of the Constitution and the statutory provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Judge Docena also violated Section 7, Canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which provides that judges shall not engage in conduct incompatible with the diligent discharge of judicial duties.<br><br>Indeed, Judge Docena's acts likewise constituted gross misconduct. Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer. To warrant dismissal from service, the misconduct must be grave, serious, important, weighty, momentous, and not trifling. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment and must also have a direct relation to and be connected with the performance of the public officer's official duties amounting either to maladministration or willful, intentional neglect, or failure to discharge the duties of the office. In order to differentiate gross misconduct from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>To hold a judge administratively liable for gross misconduct, ignorance of the law or incompetence of official acts in the exercise of judicial functions and duties, it must be shown that his acts were committed with fraud, dishonesty, corruption, malice or ill-will, bad faith, or deliberate intent to do an injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court has repeatedly and consistently held that the judge must not only be impartial but must also appear to be impartial as an added assurance to the parties that his decision will be just. The litigants are entitled to no less than that. They should be sure that when their rights are violated they can go to a judge who shall give them justice. They must trust the judge, otherwise, they will not go to him at all. They must believe in his sense of fairness, otherwise, they will not seek his judgment. Without such confidence, there would be no point in invoking his action for the justice they expect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In this case, the OCA aptly found Judge Docena's issuance of the subject search warrants to have been motivated by bad faith, as evidenced by the aforediscussed circumstances.<br><br>Lastly, Judge Docena also failed to comply with his administrative responsibilities under Rules 3.08 and 3.09 or the Code of Judicial Conduct which provide:<br><blockquote>RULE 3.08 - A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in court management, and <b>facilitate the performance of the administrative functions of other judges and court personnel</b>.<br><br>RULE 3.09 - A judge should <b>organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business</b>, and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Court Personnel of Branch 170</i></b><br><br>As it appears that the concerned court personnel in Branch 170, namely Atty. Hernandez, the Branch Clerk of Court, Zenaida Z. Salonga, the Clerk-in-Charge, together with Olivia M. Labagnao, Rosario M. San Pedro, Debhem N. Fajardo, and Gigi M. Mendoza, all court stenographers, too, are all guilty of simple neglect of duty for failure to diligently perform their respective administrative duties.<br><br>Atty, Hernandez, as the administrative officer in Branch 170, fell short of the diligence and care required of him in the following instances:<br><br>a. Case records have no minutes of the proceedings.<br><br>b. Some search warrants are incorrectly dated, thus making it appear that they were issued ahead of the date of filing of their respective applications.<br><br>c. Some search warrants were handed over to the witnesses instead of the applicants.<br><br>d. There is no date and time of receipt of the case folder by Branch 170 on the face of the search warrant applications.<br><br>e. The search warrant case folders in Branch 170 are not paginated.<br><br>f. In several applications, some documents attached thereto are not original copies.<br><br>g. Case folders are not property stitched, and some folders have loose pages. Other folders, too, are merely attached using fasteners.<br><br>The court stenographers were likewise remiss in the performance of their duties under Section 17, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court, given that they failed to produce a total of 34 stenographic notes, or seven sets of consolidated notes, and to properly label their stenographic notes. It also appears that they only prepared transcripts of stenographic notes upon request of the applicants.<br><br>As for the Clerk-in-Charge, she clearly violated Section 12(c) of Rule 126, when she unjustifiably failed to maintain the required logbook for search warrant applications in Branch 170.<br><br>It is settled that a judge presiding over a branch of a court is, in legal contemplation, the head thereof having effective control and authority to discipline ail employees within the branch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Consequently, Judge Docena likewise shares accountability for the administrative lapses of his staff that contributed to the clearly disorganized and inefficient dispatch of business in Branch 170.<br><br>Finally, the Court holds Judge Magsino and Atty. Dizon administratively liable for simple misconduct, in their capacities as the Executive Judge and the Clerk of Court of the RTC of Malabon, respectively, for imposing their own internal policies and practices in lieu of the existing rules in the raffle of applications involving ordinary cases covered by Chapter V of the Guidelines.<br><br>To be specific, Judge Magsino and Atty. Dizon failed to observe the pertinent portion of Section 6 of the Guidelines which requires the search warrant applications assigned to a branch during the special raffle to be deducted from the number of cases allotted to on the next scheduled regular raffle. This, however, was not implemented in the RTC of Malabon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Judge Magsino and Atty.

Atty.

Gross neglect of duty and gross misconduct are grave offenses that merit the most severe penalty of dismissal from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Gross ignorance of the law, which is also classified as a serious charge, is punishable by a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00, and suspension from office for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months, without salary and other benefits, or dismissal from the service. Judge Docena's acts raised a serious question on his competence and integrity in the performance of his functions asia magistrate. Thus, the Court adopts the recommendation of the OCA that the supreme penalty of dismissal is the proper penalty to be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Lastly, the Court, in a number of administrative cases, had the occasion to rule that a judge may still be validly dismissed from service for gross ignorance of the law and brazen disregard of the rules even without the detestable allegation and proof of corruption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Judge Docena's thirty (30) years in government service, with eight (8) years as a Technical Assistant at the Supreme Court, and his stint as an RTC Judge since 2010 cannot even be reasonably appreciated as a mitigating factor for the Court to reduce the imposable penalty upon him. On the contrary, said length of service should be considered against him since the same should have enabled him to become more knowledgeable in the application of the Rules and more discerning in the execution of his duties as a magistrate. Instead, it appears that all those years have only rendered him to become completely ignorant of the existing Rules of Court, specifically on the issuance and implementation of search warrants, and allowed him to repeatedly abuse the trust reposed on him by taking advantage of his position. It is settled that length of service is an alternative circumstance. It is not a magic word that, once invoked, will automatically be considered as a mitigating circumstance in favor of the party invoking it.

In order to succeed in the Court's relentless crusade to purge the Judiciary of morally rotten members, officials, and personnel, a rigid set of rules of conduct must necessarily be imposed on judges.
