In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated December 18, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court Order dismissing petitioners' Complaint. The Court of Appeals found that the Complaint sought to enforce a legal right based on a contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, petitioners failed to prove the existence of a

project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, the Court of Appeals held:<br><blockquote>Having resolved that the Complaint failed to state a cause of action, we deem it unnecessary to

In this case, existence of a contract was shown by petitioners' submission of "Joyride" materials, and the various meetings and memoranda issued by respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> These official memoranda showed that the "Joyride" project was approved, adopted, and pushed by the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also insist that the Court of Appeals should have found respondents liable for damages under the principle of <i>quantum meruit.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Petitioners point out that this Court has directed the government to pay a project contractor despite the absence of public bidding, and, in case of failure to meet certain technicalities, on the basis of <i>quantum meruit.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Petitioners claim that the principle of <i>quantum meruit </i>does not only apply to tangible things<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and that there were countless intangible benefits reaped by the public from the "Joyride" project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It informed people about public concerns,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> gave them hope, and encouraged tourism and employment through information dissemination.<sup style="color: rgb(255,

0);">[67]</sup> The Complaint prayed for disbursement of public funds and was a suit against the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> However, the State was immune from suit, and thus, petitioners had no cause of action against respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Further, respondents noted that petitioners claimed "a separate contract between [them] and respondent Public (sic) Information Agency (PIA) is no longer necessary as they were instructed by respondent PIA to just send and direct the billings to them"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Consequently, there was no contract on which to base petitioners' cause of action, and the Complaint was properly dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Additionally, the absence of public bidding for the "Joyride" project renders it null and void <i>ab initio.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Sections 46, 47, and 48 of Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code requires appropriation before entering into a contract, as well as a certificate showing said appropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Contracts entered into without these requirements are void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Finally, the principle of <i>quantum meruit </i>is not applicable here because there is no showing that the public reaped benefits from petitioners' alleged media services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The primordial issue is whether the Complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.<br><br>In <i>Zuñiga-Santos v. Santos-Gran:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>A complaint states a cause of action if it sufficiently avers the existence of the three (3) essential elements of a cause of action, namely: <i>(a) </i>a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created; <i>(b) </i>an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; and <i>(c) </i>an act or omission on the part of the named defendant violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter may maintain an action for recovery of damages. If the allegations of the complaint do not state the concurrence of these elements, the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action.<br><br>It is well to point out that the plaintiff's cause of action should not merely be "stated" but, importantly, the statement thereof should be "sufficient." This is why the elementary test in a motion to dismiss on such ground is whether or not the complaint alleges facts which if true would justify the relief demanded. As a corollary, it has been held that only ultimate facts and not legal conclusions or evidentiary facts are considered for purposes of applying the test. This is consistent with Section 1, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court which states that the complaint need only allege the ultimate facts or the essential facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action. A fact is essential if they cannot be stricken out without leaving the statement of the cause of action inadequate. Since the inquiry is into the sufficiency, not the veracity, of the material allegations, it follows that the analysis should be confined to the four corners of the complaint, and no other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, to determine the sufficiency of a cause of action in a motion to dismiss, only the facts alleged in the complaint should be considered, in relation to whether its prayer may be granted. In <i>Heirs of Maramag v. Maramag:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><blockquote>When a motion to dismiss is premised on this ground, the ruling thereon should be based only on the facts alleged in the complaint. The court must resolve the issue on the strength of such allegations, assuming them to be true. The test of sufficiency of a cause of action rests on whether, hypothetically admitting the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, the court can render a valid judgment upon the same, in accordance with the prayer in the complaint. This is the general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote>To sufficiently state a cause of action, the Complaint should have alleged facts showing that the trial court could grant its prayer based on the strength of its factual allegations.<br><br>The Complaint in this case prayed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that, after proper proceedings, judgment be rendered ordering the defendants to jointly and severally:<br><br>1. Pay the plaintiffs the amount of PESOS: TWENTY-FIVE MILLION (Php25,000,000.00) to cover plaintiffs' services and the delivered items which were received and used by the defendants as above-mentioned;<br><br>2. Pay the plaintiff Guillermo an amount of not less than PESOS: ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) as and by way of moral damages;<br><br>3. Pay the plaintiffs an amount of not less than PESOS: ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) as and by way of exemplary or corrective damages;<br><br>4. Pay the plaintiffs an amount of not less than PESOS: ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) as and by way of attorney's fees and litigation expenses; and<br><br>5. Pay the cost of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>To support the foregoing prayer, the Complaint attempted to lay down the elements of a contract between the petitioners on one hand, and respondents on the other. Thus, it alleged a series of communications, meetings, and memoranda, all tending to show that petitioners agreed to complete and deliver the "Joyride" project, and that respondents agreed to pay P25,000,000.00 as consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Assuming that the Complaint's factual allegations are true, they are not sufficient to establish that the Regional Trial Court could grant its prayer.<br><br>The Complaint attempts to establish a contract that involves expenditure of public funds. As pointed out by respondents, contracts involving the expenditure of public funds have additional requisites to be valid. Sections 46, 47, and 48 of Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code provides for essential requisites for the validity of contracts:<br><blockquote>SECTION 46. <i>Appropriation Before Entering into Contract. </i>— (1) No contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor, the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure; and<br><br>(2) Notwithstanding this provision, contracts for the procurement of supplies and materials to be carried in stock may be entered into under regulations of the Commission provided that when issued, the supplies and materials shall be charged to the proper appropriations account.<br><br>SECTION 47. <i>Certificate Showing Appropriation to Meet Contract.&nbsp;</i>— Except in the case of a contract for personal service, for supplies for current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the estimated consumption for three (3) months, or banking transactions of government-owned or controlled banks, no contract involving the expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current calendar year is available for expenditure on account thereof, subject to verification by the auditor concerned. The certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it, shall be attached to and become an integral part of the proposed contract, and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of the government agency concerned under the contract is fully extinguished.<br><br>SECTION 48. <i>Void Contract and Liability of Officer.&nbsp;</i>— Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two (2) immediately preceding sections shall be void, and the officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties.<br></blockquote>In <i>Philippine National Railways v. Kanlaon Construction Enterprises Co., Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> this Court has held that contracts that do not comply with the foregoing requirements are void:<br><blockquote>Thus, the Administrative Code of 1987 expressly prohibits the entering into contracts involving the expenditure of public funds unless two prior requirements are satisfied. First, there must be an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure required in the contract. Second, there must be attached to the contract a certification by the proper accounting official and auditor that funds have been appropriated by law and such funds are available. Failure to comply with any of these two requirements renders the contract void.<br><br>In several cases, the Court had the occasion to apply these provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. In these cases, the Court clearly ruled that the two requirements—the existence of appropriation and the attachment of the certification—are "conditions <i>sine qua non </i>for the execution of government contracts."<br><br>In <i>COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla, </i>we stated:<br><blockquote>It is quite evident from the tenor of the language of the law that the existence of appropriations and the availability of funds are indispensable pre-requisites to or conditions <i>sine qua non </i>for the execution of government contracts. The obvious intent is to impose such conditions as a <i>priori </i>requisites to the validity of the proposed contract.<br></blockquote>The law expressly declares void a contract that fails to comply with the two requirements, namely, an appropriation law funding the contract and a certification of appropriation and fund availability. The clear purpose of these requirements is to insure that government contracts are never signed unless supported by the corresponding appropriation law and fund availability.<br><br>The three contracts between PNR and Kanlaon do not comply with the requirement of a certification of appropriation and fund availability. Even if a certification of appropriation is not applicable to PNR if the funds used are internally generated, still a certificate of fund availability is required. Thus, the three contracts between PNR and Kanlaon are void for violation of Sections 46, 47, and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, as well as Sections 85, 86, and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.<br><br>However, Kanlaon is not left without recourse. The law itself affords it the remedy. Section 48 of the Administrative Code of 1987 provides that "the officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties." Kanlaon could go after the officers who signed the contract and hold them personally liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The Complaint, however, completely ignored the foregoing requisites for the validity of contracts involving expenditure of public funds. Thus, the Regional Trial Court could not order the enforcement of the alleged contract on the basis of the Complaint, and the Complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.<br><br>Finally, petitioners' invocation of the principle of <i>quantum meruit </i>could not save the Complaint from dismissal. A careful reading reveals that the Complaint does not mention the principle of <i>quantum meruit, </i>or any facts showing that the public has derived any benefit from the "Joyride" project. Even assuming that basis exists to reimburse petitioners under the principle of <i>quantum meruit, </i>no factual basis for its application was laid down in the Complaint. Its belated invocation does not retroactively make the Complaint sufficient.<br><br>However, as in <i>Philippine National Railways, </i>petitioners are not without recourse.<br><br>Under the Administrative Code, officers who enter into contracts contrary to Sections 46 and 47 of Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code are liable to the government or to the other contracting party for damages:<br><blockquote>SECTION 48. <i>Void Contract and Liability of Officer.&nbsp;</i>— Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two (2) immediately preceding sections shall be void, and the officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties.<br></blockquote>Thus, assuming petitioners are able to prove a contract was entered into, they may go after the officers who entered into said contract and hold them personally liable.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is <b>DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Mendoza, Reyes,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> and <i>Martires, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated as additional member per Raffle dated February 15, 2017.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Heirs of Maramag v.
