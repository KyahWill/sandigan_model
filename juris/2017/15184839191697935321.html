As soon as PO1 Lim received the sachet, he gave the pre-arranged signal and the other team members, who were stationed more or less 15-20 meters from the target area, approached, causing Ching to run and hide in his room. The team followed Ching inside his house where he was eventually arrested for selling <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> A subsequent search of the premises produced the following: two (2) sachets in a chicken cage outside the house, two (2) sachets on the wooden frames nailed to a wall inside the house, and one (1) sachet found in a pail outside the house. Similarly, the following drug paraphernalia were recovered in an adjacent makeshift structure outside the house: twenty-three (23) pieces of aluminum foil, six (6) pieces of improvised tooters, one (1) piece of plastic tooter, seven (7) pieces of disposable lighters, one (1) pair of scissors, two (2) pieces of cutter blade, one (1) piece of alcohol lamp and one (1) piece of color blue plastic case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The sachets of <i>shabu</i> were sealed and labeled "MLC-1 to MLC-9" after which, they were brought to the Northern Samar Police Provincial Office, Camp Carlos Delgado,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where P/Supt.

He claimed that on said date, he was in his house with his nephews and was about to leave when policemen, including P/Supt. Tonog, together with some barangay officials, arrived and roamed around his residence. He later saw one of the men insert a plastic inside the chicken cage and thereafter, gathered some things and placed them on top of a table. Not long after, a <i>pedicab</i> arrived and he was brought to the police station and detained. Ching further claimed that he was veclose with P/Supt.

More importantly, it ruled that the apprehending officers duly complied with the chain of custody rule and the mandatory requirements under Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, as P/Supt. Tonog narrated in detail the conduct of the buy-bust operation and the due diligence he exercised to ensure that the very same confiscated sachets of <i>shabu</i> were the ones submitted to the PDEA for examination and eventually presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The CA did not give credence to Ching's defenses of denial and frame-up, absent any ill-motive on the part of the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Ching is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 11, 12, and 5, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Preliminarily, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records anew and revise the judgment appealed from, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In this case, Ching was charged with illegal possession of dangerous drugs, illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, and illegal sale of dangerous drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 11, 12, and 5, Article II of RA 9165. In order to secure the conviction of an accused charged with illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must prove: (<i>a</i>) that the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a dangerous drug; (<i>b</i>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<i>c</i>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Similarly, a violation of illegal possession of paraphernalia is deemed consummated the moment the accused is found in possession of said articles without the necessary license or prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Finally, the prosecution must establish the following elements to convict an accused charged with illegal sale of dangerous drugs: (<i>a</i>) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (<i>b</i>) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence states that in these cases, it is essential that the identity of the seized drug/paraphernalia be established with moral certainty. Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubts on such identity, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same. It must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug/paraphernalia from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Pertinently, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 provides the chain of custody rule, outlining the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the seized drugs/paraphernalia, in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Under the said section, the apprehending team shall, among others, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation conduct a <u>physical inventory and photograph</u> the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, and any elected public official</b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same, and <b>the seized items must be <u>turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours</u> from confiscation for examination</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of 9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 - which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> - provide, among others, that <b>non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 - <u>under justifiable grounds</u> - will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items <u>so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 and the IRR does not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<i>a</i>) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; <u><b>and</b></u> (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <u><b>the Court stressed that for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Also, in <i>People v. De Guzman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> it was emphasized that <b><u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, Ching prayed for his acquittal in view of the police officers' non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) in that: (<i>a</i>) the sachets of drugs seized from his house were not properly identified as to which among them were connected to his particular offense; (<i>b</i>) no photographs were taken of the items taken from his house; (<i>c</i>) no sealing of the seized drugs took place; and, (<i>d</i>) it was not established who was entrusted with the safekeeping of the specimens before their presentation in court and what precautions were taken to ensure their integrity and value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing, the Court finds substantial gaps in the chain of custody of the seized dangerous drugs/paraphernalia which were left unjustified, thereby casting reasonable doubt on their integrity, as will be explained hereunder.<br><br><u><b><i>First</i></b></u>, after Ching's arrest, P/Supt. Tonog marked the seized <i>shabu</i>. His testimony on this matter is as follows:<br><blockquote>Q: Before going to Tacloban City purposely to submit the shabu that were confiscated during the buy-bust operation at the place or residence of accused Manuel Lim Ching, did you exercise due diligence to see to it that the same specimen or shabu confiscated from Manuel Lim Ching were the same specimen that were submitted to the PDEA?<br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: In what way did you exercise due diligence and effort to see to it that the very same shabu that were submitted to the PDEA?<br><br>A: The sachet of shabu was placed in a plastic and it was sealed, then it was placed also in another brown envelope and together with the request and it was sealed and after that in the evening, we rode early for Tacloban and submitted it to the PDEA.<br><br>Q: Did you make any specific markings to see to it that the same shabu that you were able to confiscate from Manuel Lim Ching were the same shabu to be submitted at the PDEA?<br><br>A: Yes, sir because before we submitted it to the PDEA, we wrote a letter on the shabu, the name of the suspect for example, Manuel Lim Ching, we put it MLC 1 up to how many numbers of shabu confiscated, if for example MLC 1 MLC 2 up to MLC 9.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>While the fact of marking of the seized items was clear from such testimony and the inventory evidenced by the attached Receipt for Property Seized, the same was glaringly silent as to the taking of photographs and the conduct of an inventory in the presence of a representative from the media and the DOJ. In the case of <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court stresses that "<u><b>[w]ithout the insulating presence of the representative from the media [and] the Department of Justice, or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' or contamination of the evidence</b></u> that had tainted the buy-bust conducted under the regime of [RA] 6425 (<i>Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972</i>) again reared their ugly heads as to <u><b>negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugs] that were evidence herein of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused</b></u>. Indeed, the insulating presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Second</i></b></u>, it is well to note that the delivery of the seized items to the PNP Crime Laboratory was made way beyond the prescribed twenty four (24)-hour period from seizure. To reiterate, the drugs/paraphernalia were seized during the buy-bust operation on June 29, 2003, but were delivered to the PDEA and the PNP crime laboratory only ten (10) days later, or on <u><b>July 9, 2003</b></u>. In <i>People v. Gamboa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court explained that "[w]hen police officers do not turn over dangerous drugs to the laboratory within twenty­-four (24) hours from seizure, they must identify its custodian, and the latter must be called to testify. The custodian must state the security measures in place to ensure that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items were preserved,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> which did not take place in this case.<br><br>All told, the breaches of the procedure contained in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 committed by the police officers, left unacknowledged and unexplained by the State, militate against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against the accused as the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> had been compromised. Case law states that the procedure enshrined in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects. For indeed, however, noble the purpose or necessary the exigencies of our campaign against illegal drugs may be, it is still a governmental action that must always be executed within the boundaries of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
