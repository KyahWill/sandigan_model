Nevertheless, it justified the noncompliance by applying the exception in the same provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On April 2, 2013, the Court of Appeals convicted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> accused-appellant. The dispositive portion of the Decision read:<br><blockquote>After due consideration, We resolve that accused-appellant has not overcome the evidence presented by the prosecution against him. This Court finds accused-appellant <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II, Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The RTC's judgment dated August 21, 2008 is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>For resolution of this Court is the sole issue of whether or not accused-appellant Abundio Mamolo Saragena is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165. Subsumed in this issue is the matter of whether or not the law enforcement officers substantially complied with the chain of custody rule.<br><br>This Court rules in favor of accused-appellant.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Absent proof beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant is presumed innocent of the crime charged.<br><br>Section 14(2) of Article III of the Constitution provides that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved[.]" To overcome this constitutional presumption, prosecution must establish accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not require absolute certainty; it only requires moral certainty or the "degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>Reasonable doubt is that doubt engendered by an investigation of the whole proof and an inability after such investigation to let the mind rest ea[sy] upon the certainty of guilt. Absolute certainty of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict a criminal charge, but moral certainty is required as to every proposition of proof requisite to constitute the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>The legal presumption of innocence prevails if the judge's mind cannot rest easy on the certainty that the accused committed the crime. In <i>People v. Santos</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote>The prosecution has the burden to overcome such presumption of innocence by presenting the quantum of evidence required. Corollarily, the prosecution must rest on its own merits and must not rely on the weakness of the defense. If the prosecution fails to meet the required quantum of evidence [of proof beyond reasonable doubt], the defense may logically not even present evidence on its own behalf. In which case, the presumption of innocence shall prevail and hence, the accused shall be acquitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>This rule is borne by the need to evenly balance the State's encompassing powers to prosecute and the defense's arduous struggle for liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It addresses the inherent inequality in resources, command, capacity, and authority between the State and an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In <i>People v. Berroya</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><blockquote>[P]roof beyond reasonable doubt lies in the fact that "(i)n a criminal prosecution, the State is arrayed against the subject; it enters the contest with a prior inculpatory finding in its hands; with <i>unlimited means of command</i>; with counsel usually of authority and capacity, who are regarded as public officers, and therefore as speaking semi-judicially, and with an attitude of tranquil majesty often in striking contrast to that of defendant engaged in a perturbed and distracting struggle for liberty[,] if not for life. These inequalities of position, the law strives to meet by the rule that there is to be no conviction when there is a reasonable doubt of guilt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>There is great possibility of abuse in drug cases, especially those involving miniscule amounts. This Court has recognized that buy-bust operations could be initiated based on dubious claims of shady persons, or that small amounts of illicit drugs could be planted as evidence on innocent individuals, in view of the secrecy surrounding drug deals in general. Thus:<br><blockquote>"[B]y the very nature of anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be planted in pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility of abuse is great." Thus, <i>the courts have been exhorted to be extra vigilant in trying drug cases lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses</i>[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Therefore, courts must subject "the prosecution evidence through the crucible of a <i>severe testing</i> . . . [T]he presumption of innocence requires them to take a more than casual consideration of every circumstance or doubt favoring the innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In deliberating the accused's guilt, courts must exercise "utmost diligence and prudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> More importantly, they must be on their guard in trying drug cases; otherwise, they risk meting severe penalties to innocent persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Here, there is reasonable doubt that the sale of shabu took place.<br><br>Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 penalizes any person who sells a dangerous drug, regardless of quantity. To successfully convict an accused under this provision, the prosecution must establish the identities of the buyer and the seller, the item sold, and the consideration given for it. There must be an actual sale, consummated through delivery and payment. Finally, the <i>corpus delicti</i> must be presented in court as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>According to accused-appellant, SPO3 Magdadaro's allegation of having "clearly" seen the exchange of money and the pack of shabu between accused-appellant and PO1 Misa is "quite disturbing."<br><br>It is unclear how SPO1 Paller and SPO3 Magdadaro allegedly witnessed the purported sale. The alleged illegal drug was of very small quantity, It weighed only 0.03 grams,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> approximately as light as a grain of rice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> or an ant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The alleged transaction between PO1 Misa and accused-appellant happened five (5) to eight (8) meters away from SPO3 Magdadaro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> While PO1 Misa was allegedly buying shabu from accused-appellant, SPO1 Paller and SPO3 Magdadaro were hiding at the side of the stage. Accused-appellant's house was at the back of this stage where they hid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Likewise, it was already 7:00 p.m. and the night time would have impaired their vision.<br><br>PO1 Misa, the only person who could attest to the commission of the crime, was not presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The poseur-buyer "had personal knowledge of the transaction since he conducted the actual transaction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> His testimony is crucial in establishing the alleged facts and circumstances surrounding the purported sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The failure to present the poseur-buyer casts doubt on the charge that an illegal sale of drugs took place. SPO1 Paller and SPO3 Magdadaro's location, the nightfall, and the miniseule amount of the alleged illegal drug further call into question prosecution's claim that SPO1 Paller and SPO3 Magdadaro witnessed the scene.<br><br>Even if there was a sale, the <i>corpus delicti</i> was not proven as the chain of custody was defective.<br><br>The <i>corpus delicti</i> is the body of the crime that would establish that a crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In cases involving the sale of drugs, the <i>corpus delicti</i> is the confiscated illicit drug itself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the integrity of which must be preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant argues that the conduct of the post-seizure custody of the shabu allegedly recovered from him violated the chain of custody rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> His contention is meritorious. The police officers' lapses are numerous and unjustified that there are serious grounds to doubt the preservation of the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<br><br>To begin with, no evidence was adduced to show <i>specifically</i> how the police officers handled, stored, and safeguarded the seized shabu pending its offer as evidence. The records merely state:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>PO1 Misa, as the poseur-buyer, transacted with accused-appellant with the buy-bust money. Upon receipt of the buy-bust money, accused-appellant gave PO1 Misa a plastic pack of white crystalline substance.<br></li><li>PO1 Misa turned over the specimen drug to SPO3 Magdadaro at the police station.<br></li><li>SPO3 Magdadaro marked the plastic pack of white crystalline substance as "AS."<br></li><li>SPO3 Magdadaro then drafted a letter-request for laboratory examination of the specimen drug signed by Chief Police Superintendent Armando Macolbacol Radoc.<br></li><li>PO1 Misa then delivered the letter-request for laboratory examination of the specimen drug, and the actual specimen drug marked as "AS" to the crime laboratory.<br></li><li>SPO2 Roma received the letter-request and the specimen drug.<br></li><li>SPO2 Roma immediately delivered the letter-request and the specimen drug to [PS]Insp.

Acog was presented before the court <i>a quo</i> for identification of the subject specimen marked as "AS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>There was no showing that accused-appellant signed a receipt of the inventory of the pack of shabu, that it was marked in his presence, that photographs were taken, or that he was made to sign a confiscation receipt relating to the seized pack of shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>This Court emphasizes that "ostensibly approximate compliance" does not suffice; rather, there must be actual compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Not doing so is tantamount to a failure to establish the <i>corpus delicti</i>, a crucial element of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>This case arose from a buy-bust operation. While a buy-bust operation can indeed enable authorities to uncover illicit transactions otherwise kept under wraps, this Court has recognized that such an operation poses a significant drawback—that is, "[i]t is susceptible to police abuse, the most notorious of which is its use as a tool for extortion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>To avert such possibility, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the dangerous drug offered during trial was the same that was bought during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The chain of custody rule under Republic Act No. 9165 fulfills this rigorous requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Section 1(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 01-02, which implements Republic Act No. 9165, explains chain of custody rule as follows:<br><blockquote>"Chain of Custody" means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.<br></blockquote>This Court agrees with the Court of Appeals that the prosecution failed to follow the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>Paragraph 1 of Section 21 of the original Republic Act No. 9165 (2002) provides the requirements for ensuring the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs <em>shall</em>, immediately after seizure and confiscation, <em>physically inventory</em> and <em>photograph</em> the same in the presence of [a] the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, [b] a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and [c] any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>This is reiterated in paragraph 1 of Section 21 of the amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Republic Act No. 9165 (2013):<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment <i>shall</i>, immediately after seizure and confiscation, <i>conduct a physical inventory</i> of the seized items and <i>photograph</i> the same in the presence of [a] the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, [b] with an elected public official and [c] a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media[,] who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <i>Provided</i>, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The chain of custody rule is further clarified by Section 1(A) of the Guidelines on the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended (Chain of Custody Implementing Rules and Regulations).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The Chain of Custody Implementing Rules and Regulations require the apprehending team to mark, inventory, and photograph the evidence in the following manner:<br><br>First, the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer must place his or her initials and signature on the seized item.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Here, PO1 Misa did not place his initials "RM" on the confiscated pack; rather, it was SPO3 Magdadaro who wrote "AS" on it,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> presumably standing for accused-appellant's initials for Abundio Saragena, instead of the police officer's initials. It was also not shown whether PO1 Misa or SPO3 Magdadaro signed the plastic pack.<br><br>Second, in a warrantless search as in this case, the marking of the drug must be done in the presence of the accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and at the earliest possible opportunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The earliest possible opportunity to mark the evidence is immediately at the place where it was seized, if practicable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> to avoid the risk that the seized item might be altered while in transit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> In <i>People v. Sabdula</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><blockquote>[C]rucial in proving chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items <i>immediately after they are seized</i> from the accused. "Marking" means the <i>placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the items seized</i>. Long before Congress passed R.A. No. 9165, this Court has consistently held that failure of the authorities to immediately mark the seized drugs casts reasonable doubt on the authenticity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<br><br>Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link; hence, it is vital that <i>the seized contraband be immediately marked</i> because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus preventing switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, the records do not show why the officers had to wait to arrive at the police station<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> before marking the seized plastic pack. The earliest available opportunity to mark it was in accused-appellant's house. Likewise, there is no showing that the seized item was marked in the presence of accused-appellant. All that the prosecution established was that, while at the police station, PO1 Misa turned over the plastic pack to SPO3 Magdadaro, who marked it with the letters "AS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Other details are left out for this Court to guess.<br><br>As in <i>People v.

Thus:<br><blockquote>A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that[,] at any of the links in the chain of custody over the [narcotic substances,] there could have been tampering, alteration, or substitution of substances from other cases — by accident or otherwise — in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, a <i>standard more stringent</i> than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a <i>more exacting standard</i> that entails a chain of custody of the item with <i>sufficient completeness</i> if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><i>People v.

While they are certainly a bane to our society, small retailers are but low-lying fruits in an exceedingly vast network of drug cartels. Both law enforcers and prosecutors should realize that the more effective and efficient strategy is to focus resources more' on the source and true leadership of these nefarious organizations. Otherwise, all these executive and judicial resources expended to attempt to convict an accused for 0.05 gram of shabu under doubtful custodial arrangements will hardly make a dent in the overall picture. It might in fact be distracting our law enforcers from their more challenging task: to uproot the causes of this drug menace.
