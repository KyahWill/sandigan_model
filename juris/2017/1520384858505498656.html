The LA pointed out that since petitioner had a history of prostatitis in 2011 and did not take regular medication for it, he merely suffered from a recurrence of a pre-existing illness. The LA added that there was no clear and convincing indication that petitioner's work as Chief Cook has aggravated his condition given that it was his duty and responsibility to prepare safe and quality meals to the crew and that he was charged with the planning and requisition of food and catering supplies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Moreover, petitioner's non-disclosure of a previous illness during his last PEME legally barred him from availing of the disability benefits pursuant to Section 20 (E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Nevertheless, the LA ordered Elburg to pay petitioner his sickness allowance which was computed at US$2,840.00, as well as 10% attorney's fees since the latter was clearly compelled to litigate to protect his rights and interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> Aggrieved, petitioner filed an appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> to the NLRC. </p><p align="center"><b>The NLRC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> dated June 30, 2015, the NLRC partly ruled in favor of petitioner, directing Crewtech, Rizzo, and Ancheta, in<i> solidum</i>, to pay him his total and permanent disability benefits in the amount of US$60,000.00, and further sustained the award of sickness allowance and 10% attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Contrary to the findings of the LA, the NLRC ruled that there was no fraudulent concealment on the part of petitioner given that Crewtech was well aware of his past medical history as reflected in the Medical Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated May 2, 2014 and thus, cannot feign ignorance of his true condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The NLRC likewise ruled that petitioner's illness was work-related, holding that as Chief Cook, the latter cannot just excuse himself to obey the call of nature more so when preparing and cooking food of the officers and crew of the vessel, and that the limited water provisions for the entire voyage and their diet may have increased the development, if not aggravation of his illness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As petitioner's illness rendered him incapable of resuming work, he was entitled to total and permanent disability or Grade 1 impediment pursuant to the 2010 POEA-SEC and not the FIT/CISL-SIRIUS SHIP management SRL - Genoa 2012-2014 IBF Model CBA that covered only those disabilities arising from an accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Finally, the NLRC ruled that since the complaint was not amended to implead Elburg, no jurisdiction was acquired over said corporation and as such, Crewtech, Rizzo, and Ancheta, were ordered, <i>in solidum</i>, to pay petitioner his disability benefits subject to reimbursement by Elburg on account of the assumption of responsibility agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The latter's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> dated August 27, 2015. </p><p> Dissatisfied, Elburg elevated the matter to the CA via a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> docketed as CA-G.R.

The material statutory provisions are Articles 197 to 199<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (formerly Articles 191 to 193)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the Labor Code in relation to Section 2 (a), Rule X<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation (AREC),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> while the relevant contracts are the POEA-SEC, the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if any, and the employment agreement between the seafarer and the employer. In this case, petitioner executed his employment contract with respondents during the effectivity of the 2010 POEA-SEC; hence, its provisions are applicable and should govern their relations.</p><p> Pursuant to the 2010 POEA-SEC, the employer is liable for disability benefits when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract. In this regard, Section 20 (E) thereof, mandates the seafarer to disclose all his pre-existing illnesses in his PEME, failing which, shall disqualify him from receiving the same, to wit: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">E.</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">A seafarer who knowingly conceals a pre-existing illness or condition in the Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) shall be liable for misrepresentation and shall be disqualified from any compensation and benefits. This is likewise a just cause for termination of employment and imposition of appropriate administrative sanctions. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Here, contrary to the findings of the C A, there was no concealment on the part of petitioner when he failed to disclose in his 2013 PEME that he was previously treated for prostatitis in 2011. As culled from the records, respondents were well aware of petitioner's past medical history given that the company-designated physician was able to provide a detailed medical history of the latter in the Medical Report dated May 2, 2014 which showed all of his past illnesses, the year he was treated and where he obtained his treatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Moreover, since petitioner's prostatitis was shown to have been treated in 2011 with no indication that he was required to undergo further medical attention or maintenance medication for the same, he cannot be faulted into believing that he was completely cured and no longer suffering from said illness. This is further bolstered by the fact that he was rehired by respondents the following year in 2012 and no longer found to be suffering from prostatitis during his PEME. Evidently, petitioner's non-disclosure of the same in his PEME in 2013 did not amount to willful concealment of vital information and he was in fact, truthful in answering "no" to the query on whether or not he was "suffering" from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by sea service or render him unfit for such service on board the vessel. </p> <p> Be that as it may, the CA is nevertheless correct in holding that petitioner's illnesses, Cystitis with Cystolithiases and BPH, were not work-related, hence, not compensable. </p><p> Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC is explicit that the employer is liable for disability benefits only when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract. Thus, work-relation must be established. As a general rule, the principle of work-relation requires that the disease in question must be one of those listed as an occupational disease under Section 32-A thereof. Nevertheless, should it not be classified as occupational in nature, Section 20 (A) paragraph 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> thereof provides that such diseases are <b>disputably presumed</b> as work-related. However, the presumption does not necessarily result in an automatic grant of disability compensation. The claimant still has the burden to present substantial evidence that his work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the illness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p> In this case, records reveal that petitioner was repatriated after having been diagnosed with prostatitis. Prostatitis is the swelling and inflammation of the prostate gland<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and among its risk factors are: (<em>a</em>) a catheter or other instrument recently placed in the urethra, (<em>b</em>) an abnormality found in the urinary tract, or (<em>c</em>) a recent bladder infection. Upon further examination, the company-designated physician found petitioner to have cystitis, or inflammation of the bladder, which is commonly caused by a bacterial infection known as urinary tract infection (UTI),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and BPH, an enlargement of the prostate gland that is common among aging men<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> which can block the flow of urine out of the bladder and cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Although the foregoing illnesses became manifest only while petitioner was on board the vessel, such circumstance alone is not sufficient to entitle him to disability benefits. It bears stressing that for a disability to be compensable, the seafarer must show a reasonable link between his work and his illness in order for a rational mind to determine that such work contributed to, or at least aggravated, his illness. It is not enough that the seafarer's injury or illness rendered him disabled; rather, he should be able to establish a causal connection between his injury or illness, and the work for which he is engaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p><p> Here, petitioner's general averments that he was exposed to stressful demands of his duties and responsibilities and subjected to hazardous condition of his station are mere allegations couched in conjectures. There was no evidence presented to establish how and why petitioner's working conditions increased the risk of contracting his illness. In the absence of substantial evidence, the Court cannot just presume that petitioner's job caused his illness or aggravated any pre-existing condition he might have had. Mere possibility will not suffice and a claim will still fail if there is only a possibility that the employment caused the disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Probability of work-connection must at least be anchored on credible information and bare allegations do not suffice to discharge the required quantum of proof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> as in this case.</p><p> Moreover, the Court notes that even petitioner's physician of choice, Dr. Tan, failed to refute the company-designated physician's pronouncement that his illness was not work-related. In the Medical Certificate dated October 20, 2014, Dr. Tan merely reiterated petitioner's medical history of his illness and declared him permanently disabled on the justification that he would not be able to perform his job effectively, in view of the presence of the catheter that caused frequent episodes of urinary tract infection. It is significant to point out at this stage that in determining the work-causation of a seafarer's illness, the diagnosis of the company-designated physician bears vital significance given that the latter is mandated by the 2010 POEA-SEC to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability. And while the seafarer is not irrevocably bound by the findings of the company-designated physician as he is allowed to seek a second opinion and consult a doctor of his choice, Section 20 (A) (3) thereof further provides that any disagreement in the findings may be referred to a third doctor jointly agreed upon by the parties, whose findings shall be final and binding between them. The Court has consistently held that non-observance of the requirement to have the conflicting assessments determined by a third doctor would mean that the assessment of the company-designated physician prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></p><p> Considering that petitioner failed to observe the conflict-resolution procedure provided under the 2010 POEA-SEC, the Court is inclined to uphold the opinion of the company-designated physician that petitioner's illnesses were not work-related, hence, not compensable.</p><p> Accordingly, no error can be imputed against the CA in granting respondents' <em>certiorari </em>petition as the findings and conclusions reached by the NLRC are tainted with grave abuse of discretion since the claim for disability benefits remains unsupported by substantial evidence. Verily, while the Court adheres to the principle of liberality in favor of the seafarer, it cannot allow claims for compensation based on whims and caprices. When the evidence presented negates compensability, the claim must fail, lest injustice be caused to the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p><p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
