				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The implementation of Republic Act No. 6758 resulted in the integration of all allowances previously received, including Cost of Living Allowance and Amelioration Allowance, into the basic standardized salary. When a government entity ceases to be covered by Republic Act No. 6758, the new position classification and compensation plan must also include all allowances previously received in the basic salary, in line with the principle of non-diminution of pay.<br><br>This is a consolidated case resulting from a Petition for Mandamus filed by the president of the National Power Corporation Employees Consolidated Union (NECU) and the president of the National Power Corporation Employees and Workers Union (NEWU) before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 84, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Petition sought to direct the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR), its President and its Board of Directors to release and pay the Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) and Amelioration Allowance (AA) to all NAPOCOR employees beginning July 1, 1989 to March 16, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Petition for Mandamus was granted by the trial court and the NAPOCOR was ordered to pay a total of P6,496,055,339.98 as back payment for COLA and AA with an additional P704,777,508.60 as legal interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>NAPOCOR was created under Commonwealth Act No. 120<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as a government-owned and controlled corporation.

The integration became effective only on March 16, 1999. Thus, in between those two dates, they were still entitled to receive the two allowances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>On December 28, 2007, Abner P. Eleria, president of NECU, and Melito B.

NAPOCOR again referred the matter to the Committee for further study. Due to the continued refusal of NAPOCOR to release the allowances, NECU and NEWU were constrained to file the Petition for Mandamus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In its Consolidated Comment before the trial court, the Office of the Solicitor General, on behalf of NAPOCOR, alleged that the Notice of Position Allocation and Salary Adjustment (NPASA) of employees should be examined to find out if the COLA and AA were nevertheless integrated into the salaries despite the ineffectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10. The affected employees must also show that they suffered a diminution of pay as a result of its implementation. The Office of the Solicitor General likewise pointed out that the COLA and AA were not among those allowances specifically excluded in Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 and thus were deemed to have been included in the standardized salary rates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In their Reply with Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings before the trial court, NECU and NEWU submitted the following documents to prove right to COLA and AA:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Letter of [NPC President] Del Callar dated October 9, 2007 categorizing the workers/employees of the NAPOCOR into three groups, viz:<br><br>a.1 NPC employees who were incumbent as of June 30, 1989 are no longer entitled to their COLA and AA from July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1993 since said allowances have been factually integrated into their salaries but entitled to COLA and AA from January 1, 1994 to March 15, 1999;<br><br>a.2 NPC employees hired between July 1, 1989 and December 31, 1993 are entitled to COLA and AA since said benefits were not factually integrated into their salaries from their date of employment up to March 15, 1999; and<br><br>a.3 NPC employees as of January 1, 1994 to March 15, 1999 are entitled to COLA and AA from their date of employment up to March 15, 1999.<br><br></li><li>Certification issued by Mr. Alexander P. Japon, NPC's Senior Finance Department Manager dated April 22, 2008 admitting its obligation to pay COLAs and AAs due the NPC workers/employees as well as certifying the availability of funds in the amount of P8.5 Billion for the purpose and pursuant to DBM CCC No. 12; and<br><br></li><li>Letter of [NPC President] Del Callar dated April 23, 2008 to the NAPOCOR Board certifying the NPC stand to pay the COLA and AA to the workers/employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The Office of the Solicitor General filed an Omnibus Motion seeking to withdraw its appearance as counsel for NAPOCOR and asking for leave to intervene as the People's Tribune. The Motion stated that the position taken by NAPOCOR ran counter to the Office of the Solicitor General's stand that the COLA and AA were already integrated into the standardized salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Department of Budget and Management likewise submitted a Supplemental Comment to the trial court, arguing that the COLA and AA were already integrated into the standardized salary rates, as shown in their Notice of Position Allocation and Salary Adjustment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It further posited that <i>De Jesus</i> only applied in instances where the integration of allowance was by "mere legal fiction"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and that <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989</i> was similarly inapplicable since there was already a factual integration of allowances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It likewise pointed out that the new compensation plan for NAPOCOR employees did not include the grant of additional COLA and AA and that the 2008 General Appropriations Act prohibited the use of savings for additional COLA and AA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It maintained that the test to the entitlement of additional allowances was whether there was a diminution of pay as a result of the law's implementation and that mandamus only lied "where there is a clear legal right sought to be enforced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On November 28, 2008, the Regional Trial Court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> in favor of NECU and NEWU. According to the trial court, the determination of whether the COLA and AA had been factually integrated was already resolved when the NAPOCOR Committee certified that the COLA and AA of the employees from July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1993 were not factually integrated into their standardized salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The trial court also cited <i>De Jesus, Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989, and Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System v.

It had intended this fact to be established by documentary evidence such as the Notice of Position Allocation and Salary Adjustment. NECU and NEWU likewise presented documentary evidence before the trial court to establish their position. In order to review any appeal of the case, it would have been necessary to review the weight and evidentiary value of the documents presented.

At the very least, before the said circular under attack may be permitted to substantially reduce their income, the government officials and employees concerned should be apprised and alerted by the publication of subject circular in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines — to the end that they be given amplest opportunity to voice out whatever opposition they may have, and to ventilate their stance on the matter.

Thus, a question arose as to whether the employees were entitled to the back pay of their COLA and AA.<br><br>This Court held that since the Philippine Port Authority has already granted these allowances to its employees, the employees should continue to receive them during the period of ineffectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10:<br><blockquote>The parties fail to cite any law barring the continuation of the grant of the COLA and the amelioration allowance during the period when DBM-CCC No. 10 was in legal limbo.<br><br>The present case should be distinguished from <i>PNB v. Palma</i>, in which the respondents sought by mandamus to compel the petitioner therein to grant them certain fringe benefits and allowances that continued to be given to Philippine National Bank (PNB) employees hired prior to July 1, 1989. This Court held that PNB could not be compelled to do so, because the respondents had been hired after that date. Under Section 12 of RA 6758, only "incumbent" government employees (as of July 1, 1989) already receiving those benefits may continue to receive them, apart from their standardized pay.<br><br>In the present case, the PPA already granted herein petitioners the COLA and the amelioration allowances, even if they were hired after July 1, 1989. The only issue is whether they should have continued to receive the benefits during the period of the "ineffectivity" of DBC-CCC No. 10; that is, from July 1, 1989 to March 16, 1999, the period during which those allowances were not deemed integrated into their standard salary rates. Furthermore, in the <i>PNB</i> Decision, the employees claimed a right to receive the allowances from July 1, 1989 to January 1, 1997. PNB was able to grant the benefits post facto, because on that date (January 1, 1997) it had already been privatized and was thus no longer subject to the restrictions imposed by RA 6758 (the Salary Standardization Law).<br><br>Tellingly, the subject matter of the <i>PNB</i> case involved benefits that had not been deemed integrated into, but in fact exempted from, the standardized salary rates. In the present case, the subject matter refers to those deemed included, but were placed "in limbo" as a result of this Court's ruling in <i>De Jesus v. COA</i>.<br><br>To stress, the failure to publish DBM-CCC No. 10 meant that the COLA and the amelioration allowance were not effectively integrated into the standardized salaries of the PPA employees as of July 1, 1989. The integration became effective only on March 16, 1999. Thus, in between those two dates, they were still entitled to receive the two allowances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989</i> clarified that those who were already receiving COLA and AA as of July 1, 1989, <b><u>but whose receipt was discontinued due to the issuance of DBM-CCC No. 10, were entitled to receive such allowances during the period of the Circular's ineffectivity, or from July 1, 1989 to March 16, 1999.

It is necessary to examine first if the officers and employees of the NAPOCOR were already receiving COLA and AA from July 1, 1989 and whether their receipt of these allowances were discontinued due to the issuance of DBM-CCC No. 10.<br><br>In <i>NAPOCOR Employees Consolidated Union (NECU)</i>, this Court was confronted with the issue of whether the employees' welfare allowance was deemed integrated into the standardized salaries of the NAPOCOR employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> In holding that the employee welfare allowance was already deemed integrated, this Court also found that the NAPOCOR employees were already receiving COLA and AA prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 6758:<br><blockquote>The State aims in Rep. Act No. 6758 to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions. Prior to the effectivity of that law, NPC employees were receiving, aside from cost of living allowance, myriad of allowances like social amelioration allowance, emergency allowance, longevity pay and employee welfare allowance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><i>NAPOCOR Employees Consolidated Union (NECU)</i> also clarifies that <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989</i> was inapplicable since it only applied to back pay of COLA and AA that was previously withheld and not to those who continued to receive these benefits even after the issuance of DBM-CCC No. 10:<br><blockquote>The Court has, to be sure, taken stock of its recent ruling in <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 vs. Commission on Audit</i>. Sadly, however, our pronouncement therein is not on all fours applicable owing to differing factual milieu. There, the Commission on Audit allowed the payment of back cost of living allowance (COLA) and amelioration allowance previously withheld from PPA employees pursuant to the heretofore ineffective DBM-CCC No. 10, but limited the back payment only to incumbents as of July 1, 1989 who were already then receiving both allowances. COA considered the COLA and amelioration allowance of PPA employees as "not integrated" within the purview of the second sentence of Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 6758, which, according to COA confines the payment of "not integrated" benefits only to July 1, 1989 incumbents already enjoying said allowances.<br><br>In setting aside COA's ruling, we held in <i>PPA Employees</i> that there was no basis to use the elements of incumbency and prior receipt as standards to discriminate against the petitioners therein. For, DBM -CCC No. 10, upon which the incumbency and prior receipt requirements are contextually predicated, was in legal limbo from July 1, 1989 (effective date of the unpublished DBM-CCC No. 10) to March 16, 1999 (date of effectivity of the heretofore unpublished DBM circular). And being in legal limbo, the benefits otherwise covered by the circular, if properly published, were likewise in legal limbo as they cannot be classified either as effectively integrated or not integrated benefits.<br><br>There lies the difference.<br><br>Here, the employee welfare allowance was, as above demonstrated, integrated by NPC into the employees' standardized salary rates effective July 1, 1989 pursuant to Rep. Act No. 6758. Unlike in <i>PPA Employees</i>, the element of discrimination between incumbents as of July 1, 1989 and those joining the force thereafter is not obtaining in this case. And while after July 1, 1989, PPA employees can rightfully complain about the discontinuance of payment of COLA and amelioration allowance effected due to the incumbency and prior receipt requirements set forth in DBM-CCC No[.] 10, NPC cannot do likewise with respect to their welfare allowance since NPC has, for all intents and purposes, never really discontinued the payment thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Republic Act No. 6758 remained effective during the period of ineffectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> Thus, the COLA and AA of NAPOCOR officers and employees were integrated into the standardized salaries effective July 1, 1989 pursuant to Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758, which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 12.

Both sets of NAPOCOR employees were continuously receiving their COLA and AA since these allowances were already factually integrated into the standardized salaries pursuant to Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758.<br><br>In order to settle any confusion, we abandon any other interpretation of our ruling in <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989</i> with regard to the entitlement of the NAPOCOR officers and employees to the back payment of COLA and AA during the period of legal limbo. To grant any back payment of COLA and AA despite their factual integration into the standardized salary would cause salary distortions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> in the Civil Service.

Neither situation applies in this case.<br><br>NECU and NEWU take exception to the application of <i>NAPOCOR Employees Consolidated Union (NECU)</i> to this case, arguing that this case involved COLA and AA, and not the employee welfare allowance. NECU and NEWU, however, are arguing on semantics.

Upon the effectivity of the law, or on July 1, 1989, all allowances, except those specifically excluded, were deemed integrated into his basic salary. <i>To stress, all allowances previously granted were already deemed integrated into the standardized salary rates by July 1, 1989.</i><br><br>As shown above, Mr. Camagong's adjusted salary of P4,386.00 already included all allowances previously received. This amount is obviously less than his previous total compensation of P8,506.30. The law, however, provided a remedy in the form of a transition allowance. <i>NAPOCOR Employees Consolidated Union (NECU)</i> explains:<br><blockquote>When Rep. Act No. 6758 became effective on July 1, 1989, the new position title of Camagong was Plant Equipment Operator B with a salary grade of 14 and with a monthly salary of P4,386.00.<br><br>Admittedly, in the case of Camagong, his monthly gross income of P8,506.30 prior to the effectivity of Rep. Act No. 6758, was thereafter reduced to only P4,386.00. The situation, however, is duly addressed by the law itself. For, while Rep. Act No. 6758 aims at standardizing the salary rates of government employees, yet the legislature has adhered to the policy of non-diminution of pay when it enacted said law. So it is that Section 17 thereof precisely provides for a "transition allowance," as follows:<br><blockquote>Section 17. Salaries of Incumbents. — Incumbents of positions presently receiving salaries and additional compensation/fringe benefits including those absorbed from local government units and other emoluments, the aggregate of which exceeds the standardized salary rate as herein prescribed, shall continue to receive such excess compensation, which shall be referred to as transition allowance. The transition allowance shall be reduced by the amount of salary adjustment that the incumbent shall receive in the future.<br><br>The transition allowance referred to herein shall be treated as part of the basic salary for purposes of computing retirement pay, year-end bonus and other similar benefits.<br><br>As basis for computation of the first across-the-board salary adjustment of incumbents with transition allowance, no incumbent who is receiving compensation exceeding the standardized salary rate at the time of the effectivity of this Act, shall be assigned a salary lower than ninety percent (90%) of his present compensation or the standardized salary rate, whichever is higher. Subsequent increases shall be based on the resultant adjusted salary.<br></blockquote>Evidently, the transition allowance under the aforequoted provision was purposely meant to bridge the difference in pay between the pre-R.A. 6758 salary of government employees and their standardized pay rates thereafter, and because non-diminution of pay is the governing principle in Rep. Act No. 6758, Camagong, pursuant to Section 17 of that law was given a transition allowance of P4,120.30. This explains why, in the case of Camagong, his gross monthly income remained at P8,506.30, as can be seen in his NPASA, clearly showing that the allowances he used to receive prior to the effectivity of Rep. Act No. 6758, were integrated into his standardized salary rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The integration of COLA into the standardized salary rates is not repugnant to the law. <i>Gutierrez, et al. v. Department of Budget and Management, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> explains:<br><blockquote>COLA is not in the nature of an allowance intended to reimburse expenses incurred by officials and employees of the government in the performance of their official functions. It is not payment in consideration of the fulfillment of official duty. As defined, cost of living refers to "the level of prices relating to a range of everyday items" or "the cost of purchasing those goods and services which are included in an accepted standard level of consumption." Based on this premise, COLA is a benefit intended to cover increases in the cost of living. Thus, it is and should be integrated into the standardized salary rates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, it would be incongruous to grant any alleged back pay of COLA and AA from July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1993, when the NAPOCOR officers and employees have already received such allowances for this period. The grant would be tantamount to additional compensation, which is proscribed by Section 8, Article IX (B) of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8.

Ramos issued Memorandum Order No. 198, providing for a different position classification and compensation plan for NAPOCOR employees to take effect on January 1, 1994. The compensation plan states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. COMPENSATION PLAN. The NPC Compensation Plan consists of the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">2.1 Total monthly compensation structure as shown in Annex "A" which shall include:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">2.1.1 Monthly basic salary schedule as shown in Annex "B"; and<br><br>2.1.2 Schedule of monthly allowances as provided in Annex "C" which include existing government mandated allowances such as PERA and Additional Compensation, and Rice Subsidy, and Reimbursable Allowances, i.e., RRA, RTA and RDA, provided however, that the NP Board is hereby authorized to further rationalize and/or revise the rates for such allowances as may be necessary; and<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">2.2 "Pay for Performance". Pay for Performance is a variable component of the total annual cash compensation consisting of bonuses and incentives but excluding the 13th month pay, earned on the basis of corporate and/or group performance or productivity, following a Productivity Enhancement Program (PEP), and step-increases given in recognition of superior individual performance using a performance rating system, duly approved by the NP Board. The corporate or group productivity or incentive bonus shall range from zero (0) to four (4) months basic salary, to be given in lump-sum for each year covered by the PEP. The in-step increases on the other hand, once granted, shall form part of the monthly basic salary.<br></div></blockquote>Thus, <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989</i> is inapplicable for the period following the enactment of Republic Act No. 7648. This case interprets provisions of Republic Act No. 6758. The "legal limbo" contemplated in this case does not apply to a period where a new position classification and compensation plan has already been enacted. Thus, entitlement to the back pay of COLA and AA from 1994 to 1999 should not be premised on this case.<br><br>The question as to whether the COLA and AA were deemed integrated in this new compensation plan was the subject of then NAPOCOR President del Callar's letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> dated May 10, 2007 to Secretary Andaya, Jr. Secretary Andaya, Jr. replied:<br><blockquote>It may also be worth mentioning that in CY 1994, NPC adopted a new Salary Pay [sic] pursuant to RA No. 6743 [sic], the Energy Power Crisis Act, as implemented by Memorandum Order (MO) 198. Under the said Salary Plan, the COLA and AA are no longer subsisting and these have already been integrated into the standardized salary of employees effective July 1, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br></blockquote>NAPOCOR's Office of the General Counsel disagreed with this assessment, stating that Memorandum Order No. 198, series of 1994 did not include the COLA and AA "presumably due to the belief that DBM-CCC No. 10 was still in effect (the Supreme Court decisions declaring the said Circular as ineffective were not yet promulgated as of that time)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> This sentiment was echoed in President del Callar's letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> dated October 9, 2007 to Secretary Andaya, Jr.<br><br>This statement, however, fails to take into account that DBM-CCC No. 10 implements Republic Act No. 6758,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> not Republic Act No. 7648. By January 1, 1994, NAPOCOR officers and employees were no longer covered by the standardized salary rates of Republic Act No. 6758. Thus, the effectivity or ineffectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10 from January 1, 1994 is irrelevant.<br><br>Memorandum Order No. 198, series of 1994 only includes the basic salary and the following allowances: Personal Economic Relief Allowance (PERA) and Additional Compensation, Rice Subsidy, and Reimbursable Allowances. Republic Act No. 7648 also provides that only the President of the Philippines can upgrade the compensation of NAPOCOR personnel:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. Reorganization of the National Power Corporation. — The President is hereby empowered to reorganize the NAPOCOR, to make it more effective, innovative, and responsive to the power crisis. For this purpose, the President may abolish or create offices; split, group, or merge positions; transfer functions, equipment, properties, records and personnel; institute drastic cost-cutting measures and take such other related actions necessary to carry out the purpose herein declared. Nothing in this Section shall result in the diminution of the present salaries and benefits of the personnel of the NAPOCOR: Provided, That any official or employee of the NAPOCOR who may be phased out by reason of the reorganization authorized herein shall be entitled to such benefits as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the NAPOCOR, with the approval of the President.<br><br>The President may upgrade the compensation of the personnel of the NAPOCOR at rates comparable to those prevailing in privately-owned power utilities to take effect upon approval by Congress of the NAPOCOR's budget for 1994. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In issuing Memorandum No. 198, series of 1994, the President determined that the New Compensation Plan for the NAPOCOR personnel shall include the basic salary, PERA and Additional Compensation, Rice Subsidy, and Reimbursable Allowances. The discretion of the President to specify the new salary rates, however, is qualified by the statement: "<i>Nothing in this Section shall result in the diminution of the present salaries and benefits of the personnel of the NAPOCOR</i>." This qualification is repeated in Section 7 of the Memorandum:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. NON-DIMINUTION IN PAY. Nothing in this Order shall result in the reduction of the compensation and benefits entitlements of NPC personnel prior to the effectivity of this Order.<br></blockquote>The Board of Directors is authorized to rationalize or revise only the rates for PERA and Additional Compensation, Rice Subsidy, and Reimbursable Allowances:<br><blockquote>2.1.2 Schedule of monthly allowances as provided in Annex "C" which include existing government mandated allowances such as PERA and Additional Compensation, and Rice Subsidy, and Reimbursable Allowances, i.e., RRA, RTA and RDA, provided however, that the NP Board is hereby authorized to further rationalize and/or revise the rates <i>for such allowances</i> as may be necessary[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As previously discussed, COLA and AA were already deemed integrated into the basic standardized salary from July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1993. These allowances need not be separately granted. <i>All basic salaries by December 31, 1993 already included the COLA and AA.</i><br><br>Thus, in order to conclude that the NAPOCOR employees were not able to receive their COLA and AA upon the implementation of the New Compensation Plan, it must first be determined whether its implementation resulted in the diminution of their salaries and benefits.<br><br>Evidence on record, however, shows that the affected employees suffered no diminution in their compensation upon the implementation of the New Compensation Plan on January 1, 1994.<br><br>The pay slips<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> of an employee, Melinda A.
