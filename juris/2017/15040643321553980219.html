It is for reconveyance and the annulment of <i>title</i>.<br><br>The difference between these two (2) actions was discussed in <i>Toledo v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><blockquote>An action for annulment of judgment is a remedy in equity so exceptional in nature that it may be availed of only when other remedies are wanting, and only if the judgment, final order or final resolution sought to be annulled was rendered by a court lacking jurisdiction or through extrinsic fraud. An action for reconveyance, on the other hand, is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful owner of land which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another for the purpose of compelling the latter to transfer or reconvey the land to him. The Court of Appeals has exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts whereas actions for reconveyance of real property may be filed before the Regional Trial Courts or the Municipal Trial Courts, depending on the assessed value of the property involved.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Petitioners allege that: first, they are the owners of the land by virtue of a sale between their and respondents' predecessors-in-interest; and second, that respondents Ramoses and ARC Marketing illegally dispossessed them by having the same property registered in respondents' names. Thus, far from establishing a case for annulment of judgment, the foregoing allegations clearly show a case for reconveyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>As stated, a complaint for reconveyance is a remedy where the plaintiff argues for an order for the defendant to transfer its title issued in a proceeding not otherwise invalid. The relief prayed for may be granted on the basis of intrinsic rather than extrinsic fraud; that is, fraud committed on the real owner rather than fraud committed on the procedure amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>An action for annulment of title, on the other hand, questions the validity of the grant of title on grounds which amount to lack of due process of law. The remedy is premised in the nullity of the procedure and thus the invalidity of the title that is issued. Title that is invalidated as a result of a successful action for annulment against the decision of a Regional Trial Court acting as a land registration court may still however be granted on the merits in another proceeding not infected by lack of jurisdiction or extrinsic fraud if its legal basis on the merits is properly alleged and proven.<br><br>Considering the Spouses Aboitiz's fraudulent registration without the Spouses Po's knowledge and the latter's assertion of their ownership of the land, their right to recover the property and to cancel the Spouses Aboitiz's<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> title, the action is for reconveyance and annulment of title and not for annulment of judgment.<br><br>Thus, the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction to hear this case.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The Spouses Aboitiz argue that the Spouses Po's cause of action has prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> They claim that prescription has set in because the original complaint was filed only on November 12, 1996, after more than 10 years after the Deed of Absolute Sale between Ciriaco and Spouses Po was executed on May 5, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The Spouses Po's action has not prescribed.<br><br>"[A]n action for reconveyance ... prescribes in [10] years from the issuance of the Torrens title over the property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The basis for this is Section 53, Paragraph 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> in relation to Articles 1456<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and 1144(2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Under Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), the owner of a property may avail of legal remedies against a registration procured by fraud:<br><blockquote>SECTION 53. <i>Presentation of Owner's Duplicate Upon Entry of New Certificate</i>. - . . .<br><br>In all cases of registration procured by fraud, the owner may pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud without prejudice, however, to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title...<br></blockquote>Article 1456 of the Civil Code provides that a person acquiring a property through fraud becomes an implied trustee of the property's true and lawful owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>An implied trust is based on equity and is either (i) a constructive trust, or (ii) a resulting trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> A resulting trust is created by implication of law and is presumed as intended by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> A constructive trust is created by force of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> such as when a title is registered in favor of a person other than the true owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>The implied trustee only acquires the right "to the beneficial enjoyment of [the] property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The legal title remains with the true owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> In <i>Crisostomo v.

[I]t is obvious that the lower court was referring to the legal effect of the conclusiveness against all persons of the <i>in rem</i> decision in the cadastral case rather than the actual fact that the plaintiff was a claimant who appeared in the said case, for he alleged in his complaint that he "has no knowledge whatsoever of the application for registration filed by defendant Maximina Fortich and the order of decree of registration issued in favor of the defendant Maximina Fortich by this Honorable Court until on February 25, 1967..." (Record on Appeal, page 30). Such being the case, then an action for reconveyance is available to the plaintiff, the decree of registration notwithstanding, for...<br><blockquote>"..., it is now a well-settled doctrine in this jurisdiction that the existence of a decree of registration in favor of one party is no bar to an action to compel reconveyance of the property to the true owner, which is an action <i>in personam</i>, even if such action be instituted after the year fixed by Section 38 of the Land Registration Act as a limit to the review of the registration decree, provided it is shown that the registration is wrongful and the property sought to be reconveyed has not passed to an innocent third party holder for value.["]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The reason for this rule is to prevent the unjust deprivation of rights over real property.

However, <b>this conclusiveness of judgment in the registration of lands is not absolute</b>. It admits of exception.

Thus, the aggrieved party may file a suit for reconveyance of property</i> or a personal action for recovery of damages against the party who registered his property through fraud, or in case of insolvency of the party who procured the registration through fraud, an action against the Treasurer of the Philippines for recovery of damages from the Assurance Fund. <i>Through these remedial proceedings, the law, while holding registered titles indefoasible, allows redress calculated to prevent one from enriching himself at the expense of other. Necessarily, without setting aside the decree of title, the issues raised in the previous registration case are <b>relitigated</b>, for purposes of reconveyance of said title or recovery of damages.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, the Spouses Po allege that the registration was done through fraud.

Hence, they are not precluded from presenting evidence that is contrary to the findings in the land registration case.<br><br>The factual findings of the land registration court are not being questioned.

What is being sought is the transfer of the property wrongfully or erroneously registered in another's name to its rightful owner or to the one with a better right.

A certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title over the particular property described therein. It cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner; nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud; neither does it permit one to enrich himself at the expense of others.

"A" Exh. A/1" Exh. 2"/ A, A-1 and A-2) has the validating elements of sale, whereas the rest of the Deeds of Sale (Exhs 1 to 5) executed by the Heirs of Mariano Seno in favor of the Defendants are void, for containing untruthful statements as pleaded and proven. They are no longer the owners of the subject property when they executed the several Deeds of Conveyance to defendant Roberto Aboitiz.<br><br>On the first issue on the identity and location of the land, the sale of Ciriaco Seno to Plaintiffs (Exh. "A") reflected in the Tax Declarations that the Defendants used in their titling proceeding is the very same lot as certified by the Barangay Captain dated July 28, 1999 under Plaintiff's Request for Admission.<br><br>Concerning the second formulated issue, only the Deed of Sale executed by Ciriaco Seno was valid with all the attending requisites of sale. It was sold by the legitimate owner of the land, Ciriaco Seno to the Plaintiffs. The sale (Exh. A, Exhibit "X") enjoyed preferential date of execution, being dated or executed in 1978 by the lawful owner Ciriaco Seno who was first to register the sale in the Registry of Property office, and due to such registration, the Tax Declaration of Ciriaco Seno, was cancelled and a new Tax Declaration was issued in the name of Victoria Po for as shown in Exh. E the said tax declaration succeeded in canceling the Tax Declaration of Mariano Seno (Exh. C) and was issued thereafter a Tax Declaration in the name of C[i]riaco Seno (Exh. D). So, when the latter sold the subject land to plaintiffs in 1978, the same was already owned by C[i]riaco Seno.<br><br>When Mariano Seno died in 1982, the subject land owned by C[i]riaco Seno, naturally, is not part of the estate of Mariano Seno, for at that point in time, the subject land is now owned by plaintiffs Sps.

"D" "E" &amp; "E-1").<br><br>As to the issue whether defendant Roberto Aboitiz was a purchaser in good faith and for value, the Court holds that defendant Roberto Aboitiz was not a purchaser in good faith and for value for he was already informed of the ownership of plaintiffs over the subject land during the conciliation proceedings before the barangay official when plaintiffs filed a barangay case against him.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In this case, the Court believes that defendant Roberto Aboitiz is aware of the proprietary rights of the plaintiffs considering the land was already declared for taxation purposes in plaintiffs' names after the tax declaration of said land, first in the name of Mariano Seno was cancelled and another one issued in the name of C[i]riaco Seno when the latter bought the said land from his father Mariano Seno, and after the said tax declaration in the name of C[i]riaco Seno was cancelled and another one issued in the name of plaintiffs herein.<br><br>So, defendant Roberto Aboitiz purchased the subject land from the Heirs of Mariano Seno who are no longer the owners thereof and the tax declaration of subject land was no longer in the name of Mariano Seno nor in the name of Heirs of Mariano Seno.<br><br>The City Assessor of Mandaue City even issued a Certification (Exh.

Therefore, the factual findings of the lower courts are binding.<br><br>Furthermore, this Court finds that the Spouses Aboitiz failed to prove their claim of fraud.

This is because when Spring Homes sold the property in question to the Spouses Lumbres, it practically transferred all its interests therein to the said Spouses.

The effect of such an outright cancellation would be to impair public confidence in the certificate of title, for everyone dealing with property registered under the Torrens system would have to inquire in every instance whether the title has been regularly or irregularly issued.
