The following day, he had chest pains with palpitations. He was seen by a doctor that same afternoon and was advised to take medication and to rest for three (3) consecutive days.

The Collective Bargaining Agreement had already lapsed by the time Perea was repatriated to the Philippines by late May 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter held that the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Vessels of the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA Contract) and the Department of Labor and Employment Order No. 4, Series of 2000 were the governing provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter emphasized that Elburg followed the POEA Contract when it paid Perea's wages during the time he was indisposed while on board the vessel. He was also given medical treatment at a foreign port at Elburg's expense. The Labor Arbiter also underscored that after Perea's repatriation, he was subjected to a series of medical tests and procedures, including a computed tomography (CT) scan and a coronary angiogram, all at Elburg's expense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter ruled that while Section 32-A of the POEA Contract provided that hypertension may be compensable, this was applicable only if it caused "impairment of function[s] of body organs like kidneys, heart and brain, resulting in permanent disability."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Labor Arbiter held that Perea's hypertension did not impair the functions of his organs, as evidenced by Dr. Hao-Quan and Dr. Lim's medical reports.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Between the findings of Dr. Hao-Quan and Dr. Lim and those of Dr. Pascual, the Labor Arbiter gave more weight to the findings of the company-designated physicians who concluded that Perea was not suffering from coronary disease based on the results of a coronary angiogram.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Perea appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Labor Arbiter Decision.<br><br>On October 14, 2011, the National Labor Relations Commission<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dismissed Perea's appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's Decision <i>in toto.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission ruled that Perea's failure to disclose his pre-existing condition of a "fractured/dislocated right elbow" on his pre-employment medical examination "would bar him from claiming compensation/disability benefits," even if the cause of his repatriation had no connection with his pre-existing condition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission likewise upheld Dr. Hao-Quan and Dr. Lim's assessment on Perea's physical fitness, finding it to be more credible than Dr. Pascual's:<br><br><blockquote>As to the two assessments, We find the company[-]designated physician[s'] assessment clearing complainant from the cause of his medical repatriation more credible. Said clearance was based on medical/laboratory examinations made on complainant like dipyridamole thallium scan done on July 1, 2010, coronary showed angiogram done on July 29, 2010 which showed normal vessels. On the other hand, the findings of complainant's physician declaring complainant medically "unfit to work as seaman" due to "uncontrollable hypertension" and "coronary artery disease" was not supported by any medical/laboratory examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On December 19, 2011, the National Labor Relations Commission<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> denied Perea's Motion for Reconsideration of its October 14, 2011 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Perea filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals but it was dismissed in the Court of Appeals Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated October 16, 2012.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that hypertension may be compensable under Section 32-A of the POEA Contract only if it caused the dysfunction of body organs, which must be substantiated with the following documents:<br><br>"(a) chest x-ray report, (b) ECG report, (c) blood chemistry report, (d) funduscopy report, and (e) [CT] scan."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals declared that while Dr. Pascual certified that Perea was suffering from uncontrolled hypertension, his certification was not supported by the required procedures and laboratory exams. Thus, his medical opinion, which was rendered after a single consultation, could not be considered over that of the company-designated physicians, who monitored Perea's progress and subjected him to extensive examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals agreed with Perea that the National Labor Relations Commission erred when it went beyond the issues elevated on appeal, specifically Perea's concealment of a pre-existing illness, an issue that was never raised by the parties. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals ruled that such was merely an error in judgment and not grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further held that the finding on concealment was merely in addition to the National Labor Relations Commission's main ground for the dismissal of the appeal—the lack of substantial evidence to support Dr. Pascual's declaration of Perea's unfitness to work as a seaman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that Elburg strictly and faithfully observed the terms and conditions of the POEA Contract by paying his wages and sickness allowance and providing medical treatment in a foreign port and upon disembarking.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Finally, the Court of Appeals denied the prayer for moral damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 2013, the Court of Appeals denied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Perea's Motion for Reconsideration of its October 16, 2012 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On March 27, 2013, Perea filed this Petition for Review<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> where he continues to assert his lack of fitness to work as a seafarer due to uncontrolled hypertension and coronary artery disease.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals erred in according weight to the self-serving findings of the company-designated physicians and in disregarding the findings of the independent cardiologist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioner likewise claims that the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's dismissal of his complaint due to concealment of pre-existing injury, since it was never put into issue, not having been raised by any of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Finally, petitioner avers that he was only given US$1,396.20 or two (2) months equivalent of his 130-day sickness allowance, leaving a balance of US$1,628.90.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>On June 10, 2013, Capt.

Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc., </i>contend that entitlement to disability benefits is governed by law, contract, and medical findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Respondents maintain that petitioner was monitored by their company-designated physicians and was subjected to laboratory examinations and procedures such as coronary angiography, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Dipyridamole Thallium Scan. Dr. Hao-Quan and Dr. Lim's resulting diagnosis of Perea's fitness to work was supported by a barrage of tests; thus, Perea's claim that he was suffering from coronary artery disease was sufficiently debunked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On November 22, 2013, petitioner filed his Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> to respondents' comment, in compliance with this Court's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> dated September 11, 2013.<br><br>In his Reply, petitioner proclaims that the Labor Code provisions regarding the entitlement of a seafarer to disability benefits should be read hand-in-hand with the POEA Contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also contests the "fit to work" assessment of the company-designated physicians since it goes against the recommendation of "Optimal Medical Management" and "Aggressive Risk Factor Modification" issued in his coronary angiography result.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that he has been unable to earn wages as a seafarer for a period of more than 240 days, making him permanently unfit to work as a seafarer in whatever capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 2014, this Court gave due course to the petition and directed<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[57]</sup></font> the parties to submit their respective memoranda.<br><br>On April 28, 2014, respondents filed their memorandum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Petitioner did not file his memorandum.<br><br>In their Memorandum, respondents continue to argue that upon his repatriation, petitioner was diagnosed with simple high blood pressure, which did not impair the functions of his internal organs. Respondents emphasize that petitioner did not suffer a heart attack or stroke and that all of the tests and procedures performed showed that aside from his high blood pressure, which was timely addressed with medication, petitioner was not suffering from any disability or illness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Respondents also point out that Dr. Pascual's finding that petitioner was medically unfit to work as a seafarer was arrived at after a single consultation and without conducting any tests on petitioner to ascertain his condition and support the conclusion of medical unfitness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>This Court resolves the following issues:<br><br>First, whether the issue of the concealed pre-existing condition was rightly ruled upon by the National Labor Relations Commission when it was not raised by any of the parties;<br><br>Second, whether petitioner is entitled to disability benefits;<br><br>Third, whether petitioner is entitled to the balance of his disability allowance; and<br><br>Finally, whether petitioner is entitled to his claims of damages and attorney's fees.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>Rule VI, Section 4(d) of the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission, categorically states that in deciding an appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission shall limit itself to the specific issues elevated on appeal:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. Requisites for Perfection of Appeal. –<br><br>d) Subject to the provisions of Article 218 of the Labor Code, once the appeal is perfected in accordance with these Rules, <i>the Commission shall limit itself to reviewing and deciding only the specific issues that were elevated on appeal. </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Petitioner was correct to assail the National Labor Relations Commission's ruling on the concealment of a pre-existing fracture or dislocated elbow because it appears that it was never raised by the parties before the Labor Arbiter or even the National Labor Relations Commission. In fact, aside from petitioner questioning this ruling, the alleged concealment of a pre-existing injury was also not raised as an issue before this Court. The National Labor Relations Commission clearly erred in considering a matter that was never raised for resolution on appeal.<br><br>However, contrary to petitioner's assertions, the dismissal of his claim was not brought about by his concealment of a pre-existing condition. Rather, his complaint was rightly dismissed by the Court of Appeals because of his failure to substantially corroborate his claim that he was unfit to work as a seafarer, thus:<br><br><blockquote>We deem the [National Labor Relations Commission]'s finding of concealment to be merely an adjunct, if not a superfluity, to. its main ground for the dismissal of the appeal, <i>i.e., </i>the lack of any medical/laboratory examination to support Dr, Pascual's declaration that petitioner is "unfit to work as a seaman" due to ""uncontrollable hypertension" and "coronary artery disease". Thus, even if the [National Labor Relations Commission] had not made any reference to the pre­existing fracture[,] the outcome of its decision would have remained the same: petitioner's appeal would still have been dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br><br><i>Madridejos v. NYK-Fil Ship Management, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> discussed that generally, this Court limits itself to questions of law in a Rule 45 petition:<br><br><blockquote>As a rule, we only examine questions of law in a Rule 45 petition. Thus, "we do not re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the [National Labor Relations Commission], an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field." Similarly, we do not replace our "own judgment for that of the tribunal in determining where the weight of evidence lies or what evidence is credible." The factual findings of the National Labor Relations Commission, when confirmed by the Court of Appeals, are usually "conclusive on this Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br><br>This Court sees no reason to depart from this rule.<br><br>For an illness or injury to be compensable under the POEA Contract, it must have been work-related and acquired during the term of the seafarer's contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Work-related illness is defined as "any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the conditions set therein satisfied."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The relevant portions of Section 32-A are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 32-A. Occupational Diseases. —<br><br>For an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; <br>(2) The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;<br>(3) The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it;<br>(4) There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. </blockquote><br><br>The following diseases are considered as occupational when contracted under working conditions involving the risks described herein:<br>....<br><br>11. Cardio-Vascular Diseases. Any of the following conditions must be met:<br><br><blockquote>a. If the heart disease was known to have been present during employment, there must be proof that an acute exacerbation was clearly precipitated by the unusual strain by reasons of the nature of his work.<br><br>b. The strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship.<br><br>c. If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship.<br><br>....<br><br></blockquote>20. Essential Hypertension<br><br>Hypertension classified as primary or essential is considered compensable if it causes impairment of function[s] of body organs like kidneys, heart, eyes and brain, resulting in permanent disability; Provided, that, the following documents substantiate it: (a) chest x-ray report, (b) ECG report, (c) blood chemistry report, (d) funduscopy report, and (f) C-T scan. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br><br>It is not disputed that petitioner was treated for injuries and hypertension during the term of his contract.

Similarly in <i>Ruben D. Andrada v.
