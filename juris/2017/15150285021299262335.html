				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A judgment that lapses into finality becomes immutable and unalterable. It can neither be modified nor disturbed by courts in any manner even if the purpose of the modification is to correct perceived errors of fact or law. Parties cannot circumvent this principle by assailing the execution of the judgment. What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> arising from the execution of a final and executory judgment for damages.

As a result of the tragic incident, Stephen suffered serious spinal cord injuries. He is now a paraplegic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated September 29, 2004 finding Mercury Drug and Del Rosario jointly and severally liable for actual damages, compensatory damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The dispositive portion of this Decision stated:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered finding defendants Mercury Drug Corporation, Inc. and Rolando del Rosario, jointly and severally liable to pay plaintiffs Spouses Richard Y.

Winning litigants are entitled to the satisfaction of the judgment through a writ of execution. On the other hand, courts are barred from modifying the rights and obligations of the parties, which had been adjudicated upon. They have the ministerial duty to issue a writ of execution to enforce the judgment.<br><br>It is a fundamental principle that a judgment that lapses into finality becomes immutable and unalterable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The primary consequence of this principle is that the judgment may no longer be modified or amended by any court in any manner even if the purpose of the modification or amendment is to correct perceived errors of law or fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This principle known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment is a matter of sound public policy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> which rests upon the practical consideration that every litigation must come to an end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The rationale behind the rule was further explained in <i>Social Security System v. Isip</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>The doctrine of immutability and inalterability of a final judgment has a two-fold purpose: (1) to avoid delay in the administration of justice and thus, procedurally, to make orderly the discharge of judicial business and (2) to put an end to judicial controversies, at the risk of occasional errors, which is precisely why courts exist. Controversies cannot drag on indefinitely. The rights and obligations of every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>The doctrine of immutability of judgment, however, is not an iron­clad rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> It is subject to several exceptions, namely:<br><blockquote>(1) [T]he correction of clerical errors;<br><br>(2) [T]he so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party;<br><br>(3) [V]oid judgments; and<br><br>(4) [W]henever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>I.A</b><br></div><br>Clerical errors or ambiguities in the dispositive portion of a judgment may result from inadvertence. These errors can be rectified without violating the doctrine of immutability of judgment provided that the modification does not affect the substance of the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Clerical errors are best exemplified by typographical errors or arithmetic miscalculations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> They also include instances when words are interchanged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><i>Baguio v.

The dispositive portion of the decision ordered the defendants "to deliver the possession of Lot 1868 . . . to [p]laintiffs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Upon motion, the trial court subsequently amended Lot 1868 to Lot 1898.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> This Court sustained the modification since it was patently clear that the subject of the controversy was Lot 1898.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The error addressed by the lower court was "merely clerical and typographical,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> which did not affect the rights of the parties.<br><br>The same rule was applied in <i>Filipino Legion Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision was modified to reflect the proper description of the documents upon which Filipino Legion Corporation based its claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> This Court held that the modification simply cured an ambiguity but did not operate to reduce the area adjudicated to the corporation:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><blockquote>It is this last-mentioned rule which respondent Court of Appeals applied when it ordered the amendment of the disputed portion of its judgment in CA-G.R. 9196-R, and We see no error in its action considering that all what respondent Court did was to cure an ambiguity and rectify a mistake it had inadvertently made when it referred to the tax declarations of real property marked as Annexes C, D, and E, as <i>Exhibits</i> C, D, and E instead of Exhibits F, G, and H, respectively. As indicated earlier, it is obvious that the appellate Court was misguided by the markings "Annex C", "Annex D", "Annex E", appearing respectively on the face of Exhibits F, G, and H, and these letterings C, D and E were the ones the Court mistakenly used when it described the exhibits in question in the dispositive portion of the decision.<br><br>The correction of a clerical error is an exception to the general rule that no amendment or correction may be made by the court in its judgment once the latter had become final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Clerical errors also contemplate inadvertent omissions that create ambiguity.<br><br>In <i>Locsin v. Paredes and Hodges</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the term "severally" was inserted in the dispositive portion of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Although the modification changed the import of the judgment's dispositive portion, the allegations in the complaint and the conclusions of fact and law contained in the decision show that the obligation was solidary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Hence, the dispositive portion of the judgment should have stated that "the debt be paid severally[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Spouses Mahusay v. B.E. San Diego, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> the lower court amended its decision to include payment of "all penalties and interest due on the unpaid amortizations" under the contracts to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The modification, according to this Court) was not a substantial amendment of the judgment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>There was nothing substantial to vary, considering that the issues between the parties were deemed resolved and laid to rest, It is unn1istakably clear that petitioners do not deny the execution of the Contracts to Sell and, in fact, admit their liability for the unpaid amortizations of the lots purchased. . . There was a compelling reason for the CA to clarify its original Decision to include the payment of all penalties and interest due on the unpaid amortizations, as provided in the contracts. Considering that the validity of the contracts was never put in question, and there is nothing on record to suggest that the same may be contrary to law, morals, public order, or public policy, there is nothing unlawful in the stipulation requiring the payment of interest/penalty at the rate agreed upon in the contract of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In determining whether there are clerical errors or ambiguities in the dispositive portion of the judgment that should be rectified, courts should refer primarily to "the court's findings of facts and conclusions of law as expressed in the body of the decision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The parties' pleadings may also be consulted if necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br><center><b>I.B</b><br></center><br>"<i>Nunc pro tunc</i>" is a Latin phrase that means "now for then."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> A judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is made to enter into the record an act previously done by the court, which had been omitted either through inadvertence or mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> It neither operates to correct judicial errors nor to "supply omitted action by the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Its sole purpose is to make a present record of a "judicial action which has been actually taken."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>The concept of <i>nunc pro tunc</i> judgments was sufficiently explained in <i>Lichauco v. Tan Pho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote><i>[A judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i>] may be used to make the record speak the truth, but not to make it speak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken.</i> If the court has not rendered a judgment that it might or should have rendered, or if it has rendered an imperfect or improper judgment, it has no power to remedy these errors or omissions by ordering the entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> of a proper judgment. Hence <i>a court in entering a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> has no power to construe what the judgment means, but only to enter of record such judgment as had been formerly rendered, but which had not been entered of record as rendered</i>. In all cases the exercise of the power to enter judgments <i>nunc pro tunc</i> presupposes the actual rendition of a judgment, and a mere right to a judgment will not furnish the basis for such an entry.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>If the court has omitted to make an order, which it might or ought to have made, it cannot, at a subsequent term, be made <i>nunc pro tunc</i>. <i>According to some authorities, in all cases in which an entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is made, the record should show the facts which authorize the entry, 'but other courts hold that in entering an order <i>nunc pro tunc</i> the court is not confined to an examination of the judges minutes, or written evidence, but may proceed on any satisfactory evidence, including parol testimony.</i> In the absence of a statute or rule of court requiring it, the failure of the judge to sign the journal entries or the record does not affect the force of the order grante[d].<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The object of a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The exercise of issuing <i>nunc pro tunc</i> orders or judgments is narrowly confined to cases where there is a need to correct mistakes or omissions arising from inadvertence so that the record reflects judicial action, which had previously been taken. Furthermore, <i>nunc pro tunc</i> judgments or orders can only be rendered if none of the parties will be prejudiced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Parties seeking the issuance of <i>nunc pro tunc</i> judgments or orders must allege and prove that the court took a particular action and that the action was omitted through inadvertence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> On the other hand, courts must ensure that the matters sought to be entered are supported by facts or data.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>This may be accomplished by referring to the records of the case. This requirement was emphasized in <i>Lichauco</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>[F]or the entry of a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order, it is required that the record present some visible data of the order which it is sought to be supplied by said <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order, whether it is the data referring to the. whole of the order or merely limited to such portion thereof, that the part lacking from the record constitutes a necessary part, an inevitable and ordinary consequence of the portion appearing in the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, courts cannot render a judgment of order <i>nunc pro tunc</i> in the absence of data regarding the judicial act sought to be recorded.

Renato Sibayan, Eduardo Jamora, Evelyn Dy and Teresita Sanchez testified regarding the massive injuries suffered by plaintiff Stephen and expenses that plaintiff will continue to incur. (TSN, July 5, 1999; TSN April 26, 1999, TSN, April 19, 1999; and TSN, March 26, 1999).</span><br><br>Although Stephen survived the accident, the doctors are unanimous in saying that Stephen needs continuous rehabilitation for the rest of his life. Dr. Sibayan's prognosis with regard to Stephen's future recovery is nil, or zero. The best thing that can be done for Stephen is for the latter to maintain some kind of rehabilitation program with the aim of preventing complications, particularly bed sores, infection of the bladder, inability to move. There are no dedicated and specific centers in the Philippines with spinal cord injury rehabilitation program. Notwithstanding the presentation by plaintiffs of the rehabilitation programs which the plaintiff Stephen may avail of at Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, New Jersey, USA, together with the estimated expenses which may be incurred by plaintiffs, (Exhibits Y, Z-3), this Court deems it proper not to include the said amount because as far as the records are concerned, the enrollment of Stephen thereat remained a plan. The plaintiffs Spouses Richard and Carmen Huang merely contemplated the sending of their son, Stephen to Kessler Institute.<br><br><i>Accordingly, the defendants must not only pay for the actual expenses incurred by plaintiffs for the hospitalization and medical treatment of Stephen, they must also pay plaintiffs for the natural and probable expenses which the plaintiffs will in the future likely incur as a result of the injuries he suffered. In 1997[,] Stephen[']s average monthly expense was P21,500.00 and for 1998 it was for P16,280.00 more or less, (TSN, p. 11, January 11, 1999). It is expected that he will continue to incur these expenses for the rest of his life. The chance of Stephen regaining his normal ability to walk and perform the most basic body movements is remote. Thus, he shall be dependent financially and physically on the care, assistance, and support of his family throughout his life. Based on the actuarial computation of the remaining years that Stephen is expected to live, the life care cost will amount to P23,461,062.00 more or less. Plaintiffs must be compensated (Exhibits ZZ, ZZ-4 to ZZ-6).</i><br><br>Also part of the damages sustained by plaintiffs is the loss or in the least, impairment of Stephen's earning capacity. The massive injury Stephen sustained disabled him from engaging in those pursuits and occupations for which, in the absence of said injury, he would have qualified. <i>To determine how much to be awarded for decreased earning capacity, the health of the injured party, and his mental and physical ability to maintain himself before the injury as compared with his condition in this respect afterwards have to be considered. The rule necessarily permits an inquiry into the capacity of plaintiff prior to the injury, including his physical condition, and his ability to labor or follow his usual vocation, his age, his state of health, and his probable life expectancy. The plaintiff's ability and disposition to labor or his business or professional habits may also be taken into consideration . . .</i><br><br>At the time of [the] accident, Stephen is a bright young man of 17, fourth year high school, a member of his school's varsity basketball team. He passed the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines, De La Salle University, and the University of Asia and the Pacific. In the actuarial study presented by plaintiff's witness, Aida Josef, she projected that Stephen's life expectancy is only up to age 48.37 or more or less 20 years after the accident. Had Stephen not met the accident, he would have continued his studies, finished his course in time, embarked on a banking career, initially earned a monthly income of at least P15,000.[00], gotten married, raised children, and become a productive member of society. Based on her actuarial study, Ms. Josef opined that due to serious physical injuries which caused him to be paraplegic for life, Stephen lost the opportunity to do all [of] the above. Stephen stood to suffer loss of his earning capacity in the total amount of P41,982,764.00 from year 2003 to year 2004 (Exhibit[s] YY, ZZ and XX with submarkings). However, considering the speculation involved, this Court places the loss or impairment of Stephen's earning capacity to a conservative amount of Ten Million Pesos, for which he must be compensated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, there are no clerical errors or ambiguities regarding the computation of life care cost and loss of earning capacity awarded to respondent Stephen. The amounts indicated in the dispositive portion of the judgment faithfully correspond to the findings of fact and conclusions of the trial court.<br><br>The trial court deemed it adequate and proper to award P23,461,062.00 as life care cost and P10,000,000.00 as loss of earning capacity based on the evidence presented during trial. In awarding life care cost, the trial court did not limit itself to respondent Stephen's actual expenses in 1997 and 1998 and his projected life expectancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> The trial court also considered the testimonies of respondent Stephen's doctors regarding his future medical expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> On the award of loss of earning capacity, the trial court did not likewise limit itself to respondent Stephen's projected initial monthly salary and life expectancy. It considered other equally important factors such as respondent Stephen's capacity prior to the injury, fhysical conditions, disposition to labor, and his professional habits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br>These findings and conclusions were even affirmed by this Court in <i>Mercury Drug Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>Petitioners are also liable for all damages which are the natural and probable consequences of the act or omission complained of. The doctors who attended to respondent Stephen are one in their prognosis that his chances of walking again and performing basic body functions are nil. For the rest of his life, he will need continuous rehabilitation and therapy to prevent further complications such as pneumonia, bladder and rectum infection, renal failure, sepsis and severe bed sores, osteoporosis and fractures, and other spinal cord injury-related conditions. He will be completely dependent on the care and support of his family. We thus affirm the award of P23,461,062.00 for the life care cost of respondent Stephen Huang, based on his average monthly expense and the actuarial computation of the remaining years that he is expected to live; and the conservative amount of P10,000,000.00, as reduced by the trial court, for the loss or impairment of his earning capacity, considering his age, probable life expectancy, the state of his health, and his mental and physical condition before the accident. He was only seventeen years old, nearly six feet tall and weighed 175 pounds. He was in fourth year high school, and a member of the school varsity basketball team. He was also class president and editor-in-chief of the school annual. He had shown very good leadership qualities. He was looking forward to his college life, having just passed the entrance examinations of the University of the Philippines, De La Salle University, and the University of Asia and the Pacific. The University of Sto. Tomas even offered him a chance to obtain an athletic scholarship, but the accident prevented him from attending the basketball try-outs. Without doubt, he was an exceptional student. He excelled both in his academics and extracurricular undertakings. He is intelligent and motivated, a go-getter, as testified by Francisco Lopez, respondent Stephen Huang's godfather and a bank executive. Had the accident not happened, he had a rosy future ahead of him. He wanted to embark on a banking career, get married and raise children. Taking into account his outstanding abilities, he would have enjoyed a successful professional career in banking. But, as Mr. Lopez stated, it is highly unlikely for someone like respondent to ever secure a job in a bank. To his knowledge, no bank has ever hired a person suffering with the kind of disability as Stephen Huang's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>There being no clerical errors or ambiguities in the dispositive portion or body of the judgment, the amounts awarded as life care cost and loss of earning capacity stand. There is no reason to disturb the trial court's findings and conclusions on the matter.<br><br>This Court notes that the amendments sought by petitioners affect the very substance of the controversy. While it appears on the surface of the Petition that they merely seek the clarification of the judgment, a careful review of petitioners' assertions and arguments reveal their true intention of appealing the merits of the case. This cannot be done without violating the doctrine on immutability of judgments. A correction pertaining to the substance of the controversy is not a clerical error.<br><br>Furthermore, petitioners have previously raised their arguments in different fora, particularly in their Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> and in their Motion for Reconsideration and/or New Trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> before this Court. Their arguments have been reviewed and passed upon twice.<br><br>Nevertheless, even if we were to indulge petitioners, their arguments deserve scant consideration. Petitioners insist that the computation of life care cost should be limited to respondent Stephen's average monthly expenses in 1997 and 1998 and his projected life expectancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> They also insist that the computation of loss of earning capacity should be limited to respondent Stephen's estimated initial salary and his projected life expectancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>To limit the computation of life care cost and loss of earning capacity strictly to these variables glosses over other equally important economic factors that the trial court has pn,:lbably considered. Inflation, which is generally defined as the increase in the price of goods and services over time,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> is a significant economic factor. Petitioners failed to consider that the cost of goods and services back then would not be the same as today. Petitioners also glossed over the possibility that respondent Stephen might eventually be promoted within the banking industry. This may lead to an increased basic salary and the grant of additional benefits on top of hefty bonuses that are usually given to top-notch or high-ranking bank officers. Furthermore, petitioners overlook the health complications that may arise from spinal cord injuries. While it may be true that respondent is able to function as a productive member of society today, this cannot operate as a justification to reduce the monetary award granted to him. Reducing the monetary award granted to respondent Stephen penalizes his recovery.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Another effect of a final and executory judgment is that winning litigants are entitled to the satisfaction of the judgment through a writ of execution.<br><br>A writ of execution must substantially conform to the judgment sought to be enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> A writ of execution that exceeds the tenor of the judgment is patently void and should be struck down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> Upon a finding of its invalidity, the case may be remanded to the lower court for the issuance of the proper writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> issued by the Regional Trial Court neither varied nor departed from the terms of the judgment in any manner.
