The Court had previously ruled that <b>the COMELEC has the legal duty to cancel the CoC of anyone suffering from the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification to hold public office,</b> albeit, arising from a criminal conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Considering, however, that Section 52 (a), Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service similarly imposes the penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office as an accessory to the penalty of dismissal from service, the Court sees no reason why the ratiocination enunciated in such earlier criminal case should not apply here, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>Even without a petition under either x x x Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, <b>the COMELEC is under a legal duty to cancel the certificate of candidacy of anyone suffering from the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification to run for public office by virtue of a final judgment</b> of conviction. The final judgment of conviction is notice to the COMELEC of the disqualification of the convict from running for public office. The law itself bars the convict from running for public office, and the disqualification is part of the final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of the court is addressed not only to the Executive branch, but also to other government agencies tasked to implement the final judgment under the law.<br><br><b>Whether or not the COMELEC is expressly mentioned in the judgment to implement the disqualification, it is assumed that the portion of the final judgment on disqualification to run for elective public office is addressed to the COMELEC because under the Constitution the COMELEC is duty bound to "[e]nforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election."</b> The disqualification of a convict to run for public office under the Revised Penal Code, as affirmed by final judgment of a competent court, is part of the enforcement and administration of "all laws" relating to the conduct of elections.<br><br>To allow the COMELEC to wait for a person to file a petition to cancel the certificate of candidacy of one suffering from perpetual special disqualification will result in the anomaly that these cases so grotesquely exemplify. Despite a prior perpetual special disqualification, Jalosjos was elected and served twice as mayor. <b>The COMELEC will be grossly remiss in its constitutional duty to "enforce and administer all laws" relating to the conduct of elections if it does not <i><u>motu proprio</u></i> bar from running for public office those suffering from perpetual special disqualification by virtue of a final judgment.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In <i>Romeo G. Jalosjos v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> <i>(Jalosjos</i>), the Court had illumined that while the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of one's CoC generally necessitates the exercise of the COMELEC's quasi-judicial functions commenced through a petition based <b><u>on either Sections 12 or 78 of the OEC, or Section 40 of the LGC</u>, <i><u>when the grounds therefor are rendered conclusive on account of final and executorv judgments, as in this case, such exercise falls within the COMELEC's administrative functions.</u></i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> To note, the choice as to which action to commence belongs to the petitioner:<br><br><blockquote>What is indisputably clear is that the false material representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under Section 78. However, since the false material representation arises from a crime penalized by <i>prisión mayor, </i>a petition under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed. The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to adopt belongs to the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As petitioner's disqualification to run for public office pursuant to the final and executory OMB rulings dismissing him from service now stands beyond dispute,<u><b> <i>it is incumbent upon the COMELEC to cancel petitioner's CoC as a matter of course</i></b></u><b><i>,</i></b><i> </i>else it be remiss in fulfilling its Constitutional duty to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court finds no merit to petitioner's claim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of denial of due process because even though the special circumstance extant herein calls for the outright cancellation of his CoC in the exercise of the COMELEC's administrative function, it even allowed him to submit his Verified Answer <i>cum </i>Memorandum to explain his side, and to file a motion for reconsideration from its resolution.<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>III.</b></div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b><u>Petitioner's re-election as <i>Punong Barangav </i>of Brgy. Pulung Maragul in the 2013 Barangay Elections cannot operate as a condonation of his alleged misconduct.</u> </b></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>In <i>Carpio Morales, </i>the Court abandoned the "condonation doctrine," explaining that "[e]lection is not a mode of condoning an administrative offense, and there is simply no constitutional or statutory basis in our jurisdiction to support the notion that an official elected for a different term is fully absolved of any administrative liability arising from an offense done during a prior term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Although <i>Carpio Morales </i>clarified that such abandonment should be prospectively applied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (thus, treating the condonation doctrine as "good law" when the COMELEC's petition was commenced on October 29, 2013, and when petitioner filed his Verified Answer <i>cum </i>Memorandum invoking the same), the parameters for the operation of such doctrine simply do not obtain in petitioner's favor.<br><br>Prior to <i>Carpio Morales,</i> the Court, in the 1996 case of <i> Reyes v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><i> (Reyes),</i> had illumined that the rationale in the <i>Aguinaldo</i> cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> was hinged on the expiration of the term of office during which the misconduct was committed before a decision could be rendered in the administrative case seeking the candidate's removal. As such, his or her re-election bars removal for said misconduct since removal cannot extend beyond the term when the misconduct was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <i>Reyes</i> likewise noted that the <i>Aguinaldo</i> cases involved a misconduct committed prior to the enactment of the LGC, and there was no existing provision similar to Section 40 (b), disqualifying a person from running for any elective local position as a consequence of his removal from office as a result of an administrative case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, it rejected petitioner's invocation of the condonation doctrine, holding that:<br><br><blockquote><i>Second. </i>The next question is whether the reelection of petitioner rendered the administrative charges against him moot and academic. Petitioner invokes the ruling in <i>Aguinaldo v. COMELEC </i>[(see supra note 31)], in which it was held that a public official could not be removed for misconduct committed during a prior term and that his reelection operated as a condonation of the officer's previous misconduct to the extent of cutting off the right to remove him therefor. But that was because in that case, <b>before the petition questioning the validity of the administrative decision removing petitioner could be decided, the term of office during which the alleged misconduct was committed expired. Removal cannot extend beyond the term during which the alleged misconduct was committed. If a public official is not removed before his term of office expires, he can no longer be removed if he is thereafter reelected for another term.</b> This is the rationale for the ruling in the two <i>Aguinaldo </i>cases.<br><br>The case at bar is the very opposite of those cases. Here, although petitioner Reyes brought an action to question the decision in the administrative case, the temporary restraining order issued in the action he brought lapsed, with the result that <b>the decision was served on petitioner and it thereafter became final on April 3, 1995, because petitioner failed to appeal to the Office of the President. He was thus validly removed from office and, pursuant to Section 40 (b) of the Local Government Code, he was disqualified from running for reelection.</b><br><br>It is noteworthy that at the time the <i>Aguinaldo </i>cases were decided there was no provision similar to Section 40 (b) which disqualifies any person from running for any elective position on the ground that he has been removed as a result of an administrative case. The Local Government Code of 1991 x x x could not be given retroactive effect. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>x x x x (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>In this case, the OMB rulings dismissing petitioner for Grave Misconduct had already attained finality on May 28, 2010, which date was even prior to his first election as Punong Barangay of Brgy. Pulung Maragul in the October 2010 Barangay Elections. As above-stated, "[t]he penalty of dismissal [from service] shall carry with it that of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for re-employment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Although the principal penalty of dismissal appears to have not been effectively implemented (since petitioner was even able to run and win for two [2] consecutive elections), the corresponding accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office had already rendered him ineligible to run for any elective local position. Bearing the same sense as its criminal law counterpart,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[66]</sup></font> the term perpetual in this administrative penalty should likewise connote a lifetime restriction and is not dependent on the term of any principal penalty. It is undisputable that this accessory penalty sprung from the same final OMB rulings, and therefore had already attached and consequently, remained effective at the time petitioner filed his CoC on October 11, 2013 and his later re-election in 2013.
