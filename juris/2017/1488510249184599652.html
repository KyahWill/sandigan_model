The court may consider - in addition to the complaint - the appended annexes or documents, other pleadings of the plaintiff, or admissions in the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br></blockquote>The 1991 Petition is compliant with the requirements stated in law and jurisprudence.

Republic</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> that "whenever any public officer or employee has acquired during his incumbency an amount of property which is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer or employee and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property, said property shall be presumed <i>prima facie</i> to have been unlawfully acquired."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Petitioners failed to satisfactorily show that the properties were lawfully acquired; hence, the <i>prima facie</i> presumption that they were unlawfully acquired prevails.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan also properly ruled that there was no inconsistency or incongruity between Republic's Request for Admission and Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Indeed, we have held that a request for admission can be the basis for the grant of summary judgment. The request can be the basis therefor when its subject is deemed to have been admitted by the party and is requested as a result of that party's failure to respond to the court's directive to state what specifically happened in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> The resort to such a request as a mode of discovery rendered all the matters contained therein as matters that have been deemed admitted pursuant to Rule 26, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>On the basis of respondent Imelda Marcos's letter dated 25 May 2009; respondents' Answer to the 1991 Petition, which was considered to be a "negative pregnant" in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>; and respondents' failure to timely respond to petitioner's Request for Admission, the Sandiganbayan thus correctly granted the Motion for Summary Judgment of the Republic.<br><br>A careful scrutiny of the three bases used by the Sandiganbayan in justifying the absence of a genuine issue and eventually granting the Motion for Pmtial Summary Judgment leads us to no other course of action but to affirm the ruling of the Sandiganbayan. The <i>prima facie</i> presumption on unlawfully acquired property indeed finds application on the first basis. Section 2 of R.A. 1379 provides that "[w]henever any public officer or employee has acquired during his incumbency an amount of property which is manifestly out of propmtion to his salary as such public officer or employee and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property, said property shall be presumed <i>prima facie</i> to have been unlawfully acquired." And in this regard, the Sandiganbayan had taken judicial notice of the legitimate income of the Marcoses during their incumbency as public officers for the period 1966-1986 which was pegged at USD 304,372.43.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>With respect to the second basis the Answer to the 1991 Petition the denial of the Marcoses cannot be considered a specific denial because similar to their denial in the Arelma case, in which insisted that they were not privy to the transactions, the Marcoses gave "the same stock answer to the effect that [they] did not engage in any illegal activities, and that all their properties were lawfully acquired."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> That they were not privy to the actual data in the possession of the PCGG and the Solicitor General is simply a line of defense which necessarily results in their failure to allege the lawfulness of the mode of acquiring the property subject of forfeiture, considering the amount of their lawful income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> As in the Arelma case, the Marcoses are deemed to have admitted that the Malacañang Collection itemized in the annexes were found in the palace and subsequently proven to have been owned by Mrs. Marcos as she admitted in her letter dated 25 May 2009.<br><br>In light of the third basis, the factual antecedents of the case bear restating. The Republic filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment dated 24 June 2009, after which it filed and served a Request for Admission on 3 July 2009. Afterwards, it submitted a Supplement to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment dated 14 July 2009. On 28 July 2009, the Marcoses filed their Manifestation and Preliminary Comments. The Sandiganbayan noted the objection they had raised in their Manifestation and Preliminary Comments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> In that manner, rather than declaring that the matters raised in the Request for Admission were deemed admitted, the Sandiganbayan instead ruled on the objection raised by the Marcoses. In short, it ruled that the Request for Admission was not inconsistent with the motion for summary judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> The Sandiganbayan reasoned that there was no inconsistency between the two. It said that a request for admission may even complement a summary judgment in that the request for admission may be used as basis for filing a motion for summary judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> It then denied the Manifestation and Preliminary Comments and Manifestation and Motion to Expunge filed by the Marcoses relative to the Republic's Request for Admission. Thereafter, it required the Marcoses to file and serve their sworn answer to the Request for Admission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> The Marcoses filed numerous pleadings, but none of these was made in response to the Request for Admission as required by Rule 26, Section 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> of the Rules of Court until the Sandiganbayan eventually issued the Partial Summary Judgment dated 13 January 2014 and the Resolution dated 11 June 2014.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan ruled that "a request for admission may even complement a summary judgment in that the request for admission may be used as basis for filing a summary judgment"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> citing three cases as follows: <i>Concrete Aggregates Corp. v.

CA</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> The first case instructs that a request for admission "should set forth relevant evidentiary matters of fact, or documents described in and exhibited with the request, whose purpose is to establish said party's cause of action or defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>The second case, on the other hand, teaches the nature of modes of discovery in this wise:<br><blockquote>Particularly as regards request for admission under Rule 26 of the Rules of Court, the law ordains that when a party is served with a written request that he admit: (1) the genuineness of any material and relevant document described in and exhibited with the request, or (2) the truth of any material and relevant matter of fact set forth in the request, said party is bound within the period designated in the request, to file and serve on the party requesting the admission a <i>sworn statement</i> either (10) denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or (2) setting forth in details the reasons why he cannot truthfully either admit or deny those matters. If the party served does not respond with such sworn statement, <i>each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted</i>.<br><br>In this case, the Dimans' request for admission was duly served by registered mail on Jose Lacalle on February 6, 1995, and a copy thereof on his lawyers on February 4, 1995. Neither made any response whatever within the reglementary period. Nor did either of them do so even after receiving copy of the Dimans' "MANIFESTATION WITH MOTION TO REQUIRE PLAINTIFFS TO ANSWER REQUEST FOR ADMISSION." dated March 28, 1995. On account thereof, in legal contemplation, the Heirs impliedly admitted all the facts listed in the request for admission.<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>On the other hand, in the case of a summary judgment, issues apparently exist - i.e., facts are asserted in the complaint regarding which there is as yet no admission, disavowal or qualification; or specific denials or atllnnative defenses are in truth set out in the answer - but <i>the issues thus arising from the pleadings are sham, fictitious, not genuine, as shown by admissions, depositions or admissions</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The third case demonstrates how failure to answer the request for admission within the period resulted in the admission of the matters stated therein. The Court, in that case, specifically ruled:<br><blockquote>The burden of affirmative action is on the party upon whom notice is served to avoid the admission rather than upon the party seeking the admission. Hence, when petitioner failed to reply to a request to admit, it may not argue that the adverse party has the burden of proving the facts sought to be admitted. Petitioners silence is an admission of the facts stated in the request.<br><br>This Court finds that the motion for summary judgment filed by respondent CHERRY VALLEY on the ground that there were no questions of fact in issue since the material allegations of the complaint were not disputed was correctly granted by the trial court. It is a settled rule that summary judgment may be granted if the facts which stand admitted by reason of a partys failure to deny statements contained in a request for admission show that no material issue of fact exists. By its failure to answer the other partys request for admission, petitioner has admitted all the material facts necessary for judgment against itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners claim that there has been a lack of observance of due process;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> that "there has been no trial or hearing";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> and that "petitioners were shamefully never given an opportunity to show that the questioned properties may have been lawfully acquired through other means."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> We find the invocation of lack of observance of due process at this stage of the proceedings rather belated, especially when it was never invoked before the Sandiganbayan. Needless to say, the various pleadings petitioners have filed in this case and in other cases involving the Marcos properties were countless occasions when they could have proven that the Malacañang Collection had indeed been lawfully acquired as claimed. They allege that they were denied due process by not being given any opportunity to prove their lawful acquisition of the Malacañang Collection. This allegation cannot be given credence for being utterly baseless.<br><br>The complete records of Civil Case No. 0141 - a total of 35 volumes along with 2 envelopes containing exhibits and 1 envelope containing the transcripts of stenographic notes - have been forwarded to this Court by the Sandiganbayan.
