Petitioner did not comply.<br><br>Petitioner would argue however that while the verification still stated "belief," it was qualified by "based on authentic records." Hence, "the statement implies that the contents of the petition were based not only on the pleader's belief but ultimately they are recitals from authentic records."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The amendment to Section 4, Rule 7 entirely removed any reference to "belief' as basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is to ensure that the pleading is anchored on facts and not on imagination or speculation, and is filed in good faith.<br><br>In <i>Go v.

Otherwise, the pleading is treated as unsigned which produces no legal effect. The court, though, in its discretion, may give the party a chance to remedy the insufficiency. Thus:<br><blockquote>Clearly, the amendment was introduced in order to make the verification requirement stricter, such that the party cannot now merely state under oath that he believes the statements made in the pleading. He cannot even merely state under oath that he has knowledge that such statements are true and correct. His knowledge must be specifically alleged under oath to be either <i>personal knowledge</i> or at least based on authentic records.<br><br>Unlike, however, the requirement for a Certification against Forum Shopping in Section 5, wherein failure to comply with the requirements is not curable by amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading, Section 4 of Rule 7, as amended, states that the effect of the failure to properly verify a pleading is that the pleading shall be treated as unsigned:<br><blockquote><b>A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification</b> based on "information and belief'', or <b>upon "knowledge, information and belief'</b>, or lacks a proper verification, <b>shall be treated as an unsigned pleading</b>.<br></blockquote>Unsigned pleadings are discussed in the immediately preceding section of Rule 7:<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Signature and address</i>. - . . . . <br><blockquote>. . .<br></blockquote><blockquote>An unsigned pleading produces no legal effect. However, the court <i><b>may, in its discretion</b></i>, allow such deficiency to be remedied if it shall appear that the same was due to mere inadvertence and not intended for delay. Counsel who deliberately files an unsigned pleading, or signs a pleading in violation of this Rule, or alleges scandalous or indecent matter therein, or fails to promptly report to the court a change of his address, shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

Immunities and privileges will cease to apply to taxpayers who, in their SALN, were proven to have understated their net worth by 30% or more.<br><br><blockquote>This clarification, however, does not mean that the amnesty taxpayers would go scot-free in case they substantially understate the amounts of their net worth in their SALN. The 2007 Tax Amnesty Law imposes a resolutory condition insofar as the enjoyment of immunities and privileges under the law is concerned. Pursuant to Section 4 of the law, third parties may initiate proceedings contesting the declared amount of net worth of the amnesty taxpayer within one year following the date of the filing of the tax amnesty return and the SALN. Section 6 then states that "All these immunities and privileges shall not apply ... where the amount of net worth as of December 31, 2005 is proven to be understated to the extent of thirty percent (30%) or more, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 hereof." Accordingly, Section 10 provides that amnesty taxpayers who willfully understate their net worth shall be (a) liable for perjury under the Revised Penal Code; and (b) subject to immediate tax fraud investigation in order to collect all taxes due and to criminally prosecute those found to have willfully evaded lawful taxes due.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </blockquote>Thus, the amnesty granted under the law is revoked once the taxpayer is proven to have under-declared his assets in his SALN by 30% or more. Pursuant to Section 10<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[60] </sup></font>of the Tax Amnesty Law, amnesty taxpayers who wilfully understate their net worth shall not only be liable for perjury under the Revised Penal Code, but, upon conviction, also subject to immediate tax fraud investigation in order to collect all taxes due and to criminally prosecute for tax evasion.<br><br>Here, the requisites to overturn the presumption of correctness of respondent's 2005 SALN were not met.<br><br>Respondent filed its Tax Amnesty documents on January 25, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Since then, and up to the time of the filing of respondent's Motion to Cancel Tax Assessment on April 17, 2009, there had been no proceeding initiated to question its declared amount of net worth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Petitioner never alleged, before the Court of Tax Appeals and this Court, the existence of any such proceeding to challenge respondent's 2005 SALN during this period.
