Atabay, Hilongos, Leyte, within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, maliciously, willfully, unlawfully, and intentionally, beat with the use of a belt, pinched, and strangulated the child victim [AAA], who was then eight (8) years old, thereby inflicting physical injuries that affected the normal development of the said child victim.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Lucido pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On August 10, 2008, the pre-trial was held.

His findings were as follows:<br><blockquote>Multiple abrasions on different parts of the body secondary to pricking<br>nail marks/scratches<br>There is redness on the peripheral circumference of the hymen<br>No hymenal laceration noted.<br>There is weakness of (L) knee joint upon walking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>After the prosecution rested its case, the defense presented Lucido, Lucia Mancio Lusuegro (Lusuegro), and Estrella L. Sanchez (Sanchez) as witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The Court of Appeals summarized their testimonies as follows:<br><blockquote>[Lucido] denied that she pinched, beat and hit AAA and that she inserted her finger into AAA's vagina. She claimed that she usually cleaned AAA's vagina and bathed her with hot water. She, likewise, denied that she brought AAA to Bato for sexual intercourse. [Lucido] impute[d] ill motive on Hinampas, whom she claimed to be her enemy, in instituting the complaint against her.<br><br>Lucia Mancio Lusuegro ... a neighbor of [Lucido] and AAA's parents at Brgy. Atabay, Hilongos, Leyte, testified that she heard AAA cry only once outside the house of [Lucido]. She never heard any commotion that [Lucido] maltreated AAA.<br><br>Estrella Sanchez ... testified that the accusation of child abuse and prostitution was not true. She claimed that the filing of the case against [Lucido] was instigated by Hinampas, with whom [Lucido] had a quarrel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>On June 27, 2011, the Regional Trial Court rendered a Decision, convicting Lucido of child abuse, as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, accused ANTON1ETA LUCIDO alyas "Tonyay" is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in violation of Section 10 (a) of Republic Act No. 7610 and hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Prision Mayor in its minimum period (SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY to EIGHT (8) YEARS imprisonment), and to pay the offended party [AAA] Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals affirmed Lucido's conviction, but modified the penalty imposed by applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The dispositive portion of the Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED. The Decision, dated 27 June 2011, of the Regional Trial Court of Hilongos[,] Leyte, 8<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Branch 18 in Criminal Case No. H-1675 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, to wit:<br><br>(a) the appellant Antonieta Lucido @ "Tonyay" is hereby sentenced to four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) days of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum;<br><br>(b) an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be applied to the award of moral damages to be reckoned from this date until fully paid;<br><br>(c) the bondsman is ordered to surrender the appellant to the court <i>a quo</i>, within ten (10) days from notice and to report to this Court the fact of surrender, within ten (10) days from notice of such fact;<br><br>(d) in case of non-surrender, the Regional Trial Court of Hilongos[,] Leyte, 8<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Branch 18 is DIRECTED to:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(i) cancel the bond posted for the provisional liberty of the appellant;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) order the arrest of the appellant; and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) immediately commit the appellant to the Bureau of Prisons.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>Lucido's Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied in the Court of Appeals March 13, 2015 Resolution.<br><br>Hence, this Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was filed on May 20, 2015. This Court received respondent's Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> on November 23, 2015.<br><br>Petitioner raises the following issues for this Court's resolution:<br><br>1. whether the Court of Appeals erred in sustaining her conviction despite the failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and<br><br>2. whether the Court of Appeals erred in not finding that the crime committed was only slight physical injuries and not a violation of Republic Act No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that the prosecution failed to prove "that the physical injuries inflicted on the child had prejudiced the child's development so as to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being." She cites the absence of an expert opinion validating scientifically that the acts complained of proximately caused the "prejudice inflicted upon the child's development."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, petitioner argues that the prosecution was not able to prove the infliction of physical injuries on the child. She avers that Hinampas' testimony of having heard the victim being maltreated several times by Lucido is incredible, exaggerated, and unworthy of belief. First, the victim's own father, whose house was about five (5) meters away from Lucido's house, never testified that he heard the maltreatment done by Lucido upon his own daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Second, two (2) defense witnesses who were neighbors of Lucido testified that they did not hear any noise that would indicate Lucido's maltreatment of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that the charge against her was ill-motivated. She highlights the ongoing enmity between her and Hinampas, one (1) of the witnesses for the prosecution. Petitioner also imputes ill-motive on AAA in falsely testifying against her after having been scolded for damaging petitioner's cellphone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioner asserts that the prosecution failed to prove that the acts alleged in the information—beating using a belt, pinching, and strangulating AAA—were intended to "debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Citing <i>Bongalon v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> petitioner contends that she could not be convicted of child abuse but only of slight physical injuries defined and punished under the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent argues that the petition must be denied because it raises questions of fact, which could not be done in a petition for review under Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>This Court denies the petition.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The issues submitted by petitioner—the prosecution's failure to prove that the abuse suffered by the victim had prejudiced her normal development and want of credibility of the prosecution witnesses—are fundamentally factual. However, this Court is not a trier of facts. As a rule, "only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>It is not the function of this Court to review and weigh anew the evidence already passed upon by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals absent any showing of arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Petitioner did not present any substantive or compelling reason for this Court to apply the exception in this case.<br><br>Even if this Court disregards this infirmity, the petition still fails to impress. This Court finds no reversible error in the Court of Appeals Decision affirming petitioner's conviction for child abuse.<br><br>It is a fact that when the incident happened, the victim was a child entitled to the protection extended by Republic Act No. 7610, as mandated by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, petitioner was properly charged and found guilty of violating Article VI, Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610, which reads:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VI<br>OTHER ACTS OF ABUSE<br></center><br>Section 10. <i>Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development.</i> <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Any person who shall commit any other acts of <i>child abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development</i> including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period. (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Article I, Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 defines <i>child abuse</i> as the maltreatment of a child, whether habitual or not, including <i>any</i> of the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Psychological and <em><strong>physical abuse</strong></em>, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Unreasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as food and shelter; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Failure to immediately give medical treatment to an injured child resulting in serious impairment of his growth and development or in his permanent incapacity or death. (Emphasis supplied)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As defined in the law, child abuse includes physical abuse of the child, whether it is habitual or not. Petitioner's acts fall squarely within this definition.<br><br>AAA testified on the physical abuse she suffered in the hands of petitioner. The Regional Trial Court described her narration of the facts to be in "a straightforward, credible and spontaneous manner which could not be defeated by the denial of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> From the appearance of the victim, the trial court likewise observed physical evidence of the abuses and ill-treatment inflicted by the petitioner on AAA aside from the victim's psychological displacement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> AAA's testimony was further corroborated by Dr. Abierra, who noted several observations during his physical examination of the victim. First, there were "multiple abrasions on different parts of [AAA's] body."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Additionally, he observed a "redness on the peripheral circumference of the hymen," which could have been caused by a hard pinching.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Finally, there was an evident "weakness on the left knee joint," which could have been caused by the victim falling to the ground or being beaten by a hard object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's bare imputations of ill motive on Hinampas and AAA deserve scant consideration. This defense had been judiciously taken into account and rejected by the trial court, in light of the clear, consistent, and positive testimonies of AAA, Dr. Abierra, and FFF. As aptly observed by the trial court, Hinampas "ha[d] no control over the intelligence and will of the victim and the parents in testifying against [petitioner]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> A child witness like AAA, who spoke in a clear, positive, and convincing manner and remained consistent on cross-examination, is a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Motive becomes inconsequential when there is a categorical declaration from the victim, which establishes the liability of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the inconsistencies relied upon by petitioner are trivial and do not minimize the value of the prosecution witnesses' testimonies. The fact that the victim's father did not mention in his testimony that he had heard any sound that would indicate Lucido's maltreatment of his daughter does not render impossible the positive declaration of the victim as to the abuses she suffered. On the other hand, defense witness Sanchez's testimony is hardly credible because she was no longer residing in Brgy. Atabay in 2007, when AAA was living with Lucido.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Further, contrary to petitioner's assertion, the other defense witness, Lusuegro, testified that she heard AAA cry when the latter was staying with Lucido.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the trial court's assessment on the trustworthiness of AAA and Hinampas will not be disturbed, absent any facts or circumstances of real weight which might have been overlooked, misappreciated, or misunderstood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Through its firsthand observations during the entire proceedings, the trial court can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion, whose testimony to accept and which witness to believe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Petitioner further insists that the prosecution failed to prove that the acts complained of were prejudicial to the victim's development.<br><br>This Court disagrees.<br><br>Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 punishes four (4) distinct offenses, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> (a) child abuse, (b) child cruelty, (c) child exploitation, and (d) being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, the element that the acts must be prejudicial to the child's development pertains only to the fourth offense. Thus:<br><blockquote>Instructive is <i>Araneta v. People</i> which held, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>As gleaned from the foregoing, the provision punishes not only those enumerated under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, but also four distinct acts, <i>i.e.</i>, (a) child abuse, (b) child cruelty, (c) child exploitation and (d) being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development. The Rules and Regulations of the questioned statute distinctly and separately defined child abuse, cruelty and exploitation just to show that these three acts are different from one another and from the act prejudicial to the child's development. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, <i>an accused can be prosecuted and be convicted under Section 10(a), Article VI of Republic Act No. 7610 if he commits any of the four acts therein</i>. The prosecution need not prove that the acts of child abuse, child cruelty and child exploitation have resulted in the prejudice of the child because an act prejudicial to the development of the child is different from the former acts.<br><br>Moreover, it is a rule in statutory construction that the word "or" is a disjunctive term signifying dissociation and independence of one thing from other things enumerated. It should, as a rule, be construed in the sense which it ordinarily implies. Hence, the use of "or" in Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 before the phrase "<i>be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development</i>" supposes that there are four punishable acts therein. First, the <i>act of child abuse</i>; second, <i>child cruelty</i>; third, <i>child exploitation</i>; and fourth, <i>being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development</i>. The fourth penalized act cannot be interpreted, as petitioner suggests, as a qualifying condition for the three other acts, because an analysis of the entire context of the questioned provision does not warrant such construal.<br></blockquote>Contrary to the proposition of the appellant, the prosecution need <i>not</i> prove that the acts of child abuse, child cruelty and child exploitation have resulted in the prejudice of the child because an act prejudicial to the development of the child is different from the former acts. The element of resulting <i>prejudice to the child's development</i> cannot be interpreted as a qualifying condition to the other acts of child abuse, child cruelty and child exploitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Strangulating, severely pinching, and beating an eight (8)-year-old child to cause her to limp are intrinsically cruel and excessive. These acts of abuse impair the child's dignity and worth as a human being and infringe upon her right to grow up in a safe, wholesome, and harmonious place. It is not difficult to perceive that this experience of repeated physical abuse from petitioner would prejudice the child's social, moral, and emotional development.<br><br>Petitioner's contention that she should only be convicted for slight physical injuries in light of the ruling in <i>Bongalon v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> is likewise untenable.<br><br>The facts in <i>Bongalon</i> are markedly different from this case. In <i>Bongalon</i>, a father was overwhelmed by his parental concern for the personal safety of his own minor daughters who had just suffered harm at the hands of the minor complainant and hit the minor complainant's back with his hand and slapped his left cheek.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Here, AAA was maltreated by petitioner through repeated acts of strangulation, pinching, and beating. These are clearly extreme measures of punishment not commensurate with the discipline of an eight (8)-year-old child. Discipline is a loving response that seeks the positive welfare of a child. Petitioner's actions are diametrically opposite. They are abusive, causing not only physical injuries as evidenced by the physical marks on different parts of AAA's body and the weakness of her left knee upon walking, but also emotional trauma on her.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared to provide a strong deterrence against child abuse and exploitation and to give a special protection to children from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It must be stressed that the crime under Republic Act No. 7610 is <i>malum prohibitum</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Hence, the <i>intent to debase, degrade, or demean</i> the minor is not the defining mark. Any act of punishment that debases, degrades, and demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child constitutes the offense.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
