				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The period to redeem a property sold in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale is not extendible. A pending action to annul the foreclosure sale does not toll the running of the one (1)-year period of redemption under Act No. 3135.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> directly filed before this Court, assailing the Judgment on the Pleadings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated April 13, 2010 and Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated September 2, 2010 rendered by Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City in Civil Case No. CEB-33639. The trial court dismissed the Complaint filed by Makilito B. Mahinay (Mahinay), declaring that he already lost his right to redeem a parcel of land sold in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The parcel of land, with an area of 3,616 square meters and located in Barrio Kiot, Cebu City, was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 111078 under the name of A&amp;A Swiss International Commercial, Inc. (A&amp;A Swiss).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The property was mortgaged to Dura Tire and Rubber Industries, Inc. (Dura Tire), a corporation engaged in the supply of raw materials for tire processing and recapping, as security for credit purchases to be made by Move Overland Venture and Exploring, Inc. (Move Overland).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Under the mortgage agreement, Dura Tire was given the express authority to extrajudicially foreclose the property should Move Overland fail to pay its credit purchases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On June 5, 1992, A&amp;A Swiss sold the property to Mahinay for the sum of P540,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the Deed of Absolute Sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Mahinay acknowledged that the property had been previously mortgaged by A&amp;A Swiss to Dura Tire, holding himself liable for any claims that Dura Tire may have against Move Overland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On August 21, 1994, Mahinay wrote Dura Tire, requesting a statement of account of Move Overland's credit purchases. Mahinay sought to pay Move Overland's obligation to release the property from the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Dura Tire, however, ignored Mahinay's request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For Move Overland's failure to pay its credit purchases, Dura Tire applied for extrajudicial foreclosure of the property on January 6, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Mahinay protested the impending sale and filed a third-party claim before the Office of the Provincial Sheriff of Cebu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Despite the protest, Sheriff Romeo Laurel (Sheriff Laurel) proceeded with the sale and issued a Certificate of Sale in favor of Dura Tire, the highest bidder at the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The property was purchased at P950,000.00, and the Certificate of Sale was registered on February 20, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On March 23, 1995, Mahinay filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> for specific performance and annulment of auction sale before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City. According to Mahinay, there was no proof that Dura Tire supplied raw materials to Move Overland after the property was mortgaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Mahinay added that Dura Tire allegedly deprived him of the opportunity to release the property from the mortgage by failing to furnish him with Move Overland's statement of account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Dura Tire, therefore, had no right to foreclose the mortgage and the foreclosure sale was void.<br><br>In its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Dura Tire mainly argued that Mahinay had no cause of action to file the Complaint to annul the foreclosure sale since he was not privy to the mortgage agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Acting on Dura Tire's affirmative defense, Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City initially dismissed the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> However, on mandamus and certiorari, the Court of Appeals set aside the order of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The case was then re-raffled to Branch 12 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>After pre-trial proceedings, the trial court again ordered the dismissal of the Complaint due to Mahinay's failure to prosecute the case. However, upon Mahinay's Motion for Reconsideration, the case was reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The case was again re-raffled, this time to Branch 58.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> After due proceedings, the trial court ultimately dismissed Mahinay's Complaint in the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated July 29, 2004. The trial court held that Dura Tire was entitled to foreclose the property because of Move Overland's unpaid credit purchases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Mahinay's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals in the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated June 16, 2006. The Court of Appeals held that Mahinay had no right to question the foreclosure of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Mahinay, as "substitute mortgagor,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was fully aware that the property he purchased from A&amp;A Swiss was previously mortgaged to Dura Tire to answer for Move Overland's obligation. Considering that Move Overland failed to pay for its credit purchases, Dura Tire had every right to foreclose the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Mahinay filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> before this Court. In G.R. No. 173117, this Court denied Mahinay's Petition as well as his Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The June 16, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals thus became final and executory on August 8, 2007, 15 days after Mahinay received a copy of the Resolution denying his Motion for Reconsideration filed before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Relying on the Court of Appeals' finding that he was a "substitute mortgagor," Mahinay filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> for judicial declaration of right to redeem on August 24, 2007. "As the admitted owner of the [property] at the time of the foreclosure,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Mahinay argued that he "must have possessed and still continues to possess the absolute right to redeem the [property]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Dura Tire answered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Complaint, raising the affirmative defense of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>. Dura Tire argued that the Complaint for judicial declaration of right to redeem had identical parties, subject matter, and causes of action with that of the Complaint for annulment of foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Furthermore, the period of Mahinay's right of redemption had already lapsed. Therefore, Mahinay could not be allowed to belatedly redeem the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>During the hearing on October 27, 2008, Mahinay and Dura Tire jointly moved for a judgment on the pleadings. The trial court granted the motion and deemed the case submitted for decision after the filing of memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Mahinay having acquired the property from A&amp;A Swiss before Dura Tire foreclosed the property, the trial court ruled that Mahinay became a "successor-in-interest" to the property even before the foreclosure sale. Therefore, by operation of law, Mahinay was legally entitled to redeem the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> However, considering that one (1) year period of redemption had already lapsed, Mahinay could no longer exercise his right of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Despite Dura Tire's refusal to accept his offer to pay Move Overland's unpaid credit purchases, the trial court said that "there was nothing to stop [Mahinay] from redeeming the property as soon as he became aware of the foreclosure sale. [Mahinay] could have . . . filed an action to compel [Dura Tire] to accept payment by way of redemption."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Hence, in the Judgment on the Pleadings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated April 13, 2010, Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City dismissed Mahinay's Complaint for judicial declaration of right to redeem. The dispositive portion of the Judgment read:<br><blockquote>Upon the foregoing considerations, the court finds no factual and legal basis to grant the plaintiffs plea to be allowed to redeem the foreclosed property subject of this case.<br><br>IN CONSEQUENCE, Judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the plaintiffs Complaint.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Mahinay filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the trial court denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated September 2, 2010.<br><br>On a pure question of law, Mahinay directly filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> before this Court. Dura Tire filed its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> to which Mahinay filed a Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Mahinay maintains that he should be allowed to redeem the property he bought from A&amp;A Swiss despite the lapse of one (1) year from the registration of the Certificate of Sale on February 20, 1995. Mahinay primarily argues that the one (1)-year period of redemption was tolled when he filed the Complaint for annulment of foreclosure sale on March 23, 1995 and resumed when the June 16, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals became final and executory on August 8, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As basis, Mahinay cites <i>Consolidated Bank &amp; Trust Corp. v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In the alternative, Mahinay contends that the one (1)-year period of redemption should be counted from the time the June 16, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals became final and executory on August 8, 2007. Mahinay theorizes that his right of redemption only arose when he was judicially declared "entitled to redeem the property" in this decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Since he filed his Complaint for judicial declaration of right to redeem on August 24, 2007, only 16 days after August 8, 2007, Mahinay claims that he exercised his right of redemption within the one (1)-year period under Act No. 3135.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Dura Tire counters that nothing prevented Mahinay from exercising his right of redemption within one (1) year from the registration of the Certificate of Sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Dura Tire argues that Mahinay's filing of an action for annulment of foreclosure sale did not toll the running of the redemption period because the law does not allow its extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Since the one (1)-year period of redemption already lapsed, Dura Tire maintains that Mahinay can no longer redeem the property at the bid price paid by the purchaser.<br><br>The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether the one (1)-year period of redemption was tolled when Mahinay filed his Complaint for annulment of foreclosure sale.<br><br>This Petition must be denied.<br><br>Contrary to Mahinay's claim, his right to redeem the mortgaged property did not arise from the Court of Appeals' "judicial declaration" that he was a "substitute mortgagor" of A&amp;A Swiss. By force of law, specifically, Section 6 of Act No. 3135, Mahinay's right to redeem arose when the mortgaged property was extrajudicially foreclosed and sold at public auction. There is no dispute that Mahinay had a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage. Consequently, he had the right to buy it back from the purchaser at the sale, Dura Tire in this case, "from and at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale." Section 6 of Act No. 3135<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Section 6. In all cases in which an extrajudicial sale is made under the special power hereinbefore referred to, the debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold, may redeem the same at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale; and such redemption shall be governed by the provisions of sections four hundred and sixty-four to four hundred and sixty-six, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.<br></blockquote>The "date of the sale" referred to in Section 6 is the date the certificate of sale is registered with the Register of Deeds. This is because the sale of registered land does not "'take effect as a conveyance, or bind the land' until it is registered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The right of redemption being statutory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the mortgagor may compel the purchaser to sell back the property within the one (1)-year period under Act No. 3135. If the purchaser refuses to sell back the property, the mortgagor may tender payment to the Sheriff who conducted the foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Here, Mahinay should have tendered payment to Sheriff Laurel instead of insisting on directly paying Move Overland's unpaid credit purchases to Dura Tire.<br><br>As early as 1956, this Court held in <i>Mateo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> that "the right of redemption . . . must . . . be exercised in the mode prescribed by the statute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The one (1)-year period of redemption is fixed, hence, non-extendible, to "avoid prolonged economic uncertainty over the ownership of the thing sold."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Since the period of redemption is fixed, it cannot be tolled or interrupted by the filing of cases to annul the foreclosure sale or to enforce the right of redemption. "To rule otherwise . . . would constitute a dangerous precedent. A likely offshoot of such a ruling is the institution of frivolous suits for annulment of mortgage intended merely to give the mortgagor more time to redeem the mortgaged property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In <i>CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Rosario Sandejas (Sandejas) mortgaged two (2) parcels of land in favor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands. She subsequently mortgaged the same parcels of land to CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. In 1971, CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. extrajudicially foreclosed the properties, which were sold at a public auction. The certificate of sale was registered on May 19, 1971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>More than a year after the registration of the Certificate of Sale, or on November 15, 1972, Sandejas wrote the president of the CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc., requesting for three (3) years within which to redeem the properties she mortgaged to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The president allegedly agreed, even giving her five (5) more years to redeem the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>However, on February 2, 1973, first mortgagee Bank of the Philippine Islands extrajudicially foreclosed the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Despite the third-party claim and action for quieting of title filed by Sandejas, the Sheriff proceeded with the public auction with Carolina Industries, Inc. emerging as the highest bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The certificate of sale was issued to Carolina Industries, Inc. and was registered on December 16, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The action for quieting of title was ultimately resolved in favor of CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. In G.R. No. 101351, this Court held that CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. was "the real owner" of the properties, not Sandejas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Nine (9) years after the registration of the Certificate of Sale in favor of Carolina Industries, or on December 15, 1992, CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. tendered P2,341,166.48 as redemption money with the Clerk of Court. It then filed with the trial court a motion to require the Sheriff to execute a certificate of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The trial court, however, denied the motion, reasoning the right of redemption of CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. had already lapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>This Court affirmed the trial court's decision. On whether the quieting of title action filed by Sandejas tolled the running of the one (1)-year period of redemption, this Court ruled in the negative. According to this Court, "the issue of ownership insofar as [CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc.'s] right of redemption as judgment debtor is concerned, has no bearing whatsoever, so as have the effect of tolling or interrupting the running of the 12-month redemption period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> This Court noted that the decision on the quieting of title case would only affect Sandejas' title to the property.<br><br>In <i>Spouses Pahang v. Judge Vestil</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> where spouses Antonio and Lolita Pahang (the Spouses Pahang) were represented by Mahinay's law firm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Spouses Pahang loaned P1,500,000.00 from Metrobank and mortgaged a parcel of land as security for the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> When the Spouses Pahang failed to pay their loan, Metrobank extrajudicially foreclosed the property. At the public sale, Metrobank emerged as the highest bidder and a corresponding certificate of sale was issued to it. The Certificate of Sale was registered on January 27, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>On December 29, 1998, Metrobank wrote the Spouses Pahang to remind them of the expiration of their right of redemption on January 27, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Ignoring Metrobank's note, the Spouses Pahang instead filed an action for annulment of extrajudicial sale, contending that Metrobank charged them excessive interests and other fees. They likewise prayed in their Complaint that they be allowed to redeem their mortgaged property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The right of redemption of the Spouses Pahang thus expired on January 27, 1999. Metrobank consolidated its ownership over the properties, and a transfer certificate of title was issued in its name. It subsequently filed a petition for issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The Spouses Pahang opposed the petition, arguing that their pending action for annulment of extrajudicial sale tolled the running of the one (1)-year period of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Rejecting the argument of the Spouses Pahang, this Court held that the "filing of an action by the redemptioner to enforce his right to redeem does not suspend the running of the statutory period to redeem the property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This Court added that upon the lapse of the one (1)-year period of redemption, it is the trial court's ministerial duty to issue a writ of possession to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Here, the Certificate of Sale in favor of Dura Tire was registered on February 20, 1995. Mahinay, as the successor-in-interest of previous owner A&amp;A Swiss, had one (1) year from February 20, 1995, or on February 20, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> to exercise his right of redemption and buy back the property from Dura Tire at the bid price of P950,000.00.<br><br>With Mahinay failing to redeem the property within the one (1)-year period of redemption, his right to redeem had already lapsed. As discussed, the pendency of an action to annul the foreclosure sale or to enforce the right to redeem does not toll the running of the period of redemption. The trial court correctly dismissed the Complaint for judicial declaration of right to redeem.<br><br>Mahinay nevertheless cites <i>Consolidated Bank &amp; Trust Corp. v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> in arguing that the one (1)-year period of redemption was tolled when he filed the Complaint for annulment of foreclosure sale. In <i>Consolidated Bank</i>, Nicos Industrial Corporation mortgaged parcels of land to Consolidated Bank to secure loans totalling P4,076,518.64. When the corporation failed to pay, Consolidated Bank applied for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Writs of attachment were issued in favor of Consolidated Bank and Notices of Levy were annotated on the transfer certificates of title covering the mortgaged properties. However, a year later, the properties were subsequently foreclosed by first mortgagee United Coconut Planters Bank, and a certificate of sale was issued to the latter on September 6, 1983. A month later, the United Coconut Planters Bank sold the properties to Manuel Go, who, in turn, sold the properties to Golden Star Industrial Corporation. Nicos then executed a Waiver of Right of Redemption in favor of Golden Star.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Golden Star then filed a petition for issuance of a writ of possession over the properties. The writ of possession was issued, allowing Golden Star to seize the properties under the custody of the Sheriff of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Consolidated Bank then filed a motion to annul the writ of possession on November 21, 1983. On a petition for review on certiorari before this Court, Golden Star argued, among others, that Consolidated Bank had no right to possess the properties. At that time, one (1) year from the registration of the certificate of sale had already lapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>This Court held that Consolidated Bank's filing of the motion to annul the writ of possession tolled the running of the one (1)-year period of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> This Court found that Nicos and Golden Star "conspired to defeat [Consolidated Bank's] lien on the attached properties and to deny the latter its right of redemption."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Considering that Consolidated Bank filed its motion to annul the writ of possession on November 21, 1983, just two (2) months after the certificate of sale was registered on September 6, 1983, this Court held that Consolidated Bank may still redeem the properties from Golden Star.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br><i>Consolidated Bank</i> is not precedent for the present case.<br><br><i>Consolidated Bank</i> cited <i>Ong Chua v. Carr</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> an inapplicable case, as basis for ruling that "the pendency of an action tolls the term of the right of redemption."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> <i>Ong Chua</i> involved a sale with right to repurchase,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> and the period of the "right of redemption" referred to in that case was governed by the provisions of the Civil Code on conventional redemption, specifically, Articles 1601 and 1606.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> On the other hand, the present case involves the redemption of an extrajudicially foreclosed property.
