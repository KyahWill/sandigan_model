				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When a party's counsel serves a notice of change in address upon a court, and the court acknowledges this change, service of papers, processes, and pleadings upon the counsel's former address is ineffectual. Service is deemed completed only when made at the updated address. Proof, however, of ineffectual service at a counsel's former address is not necessarily proof of a party's claim of when service was made at the updated address. The burden of proving the affirmative allegation of when service was made is distinct from the burden of proving the allegation of where service was or was not made. A party who fails to discharge his or her burden of proof is not entitled to the relief prayed for.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, praying that the assailed March 24, 2011 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and August 9, 2011 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, Sixth Division, in CA-G.R.

Period of Ordinary Appeal. — <i>The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from.</i> Where a record on appeal is required, the appellant shall file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order.<br><br>The period of appeal shall be interrupted by a timely motion for new trial or reconsideration.

As Rule 13, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>Section 2. Filing and Service, Defined. —<br><br>....<br><br>Service is the act of providing a party with a copy of the pleading or paper concerned. <i>If any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court.</i> Where one counsel appears for several parties, he shall only be entitled to one copy of any paper served upon him by the opposite side. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Delos Santos v. Elizalde</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this Court explained the reason for equating service upon counsels with service upon the parties themselves:<br><blockquote>To reiterate, service upon the parties' counsels of record is tantamount to service upon the parties themselves, but service upon the parties themselves is not considered service upon their lawyers. The reason is simple—the parties, generally, have no formal education or knowledge of the rules of procedure, specifically, the mechanics of an appeal or availment of legal remedies; thus, they may also be unaware of the rights and duties of a litigant relative to the receipt of a decision. More importantly, it is best for the courts to deal only with one person in the interest of orderly procedure—either the lawyer retained by the party or the party him/herself if s/he does not intend to hire a lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Rule 13, Section 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides for three (3) modes of service of judgments or final orders: first, personal service; second, service by registered mail; and third, service by publication. It reads:<br><blockquote>Section 9. Service of Judgments, Final Orders or Resolutions. — Judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be served either personally or by registered mail. When a party summoned by publication has failed to appear in the action, judgments, final orders or resolutions against him shall be served upon him also by publication at the expense of the prevailing party.<br></blockquote>Rule 13, Section 10 specifies when the first two (2) modes - personal service and service by registered mail - are deemed completed, and notice upon a party is deemed consummated:<br><blockquote>Section 10. Completeness of Service. — Personal service is complete upon actual delivery. Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the expiration of ten (10) days after mailing, unless the court otherwise provides. <i>Service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or after five (5) days from the date he received the first notice of the postmaster, whichever date is earlier.</i> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br></div><br>While petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Regional Trial Court's March 27, 2006 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> there is a dispute as to the date from which the 15-day period for filing a Motion for Reconsideration must be reckoned. That is, there is a dispute as to when petitioner was given notice of the Decision. The Court of Appeals refused to entertain petitioner's appeal reasoning that the judgment appealed from has attained finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This, according to it, is because petitioner belatedly filed her Motion for Reconsideration on June 16, 2006 considering that her counsel supposedly received notice of it on April 14, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Petitioner insists that the Motion was timely filed, her counsel having received notice of it only on June l, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals wrongly reckoned service on April 14, 2006 as the service made on this date was upon her counsel's former address.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> She adds that service upon her counsel's updated and correct address was made only on June 1, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Petitioner points out that her counsel filed with the Regional Trial Court a Notice of Change of Address. She further emphasizes that the Regional Trial Court acknowledged this change of address and issued an Order stating that, from then on, service shall be made upon the updated address.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>We sustain petitioner's position that the service made on her counsel's former address was ineffectual. We find however, that petitioner failed to discharge her burden of proving the specific date - allegedly June 1, 2006 - in which service upon her counsel's updated address was actually made. Having failed to establish the reckoning point of the period for filing her Motion for Reconsideration, we cannot sustain the conclusion that petitioner insists on, and which is merely contingent on this reckoning point: we cannot conclude that her Motion for Reconsideration was timely filed. Having failed to discharge her burden of proof, we are constrained to deny her Petition.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Indeed, petitioner's counsel filed with the Regional Trial Court a Notice of Change of Address dated June 8, 2004.

Annexes "H" and "I" indicate that the respondents themselves started serving copies of their submissions and pleadings with petitioner's counsel's updated address, in conformity with the Regional Trial Court's June 8, 2004 Order.<br><br>None, however, of the documents that petitioner adduced before this Court attests to the truth of her allegation that service to her counsel's new and correct address was made only on June 1, 2006.<br><br>In her Petition, petitioner alluded to a '"[r]eceipt attached at the back of the [Regional Trial Court's March 27, 2006] decision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> No copy of this receipt, however, was produced by petitioner. In all of the 16 pages of the Regional Trial Court's Decision that petitioner submitted as Annex "C" of her Petition, the only references made to the mailing of the Decision to her counsel are: first, the previously mentioned typewritten and handwritten texts indicating mailing to both her counsel's former address and updated address; and second, a stamped notation that stated:<br><blockquote>RELEASED BY REGISTERED MAIL DATE 3/31/06 By: [signature appears]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote>Neither of these attests to June 1, 2006 as the date of delivery to her counsel.<br><br>In <i>Cortes v. Valdellon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court noted the following as acceptable proofs of mailing and service by a court to a party: (1) certifications from the official Post Office record book and/or delivery book; (2) the actual page of the postal delivery book showing the acknowledgment of receipt; (3) registry receipt; and (4) return card.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Petitioner could have produced any of these documents or other similar proof to establish her claim. She did not. All she has relied on is her bare allegation that delivery was made on June 1, 2006. It is as though belief in this allegation necessarily follows from believing her initial claim that service to her counsel's former address was ineffectual.<br><br>Petitioner's own, voluntary reference to a "'[r]eceipt' attached at the back of the [Regional Trial Court's March 27, 2006] decision"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> suggests that she herself had access to this receipt and could have presented a copy of it to this Court. The fact that she did not present it implies negligence, or worse, calls into operation the presumption "[t]hat evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Regardless, it remains that she failed to prove what she claimed.<br><br>Petitioner similarly alludes to the Regional Trial Court's supposed realization of its error and subsequent action to correct its mistake:<br><blockquote>On account of this mistake and realizing that Atty. Raymond Palad only received a copy of the decision on 01 June 2006 (<i>see Affidavit of Atty. Raymond Palad, attached to Motion for Reconsideration, Annex "E", hereof</i>), the court a quo resolved the motion for reconsideration on the merits and gave due course to Gatmaytan's Notice of Appeal. The Hon. Court of Appeals - Sixth Division should have done the same thing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>As with the "receipt" she had earlier adverted to, petitioner could just as easily have presented to this Court a copy of the Regional Trial Court's Resolution, which supposedly resolved her Motion for Reconsideration on the merits as opposed, presumably, to denying it on the technical ground that it was filed beyond the 15-day period. This would supposedly reveal that the Regional Trial Court realized its mistake and corrected it. She did not present this.<br><br>Instead of producing the Regional Trial Court's Resolution, petitioner adduced a copy of a Motion for Reconsideration. Even then, what she annexed was a <i><b>not a copy of the Motion for Reconsideration she filed with the Regional Trial Court</b> but a copy of the Motion for Reconsideration dated April 12, 2011, which she filed with the Court of Appeals</i>. This was a Motion for Reconsideration she filed in response to the presently assailed March 24, 2011 Court of Appeals Decision, not to the Regional Trial Court's March 27, 2006 Decision.<br><br>Again, petitioner's failure to attach the correct annexes to her Petition could be attributed to mere inadvertence or negligence. We shudder to think however, that this could just as possibly be an indication of how petitioner makes an allegation but wilfully refuses to produce proof - indeed, suppresses proof - of what she alleges. Worse, her explicit reference to a Motion for Reconsideration filed with the Regional Trial Court, only to present something entirely different, could indicate an attempt to mislead this Court into blindly accepting her allegations.<br><br>As with the missing receipt however, regardless of whether petitioner failed to attach it deliberately or out of mere inadvertence, what remains is that petitioner failed to prove what she claimed.<br><br>Lacking evidentiary basis, petitioner's contention that service upon her counsel's updated and correct address was made only on June 1, 2006 cannot be sustained. As her plea for relief hinges on this singular detail, we are constrained to deny such. Bereft of any avenue for revisiting the Regional Trial Court's March 27, 2006 Decision, its findings and ruling must stand.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED</b>, the assailed March 24, 2011 Decision and August 9, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Sixth Division, in CA-G.R.
