She points to the Affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of six (6) of her former co-workers allegedly supporting her claim of unbearable working conditions; and Estelita's statement on September 22, 2009, "<i>Kung ayaw mo na ng ginagawa mo, we can manage!</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Petitioner further claims that she is entitled to service incentive leave pay for her entire 25 years of service, and not only up to three (3) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Finally, she adds that she should be awarded moral and exemplary damages because of the inhumane treatment of her employers.<br><br>We partly grant the Petition.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>At the onset, we stress that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission, if supported by substantial evidence and when upheld by the Court of Appeals, are binding and conclusive upon this Court when there is no cogent reason to disturb the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In the present case, due to lack of any palpable error, mistake, or misappreciation of facts, this Court discerns no compelling reason to reverse the consistent findings of the appellate court and the labor tribunals.<br><br>There is constructive dismissal when an employer's act of clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee so as to foreclose any choice on his part except to resign from such employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It exists where there is involuntary resignation because of the harsh, hostile and unfavorable conditions set by the employer. We have held that the standard for constructive dismissal is "whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his employment under the circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The unreasonably harsh conditions that compel resignation on the part of an employee must be way beyond the occasional discomforts brought about by the misunderstandings between the employer and employee. Strong words may sometimes be exchanged as the employer describes her expectations or as the employee narrates the conditions of her work environment and the obstacles she encounters as she accomplishes her assigned tasks. As in every human relationship, there are bound to be disagreements.<br><br>However, when these strong words from the employer happen without palpable reason or are expressed only for the purpose of degrading the dignity of the employee, then a hostile work environment will be created. In a sense, the doctrine of constructive dismissal has been a consistent vehicle by this Court to assert the dignity of labor.<br><br>However, this is not the situation in this case.<br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission did not commit a grave abuse of discretion in finding that petitioner was not constructively dismissed but that she voluntarily resigned from employment.<br><br>The affidavits of petitioner's former co-workers were mere narrations of petitioner's various duties. Far from showing the alleged harsh treatment that petitioner suffered, the affidavits rather reveal the full trust and confidence reposed by respondents on petitioner. Petitioner was entrusted with respondents' assets, the care and safeguarding of their house during their trips abroad, custody of company files and papers, and delicate matters such as the release, deposit, and withdrawals of checks from their personal accounts as well as accounts of their companies. Indeed, it was alleged that petitioner was treated by the respondents as part of the family.<br><br>Petitioner's unequivocal intent to relinquish her position was manifest when she submitted her letters of resignation. The resignation letters dated May 1, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and March 25, 2009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> contained words of gratitude, which a could hardly come from an employee forced to resign. These letters were reinforced by petitioner's very own act of not reporting for work despite respondents' directive.<br><br>As correctly appreciated by Labor Arbiter Macam:<br><blockquote>Complainant was not pressured into resigning. It seems that the complainant was not comfortable anymore with the fact that she was always at the beck and call of the respondent Javier spouses. Her supervisory and managerial functions appear to be impeding her time with her family to such extent that she was always complaining of her extended hours with the company. It is of no moment that respondent spouses in many occasions reprimanded complainant as long as it was reasonably connected and an offshoot of the work or business of respondents. . . Keeping in mind that she enjoyed the privilege of working closely with respondents and had their full trust and confidence, the summary of evidence points to the existence of voluntariness in complainant's resignation, more for personal reasons rather than the existence of a hostile and frustrating working environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>From the representation of petitioner, what triggered her resignation was the incident on September 22, 2009 when Estelita told her "<i>Kung ayaw mo na ng ginagawa mo, we can manage</i>!"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> These words, however, are not sufficient to make the continued employment of petitioner impossible, unreasonable, or unlikely.<br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly observed that the utterance of Estelita was more a consequence of her spontaneous outburst of feelings resulting from petitioner's failure to perform a task that was long overdue, rather than an act to force petitioner to resign from work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It appears that petitioner was asked to finish assigned tasks and liquidate cash advances. The affidavit of Estelita was unrebutted, and further corroborated by Rhea Sienna L. Padrid, Accounting Assistant II of Park N Ride, in her Affidavit with Cash Advances Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Estelita's affidavit read in part:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">During the middle part of December 2008, when the Accounting Division (Mrs. Rhea Padrin) audited the company books, report showed that the unliquidated Cash Advances of Lourdes Rodriguez had already ballooned to less than P7,000,000.00 some dating as early as year 2004.

There was no showing of bad faith or malicious design by the respondents that would make her work conditions unbearable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> On the other hand, it is a fact that petitioner enjoyed the privilege of working closely with the Javier Spouses and having their full trust and confidence. Spontaneous expressions of an employer do not automatically render a hostile work atmosphere. The circumstances in this case negate its presence.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>On the monetary claims, petitioner is not entitled to moral and exemplary damages considering that she was not illegally dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, with respect to service incentive leave pay, the Court of Appeals limited the award thereof to three (3) years (2006 to 2009) only due to the prescriptive period under Article 291 of the Labor Code. It held:<br><blockquote>Article 95 of the Labor Code provides that every employee who has rendered at least one year of service shall be entitled to a yearly service incentive leave pay of five days with pay, subject to exceptions (i.e.: when the employee is already enjoying vacation leave with pay of at least five days; and when the employee is employed in an establishment regularly employing less than ten employees).<br><br>It was not shown here that petitioner Rodriguez was enjoying vacation leave with pay of at least five days while being employed by private respondents Spouses Javier; it was not shown that private respondents Spouses Javier were merely employing less than 10 employees (on the contrary, private respondent spouses Javier stated that they were employing less than 15 employees). Hence, the award of service incentive leave pay to petitioner Rodriguez was proper.<br><br>Private respondents Spouses Javier employed petitioner Rodriguez for 25 years. Applying the prescriptive period for money claims under Article 291 of the Labor Code however, petitioner Rodriguez should only be entitled to the three years' worth of service incentive pay for the years 2006 to 2009.<br></blockquote>However, <i>Auto Bus Transport System, Inc. v. Bautista</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> clarified the correct reckoning of the prescriptive period for service incentive leave pay:<br><blockquote>It is essential at this point, however, to recognize that the service incentive leave is a curious animal in relation to other benefits granted by the law to every employee. In the case of service incentive leave, the employee may choose to either use his leave credits or commute it to its monetary equivalent if not exhausted at the end of the year. Furthermore, if the employee entitled to service incentive leave does not use or commute the same, he is entitled upon his resignation or separation from work to the commutation of his accrued service incentive leave. As enunciated by the Court in <i>Fernandez v. NLRC</i>:<br><blockquote>The clear policy of the Labor Code is to grant service incentive leave pay to workers in all establishments, subject to a few exceptions. Section 2, Rule V, Book III of the Implementing Rules and Regulations provides that "[e]very employee who has rendered at least one year of service shall be entitled to a yearly service incentive leave of five days with pay." Service incentive leave is a right which accrues to every employee who has served "within 12 months, whether continuous or broken reckoned from the date the employee started working, including authorized absences and paid regular holidays unless the working days in the establishment as a matter of practice or policy, or that provided in the employment contracts, is less than 12 months, in which case said period shall be considered as one year." It is also "<i>commutable to its money equivalent if not used or exhausted at the end of the year</i>." <i>In other words, an employee who has served for one year is entitled to it. He may use it as leave days or he may collect its monetary value.</i> To limit the award to three years, as the solicitor general recommends, is to unduly restrict such right.<br></blockquote>Correspondingly, it can be conscientiously deduced that the cause of action of an entitled employee to claim his service incentive leave pay accrues from the moment the employer refuses to remunerate its monetary equivalent if the employee did not make use of said leave credits but instead chose to avail of its commutation. Accordingly, if the employee wishes to accumulate his leave credits and opts for its commutation upon his resignation or separation from employment, his cause of action to claim the whole amount of his accumulated service incentive leave shall arise when the employer fails to pay such amount at the time of his resignation or separation from employment.<br><br>Applying Article 291 of the Labor Code in light of this peculiarity of the service incentive leave, we can conclude that <b>the three (3)-year prescriptive period commences</b>, not at the end of the year when the employee becomes entitled to the commutation of his service incentive leave, but <b>from the time when the employer refuses to pay its monetary equivalent after demand of commutation or upon termination of the employee's services</b>, as the case may be.<br><br>The above construal of Art. 291, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rules on service incentive leave, is in keeping with the rudimentary principle that in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of the Labor Code and its implementing regulations, the workingman's welfare should be the primordial and paramount consideration. The policy is to extend the applicability of the decree to a greater number of employees who can avail of the benefits under the law, which is in consonance with the avowed policy of the State to give maximum aid and protection to labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>Thus, the prescriptive period with respect to petitioner's claim for her entire service incentive leave pay commenced only from the time of her resignation or separation from employment. Since petitioner had filed her complaint on October 7, 2009, or a few days after her resignation in September 2009, her claim for service incentive leave pay has not prescribed.
