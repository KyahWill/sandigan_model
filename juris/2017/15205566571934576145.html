				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A stepfather's moral ascendancy or influence over his stepdaughter, who grew up knowing him as the only father she has ever had, supplants the element of violence or intimidation in a charge of rape. In this case, such influence over the stepdaughter is the reason why she silently endured years of sexual abuse without fighting back or confiding in anyone.<p> This Court is asked to review the Court of Appeals February 6, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and August 13, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in CA-GR. CR-H.C. No. 03855. The assailed Decision and Resolution affirmed the conviction of accused-appellant Benjamin Austria (Austria) for three (3) counts of rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) and (d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, and imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p> The facts, as found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p><p> On July 11, 2003, two (2) informations for rape were filed against Austria before the Regional Trial Court, Calauag, Quezon, The first information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 4380-C and read: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the year 1997, and sometime subsequent thereto, at Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lay with and have carnal knowledge of one [AAA], then a minor, 10 years of age, against her will.</p> <p> That the accused is the stepfather of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The second information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 4381-C and read: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the month of January 2003, and sometime prior thereto, at Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lay with and have carnal knowledge of one [AAA], then a minor, 16 years of age, against her will.</p> <p> That the accused is the stepfather of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>On March 225 2004, Austria pleaded not guilty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to the charges of rape against him. </p><p> Trial on the merits ensued, The prosecution presented the victim, AAA, and Dr. Yolanda Olea-Tenorio (Dr. Tenorio) as its witnesses.</p><p> AAA testified that Austria was her stepfather as he was legally married to her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> She also stated that from 1997 to July 2005, she lived in Quezon with her mother and her siblings, while Austria lived with them from 1997 to 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> AAA testified that sometime in 1997, when she was 10 years old and in grade 4, she woke up at around 2:00 a.m. when Austria went inside her bedroom and removed her shorts and panty. Her other siblings were still sleeping but her mother had gone to the market to sell her wares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> AAA cried when Austria removed her underwear. She tried to fight him off and pleaded for him to stop, but he threatened her and her family and warned her not to tell anybody about what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p>AAA testified that it was painful when Austria inserted his penis inside her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p>AAA further testified that Austria regularly raped her from 1997 to 2003 every time her mother was not at home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> One afternoon also in 1997, Austria told AAA to go with him to a grassy area in their kaingin. AAA already knew what would happen, but she went anyway because she feared for her and her mother's lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> When they reached the kaingin, Austria removed AAA's shorts and panty and raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> AAA testified that Austria raped her for the last time sometime in January 2003, when she was 16 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> AAA said that when her mother left for the market early in the morning, Austria came inside her room, lay down beside her, and started touching her private parts. AAA stated that even if Austria did not threaten her, she no longer resisted or fought back because of her fear of him and the harm he would inflict on her and her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p>Austria then inserted his penis inside AAA's vagina, causing her to feel pain with the penetration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p>During her cross-examination, AAA admitted that Austria never held or showed her a weapon when he raped her, but she was still afraid of him because he threatened to kill her or her mother if she refused his advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> On April 10, 2003, AAA told her aunt, Crisanta Reyes (Reyes), of Austria's repeated abuse from 1997 to 2003. AAA claimed that she finally found the courage to reveal her ordeal to her aunt because she was already grown up and wanted the abuse to stop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> That same day, Reyes accompanied AAA to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Austria was arrested that evening and it was only then that AAA's mother learned of what her daughter had gone through.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> The following day, AAA executed an affidavit against Austria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> Also on April 11, 2003, AAA's mother accompanied her to for a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p>The attending physician, Dr. Tenorio, gave the following diagnosis after examining AAA: </p><blockquote> <p>DIAGNOSIS: </p> <table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top">Breasts - well developed</td> <td width="1%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">External </td> <td width="87%" valign="top">- no abnormal external findings,</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">no bru[i]ses or hematoma </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">- Pubic Hair- plenty </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="6%" valign="top">IE - </td> <td colspan="2" valign="top">Hymen- intact<br> Vagina - admits 1 finger with ease<br> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">2 fingers with resistance </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">with moderate menstrual flow<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Dr. Tenorio testified that upon examining AAA's vagina, she found that AAA's hymen was still intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, Dr. Tenorio qualified that it was possible for the hymen to remain intact even if a woman had been repeatedly raped. She also added that there was a documented case where a woman who gave birth still had an intact hymen after delivering a baby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> <p> The defense's only witness was Austria himself who denied ever raping AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p>Austria admitted that AAA was his stepdaughter, as AAA was his wife's daughter from another man, but he claimed that he raised her as his own child, provided for her needs, and paid for her schooling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p>Austria testified that AAA falsely accused him of rape because she was instructed by Reyes to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p>Austria claimed that AAA's relatives from her real father's side wanted to raise her, but he refused to give AAA to them; thus, these false rape charges by his stepdaughter were filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> On February 5, 2009, Branch 63, Regional Trial Court, Quezon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> found Austria guilty of the multiple charges of rape against him. </p><p>The Regional Trial Court found that AAA was steadfast in her testimony that Austria repeatedly raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> The Regional Trial Court also took note that AAA referred to Austria as "Papa" during the trial, out of respect to her stepfather and benefactor. It opined that "it [was] improbable that [she] would [falsely] impute so grave a wrong to [Austria]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p>In contrast, the Regional Trial Court found Austria's testimony to be uncorroborated and unbelievable because he was unable to support his claim that AAA's relatives pushed her to file the false rape complaint against him so that he would lose custody over AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> The Regional Trial Court also did not give due weight to the defense's claim that AAA's intact hymen belied her claims of repeated rape. The Regional Trial Court emphasized that jurisprudence has consistently held that an intact hymen does not mean that rape did not take place, since consummated rape does not require that the hymen be penetrated or ruptured. Furthermore, the Regional Trial Court asserted that a young girl would not subject herself to the rigors of a public trial unless she was seeking justice for the abuse inflicted on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> The Regional Trial Court held that the prosecution was able to prove three (3) separate incidents of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It also held that the offenses charged against Austria were qualified because of AAA's minority and his relationship with her as her stepfather.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The<em> fallo</em> of the Regional Trial Court Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>PREMISES CONSIDERED</strong>, the Court is morally convinced that BENJAMIN AUSTRIA is <strong>GUILTY </strong>of three (3) counts of Rape beyond reasonable doubt and sentences him to<strong> RECLUSION PERPETUA</strong> in lieu of DEATH, for each count, applying the provisions of R.A. 9346 which prohibits, the imposition of death penalty. The Court hereby awards the victim:</p> <blockquote> <p> 1. <strong>Civil indemnity</strong> of <strong>P75,000.00</strong> since the crime is qualified by circumstances warranting the imposition of death penalty;<br> 2. <strong>Moral damages</strong> amounting to another<strong> P75,000.00</strong> because it is assumed that the victim has suffered moral injuries without proof thereof; and<br> 3.<strong> Exemplary damages</strong> in the amount of <strong>P25,000.00</strong> in the presence of qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship (People v. Quiatchon, G.R.

The February 5, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Calauag, Quezon, Branch 63, in Criminal Case Nos. 4380-C and 4381-C is <strong>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</strong> in that the award of exemplary damages is increased from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00.</p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> On August 13, 2013, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> denied Austria's Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> On September 6, 2013, Austria filed his Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> On September 27, 2013, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> gave due course to Austria's Notice of Appeal and directed the elevation of the records of his case to this Court. </p><p> On March 5, 2014, this Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> noted the records forwarded by the Court of Appeals and notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs.</p><p> On April 30, 2014, the prosecution filed its Manifestation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> indicating its intention to adopt the Appellee's Brief it had filed before the Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, the accused filed his Supplemental Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> on May 13, 2014.</p><p> In its Appellee's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the prosecution asserts that it has established accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p>The prosecution also points out that AAA's intact hymen does not negate her testimony that the accused repeatedly raped her, since this Court has repeatedly held that full penile penetration of the vagina is not needed for rape to be consummated. Furthermore, the elastic nature of the hymen makes it possible for it to remain intact despite repeated sexual intercourse or rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution contends that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of the witness, or lack thereof, should be given due weight considering its opportunity to observe the witness' demeanor while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution emphasizes that it is highly improbable that a young girl like AAA will expose herself to the humiliation and rigors of a public trial had she not really been abused by her stepfather.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> Finally, the prosecution stresses that the accused's defense of denial was inherently weak specially when weighed against AAA's positive and categorical testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> In his Appellant's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> accused insists that AAA's testimony must fail in light of Dr. Tenorio's testimony that AAA's hymen remained intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p> While the accused acknowledges that this Court has repeatedly stated that a physical examination finding the victim to be a virgin does not rule out the possibility of rape, he claims that the alleged numerous penile penetrations should have left physical marks on AAA's body if it were true that he repeatedly raped her for years. He further emphasized that considering AAA's small stature, the supposed sexual abuse she was constantly subjected to for years should have left traces of its commission on her body. However, this was not the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> The accused asserts that "[p]hysical evidence is a mute but eloquent manifestation of truth[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In this case, physical evidence ran counter to the testimonial evidence presented by the prosecution; hence, he insists that physical evidence should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p><p> Although Dr. Tenorio examined AAA only in 2003, when she was already 16 years old, accused, in his Supplemental Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> emphasizes that Dr. Tenorio examined AAA at two (2) instances: first, when she was 10 years old, and the second, when she was 16 years old. He claimed that during both instances, Dr. Tenorio examined AAA immediately after the alleged acts of rape by the accused and found AAA's hymen to be intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><p> The only issue to be resolved by this Court is whether or not accused-appellant Benjamin Austria's guilt for the charges of rape against him was proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p align="center"><b>I</b> </p><p> Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, provides the elements for the crime of rape: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 266-A. <i>Rape; When and How Committed</i>. — Rape is committed:</p> <p> 1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> Through force, threat, or intimidation;</li><li>When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; </li><li> By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and</li><li>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</li></ol> <p> 2. By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.</p> </blockquote> <p> Rape by sexual intercourse is carnal knowledge by a man of a woman under any of the circumstances enumerated in Article 266-A(1)(a-d).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) is also called statutory rape "as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The child victim's consent in statutory rape is immaterial because the law presumes that her young age makes her incapable of discerning good from evil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> <em>People v. Gutierez</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> explained the elements of statutory rape: </p><blockquote> <p> Statutory rape is committed when (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age and (2) the accused has carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation; whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness; or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. It is enough that the age of the victim is proven and that there was sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The defense did not dispute AAA's claim that she was 10 years old at the time she was first raped in 1997 at their house and at the kaingin. Her birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> was presented into evidence before the trial court and was not questioned by the defense. Therefore, what only needs to be proven is whether or not AAA and the accused had sexual intercourse because "sexual congress with a girl under 12 years old is always rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></p><p> AAA testified as follows: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Q [PROS.

A healed or fresh laceration would of course be a compelling proof of defloration. What is more, the foremost consideration in the prosecution of rape is the victim's testimony and not the findings of the medico-legal officer. In fact, a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape; the victim's testimony alone, if credibly is sufficient to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The accused cites <i>People v.

Opong</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> stressed that the state of the complainant's hymen is not an essential element for the successful prosecution of a charge of rape. </p><blockquote> <p> An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped, and a freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.</p> <p> In <i>People v. Gabayron</i>, we sustained the conviction of accused for rape even though the victim's hymen remained intact after the incidents because medical researches show that negative findings of lacerations are of no significance, as the hymen may not be torn despite repeated coitus. It was noted that many cases of pregnancy had been reported about women with unruptured hymens, and that there could still be a finding of rape even if, despite repeated intercourse over a period of years, the victim still retained an intact hymen without signs of injury.</p> <p> In <i>People v. Capt. Llanto,</i> citing <i>People v. Aguinaldo</i>, we likewise affirmed the conviction of the accused for rape despite the absence of laceration on the victim's hymen since medical findings suggest that it is possible for the victim's hymen to remain intact despite repeated sexual intercourse. We elucidated that the strength and dilatability of the hymen varies from one woman to another, such that it may be so elastic as to stretch without laceration during intercourse; on the other hand, it may be so resistant that its surgical removal is necessary before intercourse can ensue.</p> <p> In <i>People v. Palicte</i> and in <i>People v. Castro</i>, the rape victims involved were minors. The medical examination showed that their hymen remained intact even after the rape.
