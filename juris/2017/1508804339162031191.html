After the pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued. </p><p> The victim, AAA, testified that on October 23, 2005, at 7:00p.m., her father, Caoili, sexually molested her at their house located in Barangay JJJ, Municipality of KKK, in the Province of LLL. Caoili kissed her lips, touched and mashed her breast, inserted the fourth finger of his left hand into her vagina, and made a push and pull movement into her vagina with such finger for 30 minutes. AAA felt excruciating pain during and after the ordeal. Against her father's harsh warning not to go out of the house, AAA proceeded to the house of her uncle, BBB, located 20 meters away from their house. When he learned of this, Caoili fetched AAA and dragged her home. He beat and hit her with a piece of wood, and boxed her on the stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On October 26, 2005, AAA disclosed to Emelia Loayon (Loayon), the guidance counselor at AAA's school, the sexual molestation and physical violence committed against her by her own father.

He alleged that on October 23, 2005, at about 7:00p.m., he saw AAA with her boyfriend at the cassava plantation. He recognized AAA by the fragrance of her perfume and by the outline of her ponytail. He even greeted them "good evening" but they did not respond. He then went home. When AAA arrived at their house, he confronted her and the latter admitted that she was with her boyfriend "<em>Dodong</em>" earlier that evening. He was so angry so he struck AAA's right thigh with a piece of wood and pushed the same piece of wood on her forehead. When AAA cried out in pain, he became remorseful and asked for forgiveness, but AAA kept mum. After they had supper, Caoili and his son slept in one room; while AAA and her siblings slept in another room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC's Ruling</b> </p><p> On June 17, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> declaring Caoili guilty of rape by sexual assault.

No. 8353, and after considering the aggravating circumstance of being the parent of the complainant, who was fourteen (14) years, one (1) month and ten (10) days old at the time of the incident in question, there being no mitigating circumstance to off-set the same, this Court hereby sentences the said accused to suffer imprisonment for an indefinite period of TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Prision Mayor</em> in its maximum period, as minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Reclusion Temporal </em>in its maximum period, as maximum, and to pay the costs.

No. 8353 or the "Anti-Rape Law of 1997" amended Article 335, the provision on rape in the RPC, reclassifying rape as a crime against persons and introducing rape by "sexual assault," as differentiated from rape through "carnal knowledge" or rape through "sexual intercourse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Incorporated into the RPC by R.A. No. 8353, Article 266-A reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 266-A. <em>Rape, When and How Committed. Rape is committed</em> -</p> <p> 1) By a man who shall have<strong> carnal knowledge</strong> of a woman under any of the following circumstances: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Through force, threat or intimidation; </p> <p> (b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; </p> <p>(c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; [and] </p> <p> (d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present[.] </p> </blockquote> <p> 2) By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of<strong> sexual assault</strong> by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis ours) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, rape under the RPC, as amended, can be committed in two ways: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) Article 266-A paragraph 1 refers to <b>rape through sexual intercourse</b>, also known as "organ rape" or "penile rape." The central element in rape through sexual intercourse is carnal knowledge, which must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. </p> <p> (2) Article 266-A paragraph 2 refers to <strong>rape by sexual assault</strong>, also called "instrument or object rape," or "gender-free rape." It must be attended by any of the circumstances enumerated in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis ours) </p> </blockquote> <p> Through AAA's testimony, the prosecution was able to prove that Caoili molested his own daughter when he inserted his finger into her vagina and thereafter made a push and pull movement with such finger for 30 minutes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> thus, clearly establishing rape by sexual assault<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC.</p><p>Caoili, however, questions AAA's credibility, arguing that her testimony lacked veracity since she harbored hatred towards him due to the latter's strict upbringing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> The Court however, oppugns the veracity of Caoili's claim. </p><p> It is settled that ill motives become inconsequential if there is an affirmative and credible declaration from the rape victim, which clearly establishes the liability of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> AAA was a little over 15 years old when she testified,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and she categorically identified Caoili as the one who defiled her. She positively and consistently declared that Caoili inserted his finger into her vagina and that she suffered tremendous pain during the insertion. Her account of the incident, as found by the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> was clear, convincing and straightforward, devoid of any material or significant inconsistencies. </p><p> In <em>People v. Pareja</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he "assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand; a vantage point denied the appellate courts, and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> While there are recognized exceptions to the rule, this Court has found no substantial reason to overturn the identical conclusions of the trial and appellate courts on the matter of AAA's credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> When a rape victim's testimony on the manner she was molested is straightforward and candid, and is corroborated by the medical findings of the examining physician, as in this case, the same is sufficient to support a conviction for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In a long line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court has given full weight and credit to the testimonies of child victims, considering that their youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. Indeed, leeway should be given to witnesses who are minors, especially when they are relating past incidents of abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> It is likewise settled that in cases where the rape is committed by a close kin, such as the victim's father, stepfather, uncle, or the common-law spouse of her mother, it is not necessary that actual force or intimidation be employed; moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> Verily, the prosecution has sufficiently proved the crime of rape by sexual assault as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 266-A of the RPC.

(Emphasis ours) </p> <p> <b>Sec. 5. </b><i>When an offense includes or is included in another</i>. - An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter. And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter. </p> </blockquote> <p> By jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> however, an accused charged in the Information with rape by sexual intercourse cannot be found guilty of rape by sexual assault, even though the latter crime was proven during trial. This is due to the substantial distinctions between these two modes of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> The elements of rape through sexual intercourse are: (1) that the offender is a man; (2) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (3) that such act is accomplished by using force or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Rape by sexual intercourse is a crime committed by a man against a woman, and the central element is carnal knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the elements of rape by sexual assault are: (1) that the offender commits an act of sexual assault; (2) that the act of sexual assault is committed by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice or by inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; and that the act of sexual assault is accomplished by using force or intimidation, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> In the first mode (rape by sexual intercourse): (1) the offender is always a man; (2) the offended party is always a woman; (3) rape is committed through penile penetration of the vagina; and (4) the penalty is <em>reclusion perpertua</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> In the second mode (rape by sexual assault): (1) the offender may be a man or a woman; (2) the offended party may be a man or a woman; (3) rape is committed by inserting the penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; and (4) the penalty is <em>prision mayor</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> The Court en banc's categorical pronouncement in<em> People v. Abulon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> thus, finds application: </p><blockquote> <p> In view of the material differences between the two modes of rape, the first mode is not necessarily included in the second, and vice-versa. Thus, since the charge in the Information in Criminal Case No. SC-7424 is rape through carnal knowledge, appellant cannot be found guilty of rape by sexual assault although it was proven, without violating his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Our esteemed colleague, Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen), is of the view that Caoili should be convicted of rape by sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> According to him, sexual intercourse encompasses a wide range of sexual activities, and is not limited to those involving penetration, genitals, and opposite sexes;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> it may be penetrative or simply stimulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Thus, he maintains that Caoili's act of inserting his finger into his daughter's genitalia qualifies as carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><p> The Court, however, cannot adopt Justice Leonen's theory. </p><p> The language of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, provides the elements that substantially differentiate the two forms of rape,<em> i.e.,</em> rape by sexual intercourse and rape by sexual assault. It is through legislative process that the dichotomy between these two modes of rape was created. To broaden the scope of rape by sexual assault, by eliminating its legal distinction from rape through sexual intercourse, calls for judicial legislation which We cannot traverse without violating the principle of separation of powers. The Court remains steadfast in confining its powers within the constitutional sphere of applying the law as enacted by the Legislature. </p><p> In fine, given the material distinctions between the two modes of rape introduced in R.A. No. 8353, the variance doctrine cannot be applied to convict an accused of rape by sexual assault if the crime charged is rape through sexual intercourse, since the former offense cannot be considered subsumed in the latter. </p><p> The Court, thus, takes this occasion to once again remind public prosecutors of their crucial role in drafting criminal complaints or Information. They have to be more judicious and circumspect in preparing the Information since a mistake or defect therein may not render full justice to the State, the offended party and even the offender. </p><p> Thus, in <i>Pareja</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p> The primary duty of a lawyer in public prosecution is to see that justice is done - to the State, that its penal laws are not broken and order maintained; to the victim, that his or her rights are vindicated; and to the offender, that he is justly punished for his crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>Caoili can be convicted of the crime of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A.

To repeat, intimidation need not necessarily be irresistible. It is sufficient that some compulsion equivalent to intimidation annuls or subdues the free exercise of the will of the offended party. This is especially true in the case of young, innocent and immature girls who could not be expected to act with equanimity of disposition and with nerves of steel. Young girls cannot be expected to act like adults under the same circumstances or to have the courage and intelligence to disregard the threat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It cannot be denied that AAA, who is only a little over 14 years old at the time the offense was committed, was vulnerable and would have been easily intimidated by an attacker who is not only a grown man but is also someone exercising parental authority over her. Even absent such coercion or intimidation, Caoili can still be convicted of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 as he evidently used his moral influence and ascendancy as a father in perpetrating his lascivious acts against AAA. It is doctrinal that moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> It bears emphasis, too, that consent is immaterial in cases involving violation of Section 5 of R.A.

No. 7610" but as "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610." </p><p> Thus, in <em>People v. Bon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> the accused was charged with having carnal knowledge of a six-year-old child against her will and with the use of force and intimidation. The trial court convicted the accused of rape. The evidence, however, merely showed that accused inserted his finger into the victim's vaginal orifice. Applying the variance doctrine, the Court<em> en banc</em> held that the accused could still be made liable for acts of lasciviousness under the RPC because said crime is included in rape. The accused was convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, since all the elements of the said offense were established. </p><p> Likewise, in <em>Navarrete v. People</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the accused was charged with statutory rape for having sexual intercourse with a five-year-old girl. Absent clear and positive proof of the entry of accused's penis into the labia of the victim's vagina, the trial court convicted the accused of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The CA and this Court affirmed the conviction. In the case of <em>Bon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the Court held that the crime of acts of lasciviousness is included in rape. The Court likewise found that the victim's testimony established that accused committed acts of lewdness which amounted to lascivious conduct under R.A. No. 7610. </p><p> So also, in <em>People v. Rellota</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the Court modified the accused's conviction for attempted rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> of a 12-year-old minor to a conviction for Acts of Lasciviousness as defined in the RPC in relation to Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610, holding that the accused's acts, while lascivious, did not exactly demonstrate an intent to have carnal knowledge with the victim. The Court applied the variance doctrine and reiterated that the crime of acts of lasciviousness is included in rape. The conviction was based on the Court's finding that the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC and of lascivious conduct as defined in the rules and regulations of R.A. No. 7610 have been established. </p><p> Based on the language of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, however, the offense designated as Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 should be used when the victim is under 12 years of age at the time the offense was committed. This finds support in the first proviso in Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 which requires that "<em>when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be</em>." Thus, pursuant to this proviso, it has been held that before an accused can be convicted of child abuse through lascivious conduct on a minor below 12 years of age, the requisites for act of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC must be met in addition to the requisites for sexual abuse under Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p><p> Conversely, when the victim, at the time the offense was committed, is aged twelve (12) years or over but under eighteen (18), or is eighteen (18) or older but unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> the nomenclature of the offense should be Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, since the law no longer refers to Article 336 of the RPC, and the perpetrator is prosecuted solely under R.A. No. 7610. </p><p> In the case at bar, AAA was a little over 14 years old when the lascivious conduct was committed against her. Thus, We used the nomenclature "Lascivious Conduct" under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. </p><p> Accordingly, for the guidance of public prosecutors and the courts, the Court takes this opportunity to prescribe the following guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty: </p><p> 1. The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty. </p><p> 2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610." Pursuant to the second <em>proviso</em> in Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the imposable penalty is<em> reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period. </p><p> 3. If the victim is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A.

This statement, however, must be read alongside the immediately succeeding directive of the appellate court, remanding the case to the RTC <b>for further proceedings</b> pursuant to Section 14, Rule 110 and Section 19, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court. Said directive clearly shows that the CA still had cause to detain Caoili and did not discharge him; in fact, the CA would have Caoili answer for the proper Information which it directed the prosecution to file.

No. 7610, or the "<em>Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act,</em>" and not the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. </p><p> <strong>First. </strong>While there is a variance between the offense charged [rape by sexual intercourse] and those offenses proved [sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 and rape by sexual assault], Caoili can be convicted of sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610 because it was the offense proved during trial, and it is necessarily included in the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC which, under settled jurisprudence, is necessarily included in rape. However, due to the material differences between the two modes of committing rape, settled jurisprudence holds that rape by sexual intercourse is not necessarily included in rape by sexual assault, <em>vice-versa</em>, and that an accused cannot be found guilty of rape by sexual assault even though it was proved, if the charge is rape by sexual intercourse. </p><p> <b>Second</b>. Exception must be taken as to the applicability to this case of <em>People v. Nazareno</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> where it was held that rape by sexual assault committed at the time when the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 (R.A. No. 8353) was already in effect, although proven, should not have been considered by the trial and appellate courts for lack of a proper allegation in the information, which only charged the accused with rape by sexual intercourse. </p><p> <strong>Third.</strong> Sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 and acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC are separate and distinct from each other, despite the fact that the essential elements or ingredients of both crimes barely have material or substantial differences. </p><p> <strong>Fourth. </strong>The penalty for sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 varies if the age of the child victim is either below 12 years of age or between Twelve (12) to Seventeen (17) years of age, as well as Eighteen (18) and above but under special circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Also, the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, can only be committed against a victim who is less than 12 years old or one who cannot give intelligent consent. </p><p> <strong>Fifth. </strong>In view of possible different opinions between and among the crimes of rape through carnal knowledge under Article 266, paragraph 1 of the RPC, rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A, paragraph 2, acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, and sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, a copy of this Decision, including the Separate Opinions, should be furnished the President of the Republic of the Philippines, through the Department of Justice, as well as the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to enable them to review the said laws for possible amendments. </p><p> The antecedents are as follows: </p><p> On July 7, 2006, Caoili was indicted for rape by sexual intercourse committed against his fifteen (15)-year-old daughter, AAA. During trial, AAA testified that Caoili kissed her lips, touched and mashed her breasts, inserted the forefinger of his left hand into her vagina, then made a push-and-pull movement inside her for about thirty (30) minutes. The accusatory portion of the Information reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That, on or about the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of October 2005, at 7:00 o'clock in the evening, more or less, in Purok [III], Barangay [JJJ], [KKK], [LLL], Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with full freedom and intelligence, with lewd design, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with one [AAA], a minor, fifteen (15) years of age and the daughter of herein accused, through force, threat and intimidation and against her will, to her damage and prejudice in the amount as may be allowed by law.</p> <p> CONTRARY TO Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of R.A. 8353, with the aggravating circumstance that the accused is the father of the victim and R.A. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Surigao City, Branch 30,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> found Caoili guilty of rape by sexual assault. On appeal, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> set aside the decision, and ordered the immediate remand of the case for further proceedings, pursuant to Section 14, Rule 110, in relation to Section 19, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court.</p><p> Before us, the <em>ponencia </em>opined that even if the elements of rape by sexual assault have been proven by the prosecution, Caoili could not be held guilty of the crime proved during trial. Citing <em>People v. Pareja</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and <em>People v. Abulon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the<em> ponencia</em> held that due to the material differences and substantial distinctions between the two modes of committing rape, rape by sexual intercourse is not necessarily included in rape by sexual assault, and vice-versa. Nonetheless, under the variance doctrine embodied under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, sufficient evidence exists to convict Caoili of the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610. The<em> ponencia</em> sentenced Caoili to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to pay the victim a fine of P15,000.00, as well as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, in the amount of P75,000.00 each, plus interest rate of six percent (6%)<em> per annum </em>from finality of the judgment until fully paid. </p><p> I explain my concurrence with the<em> ponencia</em>. </p><p> To be sure, Caoili cannot be merely convicted of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in an information charging rape by sexual intercourse, because what were proved during trial are sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610<strong> and </strong>rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the RPC. Conviction for such lesser crime is not only unfair to the victim who is no less than his minor daughter, but also violates the declaration of state policy and principles under Section 2 of R.A. No. 7610 and Section 3(2), Article XV of the 1987 Constitution, which provide for special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to their development. </p><p> I fully agree with the doctrine in <em>Abulon</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and<em> Pareja</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the effect that an accused cannot be found guilty of rape by sexual assault although it was proven, if the charge in the information is rape by carnal knowledge in view of the material differences<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> between rape by sexual intercourse and rape by sexual assault, as well as the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. I also do not dispute the well-settled principles in the cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> cited by the<em> ponencia</em> that a charge of acts of lasciviousness is necessarily included in a complaint for rape, and that an accused charged with rape by carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse, can still be convicted of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness, pursuant to the variance doctrine under Section 4, in relation to Section 5, Rule 120<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the Rules of Court. </p><p> After a careful review of the relevant laws and jurisprudence, however, I find that Caoili should be convicted instead of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of Article III of R.A. No. 7610, pursuant to the variance doctrine because it was the crime proved during trial, and it is necessarily included in acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC which, under settled jurisprudence, is necessarily included in the crime of rape. </p><p> The 1987 Constitution mandates that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> From this fundamental law stems the rule that an accused can only be convicted of a crime charged in the information, and proved beyond reasonable doubt during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> To convict the accused of an offense other than that charged in the information would violate the Constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, unless the crime is alleged or necessarily included in the information filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> For the variance doctrine to apply, it is required that (1) there is a variance between an offense charged and that proved, and (2) the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved. Under the variance doctrine, the accused shall either be convicted (1) of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or (2) of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved. </p><p> While there is a variance between the offense charged [rape by sexual intercourse] and that proved [sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610 and rape by sexual assault], Caoili should be convicted of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 because it was the offense proved during trial, and it is necessarily included in the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC which, under settled jurisprudence, is necessarily included in rape. </p><p> An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter, whereas an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> The elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, on the one hand, are: </p><ol><li> The offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; </li><li>That it is done under any of the following circumstances: <br> a. By using force or intimidation; or <br> b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or <br> c. When the offended party is under 12 years of age; and</li><li> That the offended party is another person of either sex. </li></ol> <p> As correctly noted by the<em> ponencia</em>, lewdness is defined as an obscene, lustful, indecent, and lecherous act which signifies that form of immorality which has relation to moral impurity; or that which is carried in a wanton manner. Moreover, the presence or absence of lewd designs is inferred from the nature of the acts themselves and the environmental circumstances. </p><p> The elements of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, on the other hand, are: </p><ol><li> The accused commits a sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; </li><li>The said act was performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse; and</li><li> The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age. </li></ol> <p> Promulgated in relation to Section 32 of R.A. No. 7610 are the Rules and Regulations (<em>IRR</em>) on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases which define the terms "sexual abuse" and "lascivious conduct": </p><blockquote> <p> Section 2. Definition of Terms. - As used in these Rules, unless the context requires otherwise -</p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> g) "<strong>Sexual Abuse</strong>" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in sexual intercourse or <strong>lascivious conduct</strong> or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children; </p> <p> h) "<strong>Lascivious conduct</strong>'' means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A comparison of the essential elements or ingredients of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 and acts lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC barely reveals any material or substantial difference between them. The first element of sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610, which includes lascivious conduct, lists the particular acts subsumed under the broad term "act of lasciviousness or lewdness" under Article 336. The second element of "<em>coercion and influence</em>" as appearing under R.A. No 7610 is likewise broad enough to cover ''<em>force and intimidation'</em>' as one of the circumstances under Article 336.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Anent the third element, the offended party under R.A. No. 7610 and Article 336 may be of either sex, save for the fact that the victim in the former must be a child. I, therefore, posit that the sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 is necessarily included in the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC. </p><p> Applying the variance doctrine in this case where the crime charged is rape by sexual intercourse, Caoili can still be convicted of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A No. 7610. This is because the same crime was proved during trial and is necessarily included in the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC which, under settled jurisprudence, is necessarily included in a complaint for rape. For the same reason, the CA erred in applying Section 14,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Rule 110, in relation to Section 19,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, and ordering the remand of the case for further proceedings. Suffice it to stress that the provisions on substitution of information applies only when (1) there is a mistake in charging the proper offense, and (2) the accused cannot be convicted of the offense charged or any other offense necessarily included in the offense charged. The second requisite is absent in this case.</p><p> As held in <em>Dimakuta v. People</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> if the victim of lascivious acts or conduct is over 12 years of age and under eighteen (18) years of age, the accused may be held liable for: </p><blockquote> <p> xxxx</p> <p> 2. Acts of lasciviousness under Art. 336 if the act of lasciviousness is not covered by lascivious conduct as defined in R.A. No. 7610.<b> In case the acts of lasciviousness is covered by lascivious conduct under R.A. No. 7610 and it is done through coercion or influence, which establishes absence or lack of consent, then Art. 336 of the RPC is no longer applicable.</b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Before an accused can be held criminally liable of lascivious conduct, which is included in sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, the requisites of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC must be met in addition to the requisites of sexual abuse under the said Section 5(b), namely: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act was performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse; and (3) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> All these requisites are present in this case.</p><p> <strong>First. </strong>Caoili's lewd acts of kissing the victim's lips, mashing her breasts, inserting his finger into her vagina and making a push-and-pull movement inside her for thirty (30) minutes, constitute lascivious conduct as defined in the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 2. Definition of Terms. - As used in these Rules. unless the context requires otherwise—</p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> h) "Lascivious conduct" means the<strong> intentional touching</strong>, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the<strong> introduction of any object into the genitalia</strong>, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <strong>Second. </strong>Caoili clearly has moral ascendancy over the victim who is his minor daughter. It is settled that in cases where rape is committed by a relative, such as a father, stepfather, uncle, or common law spouse, moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence. It bears emphasis that a child is considered as sexually abused under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 when he or she is subjected to lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult, and that moral ascendancy is equivalent to intimidation, which annuls or subdues the free exercise of the will by the offended party. <i>Apropos</i> is <i>Caballo v. People</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> As it is presently worded, Section 5, Article III of RA 7610 provides that when a child indulges in sexual intercourse or any lascivious conduct due to the coercion or influence of any adult, the child is deemed to be a "child exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse." In this manner, the law is able to act as an effective deterrent to quell all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and discrimination against children, prejudicial as they are to their development. </p> <p> In this relation, case law further clarifies that sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult exists when there is some form of compulsion equivalent to intimidation which subdues the free exercise of the offended party’s free will. Corollary thereto, Section 2(g) of the Rules on Child Abuse Cases conveys that sexual abuse involves the element of influence which manifests in a variety of forms. It is defined as:</p> <p> The employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children.</p> <p> To note, the term "influence" means the "improper use of power or trust in any way that deprives a person of free will and substitutes another's objective." Meanwhile, "coercion" is the "improper use of ... power to compel another to submit to the wishes of one who wields it."</p> </blockquote> <p> <strong>Third. </strong>The victim was admitted and proved to be 14 years old at the time of the commission of the offense. Under Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 7610, "children" refers to persons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition." </p><p> Accordingly, Caoili should be convicted of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, and not just acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to the same provision of R.A. No. 7610. </p><p> In <em>Quimvel v. People</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (<em>Quimvel</em>) the Court held that Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 punishes sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct committed on a child subjected to other sexual abuse, and covers not only a situation where a child is abused for profit but also one in which a child, through coercion, intimidation or influence, engages in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct. The Court noted that the very definition of "child abuse" under Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 7610 does not require that the victim suffer a separate and distinct act of sexual abuse aside from the act complained of, for it refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child. Thus, a violation of Section 5(b) occurs even though the accused committed sexual abuse against the child victim only once, even without a prior sexual affront. Moreover, the Court pointed out that it is immaterial whether or not the accused himself employed the coercion or influence to subdue the will of the child for the latter to submit to his sexual advances for him to be convicted under paragraph (b). As can be gleaned from Section 5, Article III of R.A. No. 7610, the offense can be committed against "<b><u>any adult</u></b>, syndicate or group," without qualification. The clear language of the special law, therefore, does not preclude the prosecution of lascivious conduct performed by the same person who subdued the child through coercion or influence. </p><p> It may not be amiss to state that the absence of the phrase "<em>exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse</em>" or even the specific mention of "coercion" or "<em>influence</em>" in the Information filed against Caoili, is not a bar to uphold the finding of guilt against an accused for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610. As held in <em>Quimvel</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Just as the Court held that it was enough for the Information in Olivarez to have alleged that the offense was committed by means of "<em>force and intimidation</em>," the Court must also rule that the information in the case at bench does not suffer from the alleged infirmity. </p> <p> So too did the Court find no impediment in <em>People v. Abadies, Malto v. People, People v. Ching, People v. Bonaagua</em>, and<em> Caballo v. People</em> to convict the accused therein for violation of Sec. 5, RA 7610 notwithstanding the non-mention in the information of "<em>coercion</em>", <em>influence</em>", or "<em>exploited in prostitution or subject to other abuse</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In seeking his acquittal, Caoili cites <i>People v. Nazareno</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and argues that he cannot be convicted of rape by sexual assault because even if it was proved during trial, the crime specifically alleged in the information is sexual intercourse, which is a separate and distinct crime. The accusatory portion of the said Information docketed as Criminal Case No. 2638 for violation of Article 266-A of the RPC, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That from sometime in January 1990 up to December 1998 in Barangay Codon, Municipality of San Andres, Catanduanes, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the said accused, being the father of the complainant, did then and there willfully, feloniously and criminally repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her daughter AAA, then five years old up to the time when she was 15 years old against her will. </p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW. </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court ruled in <em>Nazareno</em> that considering that the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 (R.A. No. 8353) was already in force at the time of the insertion of appellant's finger in BBB's vagina on December 6, 1998, he should have been prosecuted and tried for rape by sexual assault and not under the traditional definition of rape. This is because under the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, the information must state the designation of the offense given by the statute and specify its qualifying and generic aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Stated otherwise, the accused cannot be convicted for the offense proved during trial if it was not properly alleged in the information. The Court, thus, held that in Criminal Case No. 2638, appellant should have been convicted only of qualified rape of BBB in January 1992, while the rape by sexual assault committed on December 6, 1998, although proven, should not have been considered by the trial and appellate courts for lack of a proper allegation in the information. </p><p> Contrary to Caoili's argument, <i>Nazareno</i> is inapplicable to this case for the simple reason that there is no allegation in the afore-quoted information docketed as Criminal Case No. 2638, which even remotely refers to acts constituting a violation of R.A. No. 7610. Caoili was sufficiently apprised of the offense being charged against him, and afforded opportunity to prepare his defense, because the designation of the offense appears in the Information filed against him, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> That, on or about the 23<sup>rd </sup>day of October 2005m at 7:00 o'clock in the evening, more or less, in Purok [III], Barangay [JJJ], [KKK], [LLL], Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with full freedom and intelligence, with lewd design, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had <b>sexual intercourse </b>with one [AAA], a minor, fifteen (15) years of age and the daughter of herein accused, through force, threat and intimidation and against her will, to her damage and prejudice in the amount as may be allowed by law. </p> <p> <b>CONTRARY TO</b> Article 266-A, in relation to Art. 266-B of R.A. 8353, with aggravating circumstance that the accused is the father of the victim and <b>R.A. 7610</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In particular, Section 5, Article III of R.A. No. 7610 deals with sexual intercourse committed against a child exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse: </p><p align="center"> ARTICLE III<br> <em>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse </em> </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 5. <em>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse</em>. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in <b>sexual intercourse</b> or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.</p> <p> The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon the following: </p> <p> (b) Those who commit the act of <b>sexual intercourse</b> or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse;<em> Provided</em>, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: <em>Provided</em>, That the penalty for Lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its medium period;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Significantly, while <i>Nazareno</i> is silent on the application of the variance doctrine, I have discussed that applying the same doctrine in this case where the crime charged is rape by sexual intercourse, Caoili can still be convicted of sexual abuse committed against a child under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A No. 7610. This is because the latter crime was proved during trial and is necessarily included in the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC which, under settled jurisprudence, is necessarily included in a complaint for rape. </p><p> Since Caoili should be convicted of sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610, the proper imposable penalty should be taken from<em> reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period to<em> reclusion perpetua </em>under Section 5(b), Article III thereof, and not <em>prision correccional</em> under Article 336 of the RPC, because the victim was alleged [15 years old] and proved [14 years old] to be a child.</p><p> It bears stressing that sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 and acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC are separate and distinct from each other. With due indulgence, may I refer to my Separate Concurring Opinion in <i>Quimvel </i>where I discussed the difference between the two crimes: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>Violation of the first clause of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610 is separate and distinct from acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC. Aside from being dissimilar in the sense that the former is an offense under special law, while the latter is a felony under the RPC, they also have different elements.</strong> On the one hand, the elements of violation of the first clause of Section 5(b) are: (1) accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age. On the other hand, the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 are: (1) that the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) that it is done under any of the following circumstances: (a) by using force or intimidation; or (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) When the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3) that the offended party is another person of either sex. x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> I likewise opined that the penalty for sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 varies if the age of the child victim is either below 12 years of age or between 12 to 17 years of age, as well as 18 and above but under special circumstances: </p><blockquote> <p> Moreover, while the first clause of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610 is silent with respect to the age of the victim, Section 3, Article I thereof defines "children" as those below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability. Notably, two provisos succeeding the first clause of Section 5(b) explicitly state a qualification that when the victims of lascivious conduct is under 12 years of age, the perpetrator shall be (1) prosecuted under Article 336 of the RPC, and (2) the penalty shall be<em> reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period. It is a basic rule in statutory construction that the office of the proviso qualifies or modifies only the phrase immediately preceding it or restrains of limits the generality of the clause that it immediately follows. A proviso is to be construed with reference to the immediately preceding part of the provisions, to which it is attached, and not to the statute itself or the other sections thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In light of my foregoing, I found it necessary to restate in my Separate Concurring Opinion in <em>Quimvel </em>the applicable laws and imposable penalties for acts of lasciviousness committed against a child under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to R.A. No. 7610: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>1. Under 12 years old</strong> - Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610, in relation to Article 336 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, applies and the imposable penalty is<em><strong> reclusion temporal in its medium period</strong></em>, instead of prision correccional. x x x </p> <p> 2. <em><strong>12 years old and below 18, or 18 or older under special circumstances under Section 3(a) of R.A. 7610</strong></em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> - Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610 in relation to Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, applies and the penalty is <em><strong>reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua</strong></em>. This is because the proviso under Section 5(b) apply only if the victim is under 12 years old, but silent as to those 12 years old and below 18; hence, the main clause thereof still applies in the absence of showing that the legislature intended a wider scope to include those belonging to the latter age bracket. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> I further submit that the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 can only be committed against a victim who is less than 12 years old or one who cannot give intelligent consent. This theory is supported by the provisions of Section 5(b), in relation to Article 335(3), on rape and Article 336 on acts of lasciviousness of the RPC, which deal with statutory rape and statutory acts of lasciviousness, thus: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Art. 336, RPC, Act No. 3815 (December 8, 1930)</strong></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>R.A. 7610 (June 17, 1992) </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">Chapter Two </div></td> <td><div align="center">ARTICLE III </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <table width="98%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">RAPE AND ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS <br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="justify"><strong>Art. 335.<em> When and how rape is committed.</em> — Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</strong> </div> <p align="justify">1.

Thus, if the victim is from 12 years old to 17, or 18 years old, or over but under special circumstances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the crime is sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A.

No. 7610, as stated in my Separate Concurring Opinion in <em>Quimvel</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. <b>Under 12 years old</b> - Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610, in relation to Article 336 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, applies and the imposable penalty is<strong> <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period</strong>, instead of<em> prision correccional</em>. In <em>People v. Fragante</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <em>Nonito Imbo y Gamores v. People of the Philippines</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and <em>People of the Philippines v. Oscar Santos y Encinas</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the accused were convicted of acts of lasciviousness committed against victims under 12 years old, and were penalized under Section 5(b), Artcile III of R.A. 7610, and not under Article 336 of the RPC, as amended.</p> <p> 2. <strong>12 years old and below 18, or 18 or older under special circumstances under Section 3(a) of R.A. 7610</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> - Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610 in relation to Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, applies and the penalty is <strong><em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em></strong>. This is because the proviso under Section 5(b) apply only if the victim is under 12 years old, but silent as to those 12 years old and below 18; hence, the main clause thereof still applies in the absence of showing that the legislature intended a wider scope to include those belonging to the latter age bracket. The said penalty was applied in <em>People of the Philippines v. Ricardo Bacus</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and <em>People of the Philippines v. Rolando Baraga y Arcilla</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> where the accused were convicted of acts of lasciviousness committed against victims 12 years old and below 18, and were penalized under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610. But, if the acts of lasciviousness is not covered by lascivious conduct as defined in R.A. 7610, such as when the victim is 18 years old and above, acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC applies and the penalty is <em>prision correccional</em>.</p> <p> Curiously, despite the clear intent of R.A. 7610 to provide for stronger deterrence and special protection against child abuse, the penalty [<strong><em>reclusion temporal</em> medium</strong>] when the victim is under 12 years old is lower compared to the penalty <em>[<strong>reclusion temporal</strong></em><strong> medium to <em>reclusion perpetua</em></strong>] when the victim is 12 years old and below 18. The same holds true if the crime of acts of lasciviousness is attended by an aggravating circumstance or committed by persons under Section 31,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Article XII of R.A. 7610, in which case, the imposable penalty is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. In contrast, when no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attended the crime of acts of lasciviousness, the penalty therefor when committed against a child under 12 years old is aptly higher than the penalty when the child is 12 years old and below 18. This is because, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term in the case of the younger victims shall be taken from reclusion temporal minimum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> whereas as the minimum term in the case of the older victims shall be taken from <em>prision mayor medium</em> to<em> reclusion temporal minimum</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It is a basic rule in statutory construction that what courts may correct to reflect the real and apparent intention of the legislature are only those which are clearly clerical errors or obvious mistakes, omissions, and misprints,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> but not those due to oversight, as shown by a review of extraneous circumstances, where the law is clear, and to correct it would be to change the meaning of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> To my mind, a corrective legislation is the proper remedy to address the noted incongruent penalties for acts of lasciviousness committed against a child. </p> <p> Too, it bears emphasis that R.A. 8353 did not expressly repeal Article 336 of the RPC, as amended. Section 4 of R.A. 8353 only states that Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, and all laws, rules and regulations inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions thereof are deemed amended, modified or repealed, accordingly. There is nothing inconsistent between the provisions of Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, and R.A. 8353, except in sexual assault as a form of rape. Hence, when the lascivious act is not covered by R.A. 8353, then Article 336 of the RPC is applicable, except when the lascivious conduct is covered by R.A. 7610. </p> <p> In fact, R.A. 8353 only modified Article. 336 of the RPC, as follows: (1) by carrying over to acts of lasciviousness the additional circumstances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> applicable to rape, <i>viz.</i>: threat and fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority; (2) by retaining the circumstance that the offended party is under 12 years old, and including dementia as another one, in order for acts of lasciviousness to be considered as statutory, wherein evidence of force or intimidation is immaterial because the offended party who is under 12 years old or demented, is presumed incapable of giving rational consent; and (3) by removing from the scope of acts of lasciviousness and placing under the crime of rape by sexual assault the specific lewd act of inserting the offender's penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person. In fine, Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, is still a good law despite the enactment of R.A. 8353 for there is no irreconcilable inconsistency between their provisions.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the Court is also not unmindful of the fact that the accused who commits acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. 7610, suffers the more severe penalty of<em> reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period, than the one who commits Rape Through Sexual Assault, which is merely punishable by<em> prision mayor</em>. In <em><strong>People v. Chingh y Parcia</strong></em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court noted that the said fact is undeniably unfair to the child victim, and it was not the intention of the framers of R.A. 8353 to have disallowed the applicability of R.A. 7610 to sexual abuses committed to children. The Court held that <strong>despite the passage of R.A. 8353, R.A. 7610 is still good law</strong>, which must be applied when the victims are children or those "persons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> <p> Finally, as the Court stressed in <b><i>Mustapha Dimakuta Maruhom v. People</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> where the lascivious conduct is covered by the definition under R.A. 7610 where the penalty is<em> reclusion temporal</em> medium and the said act is likewise covered by sexual assault under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the RPC, which is punishable by <em>prision mayor</em>, the offender should be liable for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610, where the law provides the higher penalty of <em>reclusion temporal</em> medium, if the offended party is a child. But if the victim is at least eighteen (18) years of age, the offender should be liable under Article 266-A, par. 2 of the RPC and not R.A. 7610, unless the victim is at least 18 years old and she is unable to fully take care of herself or protect from herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, in which case, the offender may still be held liable of sexual abuse under R.A. 7610. The reason for the foregoing is that, aside from the affording special protection and stronger deterrence against child abuse, R.A. 7610 is a special law which should clearly prevail over R.A. 8353, which is a mere general law amending the RPC. </p> </blockquote> <p> Let a copy of this Decision and the Separate Opinions be furnished the President of the Republic of the Philippines, through the Department of Justice, pursuant to Article 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the RPC, the President of the Senate of the Philippines and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as reference for possible amendments in light of the foregoing observations. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 5. <i>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse</i>. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br> The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following: xxx <br> (b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; <em>Provided,</em> That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period; xxx <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Art. 336. <i>Acts of lasciviousness</i>. - Any person who shall commit any act of lasciviousness upon other persons of either sex, under any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding article, shall be punished by<em> prision correccional.</em></p> <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 574 Phil. 175, 206 (2008). </p><p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> R.A.

The prosecution already established that the accused inserted his finger in his daughter's vagina. This already qualifies as carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse. </p><p> This Court's refusal to convict the accused of rape by sexual intercourse despite the proper allegation in the information and the sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence is based on this Court's restrictive definition of sexual intercourse. </p><p> Carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse has been inaccurately and restrictively used to denote an activity that must necessarily involve penetration, genitals, and opposite sexes. Carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse is currently understood as involving penile penetration of the vaginal orifice. In <em>People v. Opong</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Carnal knowledge is synonymous with sexual intercourse.

It denotes abstinence from sexual activity before marriage or the limitation of one's sexual contact to his or her spouse after marriage.</p> <p> Crimes against chastity under our current law include, among others, adultery, concubinage, seduction, corruption of minors, and abduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The criminalization of acts constituting these crimes is not only a declaration that chastity is something that must be protected by the State, but is also a revelation of the premium we put on abstinence before or outside marriage and our fixation on puritanical ideals. </p> <p> The brunt of the effects of this fixation is suffered to a significantly greater degree by women more than men. Between the two (2) sexes, women are expected to live out this ideal. Their adherence to this virtue is taken as a given. </p><p> What acts constitute the crimes against chastity and how they are crafted in our law reflect these unequal expectations. </p><p> Under Title Eleven or Crimes Against Chastity of the Revised Penal Code, punishment is generally directed at acts that contradict this expectation of virtue or acts that tend to give an appearance of diminished virtue. Married women may be convicted of adultery for having sexual intercourse with any man not her husband, regardless of the validity of her marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> On the other hand, sexual relations of a married man with a woman who is not his wife is not always a crime. It only becomes a crime if there is cohabitation, if it is committed under scandalous circumstances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> or if the sexual relations were committed with a married woman, and he had knowledge of that fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> Moreover, Title Eleven of the Revised Penal Code suggests that only females may be criminally seduced and abducted for lewd designs. Articles 337 and 343 emphasize virginity among their elements. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 337. <i>Qualified seduction.</i> - The seduction of a virgin over twelve years and under eighteen years of age, committed by any person in public authority, priest, home-servant, domestic, guardian, teacher, or any person who, in any capacity, shall be entrusted with the education or custody of the woman seduced, shall be punished by <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum and medium periods. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Article 343. <i>Consented abduction</i>. - The abduction of a virgin over twelve years and under eighteen years of age, carried out with her consent and with lewd designs, shall be punished by the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum and medium periods.</p> </blockquote> <p> Meanwhile, the crime of simple seduction emphasizes good reputation among females of 12 to 18 years, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 338. <em>Simple seduction</em>. - The seduction of a woman who is single or a widow of good reputation, over twelve but under eighteen years of age, committed by means of deceit, shall be punished by<em> Arresto mayor</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p> These further highlight that the expectation to remain pure is real and that this expectation is not equal between sexes. It implies that while women necessarily adhere and must necessarily adhere to chastity as a virtue, men do not and have no need to. Hence, the State provides a means to protect that virtue presumably and expectedly held by all its women. </p><p> This underlying assumption exposes the real focal point of crimes against chastity. Unlike crimes against persons wherein acts are punished for the harm done to an individual person's being regardless of sex, crimes against chastity punishes persons for acts done against a virtue. Crimes against persons recognize that individuals are conscious beings who are sovereigns in their own right of their own bodies, thoughts, and lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Crimes against chastity emphasize the virtue more than the person. The person is nothing more than a vessel of an independent abstract concept that must be protected. </p><p> Republic Act No. 8353 has already reconceptualized rape as a crime against persons. However, until present, virginity of a woman—as opposed to men's virginity—is important to men. This is one (1) of the manifestations of gender imbalance that is apparent in the current wordings of our crimes against chastity. Women are seen as objects. A woman's value depends on whether the man she will marry will be the person who will first conquer her—the man to whom she will yield and for whom she will be owned. </p><p> Thus, under the old concept, what matters was what men wanted: the woman is reduced into a vagina and it must be intact for him. He owns her when he is first to violate her. She is not as worthy otherwise. She is unchaste. </p><p> Carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse is a broad term that can be subject to several interpretations. Understandably, albeit without sensitivity to gendered meanings, past decisions even of this Court reduced this broad term to penile penetration. A more enlightened gender and culturally sensitive meaning expands this concept especially since rape is now no longer a crime against chastity but a crime against persons. </p><p> Having carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse is a powerful expression of intimacy. It is an act which requires the shedding of all inhibitions and defenses to allow humans to explore each other in their most basic nakedness. It is an act that brings out the best in humanity when it is neither required nor coerced but chosen by the partners. This autonomy that begets choice is what is protected by law. It is that choice that can complete expression and can define him or her who makes that choice. After all, as social beings, humans are defined by how they choose to be intimate, with whom, and how deeply. </p><p> It is the violation of this choice—this autonomy—that inspires the punishment for rape. Penile penetration was the traditional way to determine whether sexual intercourse has happened. But it should no longer be exclusively so. We should increasingly take the point of view of the victim. For her most fundamental autonomy to choose her intimate partner was violated when her father kissed her, mashed her breasts, inserted her finger into her vagina, and satisfied his lust for her for 30 minutes. She is as much a victim of coerced sexual intercourse as any other woman would be if it was the penis that was inserted. Except that in this case, she is not simply a woman: she is the daughter of the accused.</p><p> The determination of whether chastity was violated, in past cases, may have required a clinical passing of the entire sexual act to privilege the penis and its entry into the vagina. Regardless of its doctrinal presentation in the past, our present, more gender sensitive law and legal lenses now require that we see the acts in sexual intercourse as a whole. To reduce them to their component parts would be to say that the violation of the human dignity of a person insofar as her sexuality is concerned can be understood as a matter of degree.</p><p> By maintaining fatuous classifications, this Court fails to recognize that we create, through our interpretation, a dissonance between the law and the actual scenarios to which they apply. In this case, we would be saying that this father did not rape his daughter as much as he would have raped another woman by forcing his penis in her vagina. We would then go back to the feudal concept of protecting the powerful and graduating his liabilities by traditional but irrational categories. Instead, we should look at the victim and read the law from her perspective as a human being. </p><p> Doing so means that we pronounce that the entirety of what this father did to his daughter was "sexual intercourse" as charged in the information equivalent to "carnal knowledge" in Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code as amended. </p><p> In other words, we square the interpretation of the law with the victim's reality. She was raped by sexual intercourse. </p><p> The persistence of an archaic understanding of rape relates to our failure to disabuse ourselves of the notion that carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse is merely a reproductive activity. It is not. Sexual intercourse may be done for pleasure. It may be done for religious purposes. It may be a means to an end.</p><p> Hence, sexual intercourse encompasses a wide range of sexual activities not limited to those involving penetration, genitals, and opposite sexes. Sexual intercourse is a sexual activity that is participated in by at least two (2) individuals of the same or opposite sex for purposes of attaining erotic pleasure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It may be penetrative or simply stimulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It may or may not involve persons of opposite sexes. When forced, sexual intercourse constitutes rape. </p><p> This understanding of sexual intercourse would prevent courts from unnecessarily and unjustly convicting persons of lesser crimes when they are undoubtedly guilty of rape. </p><p align="center"> <b>II </b> </p><p> Republic Act No. 8353's reconceptualization of rape as a crime against persons and the broadening of its definition to include its other forms point towards this understanding. </p><p> The reconceptualization of rape as a crime against persons is a recognition that rape may be committed to any person regardless of sex and gender. It is also a recognition that rape may be committed through various means. The diversity of means by which rape can be committed allowed our lawmakers to create gradations for purposes of determining the appropriate punishment.</p><p> However, the imposition of different punishments for different manners of committing rape or sexual assault should not be read as a reflection of the actual heinousness of the corresponding acts for the victim. In <i>People v. Quintos y Badilla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> this Court said: </p><p> The classifications of rape in Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code are relevant only insofar as these define the manners of commission of rape. However, it does not mean that one manner is less heinous or wrong than the other. Whether rape is committed by nonconsensual carnal knowledge of a woman or by insertion of the penis into the mouth of another person, the damage to the victim's dignity is incalculable ... [O]ne experience of sexual abuse should not be trivialized just because it was committed in a relatively unusual manner. </p><blockquote> <p> "The prime purpose of [a] criminal action is to punish the offender in order to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense, to isolate him from society, reform and rehabilitate him or, in general, to maintain social order." Crimes are punished as retribution so that society would understand that the act punished was wrong. </p> <p> Imposing different penalties for different manners of committing rape creates a message that one experience of rape is relatively trivial or less serious than another. It attaches different levels of wrongfulness to equally degrading acts. Rape, in whatever manner, is a desecration of a person's will and body. In terms of penalties, treating one manner of committing rape as greater or less in heinousness than another may be of doubtful constitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> By involving the finger only as a means to violate Article 266-A, paragraph 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> thereby equating it to an "instrument or object," this Court misunderstands the gravity and the power used by those who want to defile the person of another through rape. It misunderstands the crime. </p><p> Rape is not an act of pleasure. It is an illicit expression of power. It is not an act that simply addresses the uncontrolled instincts of the perpetrator. It is an act which fulfills a depraved desire to impose one's will on another, reducing the other to the status of a subordinate. </p><p> The finger is as much part of the human body as the penis. It is not a separate instrument or object. It is an organ that can act as a conduit to give both pleasure as well as raw control upon the body of another. At a certain age, when men have difficulty with erections, his finger or any other similar organ becomes a handy tool of oppression. This Court cannot maintain an artificially prudish construction of sexual intercourse. When it does, it becomes blind to the many ways that women's bodies are defiled by the patriarchy. To legally constitute the finger as a separate object not used in "sexual intercourse" or "carnal knowledge" not only defies reality, it undermines the purpose of the punishment under Article 266-A, paragraph 2. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> Even if there is any deficiency in the form of the information, the remedy is not to prejudice the punishment for the wrong done to the victim. Rather it is to call the attention of the prosecutor who drafted the charge. Too often, the mistake of the same leads to acquittal or downgrading of the appropriate punishment. Whether this is due to lack of competence, supervision, design or consideration, the effect is the same. The consequent inability of our institutions to do what is right and just due to trivial technicalities erodes the public's confidence in what we are supposed to do: courageously do what is right and just. When we allow our system to be eroded in this way, rapists would be able to rely on the illicit graciousness of misguided prosecutors. After all, using "sexual intercourse" in lieu of "carnal knowledge" or "sexual assault" is so obviously simple but fraught with a lot of opportunities for the accused. </p><p> Laws should not be read so as to obfuscate reality.

Clearly, the acts of lasciviousness committed on the child are separate and distinct from the <b>other </b>circumstance — that the child is either exploited in prostitution or subjected to "<b>other sexual abuse</b>."</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Section 5 of RA 7610 penalizes those "who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse." The act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct may be committed on a child <b>already exploited in prostitution</b>, whether the child engages in prostitution for profit or someone coerces her into prostitution against her will. The element of profit or coercion refers to the practice of prostitution, not to the sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct committed by the accused. A person may commit acts of lasciviousness even on a prostitute, as when a person mashes the private parts of a prostitute against her will. </p> <p> The sexual intercourse or act of lasciviousness may be committed on a child <strong>already subjected to other sexual abuse</strong>. The child may be subjected to such<strong> other</strong> sexual abuse for profit or through coercion, as when the child is employed or coerced into pornography. A complete stranger, through force or intimidation, may commit acts of lasciviousness on such child in violation of Section 5 of RA 7610. </p> <p> The phrase "<strong>other sexual abuse</strong>" plainly means that the child is already subjected to sexual abuse<strong> other</strong> than the crime for which the accused is charged under Section 5 of RA 7610. The "<strong>other sexual abuse</strong>" is an element separate and distinct from the acts of lasciviousness that the accused performs on the child. The majority opinion admits this when it enumerates the second element of the crime under Section 5 of RA 7610 — that the lascivious "act is performed with a child x x x subjected to other sexual abuse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p> </blockquote> <table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>The allegation of relationship and minority in the Information meets the element of coercion or influence under Section 5(b).</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As I stated in <i>Quimvel</i>, the element of coercion or influence required by Section 5(b) is not met by the allegation in the Information of force and intimidation. I maintain this position. Several features distinguish this case from <i>Quimvel</i>, as the age of the child victim, the relationship of the offender and the child victim, and the manner of the commission of the lascivious conduct as supported by evidence on record. </p><p> The child victim in <i>Quimvel</i> is under twelve (12) years of age, falling within the first proviso of Section 5(b) — that the prosecution shall be under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code. The child victim in this case was fifteen (15) years of age at the time complained of, such that the case falls within the general provision of Section 5(b). In this regard, I concur with Justice Peralta that the designation would properly be a violation of Section 5(b). </p><p> Here, the Information alleged the use of force, threat, or intimidation, along with the relationship and minority. The Information reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of October 2005, at 7:00 o'clock in the evening, more or less, in Purok [III], Barangay [JJJ], [KKK], [LLL], Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named accused, with full freedom and intelligence, with lewd design, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with one [AAA], a minor, fifteen (15) years of age and the daughter of the herein accused, through force, threat and intimidation and against her will, to her damage and prejudice in the amount as may be allowed by law. </p> <p> CONTRARY to Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of R.A. 8353, with the aggravating circumstance that the accused is the father of the victim and R.A. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>People v. Bayya</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court explained the purpose of the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him: </p><blockquote> <p> Elaborating on the defendant's right to be informed, the Court held in <i>Pecho vs. People</i> that the objectives of this right are: </p> <blockquote> <p> 1. To furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make the defense; </p> <p>2. To avail himself of his conviction or acquittal for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause; and</p> <p> 3. To inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction, if one should be had. </p> </blockquote> <p> It is thus imperative that the Information filed with the trial court be complete — to the end that the accused may suitably prepare his defense. Corollary to this, an indictment must fully state the elements of the specific offense alleged to have been committed as it is the recital of the essentials of a crime which delineates the nature and cause of accusation against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> More concretely, the Court explained what the accused must be informed of in <em>United States v. Lim San</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> From a legal point of view, and in a very real sense, it is of no concern to the accused what is the technical name of the crime of which he stands charged. It in no way aids him in a defense on the merits. x x x. That to which his attention should be directed, and in which he, above all things else, should be most interested, are the facts alleged. The real question is not did he commit a crime given in the law some technical and specific name, but did he perform the acts alleged in the body of the information in the manner therein set forth. If he did, it is of no consequence to him, either as a matter of procedure or of substantive right, how the law denominates the crime which those acts constitute. The designation of the crime by name in the caption of the information from the facts alleged in the body of that pleading is a conclusion of law made by the fiscal. In the designation of the crime the accused never has a real interest until the trial has ended. For his full and complete defense he need not know the name of the crime at all. It is of no consequence whatever for the protection of his substantial rights. The real and important question to him is, "Did you perform the acts alleged in the manner alleged?" not "Did you commit a crime named murder?" <b><u>If he performed the acts alleged, in the manner stated, the law determines what the name of the crime is and fixes the penalty therefor. It is the province of the court alone to say what the crime is or what it is named.</u></b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The allegation of relationship and minority in the Information suffices to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and supports a conviction for Section 5(b) under the same Information because it meets the requirement of coercion and influence required to convert a child into one subjected to other sexual abuse as defined by Section 5. This, to me, forecloses any argument that the accused was not informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. </p><p> Neither does it offend against the variance doctrine to determine the existence of the elements of Section 5(b) in a charge of Article 336 or one wherein Article 336 is necessarily included, Section 5(b) being a subset of the universe of lascivious conduct covered by Article 336 of the RPC, is necessarily included in a charge of rape under Section 266-A(2) of the RPC if the specific circumstances required for Section 5(b) to operate can be fairly read into the allegations in the Information and thereafter proved. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>There is sufficient showing that coercion or influence attended AAA's sexual abuse; otherwise, that AAA was a child subjected to other sexual abuse at the time of the lascivious conduct complained of.</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The factual pattern of this case is analogous to that of <i>Larin v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where the Court found the elements of Section 5(b) to be present. Larin, being an adult and the swimming trainor of his 14-year-old victim, had the influence and ascendancy to cow her into submission. Evidence was introduced to show that Larin employed psychological coercion upon his child victim by attacking her self-esteem and then pretending to be attentive to her needs and making himself out to be the only one who could accept her inadequacies. </p><p> To my mind, what was determinative of the existence of the second element of Section 5(b) in <i>Larin</i> was: </p><blockquote> <p> The independent proof given of psychological coercion, prior to the first lascivious conduct against the child victim, coupled with the fact that the lascivious conduct happened on two separate occasions indubitably proved the second element — that the child victim was coerced or influenced by Larin to engage in lascivious conduct at the first instance of lascivious conduct, or, to be sure, on the second instance of lascivious conduct (as the first was already sufficient to convert the child victim into a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Verily, this factual milieu of <i>Larin</i> that places it within the ambit of Section 5(b) involving coercion and influence is shared by this case. From the initial Sworn Statement filed by AAA, she already claimed that the abuse had begun as early as February 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In fact, during AAA's direct testimony, she testified that she had told her mother about the sexual abuse as early as June 2005 but that her mother did not believe her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Therefore, at the time the lascivious conduct was committed upon AAA on October 23, 2005, she was already a child subjected to other sexual abuse — meeting the second essential element. </p> <p> Again, as I have said in Quimvel, this is not to say that in every instance, prior sexual affront upon the child must be shown to characterize the child as one "subjected to other sexual abuse". What is only necessary is to show that the child is already a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse at the time the sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct complained of was committed or that circumstances obtained prior or during the first instance of abuse that constitutes such first instance of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct as having converted the child into a child "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Otherwise, it appears that without the circumstances of Section 5(a) or independent evidence of coercion or influence, a single instance of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct may not be sufficient to meet the second element of Section 5(b).</p><p> Similarly, in <i>People v. Fragante</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> where the Court found the elements of Section 5(b) present in the several instances of sexual intercourse and lascivious conducted committed by the accused against his minor daughter, it was held that actual force or intimidation need not be employed in incestuous rape of a minor because the moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim into submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The appreciation of how the sexual intercourse and lascivious conduct in this case fell within the ambit of Section 5(b) is cogently explained thus: appellant, as a father having moral ascendancy over his daughter, coerced AAA to engage in lascivious conduct, which is within the purview of sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> This is the same situation obtaining in this case, with evidence extant in the records that the child had already been subjected to sexual abuse under circumstances showing coercion and influence (otherwise termed "[a father's] moral and physical dominion" in <i>Fragante</i>) even prior to the act complained of. </p><p> As well, in <i>Malto v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court took pains to determine the existence of the second element, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The second element was likewise present here. The following pronouncement in <i>People v. Larin</i> is significant: </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>A child is deemed</b> exploited in prostitution or<b> subjected to other sexual abuse, when the child indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct</b> (a) for money, profit, or any other consideration; or (b) <b>under the</b> coercion or <b>influence of any adult</b>, syndicate or group. (emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> On November 19, 1997, due to the influence of petitioner, AAA indulged in lascivious acts with or allowed him to commit lascivious acts on her. This was repeated on November 26, 1997 on which date AAA also indulged in sexual intercourse with petitioner as a result of the latter's influence and moral ascendancy. Thus, she was deemed to be a "child subjected to other sexual abuse" as the concept is defined in the opening paragraph of Section 5, Article III of RA 7610 and in <i>Larin</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This is consistent with my position that to secure a conviction for violation of Section 5(b), coercion or influence (or otherwise, that the child indulged in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct for money, profit or other consideration) is a textually-provided circumstance that must be shown.

My refusal to accept this conclusion is grounded on the definition of carnal knowledge that this Court set forth in the 2011 case of <em>People vs. Butiong</em> G.R. No. 168932, 19 October 2011]: </p><blockquote> <p> Carnal knowledge is defined as the act of a man having <strong>sexual bodily connections</strong> with a woman. This explains why the slightest penetration of the female genitalia consummates the rape. [emphasis supplied] </p> </blockquote> <p> The crux of carnal knowledge, then, is <b><i>sexual bodily connection</i></b>. </p><p> The finger is a part of the body by which a sexual bodily connection may be attained. It is an organ that evokes sensations of pleasure, particularly in sexual situations; thus, it should not be deemed as an "object" within the contemplation of the second paragraph of Article 266-A. A man's use of his penis, the tongue, or his finger to penetrate a vagina for the purpose of sexual stimulation or sensation undeniably creates a sexual bodily connection with a woman; thus, <i>carnal knowledge</i> of the woman is achieved. </p><p> I submit that the concept of <i>carnal knowledge</i> should not be limited exclusively to the contact between the penis and the vagina. The word <i>carnal</i>, as defined, describes "in or of the flesh" or "having to do with or preoccupied with bodily or sexual pleasure, sensual or sexual."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> A perpetrator's use of any of his or her organs, such as the tongue or the finger, in order to create bodily pleasure or to penetrate a vagina constitutes carnal knowledge. Consequently, when such carnal knowledge is attained under any of the circumstances in the first paragraph of Article 266-A, the perpetrator should be convicted of Rape under such, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. - Rape is committed: </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td width="2%"><br></td> <td width="94%"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Through force, threat, or intimidation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The use of a body organ in order to <i>penetrate </i>a vagina should be distinguished from the sexual <i>insertion</i> of an instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another. This latter act is defined and punished under the second paragraph of Article 266-A, <i>viz</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. - Rape is committed: </p> <p> xxxx </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Thus, under the two categories of rape created by the twin paragraphs under Article 266-A, when a perpetrator <i>inserts</i> into the genital or anal orifice of another an instrument or object that does not form part of the perpetrator's body, the offense committed is punishable under the second paragraph of Article 266-A; when a perpetrator <i>penetrates</i> a vagina with the use of any of his or her own body parts, the offense committed is punishable under the first paragraph. </p> <p>With this disquisition, I respectfully submit that the majority unduly confines the concept of carnal knowledge under the first paragraph of Article 266-A to penile penetration and, correspondingly, unduly restricts the law's coverage. Such limitation disregards a vital premise in our rape jurisprudence, namely, that carnal knowledge is achieved when a person has<i> sexual bodily connection</i> with a woman. To reiterate: the penetration of a vagina by means of any bodily part such as the finger or tongue is a <i>sexual bodily connection</i>. </p> <p> To limit the concept of carnal knowledge solely to penile penetration is contrary to human experience. Carnal knowledge occurs on a wanton field, and is achieved in sundry ways: vaginal, oral, anal, and fingering. Which brings us back to the case at hand. The majority may take notice that the act of "fingering" a woman, as it has been said time and again, is an act from which women may, unwittingly or not, derive pleasure in varied degrees. Rapists exploit this biological imperative. Our rape jurisprudence is replete with grievous narratives where the perpetrators, before attaining carnal knowledge of their victims through penile means, had already attained carnal knowledge of their victims through the use of their finger on their victim's vagina in a bid to arouse and confuse her, and in the belief that this would facilitate the penile intercourse to follow. The fingering committed, in itself, is already carnal knowledge. In cases of rape, the forced penetration or entry into a woman's most private part by or with whatever means with the use of a bodily organ is carnal knowledge, and an outrage to the dignity of the victim. Fingering is no mere act of lasciviousness. </p><p> I humbly beg that the majority see and punish the crime committed in this case for what it is: Rape. The accused, having been found to have fingered his own daughter, should be convicted of Rape under the first paragraph of Article 266-A. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged), p. 340; New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 216.</div></div><br></div> </div></div></div>
