DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These consolidated administrative matters arose from (<b><i>i</i></b>)
 the Memorandum dated March 30, 2006 of Judge Elpidio R. Calis (Judge 
Calis), Presiding Judge, Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Sta. Cruz, Laguna 
addressed to then Court Administrator, now Associate Justice of the 
Court, Honorable Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr., recommending that Ms. 
Elizabeth R. Tengco (Tengco), Clerk of Court II, MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna 
be suspended from work; that her salaries and other benefits be 
withheld; and that an immediate financial audit of her books of accounts
 be undertaken; and (<b><i>ii</i></b>) the Financial Audit conducted on 
the Books of Accounts of Tengco, the designated custodian of court 
funds, during the period of April 1, 2000 to March 26, 2006. <p align="center"> <b><i><u>Antecedents</u></i></b> 
  </p><p> In a Memorandum dated February 27, 2006, Judge Calis directed Tengco to explain the following: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> 1. Failure to deposit Fiduciary Fund Collection; </p>
    <p> 2. Delayed (sic) in the Release of Cash Bond; </p>
    <p> 3. Failure to prepare and submit your Statement of Unwithdrawn Fiduciary Fund; [and] </p>
    <p> 4. Failure to explain the alleged wrong assessment of filing 
fees of Violation of BP 22 under Criminal Cases (sic) Nos. 32872 to 
32874.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The Memorandum was issued as a result of-- 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> [A] random checking and comparison of Unwithdrawn Cash Bond 
available on [record] and Unwithdrawn Cash Deposit as reflected in the 
Xerox copies of the Fiduciary Bank Book reveals that there are Fiduciary
 Fund Collection duly receipted posted by the accused for the period of 
2004-2005 that were not deposited. </p>
    <p> Furthermore, since the alleged wrong assessment of the filing 
fees you made in the Violation of BP 22 under Criminal Cases (sic) Nos. 
32782 to 32784 and came to the attention of the Court last December 2005
 and after confronting you, and directed to explain, you failed up to 
the present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Criminal Case Nos. 32782-84 involved the violation of Batas 
Pambansa Bilang 22 by the spouses Edwina and Ferdinand Dator before the 
MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The complaint was filed by one Jonathan Rebong 
(Rebong) and his mother. According to Rebong, Tengco required him to pay
 P400,000.00, 	instead of 	just P75,525.00, 	as filing fees for the two 
complaints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p>Due to 
the continued absence of Tengco since February 27, 2006, in a letter 
dated March 1, 2006, Judge Calis wrote the Office of the Court 
Administrator (OCA) for the immediate conduct of a financial audit of 
the Books of Accounts of Tengco on the ground that "<i>there are 
complaints about the delay of released (sic) of the Fiduciary bond due 
to the bondsman after the case has been dismissed or decided. Thus, a 
random checking of [some] approved cash bond duly receipted (sic) by the
 Clerk of Court and compared to the Fiduciary Bank Book reveals that 
cash bond are not deposited on time or not deposited at all</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>    </p><p>
 In the meantime, Judge Calis designated Ms. Leslie San Juan (San Juan),
 Court Stenographer, MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna as the acting accountable 
officer of said sala. </p><p> On March 9, 2006, Judge Calis issued 
another Memorandum to Tengco directing her to report to work, otherwise 
she would be considered AWOL or absent without official leave. However, 
Tengco still failed to do so. </p><p> On March 22, 2006, Judge Calis issued a third Memorandum that (<em>i</em>)
 directed Tengco to submit her monthly report of Judiciary Development 
Fund (JDF), Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF), and 
Fiduciary Fund (FF) collections; (<em>ii</em>) reminded Tengco to turn over all records in her possession; and (<em>iii</em>)
 reiterated his earlier directive to Tengco to explain the alleged wrong
 assessment of filing fees in Criminal Case Nos. 32782-84 for violation 
of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22. 	But, as with the other earlier memoranda, 
Tengco still failed to comply thereto.

October 9, 2006, the Court adopted the recommendation of the OCA. We 
also directed the Legal Office of the OCA to file the appropriate case 
against Tengco. The Partial Report was re-docketed as <u>A.M. No. P-06-2253</u>. </p><p>
 Tengco was furnished copies of the above-mentioned Resolution and Hold

unserved with the notations "<em>RTS-moved out</em>" and "<em>RTS-addressee abroad nobody to receive</em>."
 Similarly, in a Manifestation dated October 31, 2006, Judge Calis 
informed the Court that the Process Server of the MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna
 made two attempts to personally serve the subject Resolution but there 
was no one inside the premises on both times; hence, he was forced to 
leave a copy thereof in the mailbox.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>

  <p>In a Memorandum dated March 30, 2006 to the OCA, Judge Calis recommended the following actions against Tengco: 
  </p><ol><li> 	Request for SUSPENSION of Elizabeth R. Tengco; <br><br></li><li> 	WITH[H]OLDING of her salary and other benefits; <br><br></li><li> 	Declaring her absent without [official] leave (AWOL); <br><br></li><li> 	Reiterating further the request for immediate auditing as 
reflected in the letter of the herein presiding judge dated March 1, 
2006 and indorsed by the Executive Judge, Hon. Mary Ann Enrile Corpuz 
Manalac on March 1, 2006 and received by the Fiscal Monitoring Division 
on March 3, 2006 and also the Office of the Deputy Court Administrator 
Jose P. Perez on March 3, 2006 also; and <br><br></li><li> 	Other appropriate actions under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </li></ol>
  <p> Judge Calis alleged that he had no other option but make the 
abovestated recommendations in view of Tengco's refusal to comply with 
his directive to explain the non-submission of Monthly Report of JDF, 
SAJ and Fiduciary Collections for the month of February 2006 and other 
matters pertaining to her obligations as clerk of court. </p><p> The OCA
 treated the foregoing Memorandum as an administrative complaint for 
grave misconduct and dereliction of duty against Tengco, and docketed it
 as<u> OCA IPI No. 06-2427-P</u> entitled "<em>Judge Elpidio R. Calis v. Elizabeth R. Tengco, Clerk of Court II, MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna</em>." 
  </p><p> Several times Tengco was directed to comment on the 
administrative complaint against her, but all Indorsements sent to her 
address on record were also returned unserved with the notation "<em>RTS-Moved Out</em>."
 Note that it appeared on record, however, that Tengco filed a letter 
dated March 8, 2006 (with attachments) before the Leave Division-OCA, 
wherein she manifested that she was filing her Daily Time Record (DTR) 
for the month of February 2006, an Application for Leave<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> duly signed by
 Judge Calis and a Medical Certificate. 
  </p><p> When asked to comment on Tengco's March 8, 2006 
letter-manifestation with attachments, Judge Calis admitted signing 
Tengco's Application for Leave, but he clarified that it was obtained 
through fraud, <em>i.e</em>., he signed it way back in November 2005 
upon Tengco's representation that the same would be used relative to the
 latter's forced leave credits in 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
  </p><p> In a Memorandum dated June 14, 2007, the OCA made the following evaluation and recommendation, to wit: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Respondent's silence and inaction on the directive of 
complainant can be misinterpreted as admission of guilt. Defying the 
express directive of the complainant to explain her non-submission of 
her report on financial records, she chose not to explain, to the 
prejudice of the service. </p>
    <p> Time and again the Court has pronounced that Public Officers 
must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost 
degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency. A court 
employee's AWOL for a prolonged period of time constitutes conduct 
prejudicial to the best interest of the public service and warrants the 
penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of benefits. </p>
    <p> xxxx </p>
    <p> RECOMMENDATION: XXX </p>
    <ol><li>  That instant administrative complaint be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter; <br><br></li><li> The respondent[,] Elizabeth R. Tengco, be DROPPED from the service and her position declared vacant; [and] <br><br></li><li> This instant administrative complaint be incorporated to AM. 
No. P-06-2253 (OCA vs. Ms. Elizabeth R. Tengco, Clerk of Court II, MTC, 
Sta. Cruz, Laguna).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </li></ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p> By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 15, 2007, the Court adopted the recommendation of the OCA. The administrative complaint was re-docketed as <u>A.M. No. P-07-2360</u> and consolidated with A.M. No. P-06-2253. </p><p> And in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 dated December 8, 2008, taking note that copies of its Hold Departure 
Order issued against Tengco that were sent to her given addresses were 
all returned unserved with the notations "<i>RTS addressee abroad nobody to receive</i>" or ''<i>RTS-moved out</i>," the Court resolved to direct the Legal Office-OCA to file the appropriate criminal case against Tengco. </p><p>
 In a Memorandum dated July 5, 2011, however, the OCA recommended that 
the filing of a criminal case against Tengco be held in abeyance pending
 the completion of the reconciliation of all accounts maintained by the 
MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna. The OCA explained that in another round of 
financial audit conducted on February 15-26, 2011, the Financial Audit 
Team unearthed more discrepancies relative to Tengco's financial 
accounts. The subject recommendation was approved and adopted by the 
Court on August 22, 2011.

 Clerks of Court, as custodians of court funds and revenues, have the 
duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the 
authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep 
funds in their custody. Such functions are highlighted by OCA Circular 
Nos. 50-95 and 113-2004 and Administrative Circular No. 35-2004, which 
mandate Clerks of Court to timely deposit judiciary collections as well 
as to submit monthly financial reports on the same. And failure of the 
Clerk of Court to remit court funds is tantamount to <em>gross neglect of duty, dishonesty</em> and <em>grave misconduct. </em>
  </p><p> Records disclose in this case that there were missing 118 
booklets of official receipts and 87 pieces of official receipts during 
Tengco's term as Clerk of Court of the MTC, Sta. Cruz, Laguna. From the 
Final Report of the Financial Audit Team, her total accountabilities 
amounted to P1,534,916.70, consisting of Clerk of Court Fiduciary Fund 
(P774,603.91), Judiciary Development Fund (P569,851.39), Special 
Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (P124,595.40), General Fund 
(P64,866.00), and Mediation Fund (P1,000.00). Evidently, Tengco was 
remiss in her duties to safeguard the receipts and to deposit on time 
the funds entrusted to her. She likewise failed to comply with Judge 
Calis's memoranda to explain, among other things, her failure to deposit
 fiduciary fund collections, to submit monthly report of collections, 
and to turn over all records in her possession. Her unexplained actions 
coupled with her absence without official leave lead the Court to 
conclude that she went into hiding to run away from her 
accountabilities. Such silence and inaction are indications of guilt. 
And considering the Decision of the Court in A.M. No. P-07-2338, these 
additional administrative cases against her speak eloquently of the 
gravity of her offenses, and should be characterized as gross in nature.
 </p><p> It must be emphasized that the safekeeping of funds and 
collections is essential to an orderly administration of justice, and no
 protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the 
circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds. 
Clerks of Courts and those acting in this capacity perform a delicate 
function as designated custodian of the court's funds, revenues, 
records, properties and premises. Hence, any loss, shortage, and 
destruction or impairment of those funds and property makes them 
accountable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Following the Court's ruling in <em>Office of the Court Administrator v. Panganiban</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Tengco's actions and her continued refusal to make satisfactory 
explanations thereto make her liable for gross neglect of duty, 
dishonesty and grave misconduct, which merit the supreme penalty of 
dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> In 
view, however, of the Resolution dated August 1 5, 2007 wherein Tengco 
was already dropped from the service and her position declared vacant, 
the penalty of dismissal can no longer be imposed. Further, the Decision
 dated April 7, 2010 of the Court in A.M. No. P-07-2338 already barred 
her from future employment in any branch or instrumentality of the 
government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. 
Therefore, all that is left for the Court to do is process the remaining
 balance of previously computed monetary value of Tengco's earned leave 
credits to partly answer for her financial accountabilities to the 
Court; and direct the OCA to finally initiate criminal proceedings 
against her posthaste. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, Elizabeth R. Tengco is held liable for gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, and grave misconduct. </p><p> The 	Financial 	Management	Office, 	Office 	of 	the 	Court Administrator is hereby <strong>DIRECTED</strong> to:

  <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On April 11, 2006, 
Rebong filed a complaint-affidavit against Tengco before the OCA. He 
alleged that he asked Tengco for his official receipts. Tengco, however,
 could only give him photocopies of the supposed receipts; and when 
pressed for the originals thereof, she claimed that she still needed to 
enter them in the books and promised to send them to Rebong as soon as 
possible. But despite repeated demands, Tengco failed to produce and 
turn over the originals of the official receipts. The aforementioned 
complaint-affidavit was eventually docketed as<strong> A.M. No. P-07-2338</strong>, a regular administrative matter against Tengco (<em>Rollo</em> [A.M. No. P-13-3157], p. 41.)

 the Court resolved to withhold the salaries and benefits of Tengco for 
non-submission of Daily Time Records/Bundy Cards until compliance is 
made pursuant to Sec. 50, Rule XVI, CSC MC No. 41. s. 1998 of the 
Omnibus Rules on Leave. Further, the CMO-OCA formed a financial audit
