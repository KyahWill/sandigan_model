At about 11:00 a.m. on the same day, CCC reported this to the barangay captain of Bawod, San Isidro. CCC was first referred to the house of the punong tanod, who was then not around. At noon, he proceeded to the police headquarters.

The dispositive portion of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered convicting the accused, Juanito Entrampas, in Criminal Cases [sic] Nos.

It held that the inconsistencies alleged by Entrampas did not "touch upon the commission of the crime nor affect [the minor victim]'s credibility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The dispositive portion of this Decision reads as follows:<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 11 of Calubian, Leyte, in Criminal Case Nos. CN-04-457 and CN-04-458 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS</b> that the award of civil indemnity and moral damages in both charges are increased to Php75,000.00 each. Further, accused-appellant is ordered to pay Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages as well as the rate of 6% per annum interest on all the damages awarded to be computed from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br><br>On December 2, 2013, Entrampas appealed via a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> before the Court of Appeals, which resolved to give it due course on March 25, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>For resolution is whether accused-appellant Juanito Entrampas is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of statutory rape.<br><br>We affirm the finding of Entrampas' guilt.<br><br>The alleged inconsistencies "are collateral and minor matters which do not at all touch upon the commission of the crime nor affect [the minor victim]'s credibility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> AAAs inability to recall the precise date and time of the rape is immaterial as these are not elements of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Moreover, "rape victims are not expected to cherish in their memories an accurate account of the dates, number of times[,] and manner they were violated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance truth, or weight of the victim's testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> "[M]inor inconsistencies may be expected of [a girl] of such tender years ... who is unaccustomed to a public trial[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> particularly one where she would recount such a harrowing experience as an assault to her dignity. The inconsistencies and contradictions in AAA's declarations are quite expected. The victim is a child less than 12 years old and, therefore, more likely to commit errors than teenagers or adults.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Neither do these alleged discrepancies, not being elements of the crime, diminish the credibility of AAA's declarations. Jurisprudence has consistently given full weight and credence to a child's testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> "Youth and immaturity are badges of truth and sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> "Leeway should be given to witnesses who are minors, especially when they are relating past incidents of abuse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>AAA, then only 11 years old, had no reason to concoct lies against petitioner. Her declarations are generally coherent and intrinsically believable. In <i>People v. Dimanawa</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><blockquote>[R]everence and respect for the elders is deeply rooted in Filipino children and is even recognized by law. Thus, it is against human nature for a ... girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself, as well as her family, to a lifetime of shame, especially when her charge could mean the death or lifetime imprisonment of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Her failures to resist the sexual aggression and to immediately report the incident to the authorities or to her mother do not undermine her credibility. The silence of the rape victim does not negate her sexual molestation or make her charge baseless, untrue, or fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> A minor "cannot be expected to act like an adult or a mature experienced woman who would have the courage and intelligence to disregard the threat to her life and complain immediately that she had been sexually assaulted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Force and intimidation must be appreciated in light of the victim's perception and judgment when the assailant committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In rape perpetrated by close kin, such as the common-law spouse of the child's mother, actual force or intimidation need not be employed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>"While [accused-appellant] was not the biological father of AAA ... [she] considered him as her father since she was a child."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Moral influence or ascendancy added to the intimidation of AAA. It enhanced the fear that cowed the victim into silence. Accused-appellant's physical superiority and moral influence depleted AAAs resolve to stand up against her foster father. The threats to her and her mother's lives, as well as the knife within accused-appellant's reach, further prevented her from resisting her assailant. As accused-appellant sexually assaulted AAA, she cried and pleaded him to stop. Her failure to shout or tenaciously repel accused-appellant does not mean that she voluntarily submitted to his dastardly act.<br><br>Accused-appellant questioned the Regional Trial Court's appreciation of the age of the victim at the time of the commission of rape. He claimed that the birth certificate cast doubt on whether the victim was indeed below 12 years old in February 2003, when the offense was first committed. According to him, AAA's birth certificate should be questioned as it was registered late.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This allegation is speculative.<br><br>Absent proof to the contrary, accused-appellant's objection must be set aside. A public document such as a birth certificate generally enjoys the presumption of regularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Accused-appellant failed to present any evidence to overturn this legal presumption. In <i>Baldos v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>Applications for delayed registration of birth go through a rigorous process. The books making up the civil register are considered public documents and are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the truth of the facts stated there. As a public document, a registered certificate of live birth enjoys the presumption of validity. It is not for [the owner of the birth certificate] to prove the facts stated in his [or her] certificate of live birth, but for petitioners who are assailing the certificate to prove its alleged falsity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, it is not for AAA to prove that the Certificate of Live Birth reflects the truth of the facts stated in it; rather, it is for accused-appellant to rebut the presumption that AAA's birth certificate sufficiently establishes her birth on November 11, 1991. Accused-appellant miserably failed to do this.<br><br>A careful examination of the records shows that there is nothing that would warrant a reversal of the Decisions of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. "[W]hen a woman, especially a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Settled is the rule that "factual findings of the trial court and its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal, unless the trial court is shown to have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>On the two (2) charges of qualified rape, AAA clearly and consistently communicated how accused-appellant threatened and forced her into having sexual congress with him. Sometime in February 2003, accused-appellant made AAA lie down on the floor and warned her that he would kill her and her mother if she called for attention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> He removed AAA's panty, undressed himself, and stripped her of her innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> AAA cried and pleaded him to stop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> She grew more fearful as she saw a knife within the assailant's reach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Accused-appellant again threatened her and her mother's lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Terrified of accused-appellant's threats, AAA did not tell her mother what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>The incident occurred again a week later in February 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Accused-appellant told her to lie down, penetrated her vagina, and then went outside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> AAA stayed in the room upstairs, crying, until BBB came home later that evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> "For the succeeding months, [Entrampas] continued to rape AAA who [kept silent] out of fear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's acts amounted to statutory rape through carnal knowledge under Article 266-A(l)(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>.

AAA was accused-appellant's foster daughter. AAA and her mother, who was accused-appellant's fanner live-in partner, resided with accused-appellant in his house.<br><br>In September 2003, Dr. Bagaporo administered AAA's pregnancy test and found her to be with child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> AAA gave birth on November 3, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> within nine (9) months from the date of the first rape in February 2003.<br><br>Meanwhile, CCC averred that accused-appellant admitted the crime to him, after which CCC reported the incident to the barangay captain and then to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>As against these details and testimonies, all that accused-appellant offered in defense were denials and alibis, which jurisprudence has long considered weak and unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, properly found that the testimonies of AAA, BBB, CCC, and Dr. Bagaporo corroborated each other and supported the physical evidence. There was no showing that the witnesses for the prosecution had ill motives to testify against accused-appellant. Their testimonies are, therefore, accorded full faith and credence.<br><br>Raping a daughter destroys the purity of a father-daughter relationship. It shatters her dignity. It destroys her ability to trust her elders charged with her care. The selfish momentary pleasure of the father will torment her for life. In this case, it will also aggravate with the existence of the child of his daughter. This Court is at a loss for words to describe this evil. All it can do is to increase the amounts awarded to AAA in the hope that she will remember that the law is on her side.<br><br>In view of the depravity of the acts committed by accused-appellant against his 11-year old foster daughter, this Court increases the amounts awarded to AAA, in accordance with jurisprudence:<br><br>For qualified rape through carnal knowledge, this Court modifies the award of civil indemnity from P75,000.00 to P100,000.00; moral damages from P75,000.00 to P100,000.00; and exemplary damages from P30,000.00 to P100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, the Regional Trial Court Decision dated December 6, 2008 and Court of Appeals Decision dated November 6, 2013 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS</b>:<br><br>Judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused, Juanito Entrampas, in Criminal Case Nos.
