				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Disability retirement is conditioned on the incapacity of the employee to continue his or her employment for involuntary causes such as illness or accident. The social justice principle behind retirement benefits also applies to those who are forced to cease from service for disabilities beyond their control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On October 20, 2016, this Court received a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> from Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo M.

She stated that she had been in government service since August 1977 and has been in the judiciary from January 1987 to the present. Justice Cornejo's letter request bore her thumbprint instead of a signature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On February 6, 2017, Presiding Justice Amparo M.

Upon retirement, a Justice of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan or of the Court of Tax Appeals, or a Judge of the regional trial court, metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court in cities, municipal trial court, municipal circuit trial court, shari'a district court, shari'a circuit court, or any other court hereafter established shall be automatically entitled to a lump sum of five (5) years' gratuity computed on the basis of the highest monthly salary plus the highest monthly aggregate of transportation, representation and other allowances such as personal economic relief allowance (PERA) and additional compensation allowance he/she was receiving on the date of his/her retirement and thereafter upon survival after the expiration of five (5) years, to further annuity payable monthly during the residue of his/her natural life pursuant to Section 1 hereof: <i> Provided, however, </i><b>That if the reason for the retirement be any permanent disability contracted during his/her incumbency in office and prior to the date of retirement, he/she shall receive a gratuity equivalent to ten (10) years' salary and the allowances aforementioned:</b> <i> Provided, further, </i>That should the retirement under Section 1(a) hereof be with the attendance of any partial permanent disability contracted during his/her incumbency and prior to the date of retirement, he/she shall receive an additional gratuity equivalent to two (2) years lump sum that he/she is entitled to under this Act; <i> Provided, furthermore, </i>That if he/she survives after ten (10) years or seven (7) years, as the case may be, he/she shall continue to receive a monthly annuity as computed under this Act during the residue of his/her natural life pursuant to Section 1 hereof: <i> Provided, finally, </i>That those who have retired with the attendance of any partial permanent disability five (5) years prior to the effectivity of this Act shall be entitled to the same benefits provided herein[.] (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Justice Cornejo's long and dedicated service warrants no less than all the benefits that the law allows for her condition.
