Osir (Osir), Orozco, Maturan, and Castro were charged with the crime of murder. It read, in part:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 15<sup>th</sup> day of November, 1998, in the City of Surigao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, taking advantage of superior strength and by means of treachery and armed with pointed weapons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Julius Joshua Mata with the use of said pointed weapons hitting the latter on the vital parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which caused the death of said Julius Joshua Mata, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the deceased in such amount as may be allowed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Orozco and Osir were arraigned on January 25, 1999 and pled not guilty, while Castro and Maturan were still at large. Trial for Orozco and Osir ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On March 9, 2002, Maturan was arrested and pled not guilty upon arraignment on July 3, 2002. Castro was arrested on November 23, 2006 and arraigned on December 22, 2006. He offered to plead guilty to the lesser offense of homicide; but this was rejected, and a plea of "not guilty" was entered for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Osir passed away during the course of trial, and the case against him was dismissed in an Order dated February 20, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The version of the prosecution was as follows:<br><br>Eyewitness Susan Lalona (Lalona) testified that on the evening of November 15, 1998, she was at Murillo's Restaurant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Magallanes Street, Surigao City with her friend and herein victim, Julius Joshua Mata (Mata).<br><br>They were the only customers at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Later, Orozco, Osir, Castro, and Maturan, apparently drunk, entered and occupied the table in front of Lalona and Mata. Shortly after they ordered beer, Orozco approached Mata from behind and stabbed him twice with a small bolo. Mata shouted that he was stabbed. Lalona grabbed Orozco and wrestled with him, but he pushed her back. When Mata tried to run out, the rest of the accused caught him. While Maturan and Osir held Mata's arms, Castro stabbed him in the chest. The four (4) accused continued stabbing Mata and ran away when Lalona shouted for help. Lalona took Mata to the Caraga Regional Hospital on a tricycle, but Mata was pronounced dead on arrival. Immediately after, Lalona went to Mata's house and told his relatives what had happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On her way home, Lalona saw Castro walking along Sanchez Construction and reported it to her neighbor, PO1 Ulyses Ibarra (PO1 Ibarra), who then apprehended and took Castro to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Dr. Milagros Regaña (Dr. Regaña) testified that on November 16, 1998, she conducted a post mortem examination on Mata's body, which provided the following details:<br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ESTIMATED WEIGHT : 5'7"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LENGTH : Over 60 kilos (sic)<br><br>FRONT:<br><ol><li>Skin deep incised wound located on the right forehead 7.5 cm. long, extending from the hairline and ending between the right and left eye.<br></li><li>Skin deep incised wound 0.9 cm. long over the right nasal bone.<br></li><li>Small incised wound 1 cm. below wound number 2.<br></li><li>Stab wound measuring 2.4 cm. x 1.3 cm. located on the chest 7 cm. from the midsternal line at the level of the 3 rd right anterior rib, directed downwards and medially towards the left and mediastinum 13 cm. deep.<br></li><li>Stab wound measuring 1 cm. x 4.5 cm. located on the postero-medial side, middle 3rd of right arm.<br></li><li>Abrasion, posterior [side] of right elbow.<br></li><li>Abrasion posterior side 3 cm. below wound number 6.<br></li><li>Confluent abrasion medial side of the right big toe.<br></li><li>Confluent abrasion medial side of the left big toe.<br></li></ol>BACK<br><br>Wound No. 1 Stab wound measuring 1.7 cm. by 0.6 cm. 4.5 cm. from the middle 3<sup>rd</sup> of the right shoulder line 3.5 cm. deep directed towards the right shoulder joint.<br><br>Wound No. 2 Stab wound measuring 1.7 cm. x 0.6 cm. 13 cm. deep at the level of the 9[th] thoracic vertebra directed downwards along the left side of the 10<sup>th</sup> to the 12<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae and to the 1st lumbar vertebra.<br><br>Wound No. 3 Stab wound measuring 2.3 cm. x 1 cm, 10.5 cm. deep 7 cm. from the 6<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra directed anteriorly and towards the right shoulder[.]<br><br>Wound No. 4 Stab wound measuring 2.6 cm. x 1.2 cm. directed anteriorly and downwards towards the posterior right axillary line and the right upper quadrant of the abdomen 18 cm. deep.<br><br>Wound No. 5 Linear abrasion 1.5 cm. located on the lateral side of the right forearm, distal 3<sup>rd</sup>.<br><br>Wound No. 6 Confluent abrasion over the left carpo phalangeal joint of the middle finger volar area.<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH:<br><br>Cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to Severe Blood Loss secondary to Stab wounds on the chest and back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Dr. Regaña also testified that the size and nature of Mata's wounds could indicate the use of at least two (2) separate weapons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Mata's parents testified that they incurred P120,000.00 as funeral expenses for Mata.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Marlowe Cabana (SPO1 Cabana) and PO1 Ibarra testified on the respective arrests of Osir and Castro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The version of the defense was as follows:<br><br>All the accused admitted that on the night of November 15, 1998, after drinking beer at Pacelan Videoke in Bilang-bilang, Surigao City, they ordered another round of beer at Murillo's Restaurant.

The woman yelled, "Ta, run ta," and Mata ran to the exit. Castro thought that Mata may have stabbed Orozco, so he took a knife from a bucket of utensils and chased Mata. Orozco overtook Mata then stabbed him in the chest once. Seeing the ensuing commotion, Castro ran away from Murillo's Restaurant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Atty.

The dispositive portion of this Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISED.

The only element disputed in this case is that the killing was attended by circumstances which qualify the crime as murder.<br><br>In <i>People v. Dela Cruz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make. The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without a warning and in a swift, deliberate, and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape. For treachery to be considered, two elements must concur: (1) the employment of means of execution that gives the persons attacked no opportunity to defend themselves or retaliate; and (2) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>The circumstances proved by the prosecution amply show that treachery attended the killing of Mata:<br><blockquote>As above-stated, Mata was completely helpless. His hands were held by two other persons while he was stabbed. To make matters worse, four persons, who were armed with knives, ganged-up on Mata. Certainly, Mata was completely deprived of any prerogative to defend himself or to retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant claims that the prosecution failed to prove that treachery attended the killing of Mata, positing that the finding of treachery was based only on the fact that Orozco stabbed Mata suddenly in the back, which is insufficient to establish treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This argument has no merit. Contrary to accused-appellant's contention, the finding of treachery was not based only on Orozco's act of swiftly stabbing Mata from behind. As observed by the Court of Appeals, Mata was helpless against a group of persons with knives, who ganged up on him and held his hands while stabbing him.<br><br>There is likewise no sufficient ground to overturn the finding of conspiracy.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two (2) or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Its existence may be inferred and proved through acts that show a common purpose, a concert of action, and a community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In this case, the prosecution proved the common purpose of all the accused, a concert of action, and a community of interest. This Court quotes the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>In the case at hand, the overwhelming evidence is to the effect that accused-appellants and their co-accused acted in concert with a unity of purpose to kill Mata. After Orozco stabbed Mata in the back, the latter mustered his remaining strength to run away from his assailants. However, Osir, Maturan, and Castro chased and caught Mata. While Osir and Maturan held the hands of Mata, Castro stabbed the latter's chest. This caused Mata to fall on the ground. Still not contented with the dismal condition of the victim, all of the accused continued on stabbing the victim. Such carnage would not have stopped if not for the shouting made by Lalona to call for help. Clearly, the acts of the accused-appellants showed a unity of the criminal design to kill Mata.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant insists that Lalona's testimony was insufficient to establish that he and his co-accused acted in conspiracy with one another, considering that it was not shown that they assumed positions or made statements showing a prior intention to kill Mata.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This claim has no merit. The finding of conspiracy was based on the fact that Orozco delivered the initial stabs to Mata's back and that the others chased, held down, and continued attacking him when he attempted to escape. This finding was based on overt acts by all the accused, which were determined to be concerted actions.<br><br>Accused-appellant insists that Lalona's testimony is inconsistent, uncertain, and insufficient to establish treachery and conspiracy on the part of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This argument must be rejected.<br><br>The trial court's factual findings, assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the probative weight of their testimonies, and conclusions based on these factual findings are to be given the highest respect. When these have been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, this Court will generally not re-examine them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Here, the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court found Lalona's testimony to be credible, considering that it was candid, categorical, and straightforward:<br><blockquote>Lalona, the eye-witness to the gruesome killing of Mata, was candid, categorical and straightforward throughout the course of her examination. Hence the trial court gave ample credence to the testimony of the said witness.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Lalona, in her testimony, convincingly narrated a complete picture of what really transpired during that fateful night. . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Moreover, whatever doubts that surrounded Lalona's credibility as an eyewitness were purged by her clear and straightforward testimony during the trial. While there might have been several minor inconsistencies in her testimony, Lalona was nonetheless able to give a candid narration of the crime which she claimed to have transpired right before her very eyes. Certainly, this Court does not demand from the said witness a blow by blow account of the incident. Her positive identification of the accused-appellants in open court as the persons who stabbed and mauled the victim was unerring. A truth-telling witness is not always expected to give an error-free testimony, considering the lapse of time and treachery of human memory. Thus, We have followed the rule in accord with human nature and experience that honest inconsistencies on minor and trivial matters serve to strengthen, rather than destroy, the credibility of a witness, especially of witnesses to crimes shocking to conscience and numbing to senses.<br><br>It should be noted that Lalona was recalled several times to the witness stand because of the fact that herein appellants were arrested long after the prosecution rested its case. Lalona first testified on February 22, 1999. Then, on November 22, 2002, she testified again after the arrest of Maturan. And finally, on April 26, 2007, she appeared before the trial court after the arrest of Castro. Given the foregoing, it would be unreasonable to expect from Lalona to recall to the exact detail the testimony she had given years ago.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Accused-appellant has failed to present any cogent reason to reverse the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and of the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>However, in line with current jurisprudence, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages shall be awarded to the heirs of Mata.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court <b>ADOPTS</b> the findings of fact and conclusions of the Court of Appeals November 28, 2013 Decision in CA-G.R.
