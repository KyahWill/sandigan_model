On the other hand, we agree with the findings of the Office of the Court Administrator that Rota is guilty of gross neglect of duty.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>There was clearly an undue delay in resolving the two (2) motions. Judge Walse-Lutero, however, attributes the delay to the failure of the Branch Clerk of Court to refer to her the records of the ejectment case for resolution.<br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator found Judge Walse-Lutero's explanation sufficient to clear her from any administrative liability. We disagree.<br><br>While the Branch Clerk of Court was remiss in not calling respondent's attention to the pending incident in Civil Case No. 06-35758, this does not completely exculpate respondent from liability. As the presiding judge, it was respondent's responsibility to know which cases or motions were submitted for decision or resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Judges are expected to closely follow the development of cases and in this respect, "to keep [their] own record of cases so that [they] may act on them promptly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In <i>RE: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted at the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 55, Malabon City,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court held that "[j]udges and branch clerks of court should conduct personally a physical inventory of the pending cases in their courts and examine personally the records of each case [not only] at the time of their assumption to office, [but] every semester thereafter on 30 June and 31 December."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> "[T]he regular and continuing physical inventory of cases enable[s] the judge to keep abreast of the status of the pending cases and to be informed that everything in the court is in proper order."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Responsibility rests primarily on the judge and he or she "cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or .mismanagement of his personnel."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In this case, the motions were submitted for resolution on September 12, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> On March 17, 2010, Rapsing even filed a Manifestation and Motion informing the court about the two (2) pending motions, and praying for their resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Had Judge Walse-Lutero been more circumspect in discharging her judicial duties, she would have discovered the pending incidents in the ejectment case. Instead, she found out about the unresolved motions only in March 2011 when she was apprised by the Office of the Court Administrator of the present administrative complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Respondent explained that she had worked hard to considerably reduce the caseload of her sala<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and had endeavored to personally monitor all the cases in her court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, in 2009, she was usually on leave to look after her Stage 2A colon cancer-diagnosed husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This situation forced her to rely on her legal researcher and on Rota to update her on urgent matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Later on, she also had to care for her son who was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>While respondent's domestic concerns deserve some consideration from this Court, such circumstances could only mitigate her liability. Judges have the duty to administer justice without delay. Judge Walse-Lutero should bear in mind that those charged with the task of dispensing justice carry a heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> As a frontline official of the Judiciary, a trial judge should at all times maintain professional competence and observe the high standards of public service and fidelity. Her dedication to duty is the least she could do to sustain the public's trust and confidence not only in her but more importantly in the institution she represents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Had respondent Judge Walse-Lutero physically inventoried her cases on a semestral basis as prescribed, she could have discovered the unresolved pending incidents earlier, instead of two (2) years later. The resolution of two (2) fairly simple motions dragged on for more than two (2) years â thereby prolonging the resolution of the ejectment case â because of respondent's lapse.<br><br>In <i>Atty. de Jesus v.

They play a key role in the complement of the court and cannot be permitted to slacken on their jobs under one pretext or another. They must be assiduous in performing their official duties and in supervising and managing court dockets and records. On their shoulders, as much as those of judges, rest the responsibility of closely following development of cases, such that delay in the disposition of cases is kept to a minimum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Judge Walse-Lutero further pointed out that Rota had not improved despite being repeatedly called to task for her incompetence and negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In fact, Judge Walse-Lutero added that while Rota held the position of branch clerk of court, her functions were delegated to other court personnel because of her poor performance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> "More often than not, she [could] be seen either reading a novel, eating, or staring at the ceiling."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Despite these serious charges of incompetence and unsatisfactory performance against her, the only explanation that Rota could offer was the high volume of caseload in the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> The volume of work, however, cannot be an excuse for her being remiss in the performance of her functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> By her assumption of the position of clerk of court, it is understood that she was ready and competent to do her job with utmost devotion and efficiency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Rota's apathy towards her duties and responsibilities as Branch Clerk of Court is inimical to the prompt and proper administration of justice.<br><br>Simple neglect of duty is defined as the failure of an employee to give one's attention to a task expected of him or her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Gross neglect of duty is such neglect which, "from the gravity of the case or the frequency of instances, becomes so serious in its character as to endanger or threaten the public welfare."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In <i>GSIS v. Manalo:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Gross neglect of duty or gross negligence 'refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or <i>omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, </i>not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the <i>omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property.' </i> It denotes a <i>flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty. </i>In cases involving public officials, gross negligence occurs when a <i>breach of duty is flagrant and palpable. </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Rota's neglect in this case is gross, bordering on utter carelessness or indifference, to the prejudice of the public she was duty-bound to serve. Her inattentiveness and lack of any effort to even look for the case records, despite several follow-ups from the complainant, caused unnecessary and undue delay in the progress of the ejectment case.<br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator recommended a penalty of suspension of six (6) months in view of Rota's 20 years in government service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> We disagree with the penalty.<br><br>This is not the first offense of Rota.

Despite these opportunities, and this Court's previous sanctions and repeated warnings that similar acts would be severely dealt with, Rota had not improved in her performance as Branch Clerk of Court. The previous warnings from this Court did not effectively rouse Rota to be more mindful of her duties. Judge Walse-Lutero had clearly expressed her dissatisfaction with Rota's performance and gave her unsatisfactory performance evaluation ratings. Rota was asked twice to explain why she should not be dropped from the service for her incompetence and negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Judge Walse-Lutero had even elevated the issue of Rota's incompetence before the Office of the Court Administrator many times. Rota had not given any satisfactory explanation.<br><br>Clerks of Court are at the forefront of judicial administration because of their indispensable role in case adjudication and court management. They are the models for the court employees "to act speedily and with dispatch on their assigned task[s] to avoid the clogging of cases in court and thereby assist in the administration of justice without undue delay."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Moreover, as public officers, they should discharge their tasks with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency guided by the principle that "public office is a public trust."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>The frequency by which Rota neglected her duties and her lack of remorse reveal that there is no more justification for her to stay longer in her position. Rota clearly failed to meet the requirements expected of her as a Branch Clerk of Court. Her apathy evinces an utter lack of concern for her role as a "sentinel of justice." Her repeated infractions "seriously compromise[d] efficiency and hamper[ed] public service."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Rota was not even diligent in complying with the orders of this Court.
