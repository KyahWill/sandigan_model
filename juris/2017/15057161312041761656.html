When they approached him, the man ran away. After a brief chase, the man was cornered. PO2 Paule noticed that he was nervous and sweating. His right leg was stained with blood and his right waistline was bulging with an object, which turned out to be a double bladed 9-inch mini kris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He did not answer when asked about the bloodstain on his leg.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p> <p>They brought him to the police station where he identified himself as Jerry Dela Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The bag yielded three (3) reams of Marlboro cigarettes, a lighter, some coins, and a blue denim wallet with cash in different denominations amounting to P1,470.00.

He also saw that "[t]he store was forcibly opened and some of the store articles were disarranged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Inside the house, he found one (1) of the rooms in the second floor ransacked and in total disarray. He requested the Scene of the Crime Operative team, which took pictures of the crime scene,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to bring the bodies of the victims to the morgue for appropriate autopsy by the National Bureau of Investigation. He proceeded to the Caloocan police precinct where he saw Dela Cruz and Opiniano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> The Caloocan police turned over to SPO2 Ko the multi-colored bag with its contents and the mini-kris that were recovered from Dela Cruz. SPO2 Ko brought the bloodstained bills, the mini-kris, and the knife found by Estrella to the National Bureau of Investigation for testing of human blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He did not take the fingerprints of the accused or submit the items for fingerprinting at the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory before submitting them to the National Bureau of Investigation because he thought it was no longer necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p>SPO2 Ko brought Dela Cruz and Opiniano to the La Loma Police Station for further investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> PO3 Gomez conducted the body search on the suspects.

On November 26, 1997, Lumayag, his first cousin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> visited him at his employer's house. Lumayag borrowed from him P50.00 to buy food. The following day, November 27, 1997, Lumayag visited him again to ask for cigarettes. Before leaving, however, Lumayag disclosed that he would come back on November 29, 1997 to rob his employer's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> When Dela Cruz dissuaded Lumayag from his plans, the latter merely replied, "<em>Bahala ka, pupunta rin ako dyan</em>. "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> Around 8:00 p.m. of November 29, 1997, Dela Cruz was eating in the kitchen when he heard Leonor shouting for help.
