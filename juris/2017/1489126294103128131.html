A subdivision owner must comply with such requirement before the subdivision plan is approved and the authority to sell is issued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Under this compulsion, the dispositive portion of the 1991 <i>White Plains</i> Decision proceeds to state:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is GRANTED. The questioned orders of respondent judge dated July 10, 1990 and September 26, 1990 are hereby reversed and set aside. <i>Respondent QCDFC is hereby directed to execute a deed of donation of the remaining undeveloped portion of Road Lot 1 consisting of about 18 meters wide in favor of the Quezon City government, otherwise, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is hereby directed to cancel the registration of said Road Lot 1 in the name of respondent QCDFC under TCT No. 112637 and to issue a new title covering said property in the name of the Quezon City government. </i>Costs against respondent QCDFC.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The Department of Public Works and Highways is in grave error.<br><br>Petitioner's reliance on the 1991 <i>White Plains</i> Decision is misplaced. The same 1991 Decision was not the end of litigation relating to the widening of Katipunan Road. The owner and developer of White Plains Subdivision, Quezon City Development and Financing Corporation (QCDFC), went on to file motions for reconsideration. The second of these motions was granted in this Court's July 27, 1994 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This Resolution expressly discarded the compulsion underscored by the Department of Public Works and Highways, and the dispositive portion of the 1991 <i>White Plains</i> Decision was modified accordingly. As this Court recounted in its 1998 Decision in <i>White Plains Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he dictum in G.R. No. 95522, White Plains Association, Inc. <i>vs. </i>Legaspi[,] that the developer can be compelled to execute a deed of donation of the undeveloped strip of Road Lot 1 and, in the event QCDFC refuses to donate the land, that the Register of Deeds of Quezon City may be ordered to cancel its old title and issue a new one in the name of the city was questioned by the respondent QCDFC as contrary to law. We agree with QCDFC that <b><i>the final judgment in G.R. No. 95522 is not what appears in the published on February 7, 1991 decision in White Plains Association, Inc. vs. Legaspi.</i></b><i> </i>[Rather, it] is the following resolution issued three (3) years later, on July 27, 1991 [sic], which states, <i>inter alia:</i><br><br><blockquote>". . . (T)he Court is constrained to grant the Instant Motion for Reconsideration but only insofar as the motion seeks to delete from the dispositive portion of the decision of 07 February 1991 the order of this Court requiring the execution of the deed of donation in question and directing the Register of Deeds of Quezon City, in the event that such deed is not executed, to cancel the title of QCDFC and to issue a new one in the name of the Quezon City government. It may well be that the public respondents would not be aversed [sic] to such modification of the Court's decision since they shall in effect have everything to gain and nothing to lose.<br><br>WHEREFORE the second motion for reconsideration is hereby partly granted by MODIFYING the dispositive portion of this Court's decision of 07 February 1991 and to now read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>'WHEREFORE the petition is GRANTED. The questioned orders of respondent judge dated July 10, 1990 and September 25 1990 are hereby reversed and set aside. Costs against respondent QCDFC.<br><br>SO ORDERED."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>The 1998 <i>White Plains</i> Decision unequivocally repudiated the 1991 <i>White Plains</i> Decision's allusion to a compulsion on subdivision developers to cede subdivision road lots to government, so much that it characterized such compulsion as an "illegal taking."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It did away with any preference for government's capacity to compel cession and, instead, emphasized the primacy of subdivision owners' and developers' freedom in retaining or disposing of spaces developed as roads. In making its characterization of an "illegal taking," this Court quoted with approval the statement of the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>Only after a subdivision owner has developed a road may it be donated to the local government, if it so desires. On the other hand, a subdivision owner may even opt to retain ownership of private subdivision roads, as in fact is the usual practice of exclusive residential subdivisions for example those in Makati City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>In insisting on a compulsion on subdivision owners and developers to cede open spaces to government, the Department of Public Works and Highways references Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1216, otherwise known as the Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree.<br><br>The first paragraph of Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 957 spells out the minimum area requirement for roads and other open spaces in subdivision projects. Its second paragraph spells out taxonomic or classification parameters for areas reserved for parks, playgrounds, and for recreational use. It also requires the planting of trees. The last paragraph of Section 31 <i>requires—</i>note the use of the word "shall"—subdivision developers to donate to the city or municipality with territorial jurisdiction over the subdivision project all such roads, alleys, sidewalks, and open spaces. It also imposes upon cities and municipalities the concomitant <i>obligation</i> or compulsion to accept such donations:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 31. Roads, Alleys, Sidewalks and Open Spaces. — The owner as developer of a subdivision shall provide adequate roads, alleys and sidewalks. For subdivision projects one (1) hectare or more, the owner or developer shall reserve thirty percent (30%) of the gross area for open space. Such open space shall have the following standards allocated exclusively for parks, playgrounds and recreational use:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>9% of gross area for high density or social housing (66 to 100 family lot per gross hectare).<br></li><li>7% of gross area for medium-density or economic housing (21 to 65 family lot per gross hectare).<br></li><li>3.5% of gross area low-density or open market housing (20 family lots and below per gross hectare).</li></ol><br><br>These areas reserved for parks, playgrounds and recreational use shall be non-alienable public lands, and non-buildable. The plans of the subdivision project shall include tree planting on such parts of the subdivision as may be designated by the Authority.<br><br>Upon their completion as certified to by the Authority, the roads, alleys, sidewalks and playgrounds <i>shall be donated </i>by the owner or developer to the city or municipality and <i>it shall be mandatory for the local governments to accept; </i>provided, however, that the parks and playgrounds may be donated to the Homeowners Association of the project with the consent of the city or municipality concerned. No portion of the parks and playgrounds donated thereafter shall be converted to any other purpose or purposes. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The last paragraph of Section 31 is oxymoronic. One cannot speak of a donation and compulsion in the same breath.<br><br>A donation is, by definition, "an act of liberality." Article 725 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 725. Donation is an act of liberality whereby a person disposes gratuitously of a thing or right in favor of another, who accepts it.</blockquote><br>To be considered a donation, an act of conveyance must necessarily proceed freely from the donor's own, unrestrained volition. A donation cannot be forced: it cannot arise from compulsion, be borne by a requirement, or otherwise be impelled by a mandate imposed upon the donor by forces that are external to him or her. Article 726 of the Civil Code reflects this commonsensical wisdom when it specifically states that conveyances made in view of a "demandable debt" cannot be considered true or valid donations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In jurisprudence, <i>animus donandi </i>(that is, the intent to do an act of liberality) is an indispensable element of a valid donation, along with the reduction of the donor's patrimony and the corresponding increase in the donee's patrimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Section 31's compulsion to donate (and concomitant compulsion to accept) cannot be sustained as valid. Not only does it run afoul of basic legal concepts; it also fails to withstand the more elementary test of logic and common sense. As opposed to this, the position that not only is more reasonable and logical, but also maintains harmony between our laws, is that which maintains the subdivision owner's or developer's freedom to donate or not to donate. This is the position of the 1998 <i>White Plains </i>Decision. Moreover, as this 1998 Decision has emphasized, to force this donation—and to preclude any compensation—is to suffer an illegal taking.<br><br><center><blockquote><b>III</b><br></blockquote></center><br>The Court of Appeals correctly stated that a "positive act"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> must first be made by the "owner-developer before the city or municipality can acquire dominion over the subdivision roads."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As there is no such thing as an automatic cession to government of subdivision road lots, an actual transfer must first be effected by the subdivision owner: "subdivision streets belonged to the owner until donated to the government or until expropriated upon payment of just compensation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Stated otherwise, "the local government should first acquire them by donation, purchase, or expropriation, if they are to be utilized as a public road."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>This Court's 2014 Decision in <i>Republic v. Ortigas</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> succinctly captures all that we have previously stated:<br><br><blockquote>Delineated roads and streets, whether part of a subdivision or segregated for public use, remain private and will remain as such until conveyed to the government by donation or through expropriation proceedings. An owner may not be forced to donate his or her property even if it has been delineated as road lots because that would partake of an illegal taking. He or she may even choose to retain said properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Department of Public Works and Highways makes no claim here that the road lots covered by TCT No. 179165 have actually been donated to the government or that their transfer has otherwise been consummated by respondents. It only theorizes that they have been automatically transferred. Neither has expropriation ever been fully effected. Precisely, we are resolving this expropriation controversy only now.<br><br>Respondents have not made any positive act enabling the City Government of Parañaque to acquire dominion over the disputed road lots. Therefore, they retain their private character (albeit all parties acknowledge them to be subject to an easement of right of way). Accordingly, just compensation must be paid to respondents as the government takes the road lots in the course of a road widening project.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED.</b> The assailed October 14, 2010 Decision of the Fifth Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
