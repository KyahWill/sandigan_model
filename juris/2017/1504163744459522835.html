Alfredo went to the living room<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and peered through the jalousie window.

The nipa hut and its contents were completely destroyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The local authorities conducted an investigation on the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The defense presented Bacerra, Alex Dacanay (Dacanay), and Jocelyn Fernandez (Fernandez) as witnesses. Their collective testimonies yielded the defense's version of the incident:<br><br>At around 11:00 p.m. of November 14, 2005, Bacerra was at the house of his friend, Ronald Valencia. The two (2) engaged in a drinking session with Dacanay and a certain Reyson until 1:00 a.m. of November 15, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Bacerra asked Dacanay to take him to his grandmother's house.

She checked on Bacerra every hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> At around 7:00 a.m., police officers who were looking for Bacerra arrived at Fernandez's house.<sup style="color:

People of the Philippines to comment on the petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>On June 18, 2013, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a Comment on the Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to which petitioner filed a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> on January 27, 2014.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding his conviction based on circumstantial evidence, which, being merely based on conjecture, falls short of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> No direct evidence was presented to prove that petitioner actually set fire to private complainant's nipa hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Moreover, there were two (2) incidents that occurred, which should be taken and analyzed separately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner adds that there were material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Petitioner also points out that private complainant acted contrary to normal human behavior, placing great doubt on his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Persons whose properties are being destroyed should immediately confront the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Private complainant and his family, however, merely stayed inside their house throughout the entire incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

the imposable penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Petitioner was drunk at the time of the alleged incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In addition, he voluntarily surrendered to the authorities despite the absence of an arrest warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Lastly, petitioner asserts that temperate damages should not have been awarded because private complainant could have proven actual damages during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In its Comment, respondent asserts that direct evidence is not the only means to establish criminalliability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> An accused may be convicted based on circumstantial evidence as long as the combination of circumstances leads to the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court's decision. For intoxication to be considered as a mitigating circumstance, it must be shown that it is not habitual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The state of drunkenness of the accused must be of such nature as to affect his or her mental faculties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Voluntary surrender cannot likewise be considered as a mitigating circumstance because there is no showing of spontaneity on the part of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondent argues that temperate damages amounting to P50,000.00 was properly awarded because the burning of private complainant's nipa hut brought some pecuniary loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>This case presents the following issues for this Court's resolution:<br><br>First, whether petitioner's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt based on the circumstantial evidence adduced during trial;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Second, whether the mitigating circumstances of intoxication and voluntary surrender may properly be appreciated in this case to reduce the imposable penalty;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and<br><br>Finally, whether the award of temperate damages amounting to P50,000.00 was proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>This Court affirms petitioner's conviction for the crime of simple arson.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Direct evidence and circumstantial evidence are classifications of evidence with legal consequences.<br><br>The difference between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence involves the relationship of the fact inferred to the facts that constitute the offense. Their difference does not relate to the probative value of the evidence.<br><br>Direct evidence proves a challenged fact without drawing any inference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Circumstantial evidence, on the other hand, "indirectly proves a fact in issue, such that the fact-finder must draw an inference or reason from circumstantial evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The probative value of direct evidence is generally neither greater than nor superior to circumstantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The Rules of Court do not distinguish between "direct evidence of fact and evidence of circumstances from which the existence of a fact may be inferred."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The same quantum of evidence is still required.

Acosta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> there was also no direct evidence linking the accused to the burning of the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> However, the circumstantial evidence was substantial enough to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The accused had motive and previously attempted to set a portion of the victim's house on fire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Moreover, he was present at the scene of the crime before and after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in this case, no one saw petitioner actually set fire to the nipa hut. Nevertheless, the prosecution has established multiple circumstances, which, after being considered in their entirety, support the conclusion that petitioner is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple arson.<br><br>First, the evidence was credible and sufficient to prove that petitioner stoned private complainant's house and threatened to burn him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Private complainant testified that he saw petitioner throwing stones at his house and heard petitioner say, "<i>okinam nga Lakay Fred, puuran kayo tad ta!</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Vulva of your mother, Old Fred, I'll burn you now.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Petitioner's threats were also heard by private complainant's son<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and grandchildren.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Second, the evidence was credible and sufficient to prove that petitioner returned a few hours later and made his way to private complainant's nipa hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Private complainant testified that at 4:00 a.m.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> he saw petitioner pass by their house and walk towards their nipa hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> This was corroborated by private complainant's son who testified that he saw petitioner standing in front of the nipa hut moments before it was burned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Third, the evidence was also credible and sufficient to prove that petitioner was in close proximity to the nipa hut before it caught fire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Private complainant testified that he saw petitioner walk to and fro in front of the nipa hut and shake its posts just before it caught fire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Private complainant's son likewise saw petitioner standing at the side of the nipa hut before it was burned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The stoning incident and the burning incident cannot be taken and analyzed separately. Instead, they must be viewed and considered as a whole. Circumstantial evidence is like a "tapestry made up of strands which create a pattern when interwoven."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Each strand cannot be plucked out and scrutinized individually because it only forms part of the entire picture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The events that transpired prior to the burning incident cannot be disregarded. Petitioner's threat to burn occurred when he stoned private complainant's house.<br><br>Also, there is no other reasonable version of the events which can be held with reasonable certainty.<br><br>Private complainant could have actually seen petitioner burn the nipa hut by stepping outside of his house. However, behavioral responses of individuals confronted with strange, startling, or frightful experiences vary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Where there is a perceived threat or danger to survival, some may fight, others might escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Private complainant's act of remaining inside his house during the incident is not contrary to human behavior. It cannot affect his credibility as a witness.<br><br>Furthermore, "the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a function ... of the trial courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> It is a factual matter that generally cannot be reviewed in a Rule 45 petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Petitioner failed to prove, much less allege, any of the exceptions to the general rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review brought under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Hence, this Court will not disturb the trial court's findings on the matter.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>For intoxication to be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance, the intoxication of the accused must neither be "habitual [n]or subsequent to the plan to commit [a] felony."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it must be shown that the mental faculties and willpower of the accused were impaired in such a way that would diminish the accused's capacity to understand the wrongful nature of his or her acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The bare assertion that one is inebriated at the time of the commission of the crime is insufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> There must be proof of the fact of intoxication and the effect of intoxication on the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>There is no sufficient evidence in this case that would show that petitioner was intoxicated at the time of the commission of the crime. A considerable amount of time had lapsed from petitioner's drinking spree up to the burning of the nipa hut within which he could have regained control of his actions. Hence, intoxication cannot be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance in this case.<br><br>Neither can voluntary surrender be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance.<br><br>Voluntary surrender, as a mitigating circumstance, requires an element of spontaneity. The accused's act of surrendering to the authorities must have been impelled by the acknowledgment of guilt or a desire to "save the authorities the trouble and expense that may be incurred for his [or her] search and capture."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>Based on the evidence on record, there is no showing that petitioner's act of submitting his person to the authorities was motivated by an acknowledgement of his guilt.<br><br>Considering that no mitigating circumstances attended the commission of the crime, the indeterminate sentence of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum, imposed by the trial court, stands.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Under Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages may be awarded when there is a finding that "some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount [cannot], from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."
