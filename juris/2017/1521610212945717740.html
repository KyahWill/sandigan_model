On the other hand, respondents claim that petitioners did not properly substitute Piedad upon his death; hence, they failed to substantiate their personality to move for the revival of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Respondents fail to convince.

Judge Estrera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> petitioners filed an administrative case in their capacity as Piedad's heirs and this Court acknowledged their standing to sue in this capacity. The same is also true in the assailed Court of Appeals September 15, 1998 Decision where petitioners filed their appeal as Piedad's heirs and their personality to represent their father was never questioned or assailed.<br><br>This Court upheld petitioners' personality to sue in <i>Heirs of Simeon Piedad</i> and sees no reason to deny them the same recognition in the case at bar when the current case is merely an offshoot of their father's original complaint for nullity of deed of sale.<br><br>Furthermore, this Court takes judicial notice of how respondents, through their counsels,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> deliberately and maliciously delayed the execution of a final and executory judgment by filing patently dilatory actions. These actions include the Petition for the Probate of the Last Will and Testament of Simeon Piedad,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> filed in the same case as Piedad's complaint for annulment of absolute deed of sale. The Petition for Probate of the Last Will and Testament of Simeon Piedad was filed in response to the Writ of Demolition issued on December 4, 2001, pursuant to the final and executory Court of Appeals September 15, 1998 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 38652.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Respondents, through their counsels, further delayed the execution of the judgment by filing a petition against Sheriff Bellones of Branch 9, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City to restrain him from enforcing the writ of demolition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The extent of the insidious machinations employed by respondents and their counsels were highlighted when they assailed petitioners' motion for execution for purportedly being filed beyond the prescriptive period of 10 years, when they themselves were part of the reason for the delay in execution.<br><br>Counsels for respondents are reminded that as officers of the law, they are mandated by Rule 12.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility to "not unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse court processes." While counsels for respondents are expected to serve their clients to the utmost of their ability, their duty to their clients does not include disrespecting the law by scheming to impede the execution of a final and executory judgment. As members of the Bar, counsels for respondents are enjoined to represent their clients "with zeal within the bounds of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Thus, counsels for respondents are given a <b><i>stern warning</i></b> to desist from committing similar acts which undermine the law and its processes. Any similar infractions in the future from counsels for respondents will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides the two (2) ways of executing a final and executory judgment:<br><blockquote>Section 6. Execution by motion or by independent action. - A final and executory judgment or order may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry. After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action. The revived judgment may also be enforced by motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry and thereafter by action before it is barred by the statute of limitations.<br></blockquote>Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court must be read in conjunction with Articles 1144(3) and 1152 of the Civil Code, which provide:<br><blockquote>Article 1144. The following actions must be brought within ten years from the time the right of action accrues:<br><br>....<br><br>(3) Upon a judgment.<br><br>....<br><br>Article 1152. The period for prescription of actions to demand the fulfillment of obligation declared by a judgment commences from the time the judgment became final.<br></blockquote>Thus, the prevailing party may move for the execution of a final and executory judgment as a matter of right within five (5) years from the entry of judgment. If no motion is filed within this period, the judgment is converted to a mere right of action and can only be enforced by instituting a complaint for the revival of judgment in a regular court within 10 years from finality of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the Court of Appeal's ruling on the nullity of the deed of absolute sale executed between Piedad and respondents became final and executory on November 1, 1998. Judge Gaviola, upon motion, then issued an order for the issuance of a writ of demolition on October 22, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>However, the writ of demolition was never served on respondents due to their dilatory tactics and the gross ignorance of the law and undue delay caused by Judges Estrera and Villarin. The case only began to gain traction on July 12, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> when petitioners filed their motion for the revival of judgment. But by this time, almost 12 years had passed since the Court of Appeals September 15, 1998 Decision became final and executory. This led Branch 29, Regional Trial Court, Toledo City, where the case was transferred from Branch 9, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City, to deny the motion in its Order dated May 15, 2012 for being the wrong remedy. The Regional Trial Court stated:<br><blockquote>In the instant case, reckoned from November 1, 1998, the date when the Decision of the Court of Appeals became final and executory, 12 years and 1 day had already elapsed when the instant motion was filed on November 2, 2010. There may be instances that execution may still pursue despite the lapse of ten years from finality of judgment but it should be a result of a well-justified action for revival of judgment, not a mere motion, as can be found in the cited Supreme Court Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>The Regional Trial Court likewise referred to <i>Bausa v. Heirs of Dino</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> to support its denial of petitioners' motion, claiming that the case at bar is very similar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> with <i>Bausa</i>. However, a careful reading of <i>Bausa</i> shows that while it contains similarities with the case at bar, the factual circumstances and ruling in <i>Bausa</i> tend to support petitioners' motion for revival, not its denial.<br><br>In <i>Bausa</i>, the Decision declaring petitioners as the rightful owners of the disputed property became final and executory on January 28, 1987. On May 8, 1987, petitioners filed a motion for execution which was granted by the trial court but was not served on the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Petitioners in <i>Bausa</i> subsequently applied for the issuance of an alias writ of execution, which was likewise granted. The sheriff then executed a Delivery of Possession, but respondents refused to sign the Delivery of Possession and refused to vacate the premises. This prompted petitioners to apply for a writ of demolition, which was again granted but could not be implemented due to respondents' continued resistance. Finally, petitioners filed an action to revive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the judgment of the trial court, which respondents asserted was not timely filed.<br><br><i>Bausa</i> stated that the law set time limitations in the enforcement of judgments "to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> <i>Bausa</i> then held that considering petitioners' diligent efforts in the enforcement of what was already rightfully theirs and respondents' machinations that prevented petitioners from possessing their property, it cannot be said that petitioners slept on their rights:<br><blockquote>Despite diligent efforts and the final and executory nature of the Decision, petitioners have yet to regain possession of what is legally their own. These circumstances clearly demonstrate that the failure to execute the judgment was due to respondents' refusal to follow the several writs ordering them to vacate the premises. It would be unfair for the Court to allow respondents to profit from their defiance of valid court orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Bausa</i> likewise emphasized that if manifest wrong or injustice would result with the strict adherence to the statute of limitations or doctrine of laches, it would be better for courts to rule under the principle of equity:<br><blockquote>It is a better rule that courts, under the principle of equity, will not be guided or bound strictly by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches when to do so, manifest wrong or injustice would result. It would be more in keeping with justice and equity to allow the revival of the judgment rendered by Branch 52 of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon in Civil Case No. 639. To rule otherwise would result in an absurd situation where the rightful owner of a property would be ousted by a usurper on mere technicalities. Indeed, it would be an idle ceremony to insist on the filing of another action that would only unduly prolong respondents' unlawful retention of the premises which they had, through all devious means, unjustly withheld from petitioners all these years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></blockquote>Just like in <i>Bausa</i>, it also cannot be said that petitioners slept on their rights. Petitioners filed a motion for execution well within the five (5)-year period prescribed by Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court. However, their efforts were thwarted by respondents' machinations and Judges Estrera's and Villarin's illegal acts of issuing restraining orders against a co­equal court. Nonetheless, petitioners continued to persevere and filed several motions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> before Judge Villarin, which the judge proceeded to ignore. This Court recognized the illegality of the acts committed by Judges Estrera and Villarin when this Court held them administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law and undue delay in rendering an order, imposing upon them a fine and a stem warning that a repetition of a similar act will be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In dismissing the motion for revival, the Regional Trial Court adopted a strict interpretation of Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court because the proper remedy was supposedly an action for revival of judgment, not just a mere motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The Court of Appeals, in turn, also dismissed the petition for being the wrong remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The lower courts are mistaken.<br><br>In <i>David v. Ejercito</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> for reasons of equity, this Court treated the motion for execution, alias writ of execution, and motion for demolition as substantial compliance with the requirement to file an action to revive judgment if no motion for execution is filed within five (5) years from the date of its entry of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> <i>David</i> pointed out that petitioner's deliberate efforts at delaying the execution of a final and executory judgment should not be condoned:<br><blockquote>It would be an idle ceremony to insist on the filing of a separate action that would only unduly prolong petitioner's unlawful retention of the premises which he has through all devious means unjustly withheld from respondents all these years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court, in a long line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> has allowed for the execution of a final and executory judgment even if prescription has already set in, if the delay was caused by the judgment obligor for his or her benefit or advantage. The reason behind this exception was explained in <i>Camacho v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><blockquote>The purpose of the law in prescribing time limitations for enforcing judgments or actions is to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights. Far from sleeping on their rights, respondents persistently pursued their rights of action. It is revolting to the conscience to allow petitioner to further avert the satisfaction of her obligation because of sheer literal adherence to technicality. After all, the Rules of Court mandates that a liberal construction of the Rules be adopted in order to promote their object and to assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding. This rule of construction is especially useful in the present case where adherence to the letter of the law would result in absurdity and manifest injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court has also interrupted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> the tolling of the prescriptive period or deducted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> from the prescriptive period when the peculiar circumstances of the case or the dictates of equity called for it. This Court held in <i>Lancita v.

Any interruption or delay occasioned by the debtor will extend the time within which the writ may be issued without <i>scire facias</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>It is not disputed that the deed of absolute sale between Piedad and respondents was declared null and void for being a forgery, and that the Court of Appeals September 15, 1998 Decision became final and executory as early as November 1, 1998. However, due to respondents' schemes and maneuvers, they managed for many years to prevent Piedad and his heirs from enjoying what had already been decreed to be rightfully theirs, leading to an empty victory and petitioners' continued struggle for their rights.<br><br>Considering that the Regional Trial Court May 15, 2012 Order dismissing petitioners' motion for revival was utterly devoid of legal or factual basis, it is clear that it was attended by grave abuse of discretion for being issued capriciously and with a gross misapprehension of the facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, jurisprudence is consistent that when the delay in filing a motion or action for execution could not be attributed to the prevailing party, a liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure should be resorted to where a literal and strict adherence will most likely result in miscarriage of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court resolves to <b>GRANT</b> the Petition.
