The RTC rejected NPC's claim that it took possession of the property in 1972 and 1974 when respondents allegedly. allowed NPC to construct the transmission lines for lack of proof. In addition, the RTC held that had the properties been taken on said years, such taking was without color of legal authority. The RTC likewise adopted the recommendation of the appraisal committee for the payment of PhP 22,227,800 as consequential damages for the 41,867 square meters portion of the properties which were rendered useless or no longer fit for its intended use due to the construction of the transmission lines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> In disposal, the RTC held: </p><blockquote> <p> Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered: </p> <p> 1.

Specifically, NPC argued that the award was based on the premise that it sought to acquire ownership over the properties when it merely seeks to acquire a right-of-way thus necessitating the payment of a mere easement fee equivalent to 10% of the market value of the properties. Further, it argued that the award is contrary to the zonal valuation of the property classified as agricultural and erroneously reckoned as of the time of the filing of the complaint instead as of the time of taking. </p><p> On the other hand, respondents moved for the execution of the award pending appeal which the RTC granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A writ of execution and a notice of garnishment were thereafter issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> On September 1, 2015, the CA rendered its Decision denying NPC's appeal. Contrary to NPC's claim, the CA held that the just compensation to be paid for an easement of a right-of-way over lands that would be traversed by high-powered transmission lines should be the full value of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> The CA likewise found no merit in NPC's argument that the fair market value of the properties should have been based on the BIR zonal valuation at the time of its supposed taking of the property in the 1970s and on the basis of its classification as agricultural land as stated in the tax declarations. The CA reasoned that NPC failed to allege the issue of taking. in its complaint nor was such raised during pre-trial or proven during trial. The CA also held that to base the fair market value of the property during the alleged actual taking in the 1970s is to compound the injustice caused to respondents as the expropriation complaint was filed more than 30 years after NPC allegedly took respondents' properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>As regards to the proper classification of the properties, the CA noted that these were already reclassified as residential, commercial and industrial by the municipality of Pili, Camarines Sur even prior to the filing of the expropriation complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the CA found no reason to disturb the RTC's award of consequential damages as testimony to that effect was presented by respondents while NPC, on the other hand, failed to prove the alleged consequential benefits. </p><p> The CA thus disposed: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the foregoing considered, the appeal is hereby <strong>DENIED</strong> and the decision of the trial court [dated] December 20,2010, as modified by its Order dated May 2, 2011, is <b>AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i></b>. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Upon denial of its motion for reconsideration, NPC filed the present petition.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issues</b> </p><p> Reiterating its arguments before the lower courts, NPC interposes the following issues for resolution: (<i>1.</i>) should the value of the property be reckoned at the time of the taking in the 1970s; (<i>2</i>.) should the amount of just compensation be based on the properties' BIR zonal valuation corresponding to its classification as agricultural in the tax declarations; and (<i>3.</i>) is the award of consequential damages for the "dangling" area proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> Essentially, NPC contests the amount of just compensation and the award of consequential damages. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling</b> </p><p> We deny the petition. </p><p><em> Reckoning point of the market value of the properties </em> </p><p> The circumstances surrounding the "taking" of property in the context of the State's exercise of the power of eminent domain has been jurisprudentially listed in the seminal case of <i>Republic v. Vda. De Castellvi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <em>First</em>, the expropriator must enter a private property. x x x </p> <p> <em>Second,</em> the entrance into private property must be for more than a momentary period. x x x </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> <em>Fourth</em>, the property must be devoted to a public use or otherwise informally appropriated or injuriously affected. x x x </p> <p> <em>Fifth</em>, the utilization of the property for public use must be in such a way as to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment of the property. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> That there was taking of the subject properties for purposes of expropriation is beyond contest. What plagues the court and the parties is the date when such taking is to be reckoned because this will, in turn, be determinative of the value of the subject properties from which the amount of just compensation will be based. </p><p> Sec. 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Rule 67 lays down the basic rule that the value of the just compensation is to be determined as of the date of the taking of the property or the filing of the complaint, whichever came first. </p><p> The case of <i>National Transmission Corporation v. Oroville Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> settles that just compensation should be reckoned from the date of actual taking when such preceded the filing of the complaint for expropriation. In <em>Oroville</em>, the Court explains that the State is. only obliged to make good the loss sustained by the landowner and considering the circumstances availing at the time the property was taken. Deviation from this general rule was permitted in the cases of<em> National Power Corporation v. Heirs of Macabangkit Sangkay</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and <em>National Power Corporation v. Spouses Saludares</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> due to special circumstances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> therein obtaining which necessitated a valuation of just compensation at the time the landowners initiated inverse condemnation proceedings notwithstanding that taking of the properties occurred first. </p><p> The peculiarity of the instant case is that NPC insists that it took the subject properties in the 1970s despite having initiated the expropriation complaint only on January 23, 2006. Following the general rule, NPC thus reasons that the value of the properties should be reckoned in the 1970s. However, NPC's expropriation complaint and the very testimonial evidence it offered strongly militate against such proposition. </p><p> NPC's expropriation complaint filed on January 23, 2006 clearly sought "to acquire an easement of right-of-way over portions of the [subject properties]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> to enable it "to construct and maintain its steel transmission lines and wooden electric poles for its Naga-Tiwi 230 KV (Single Bundle), Naga-Tiwi 230 KV (Double Bundle) and 69 KV Naga-Daraga Transmission Lines".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> NPC's action relative to the acquisition of an easement of right-of-way made prior to the filing of its expropriation complaint was limited only to the conduct of negotiations with respondents. Even then, such negotiations pertained to the construction of HVDC 350 KV transmission lines which was not among the transmission lines subject of the expropriation complaint. This, as much, was alleged by NPC itself in its expropriation complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and was testified to by NPC's right-of-way officer who conducted the negotiations in 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The lower courts were thus correct in disregarding NPC's claim of actual taking in the 1970s as such was not alleged in the expropriation complaint nor was it successfully proven during the trial. </p><p> There being no sufficient proof that NPC actually took the subject properties at a date preceding the filing of the expropriation complaint, the time of the taking should be taken to mean as coinciding with the commencement of the expropriation proceedings on January 23, 2006. Hence, the value at the time of the filing of the complaint should be the basis for the determination of the value when the taking of the property involved coincides with or is subsequent to the commencement of the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> <i>Amount of just compensation</i> </p><p> To begin with, factual issues pertaining to the value of an expropriated property is beyond the scope of judicial review under a petition filed via Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As such, factual findings of the trial and appellate courts will not be disturbed by this Court unless any of the recognized exceptions is present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> No such exception obtains in the instant case. </p><p> The various provisions of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> uniformly treat the payment of just compensation as a limitation to the State's exercise of eminent domain. Just compensation likewise bears the consistent and settled meaning as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator, the measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to qualify the meaning of the word "compensation" and to convey thereby the idea that the amount to be tendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> Further, the determination of just compensation in expropriation cases is a function addressed to the discretion of the courts owing to the constitutional mandate that no private property shall be taken for public use without payment of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As such, legislative enactments, as well as executive issuances, fixing or providing for the method of computing just compensation are tantamount to impermissible encroachment on judicial prerogatives. As such, they are not binding on courts and are treated as mere guidelines in ascertaining the amount of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Even the enumeration of the standards for the assessment of the value of the land for purposes of expropriation under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 8974<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> reflects the non-exclusive, permissive and discretionary character thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p>Here, NPC assails the valuation assigned to the subject properties for being contrary to its alleged classification as agricultural as appearing on the tax declarations attached to its expropriation complaint. </p><p> However, the insistence of NPC to base the value of the properties solely on the tax declarations is misplaced considering that such is only one of the several factors which the court may consider to facilitate the determination of just compensation. Indeed, courts enjoy sufficient judicial discretion to determine the classification of lands, because such classification is one of the relevant standards for the assessment of the value of lands subject of expropriation proceedings. It bears to emphasize, however, that the court's discretion in classifying the expropriated land is only for the purpose of determining just compensation and is not meant to substitute that of the local government's power to reclassify and convert lands through local ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> The subject properties in this case had been reclassified as residential, commercial and industrial several years before the expropriation complaint was filed. If NPC contests the reclassification of the subject properties, the expropriation case is not the proper venue to do so. As such, the RTC and the CA did not err in abiding by the classification of the subject properties as residential, commercial and industrial as reclassified under Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 17 and Municipal Ordinance No. 7 dated February 1, 1993 and as certified to by the Municipal Assessor of Pili, Camarines Sur. </p><p> In any case, reliance on the tax declarations attached to NPC's expropriation complaint to classify the properties as purely agricultural is inaccurate as these very same tax declarations reveal that portions of the expropriated Lot No. 4237 and Lot No. 2870 are in fact classified as residential and commercial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p><i>Award of consequential damages</i> </p><p> As a rule, just compensation, to which the owner of the property to be expropriated is entitled, is equivalent to the market value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The rule is modified where only a part of a certain property is expropriated. In such a case, the owner is not restricted to compensation for the portion actually taken, he is also entitled to recover the consequential damages, if any, to the remaining part of the property. </p><p> Consequential damages is specifically enunciated under Section 6 of Rule 67 as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 6. Proceedings by Commissioners. — Before entering upon the performance of their duties, the commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath that they will faithfully perform their duties as commissioners, which oath shall be filed in court with the other proceedings in the case. Evidence may be introduced by either party before the commissioners who are authorized to administer oaths on hearings before them, and the commissioners shall, unless the parties consent to the contrary, after due notice to the parties, to attend, view and examine the property sought to be expropriated and its surroundings, and may measure the same, after which either party may, by himself or counsel, argue the case.<strong> The commissioners shall assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner from the public use or purpose of the property taken, the operation of its franchise by the corporation or the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property. But in no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the consequential damages assessed, or the owner be deprived of the actual value of his property so taken. </strong>(Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, if as a result of expropriation, the remaining portion of the property suffers from impairment or decrease in value, the award of consequential damages is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p>Respondents in this case claim consequential damages for the areas in between the transmission lines which were rendered unfit for use. "Dangling" areas, as defined under National Power Board Resolution No. 94-313, refer to those remaining small portions of the land not traversed by the transmission line project but which are nevertheless rendered useless in view of the presence of the transmission lines. The appraisal committee determined the total dangling area to be 41,867 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and consequently recommended the payment of consequential damages equivalent to 50% of the BIR zonal value per square meter or for a total amount of PhP 22,227,800. </p><p> In arriving at its recommendation to pay consequential damages, the appraisal committee conducted an ocular inspection of the properties and observed that the areas before and behind the transmission lines could no longer be used either for commercial or residential purposes. Despite this determination, NPC insists that the affected areas cannot be considered "dangling" as these may still be used for agricultural purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In so arguing, NPC loses sight of the undisputed fact that the transmission lines conveying high-tension current posed danger to the lives and limbs of respondents and to potential farm workers, making the affected areas no longer suitable even for agricultural production. Thus, the Court finds no reason to depart from the assessment of the appraisal committee, as affirmed and adopted by the RTC. </p><p> NPC's contention that the consequential benefits should have canceled the consequential damages likewise deserve no merit. It is true that if the expropriation resulted in benefits to the remaining lot, such consequential benefits may be deducted from the consequential damages or from the value of the expropriated property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> However, such consequential benefits refer to the actual benefits derived by the landowner which are the direct and proximate results of the improvements as a consequence of the expropriation and not to the general benefits which the landowner may receive in common with the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Here, it was not shown by NPC how the alleged "tremendous increase" in the value of the remaining portions of the properties could have been directly caused by the construction of the transmission lines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> If at all, any appreciation in the value of the properties is caused by the consequent increase in land value over time and not by the mere presence of the transmission lines.</p><p><em> Imposition of interest </em> </p><p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, We find the need to modify the imposition of interest. </p><p> The award of interest is imposed in the nature of damages for delay in payment which, in effect, makes the obligation on the part of the government one of forbearance to ensure prompt payment of the value of the land and limit the opportunity loss of the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, the imposition of interest is justified only in cases where delay has been sufficiently established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> In this case, NPC deposited the provisional value of the subject properties in the amount of PhP 47,064,400 on May 19, 2006 which was days before the issuance of a writ of possession. Considering NPC's prompt payment, the imposition of interest thereon is unjustified and should therefore be deleted. </p><p> However, interest should be imposed on the award of consequential damages as it is a component of just compensation. To emphasize, in order to determine just compensation, the trial court should first ascertain the market value of the property, to which should be added the consequential damages after deducting therefrom the consequential benefits which may arise from the expropriation. If the consequential benefits exceed the consequential damages, these items should be disregarded altogether as the basic value of the property should be paid in every case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Here, when the RTC pegged the amount of PhP 47,064,400 for the expropriated 49,173 square meters, the consequential damages was not yet included. The total just compensation should therefore be the total of PhP 47,064,400 and PhP22,227,800. Considering that the amount of PhP 22,227,800 as consequential damages was not yet paid, such amount should earn interest at the rate of 12% <em>per annum</em> from January 23, 2006 until June 30, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and the interest rate of 6% <em>per annum</em> is imposed from July 1, 2013 until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.

NPC's entry denied elementary due process of law to the owners since then until the owners commenced the inverse condemnation proceedings. The Court is more concerned with the necessity to prevent NPC from unjustly profiting from its deliberate acts of denying due process of law to the owners. As a measure of simple justice and ordinary fairness to them, therefore, reckoning just compensation on the value at the time the owners commenced these inverse condemnation proceedings is entirely warranted.</p> <p> In <em>Saludares</em>:</p> <p> "xxx To reiterate, NAPOCOR should have instituted eminent domain proceedings before it occupied respondent spouses' property. Because it failed to comply with this duty, respondent spouses were constrained to file the instant Complaint for just compensation before the trial court. From the 1970s until the present, they were deprived of just compensation, while NAPOCOR continuously burdened their property with its transmission lines. This Court cannot allow petitioner to profit from its failure to comply with the mandate of the law. We therefore rule that, to adequately compensate respondent spouses from the decades of burden on their property, NAPOCOR should be made to pay the value of the property at the time of the filing of the instant Complaint when respondent spouses made a judicial demand for just compensation."</p> </blockquote> <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> See paragraph 5 of the Complaint; <em>rollo</em>, p. 378.</p><p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Id. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> See paragraph 7 of the Complaint; id. at 379. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <em>Supra </em>note 27. </p><p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> <em>Municipality of La Carlota v.
