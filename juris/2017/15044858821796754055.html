The Settling Defendants reserve the right to move the escrow account and funds contained therein to a different financial institution in Texas. This payment shall be made within ten (10) business days after The Plaintiffs deliver to Counsel for Settling Defendants an executed original (or counterpart original) of this Compromise Settlement, Indemnity, and Hold Harmless Agreement signed individually by each of the Counsel for The Plaintiffs, or signed by one or more Counsel for The Plaintiffs on their behalf Administration of this escrow account and all payments from it shall be made by the Mediator, MA.

The parties agree to cooperate with Mr. Mills and, if agreed upon by the parties and if necessary to complete the settlement, to seek his appointment by an appropriate court as Special Master. The interest earned on this escrow account shall first be used to pay the Mediator's fees, costs and expenses (which expenses shall include reasonable expenses associated with travel, lodging and meals), and the costs of implementing this settlement including distribution expenses, bank charges and fees, and the like. Any interest remaining thereafter shall be owned by the party owning the principal. The Settling Defendants reserve the right to audit any and all payments from the escrow account at anytime.

Releases<br><br>The individual releases are to be signed by The Plaintiffs and shall be enforceable in the courts of Plaintiffs' country of residence, in the United States, and in any other country in which their cause of action allegedly occurred. The form of this individual release shall be that of Exhibit G to the Dow agreement or such other form as is acceptable to the Settling Defendants. The check provided to each Plaintiff will contain release language and will incorporate the language on the full release to be signed separately by the Plaintiff. This release shall be notarized (or, if approved by the Mediator, be authorized in such a manner that the signed release shall be enforceable in the courts of Plaintiffs' country of residence, as well as in the United States) and signed by one of the Counsel for The Plaintiffs or an authorized representative thereof acceptable to Settling Defendants. The notary, or authorizing person, shall attest to the identity of the Plaintiff receiving the settlement payment. In countries which have a picture identification, the notary, or authorizing person, will examine the picture identification at the time the notarization or authorization is accomplished. In countries which do not have a picture identification, the notary, or authorizing person, will examine other appropriate documentary evidence of the identity of the person signing the release; provided, however, that the Mediator shall have authority in all instances to determine identification of The Plaintiffs.<br><br>....<br><br>17. Payment From Escrow Funds<br><br>The amount placed in escrow shall be divided into a clients' account and an attorneys' account according to the terms of powers of attorney held by Counsel for The Plaintiffs. <i>The check for the amount payable to each Plaintiff (the "net client allocation") will be provided by the Mediator to Counsel for The Plaintiffs for their delivery to the Plaintiffs at the time the released [sic] is signed.</i> The amount owed to Counsel for The Plaintiffs from the attorneys' account, as a result of execution of releases by Plaintiffs, shall be paid by the Mediator to Counsel for The Plaintiffs on a sliding scale of the percentage of releases obtained and after receipt and determination by the Mediator that the executed releases received comply with the requirements of this Agreement. Counsel for Plaintiffs will use their best efforts to obtain releases from each of the Plaintiffs listed on Exhibits A and C. When the Mediator receives releases from at least fifty (50) percent of those Plaintiffs listed on Exhibit A, the Mediator may release to Counsel for Plaintiffs from the escrow account attorneys' fees and expenses proportionate to twenty-five (25) percent of the Plaintiffs having signed and returned valid releases. When the Mediator has received releases from at least eighty (80) percent of those Plaintiffs listed on Exhibit A, an additional twenty-five (25) percent of the fees and expenses allocated to Plaintiffs who have signed releases can be disbursed to Plaintiffs' Counsel. Upon receipt of releases from ninety-five (95) percent of the Plaintiffs/Claimants listed on Exhibit A, the Mediator may release all of the allocated fees and expenses proportionate to that percentage of Plaintiffs who have signed releases (e.g., ninety-five (95) percent signed releases results in ninety-five (95) percent of fees and expenses being disbursed to Plaintiffs' Counsel). All questions concerning the propriety and validity of each release and of the payment of the client's share to each individual client will be determined by the Mediator.

The case was then transferred to Davao City due to the hostile environment in Panabo City. Succeeding events further delayed the proceedings.<br><br>Given the circumstances of this case, petitioners cannot be faulted for failing to make a formal offer of evidence because they were denied the opportunity to do so. Respondent court should have given petitioners the chance to offer the deposition of Mr. Stubbs in evidence before acting on the pending incidents of the case. Thus, respondent court gravely abused its discretion in issuing the Order dated July 10, 2009, which affirmed execution against petitioners.<br><br>Respondent court also erred in issuing the Order dated July 10, 2009. Petitioners' subsidiaries and affiliates cannot be adjudged solidarily liable.<br><br>Under the Compromise Agreement, the law that shall govern its interpretation is the law of Texas, United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> In this jurisdiction, courts are not authorized to "take judicial notice of foreign laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> The laws of a foreign country must "be properly pleaded and proved" as facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> Otherwise, under the doctrine of processual presumption, foreign law shall be presumed to be the same as domestic law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> Unfortunately, there is no evidence that Texan law has been proven as a fact.

Thus, respondent Judge Omelio gravely abused his discretion in holding that the petitioners' subsidiaries and affiliates were solidarily liable under the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>Furthermore, there is no reason for respondent court to pierce the veil of corporate fiction. There is hardly any evidence to shew that petitioners abused their separate juridical identity to evade their obligation under the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>Consequently, the Amended Order dated August 11, 2009, the Amended Writ of Execution, and the Alias Writ of Execution are void for having been issued by respondent court with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Respondent court's fervor in ordering the execution of the compromise agreement appears to be fueled by its compassion towards the workers who have allegedly been exposed to DBCP. However, prudence and judicial restraint dictate that a court's sympathy towards litigants should yield to established legal rules. Moreover, this jurisdiction should not alter the mechanism established for claims here and abroad as it can undo the entire process for all the farmers involved. The remedy of any unpaid claimant would be to establish their claims with the mediator named in the Compromise Agreement. Counsels for the farmers and their families should have followed this clear, legal course mandated in the Compromise Agreement.
