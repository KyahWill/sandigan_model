CR HC No. 04851, which affirmed the Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 12, 2010 of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, Branch 49 (RTC), in Criminal Case Nos. U-11324, U-11325, and U-11326, convicting accused-appellant Ruben N. Bongbonga (Ruben) for the crimes charged therein. <p align="center"><em> The Facts </em> </p><p> Three (3) separate Informations were filed in the RTC, charging Ruben with two (2) counts of Rape and one (1) count of Acts of Lasciviousness, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p><strong> CRIMINAL CASE NO.

U-11326</b></p> <p> That on or about October 16, 2000 at Brgy. [XXX], Binalonan, Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named accused, by means of force and intimidation with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously perform lascivious conduct upon [AAA], minor, 12 years of age, by kissing her lips, mashing her private parts against her will and without her consent, to the damage and prejudice of [AAA]. </p> <p> CONTRARY to Article 336, Revised Penal Code, in relation to Sec. 5, par. b, R.A. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> As summarized by the CA in the questioned Decision, the facts are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> AAA, a minor of about 16 years of age at the time she testified on February 4, 2003, declared that on April 26, 2000, while she was seated in a chair reading a pocketbook in the yard of their house, appellant came. Since no one was at home except for the two of them, he carried her inside the house up to the second floor where he laid her down the bamboo floor. After removing his clothes, appellant then removed the shirt, pajamas, panty and bra of the victim. She wanted to shout, but the accused wielded a "balisong". The appellant then went on top of AAA and forcibly had carnal knowledge with her and mashed her breast. AAA tried to kick appellant but he was too strong for her. After the ordeal, appellant warned AAA not to tell anyone. AAA did not tell anyone out of fear of appellant. </p> <p> The second incident took place on May 29, 2000. While AAA was playing with her siblings, BBB, CCC, and appellant's daughter Ruby Ann and niece Julie Ann Bongbonga, in the yard of their house, appellant arrived thereat. While playing, appellant called AAA and told her they were going to his mother Crising Bongbonga's house some 200 meters away. Appellant allowed AAA to watch "Eat Bulaga" in their living room for about an hour. Thereafter, appellant brought AAA inside one of the bedrooms and locked the door. Armed with a "<i>balisong</i>", appellant again had carnal knowledge of AAA. When appellant was finished, he stood and dressed up. AAA put her clothes on and was told by appellant not to tell her parents about what happened between them. Thereafter, they left the premises. AAA did not tell her parents what happened because she was afraid that Ruben might kill her. </p> <p> The third incident was on October 16, 2000, when AAA, BBB, CCC and their other playmates, went to the river to go swimming. While the group was playing in the water, appellant arrived. Thereafter, AAA's group went home. After doing some household chores, AAA and her siblings went to the sugar cane field to gather sugar cane for eating. Appellant followed the group to the sugar cane field. The group went home while AAA stayed behind because she was told by the appellant "May gagawin tayo." Appellant carried AAA to the middle of the field, undressed her and laid her down. Appellant undressed himself, went on top of AAA, kissed her lips and for the third time, had carnal knowledge with the victim. After such incident, AAA was again warned by the appellant not to tell her parents. However, this time AAA told her parents about the incident and her parents got mad and whipped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thereafter, a medical examination conducted on AAA revealed deep healed lacerations in AAA's genitalia, which allegedly could have been caused by strenuous activities, the insertion of a foreign body (<em>e.g</em>., a hardened penis), or a viral disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Pleading his innocence, Ruben denied the accusations against him on the claim that he and AAA were live-in partners and that their sexual encounters were consensual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Ruben further claimed that the charges against him were filed at the instance of AAA's Aunt, possibly due to feelings of disapproval as Ruben was still married to another woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Ruben's defense was corroborated by his daughter, Ruby Ann, during her testimony before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> Upon arraignment, Ruben entered separate pleas of "not guilty" to the separate Informations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> <i>Ruling of the RTC</i> </p><p> On July 12, 2010, the RTC rendered a Judgment of even date, finding Ruben guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged.

It is a basic constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him. It would be a denial of appellant's constitutional right to due process if he was charged with acts of lasciviousness but subsequent proof suggested rape. Nevertheless, the prosecution established that appellant was motivated by lewd design on October 16, 2000 when after AAA's companions left, he brought AAA in the middle of the sugarcane field and thereafter kissed AAA and touched her private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In affirming the findings of the RTC, the CA modified the award of damages, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, accused-appellant Ruben Bongbonga's <strong>APPEAL</strong> is hereby <strong>DENIED</strong>. Hence, the Decision dated July 12, 2010 for two counts of <strong>RAPE</strong> and <strong>ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS</strong> is hereby <strong>AFFIRMED with modification </strong>insofar as the amount of civil indemnity which is hereby increased to Php75,000.00 and moral damages to Php75,000.00 for each count of rape, plus Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages.

In the same vein, Ruben's arguments were already considered and thoroughly addressed by the courts below. </p><p> As correctly observed by the CA, Ruben's flimsy defense of consensual sexual congress pales in comparison to the testimony of AAA, which was delivered in a clear and straightforward manner: </p><blockquote> <p> On the basis of the record of this case, We can hardly agree with appellant's belief that there was cogent reason to deviate from the findings of the lower court that appellant had carnal knowledge with AAA. <strong>The testimony of AAA was clear, straightforward and consistent in her recollection of the details of the defloration. She positively identified the appellant and she vividly recounted the three incidents of sexual assault she suffered in April, May and October of 2000 and these declarations were corroborated by the findings of Dr. Ramilo. </strong>The doctor examined the victim and found deep healed lacerations in AAA's hymen which was caused by forcibly inserting a foreign body. When the consistent and forthright testimony of a rape victim blended (<em>sic</em>) with medical findings, there is sufficient basis to warrant a conclusion that the essential requisites of carnal knowledge have been established. </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> <b>AAA categorically declared that she and appellant were not lovers prior to the three incidents that happened on April 26, May 29, and October 16, 2000, and based on the testimony of both the prosecution and defense, they cohabited<i> after</i> the third incident of alleged rape in October 2000. </b>Moreover, out of fear and intimidation employed upon AAA by her father, she was forced to live with appellant against her will. Evidently, the cohabitation was dictated upon the victim out of fear and not free consent and even if they cohabited after the incidents, it will not negate the fact that AAA was raped by appellant.<strong> "Definitely, a man cannot demand sexual gratification from a fiancee and worse, employ violence upon her on the pretext of love. Love is not a license for lust."</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> At the outset, it should be emphasized that the Court has consistently disfavored the "sweetheart theory" defense for being self-serving in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Being an affirmative defense, the allegation of a love affair must be substantiated by the accused with convincing proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It bears noting that Ruben's defense was corroborated only by his daughter, Ruby Ann,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which effectively weakened the defense, being supported by a mere relative of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In <i>People v. Nogpo, Jr</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court held that where nothing supports the sweetheart theory except the testimony of a relative, such defense deserves scant consideration. </p><p> On this note, Ruben anchors his claim of consensual sexual congress on the fact of his cohabitation with AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> However, such claim was already addressed by the CA in the questioned Decision, which affirmed the findings of the RTC, that such cohabitation occurred only<strong> after </strong>the respective dates of the incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Here, such fact of cohabitation, by itself, had no bearing on the prior forcible advances committed by Ruben upon AAA. In fact, contrary to Ruben's assertions, any consent implied from the fact of cohabitation is dispelled by AAA's express declarations that she was forced against her will to live with Ruben out of fear of her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> To be sure, that a man and a woman are living in the same house is not enough to rule out the bestial act of forced sexual intercourse. Here, the fact of cohabitation is immaterial to the charge of rape as it only took place after the alleged incidents. In<i> People v. Bautista</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court aptly held: </p><blockquote> <p> Besides, even if he and the victim were really sweethearts, such a fact would not necessarily establish consent. It has been consistently ruled that "a love affair does not justify rape, for the beloved cannot be sexually violated against her will." The fact that a woman voluntarily goes out on a date with her lover does not give him unbridled license to have sex with her against her will. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, in the landmark case of<i> People v. Jumawan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court declared that even a husband has no ownership over his wife's body by reason of marriage, for in assenting to marital union, the wife does not divest herself of her right to exclusive autonomy over her own body. Hence, a married woman can give or withhold her consent to sexual intercourse with her husband and he cannot unlawfully wrestle such consent from her in case of her refusal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> In the same manner, Ruben's defense of consensual intercourse evidenced by cohabitation does not hold water in the absence of compelling evidence<em> contra</em> AAA's unwavering testimony of her defilement. In this respect, we defer to the factual conclusions of the RTC regarding the credibility of the witnesses and their respective testimonies, which were affirmed <em>in toto</em> by the CA. </p><p> Proceeding therefrom, the Court finds that the prosecution was able to positively establish the guilt of Ruben for the crimes as charged beyond reasonable doubt. </p><p> <i>Criminal Case Nos. U-11324 and U-11325 for Rape</i> </p><p> The gravamen of the crime of Rape is sexual intercourse without consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In the instant case, that Ruben obtained carnal knowledge of AAA by employing force, threat, and intimidation is fully supported by the testimony of AAA and the medical findings of Dr. Jeanna Ramilo. In both instances, Ruben threatened AAA with a<em> balisong</em> in fulfilling his bestial desires. As previously ruled by the Court: </p><blockquote> <p> Suffice it to say that in rape cases, the law does not impose a burden on the private complainant to prove resistance. The degree of force and resistance is relative, depending on the circumstances of each case and on the physical capabilities of each party. It is well settled that the force or violence required in rape cases is relative; when applied, it need not be overpowering or irresistible. When force is an element of the crime of rape, it need not be irresistible; it need but be present, and so long as it brings about the desired result, all consideration of whether it was more or less irresistible is beside the point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, finding no reason to vacate the findings of the RTC and CA, the Court affirms Ruben's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the two (2) counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. U-11324 and U-11325. </p><p> <i>Criminal Case No. U-11326 for Acts of Lasciviousness</i> </p><p> Anent the charge for Acts of Lasciviousness, the Court affirms the CA's conclusion that subsequent proof of suggested rape is immaterial where the allegations of the Information only describe lascivious conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> To convict an accused of a higher or more serious offense than that specifically charged in the information on which he is tried (<em>e.g</em>., Rape versus Acts of Lasciviousness) would be an outright violation of his basic rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> It is well-settled that a conviction for a crime not sufficiently alleged in the Information is proscribed by the fundamental requirement of due process and other rights granted to an accused by the Constitution, particularly the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In implementing such right, our Rules specifically require that the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense, including the qualifying and aggravating circumstances, must be stated in ordinary and concise language and in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged and the attendant qualifying and aggravating circumstances present, so that the accused can properly defend himself and the court can pronounce judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, the Rules authorize the quashal, upon motion of the accused, of an Information that fails to allege the acts constituting the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Likewise, the Rules impose restrictions in the amendment of an information to safeguard the rights of the accused. Thus, an information may be amended, in form or in substance, without leave of court, at any time <em>before</em> the accused enters his plea. However,<em> after</em> the plea and during the trial, only a formal amendment may be made with leave of court and only if it can be done without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In the same vein, if it appears at any time<em> before judgment</em> that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense, the court shall dismiss the original information upon the filing of a new one, provided the accused would not be placed in double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> Here, there is no indication in the records that the Prosecution attempted to have the Information in Criminal Case No. U-11326 amended at any stage of the proceedings before the RTC. Upon rendition of the Judgment dated July 12, 2010 of the RTC, amendments to the Information could no longer be made. Accordingly, Ruben can only be convicted for Acts of Lasciviousness as described in the Information, notwithstanding evidence of carnal knowledge during the trial proper. </p><p> However, the Court finds that the RTC imposed the incorrect penalty corresponding to the Information in Criminal Case No. U-11326. </p><p> To recall, the RTC sentenced Ruben to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and one (1) day of<em> arresto mayor</em> as minimum up to four (4) years and two (2) months of <em>prision correccional</em> as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Based on the foregoing, it appears that the RTC imposed the penalty merely for Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended, as opposed to the same crime when committed in relation to Section 5, paragraph b, Article III of Republic Act No. 7610 (R.A. 7610), otherwise known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act." The Information reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about October 16, 2000 at Brgy. [XXX], Binalonan, Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named accused, by means of force and intimidation with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously perform lascivious conduct upon [AAA], minor, 12 years of age, by kissing her lips, mashing her private parts against her will and without her consent, to the damage and prejudice of [AAA]. </p> <p> <b>CONTRARY to Article 336, Revised Penal Code, in relation to Sec.5, par. b, R.A. 7610.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> As it stands, the facts of this case support a conviction for a violation of Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of R.A. 7610, as originally described in the Information. The essential elements of Section 5(b) are: </p><ol><li> The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or <em>lascivious conduct</em>; <br><br></li><li> The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and <br><br></li><li> The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </li></ol> <p> Undoubtedly, the first and third element are amply supported by the evidence on record - the testimonial evidence sufficiently established that Ruben committed lascivious acts against AAA, who, at the time of the incident, was only 12 years of age. </p><p> Meanwhile, anent the second element, the Court's recent ruling in <em>Quimvel v. People</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> finds particular relevance in this case. In <em>Quimvel</em>, the petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the Information as it did not allege all the elements necessary in committing Acts of Lasciviousness under R.A. 7610. In addition, the petitioner argued that the second element,<em> i.e</em>., that the victim is a child "exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse" was absent. In denying the petition, the majority of the Court sitting <em>en banc</em> held that the allegations of the Information were sufficient to allow a conviction for violation of Section 5(b). It was ruled that for Acts of Lasciviousness committed under R.A. 7610, the victim need not suffer abuse <em>aside from</em> the act complained of based on the majority's reading of Section 5(b), which defines "children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse" as those who "indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct x x x due to coercion or influence of any adult." </p><p> Dissenting from the majority, the <em>ponente</em> herein offered a different interpretation. In a Dissenting Opinion, it was opined that a person can only be convicted of violating Article 336 in relation to Section 5(b) upon allegation and proof of the unique circumstances of the child - that he or she was exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse. Stated differently, it is necessary to show that the child is already a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse at the time the sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct complained of was committed. Hence, the phrase "other sexual abuse" can only mean that the child was previously subjected to sexual abuse<em> other </em>than the crime for which the accused is being charged under Section 5(b). To be sure, such reading is not novel as it was adopted by Justice Carpio in his Dissenting Opinion in<em> Olivarez v. Court of Appeals</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><p> Admittedly, the second element of Section 5(b) - that the act complained of is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse - is present herein. As discussed above, the facts unmistakably establish two prior instances of forced intercourse committed against AAA, which should count for "other sexual abuse" <em>aside</em> from the Acts of Lasciviousness charged in Criminal Case No. U-11326. However, following the position articulated above, absent a specific allegation of the unique circumstances of the child in the Information, Ruben can only be convicted for violation of Article 336 of the RPC and not under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610. It is with this same <em>animus</em> of due process that Ruben was only held liable for acts of lasciviousness instead of rape despite evidence to the contrary. </p><p> Be that as it may, the majority's ruling in<em> Quimvel </em>remains binding and requires application in this case. Accordingly, the penalty uniformly imposed by the RTC and the CA is modified to correspond to the penalty imposed by law for violation of Section 5(b), which is<em> reclusion temporal </em>in its medium period to<em> reclusion perpetua</em>. Further, the Court is guided by the following ruling in<em> Roallos v. People</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> in applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law: </p><blockquote> <p> For acts of lasciviousness performed on a child under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, the penalty prescribed is <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Notwithstanding that R.A. No. 7610 is a special law, Roallos may enjoy the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Roallos shall be entitled to a minimum term to be taken within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by R.A. No. 7610. The penalty next lower in degree is <em>prision mayor</em> medium to <em>reclusion temporal</em> minimum, the range of which is from eight (8) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months. On the other hand, the maximum term of the penalty should be taken from the penalty prescribed under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, which is <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its medium period to<em> reclusion perpetua</em>, the range of which is from fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. The minimum, medium and maximum term of the same is as follows: minimum — fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months; medium— seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to twenty (20) years; and maximum —<em> reclusion perpetua</em>. </p> </blockquote> <p> Considering that there are neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances extant in this case, both the RTC and the CA correctly imposed on Roallos the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor </em>medium as the minimum term to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of<em> reclusion temporal</em> as the maximum term. x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> Finally, to conform with recent jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the damages awarded by the CA are hereby modified. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing, the Appeal is <strong>DISMISSED</strong> for lack of merit and the Decision dated February 26, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 04851 is <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with <strong>MODIFICATION</strong>. Accused-appellant Ruben "Robin" Bongbonga y Nalos is hereby found <strong>GUILTY</strong> beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the same law, in relation to Section 5, paragraph b, Article III of Republic Act No. 7610. For the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. U-11326 the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor </em>medium as the minimum term to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> as the maximum term is hereby imposed. </p><p> The amount of damages awarded is likewise increased, ordering accused-appellant to pay the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity, Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages, and Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as exemplary damages for each count of Rape. In addition to the Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) moral damages awarded by the Court of Appeals for the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness, civil indemnity in the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) and Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) exemplary damages are likewise awarded. All monetary awards shall earn interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. </p><p><strong> SO ORDERED.</strong> </p><p> <em>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo</em>, and <em>Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.</em>, concur.<br><br> </p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 12-13. <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 2-11.
