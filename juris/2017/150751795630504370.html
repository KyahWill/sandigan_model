This prompted the latter to file a formal complaint before the City Government of Makati. In view of this development, a Hold Order was issued by the Building Officials of Makati City dated January 22, 2004 directing KKCA to <i>stop immediately all its excavation activities in the premises, and to immediately restore the eroded portion of the adjacent property</i>. The incident resulted in the delay of the project because the Hontiveros family refused to sign a waiver that was required for the lifting of the Hold Order unless their property was restored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The restoration of the Hontiveros property was completed in October 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Notwithstanding this development, the Hontiveros family's quitclaim remained forthcoming. As a consequence, the Hold Order remained effective and the construction suspended.<br><br>After 878 days of delay, Colorite demanded from KKCA to pay damages pursuant to the contract. KKCA refused contending that: (a) the agreed completion period was suspended when the City Government of Makati issued the Hold Order; and (b) Colorite failed to pay the costs of soil protection, as well as the 70% of the restoration cost of the Hontiveros property, which allegedly formed part of the agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The dispute impelled Colorite to file the instant claim before the CIAC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> According to Colorite, reckoning from the date the down payment was made less the seven-day interval before KKCA commenced its work, and the 73 calendar days allowed slippage, the project should have been completed on March 5, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, from March 6, 2005 up to the commencement of the action on July 31, 2007, the project was already delayed for 878 days. This renders KKCA liable to Colorite for payment of liquidated damages in the amount of Eight Million, Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand Pesos (Php8,780,000.00), plus Ten Thousand Pesos (Php10,000.00) per additional day of delay until the project is completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In addition to its claim for liquidated damages, Colorite also asserted that upon its completion, the building will have a total leasable area of 1,320.12 square meters.

Due to this fact, and because of Colorite's contributory negligence owing to its failure to deliver the share it promised amounting to Php700,000.00, it is partly to blame for the protracted delay of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Accordingly, Colorite was adjudged as only entitled to 50% of the liquidated damages it is claiming or Php4,390,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> For the same reason, Colorite was also held liable to 50% of the total maintenance cost amounting to Php2,047,268.75.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The CA ruled that the parties were both at fault, but were not in bad faith.

However, this rule admits of certain exceptions; among them is when the findings of the CA conflict with those of the court <i>a quo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as in this case. Thus, a review of the evidence on record is warranted.<br><br>The instant controversy arose from the delay in the completion of the construction project.<br><br>According to the CIAC, the issuance of the Hold Order was the immediate cause of the delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> However, there is no denying that said Hold Order would not have been issued if not for the complaint instituted by the Hontiveros family after their property was damaged by the erosion. Thus, it is material to detennine what caused the erosion, and who should be blamed therefore.<br><br>The records further show that the restoration of the Hontiveros property was already completed in October 2005. In spite of this, the construction remained suspended. The instant case was instituted on July 31, 2007, or 24 months from the time the Hontiveros property was restored.<br><br>There are two principal questions to be resolved herein, to wit: (a) what factor or factors contributed to the project's prolonged delay?; and (b) what are the parties' respective participation, if any, in the delay?<br><br>Moreover, the resolution of this case also rests upon an examination of the parties' contractual relationship embodied in the main construction contract, Addendum #01 and Addendum #02, and the alleged agreement entered into by the parties where Colorite will contribute Php700,000.00 in the restoration of the Hontiveros property.<br><br><b>KKCA is at fault for the erosion, which damaged the Hontiveros property</b><br><br>The CIAC found that the parties are both to blame for the erosion, which damaged the Hontiveros property; hence, they should equally share the restoration cost of the same and bear the consequences of the project's delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>According to the CIAC:<br><blockquote>The actual cause of the delay is the failure by the parties to realize and admit that they are both to blame for the erosion the excavation had caused to the adjacent Hontiveros property and therefore are to share equally the expenses of restoring said property.<br><br>The excavation was done by [WCC] that was engaged by [Colorite] and it was done without the correct and adequate soil protection for which reason it caused erosion to the adjacent Hontiveros property. [Colorite] assumed responsibility for the defective excavation of its contractor when it did not hold [WCC] accountable and was present in the various meetings with [KKCA], the Hontiveros family[,] and Makati Building Official regarding the restoration of the Hontiveros property and it is estopped to deny it. Estoppel precludes one from denying or asserting by his own deed or representative any contrary to that established as the truth in the legal contemplation (<b>R-11 Builders Inc. v. CIAC G.R. No. 152545 &amp; 165687, Nov. 15, 2007</b>). But [KKCA] is equally to blame because erosion occurred on January 20, 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (sic) after full blast excavation started on January 17, 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (sic) after excavation was added to its scope of work on December 15, 2003 (Exh. R-11), which placed under its supervision the excavation works of the sub-contractor. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>On the basis of estoppel, the CIAC concluded that eolorite was also at fault considering that it attended the various meetings regarding the restoration of the Hontiveros property; and it did not attribute any fault on WCC. To this, the Court cannot agree.<br><br>Colorite was present in the various meetings with KKCA, the Hontiveros family, and Makati building official regarding the restoration of the Hontiveros property. However, such fact, by itself, should not be taken against eolorite. As the owner of a project involving a substantial amount of financial investment, it is but normal for Colorite to show extraordinary interest in the resolution of an issue that posed a problem to the project's completion. Colorite's mere presence in the meetings does not amount to conduct and/or representation that it has, in fact, assumed an obligation. The principle of estoppel was, thus, erroneously applied.<br><br>Secondly, the CIAC maintained that WCe was at fault for the defective excavation. According to the CIAC:<br><blockquote>In the construction industry[,] soil protection is part of excavation works inasmuch as it is necessary in order to prevent erosion. The sub-contractor, [WCC], the company contracted by [Colorite] to do the excavation work for the basement and foundation of the building before the contract and Addendum #01 were signed by the parties, is duty bound to provide correct and adequate soil protection to avoid erosion. [Co1orite] failed to establish that its sub-contractor did soil protection work and if it did[,] it was [not] adequate or properly done. On the contrary, what happened was that after its initial full blast excavation works[,] the wall of the excavated basement adjacent [to] the Hontiveros property collapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>The CIAC concluded that by not holding wee accountable, eolorite, thereby, condoned its actions and assumed its liabilities. As such, WCC's liability in the resulting damage to the Hontiveros property should be borne by Colorite. To this, the Court once again disagrees. For one, WCC was not an employee of Colorite within the contemplation of Article 2180,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> in relation to Article 2176,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the Civil Code as to make the latter liable tor the damages caused by the former. Further, the fact that it was Co1orite, which contracted WCC to do the excavation works, is of no moment. It is beyond dispute that the parties expressly agreed that all excavation works are included in KKCA's scope of work, as the general contractor of the project. Paragraph 21 of Addendum #01 is clear on this point. It reads:<br><blockquote>21. <b>All excavation works as required for, should be included on the scope of works of the Contractor.</b> Disregard Pre-Bid Minutes Item II-G at Page 3.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Corresponding cost to be paid to the contractor based on sub-contractor's cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In view of the said stipulation, WCC was placed under KKCA's supervision and control.<br><br>Notably, in its Answer to Colorite's Complaint before the CIAC, KKCA never asserted that WCC should be blamed for the erosion.

Reyes, KKCA's consultant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> tasked to supervise the excavation, testified that no soil protection measure was installed prior to the erosion.

It is settled that the law does not relieve a party from the effects of an unwise, foolish, or disastrous contract, entered into with all the required formalities and with full awareness of what he was doing, and courts have no power to relieve parties from obligations voluntarily assumed, simply because their contracts turned out to be disastrous deals or unwise investments. <i>Valenti non fit injuria.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The CA was correct when it found that pursuant to paragraph 33 of Addendum #01, and the pertinent provision of Article XIII of the Main Construction Contract, KKCA assumed the responsibility of ensuring that properties adjacent to the project are protected from erosion and settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Said contractual provisions read:<br><br>Paragraph 33 of Addendum #01 states:<br><blockquote><ol start="33"><li>The Contractor to provide, erect and maintain all necessary bracing, shoring, planking, etc.[,] as required to protect the adjoining property against settlement and damages.

Accordingly, the totality of excavation work was divided into two levels, each with corresponding soil protection measure. The first level covers the depth, which extends from the natural grade-line down to the basement level, and which was to be undertaken by an excavation sub-contractor. On the other hand, the second level covering the depth beginning from the basement level down to the required column foundation height and other trimming works are to be done by the General Contractor. Item II, paragraph (g) of the pre-bid conference minutes of meeting reads:<br><blockquote>g) KKCA advised all the Bidders that excavation works from the natural grade line up to the Basement level shall be done by separate Excavation Contractor.

Paragraph 21 provides that all excavation works are within the scope of works of KKCA but it does not oblige KKCA to directly perform the same as it admits the employment of excavation sub-contractors, albeit for the account of Colorite. On the other hand, paragraph 33 explicitly makes soil protection works, and the installation of adequate dewatering equipment and pumps as KKCA's direct contractual obligation. While soil protection works and adequate dewatering system have distinct purposes, they are similar since both are continuing necessities while the foundation and the basement are not yet secured. It was thus logical that both items were placed under the general contractor's direct responsibilities under paragraph 33.<br><br>In <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Teodoro G.

Courts cannot make for the parties better or more equitable agreements than they themselves have been satisfied to make, or rewrite contracts because they operate harshly or inequitably as to one of the parties, or alter them for the benefit of one party and to the detriment of the other, or by construction, relieve one of the parties from terms which he voluntarily consented to, or impose on him those which he did not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis in the original deleted)<br></blockquote><b>There was no agreement that Colorite has to share in the restoration of the Hontiveros property.</b><br><br>The CA stated that the parties agreed for Colorite to contribute Php700,000.00 in the restoration of the Hontiveros property. The CA also held that the provision in the main contract which states that "<i>the owner shall be held free and harmless from any liability arising from claims of third parties arising from the construction</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> was effectively superseded thereby. Thus, owing to Colorite's failure to deliver the said amount, the CA ruled that Colorite was partly to be blamed for the delay of the project. Accordingly, Colorite was adjudged as only entitled to 50% of the liquidated damages it is claiming. For the same reason, Colorite was also held liable of 50% of the total maintenance cost.<br><br>According to the CA:<br><blockquote>It can thus be seen that despite its earlier commitment to contribute P700,000.00 for restoration costs, Colorite failed to pay the said amount. This Court holds that while Colorite cannot be held accountable for 70% of the restoration costs <b>in the absence of a clear agreement to this effect</b>, it should nonetheless be directed to fulfill its obligation to pay P700,000.00. x x x.<br><br>x x x [A]<b>lthough their contract states that KKCA should be held liable for expenses pertaining to such damage, the subsequent acts of the parties, specifically Colorite's undertaking to contribute P700,000.00 to the restoration costs, effectively superseded the said terms of the contract, and should now be made the governing law between the parties</b>. Article 1159 of the Civil Code supports this conclusion, when it provides that "(o)bligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith." Moreover, Article 1315 of the same Code provides that "(c)ontracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law." When Colorite thus bound itself to share in the restoration cost by paying P700,000.00, this effectively became the contract between the parties with regard to this matter. <b>While at first, there appeared to be a confusion as to the exact amount becuuse KKCA was insisting on a 70-30 sharing, it has been established that KKCA also eventually demanded P700,000.00 from Colorite, thereby showing that at that point, there was already an agreement as to the amount that should be delivered by Colorite.</b> It may be said, therefore, that a binding agreement has been perfected between the parties insofar as the restoration cost is concerned, and they should be bound by it regardless of who should be blamed, if any for the erosion. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x We are convinced that the parties' incapability to perform what was incumbent upon them was not attended by bad faith. <b>On the part of Colorite, its failure to advance P700,000.00 as part of its share in the restoration cost was due to a breakdown in the negotiation process which occurred when KKCA was insisting on a 70-30 sharing.</b> Although We maintain that Colorite was still at fault when it failed to give the promised P700,000.00 when KKCA was already demanding the same, it cannot be said that such refusal was tainted by bad faith. <b>Instead, it was more a case of a breakdown in the negotiation process, or a deadlock which the parties were not able to overcome due to their adherence to their respective positions.</b> x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>As can be deduced from the foregoing, it is not clear that the parties really agreed on whether Colorite was to contribute Php700,000.00 or 70% of the restoration cost.

As shown by the following, KKCA was adamant on its position that unless Colorite delivers the amount corresponding to 70% of the restoration cost of the Hontiveros property, the project will not continue. Thus:<br><blockquote>Atty. M. Somera (Counsel-Respondent):<br>Archt. Chua, you said that there was no [quit]claim or you were not been able to secure the [quit]claim...<br><br>Archt. K. K.

KKCA employed soil protection only after erosion had already taken place. Indeed, KKCA's failure to provide sufficient soil protection measures caused the erosion and was the proximate cause which set in motion the chain of events resulting to the project's delay.<br><br>KKCA represented itself as capable, competent and duly licensed to undertake the project. Thus, it is but reasonable to assume that KKCA knows the importance of soil protection in excavations and the degree of the risks involved in the absence of such protective measures. However, considering that Colorite never imputed bad faith on the part of KKCA, and in the absence of proof that the breach was attended by deliberate intent, the same can only be regarded as simple negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><b>Colorite is equally at fault for the protracted delay of the project</b><br><br>While all the foregoing easily points to the conclusion that KKCA is solely to be blamed for the delay of the project, the Court, however, finds that Colorite is also at fault. From the moment it became apparent that KKCA paid no heed to Colorite's demand to complete the project, the latter also began contributing to its delay.<br><br>Despite KKCA's firm stance, the project need not actually be delayed for too long. Other than KKCA's fault, the delay can likewise be avoided. For one, while KKCA is under contractual obligation to secure the lifting of the Hold Order, there is, however, nothing which prohibits Colorite from doing it.<br><br>Under Article V, paragraph (b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> of the construction contract, Colorite has the right to terminate the contract and carry out the completion of the project in the event that the delay exceeds the maximum allowable number of days of delay. However, Colorite opted to continue to bind KKCA in the contract.<br><br>While it may be that Colorite is acting within its right, the Court cannot find justification behind the former's inaction. Colorite asserts that it should be awarded compensatory damages for unrealized profit amounting to Php460,189.00 a month owing to the alleged great demand for leasable residential/commercial units in the area. However, Colorite's inaction weighs against the sincerity of its claim. Certainly, it does not appear to be in keeping with good sense that Colorite, on its part, did not act to secure the lifting of the Hold Order.<br><br>The law, under Article 19 of the Civil Code, provides that "[e]very person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith."<br><br>Article 19 of the Civil Code prescribes a primordial limitation on all rights by setting certain standards that must be observed in the exercise thereof. Accordingly, when it becomes manifest that one's right is exercised in bad faith for the sole intent of prejudicing another, an abuse of a right exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> However, abuse of a right must, of course, be proven since bad faith cannot be presumed, and nothing was presented here to establish the same.<br><br>The Court finds that in continuing to bind KKCA in the contract, Colorite was not impelled by good intentions. Article 2203 of the Civil Code is explicit that:<br><blockquote>The party suffering loss or injury must exercise the diligence of a good father of a family to minimize the damages resulting from the act or omission in question.<br></blockquote>This codal rule clearly obligates the injured party to undertake measures that will alleviate and not aggravate his condition after the infliction of the injury, and places upon him the burden of explaining why he could not do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the case of <i>Lasam v. Smith</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> the Court held that it was correct to fix the recoverable damages to Php1,254.10, and not to charge the defendant with the full expense of medical treatment amounting to Php7,832.80 considering that it was plaintiffs refusal to submit to an operation, which spawned the ensuing series of infections and which required constant and expensive treatment for several years.<br><br>Verily, common human experience dictates that under similar circumstances, anybody in the predicament of Colorite would have opted to exercise its right to terminate the contract the moment it became apparent that the contractor would not lift a finger to finish the project. Colorite should have pursued the completion of the project by another contractor to minimize injury upon itself, without prejudice, however, to the prosecution of its cause of action against KKCA.<br><br><b>On claims of Damages</b><br><br>Colorite prays that KKCA be directed to pay exemplary damages, attorney's fees, compensation for lost earnings, litigation expenses, and liquidated damages. For its part, KKCA prays that Colorite be adjudged liable for moral damages for the latter's bad faith in deliberately causing delay in the project and refusal to cooperate, attorney's fees, exemplary damages, arbitration fees and cost of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Since KKCA cannot be regarded to be in bad faith, the Court is left with no basis for awarding exemplary damages in favor of Colorite. In contracts and quasi-contracts, the award of exemplary damages connotes that the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> As the case provides no basis consistent with any of the grounds provided under Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> of the Civil Code for awarding attorney's fees and litigation cost, they cannot be awarded.<br><br>The same evenly applies to KKCA's claim. While the Court does not find sense in Colorite's failure to exercise its right to terminate its contract with KKCA, it, however, does not equate to a finding of bad faith. At any rate, KKCA did not impute bad faith against Colorite upon this issue. KKCA imputed bad faith against Colorite for insisting that excavation and soil protection works are its responsibilities, and for refusing to comply with the alleged sharing agreement in the restoration of the Hontiveros property. Since the Court does not subscribe to KKCA's assertions, its claim for moral damages proved to be without any basis.<br><br>Anent Colorite's claim for compensation for lost earnings, the Court agrees with the tribunals below that it cannot be awarded for want of sufficient basis. It assumes the nature of actual or compensatory damages, and such form of damages can only be awarded upon proof of the value of the loss suffered, or that of profits which failed to be obtained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> As propounded by the CA, "[t]he only basis relied upon by Colorite in claiming this item is the allegation that the subject property could have been rented at Php460,189.00 a month. There is, however, no showing that actual lease agreements exist so as to make the loss of rentals factual and not speculative."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Respecting Colorite's claim for liquidated damages, the Court does not find any reason to deny them.<br><br>Under Article V<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> of the construction contract, payment of liquidated damages was expressly stipulated in case of delay, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>Time being of the essence of this Agreement and the CONTRACTOR'S acknowledgment that the OWNER will suffer loss by the delay or failure of the CONTRACTOR to have the work completed in all parts within the time stipulated in Article IV, the <b>CONTRACTOR hereby expressly covenants and agree to pay the OWNER liquidated damages in the amount of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00) for each calendar day of delay (Sundays, and legal holidays included) until final completion and acceptance</b> by the OWNER, <b>the said payment to be made as liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Further, the fact of KKCA's delay in the performance of its obligation is well established. Nevertheless, it is also true that the delay would not have been that long had Colorite opted to exercise its right to take over the project.<br><br>Article 2226<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> of the Civil Code allows the parties to a contract to stipulate on liquidated damages to be paid in case of breach. It is attached to an obligation in order to insure performance and has a double function: (1) to provide for liquidated damages; and (2) to strengthen the coercive force of the obligation by the threat of greater responsibility in the event of breach. As a general rule, contracts constitute the law between the parties, and they are bound by its stipulations. For as long as they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy, the contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>By definition, liquidated damages are a penalty, meant to impress upon defaulting obligors the graver consequences of their own culpability. Liquidated damages must necessarily make non-compliance <i>more cumbersome</i> than compliance. Otherwise, contracts might as well make. no threat of a penalty at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Thus, the fact that Article V, paragraph (a) of the construction contract provides that the stipulated liquidated damages was not meant to penalize the contractor for the delay, but in order to compensate the owner for the loss it may suffer brought about by the delay is inconsequential; it does not operate to remove the stipulation's character as a penal clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Neither does it require that the loss suffered be proved. "Liquidated damages are identical to penalty, so far as legal results are concerned. In either case, the injured party need not prove the damages suffered by him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>Reckoning from March 6, 2005, as the first day of delay up to this writing, the project has been delayed for more than 12 years. Under Article V, paragraph (d), the contract allows justifiable cause or reason for delay, such as the occurrence of <i>coup d'etat</i>, general strike, typhoon, earthquake, shortage of lubricant or diesel fuel, or other civil disturbances that will directly affect the performance schedule. However, upon the occurrence of a justifiable cause, the contractor is required to submit a written request for time extension; otherwise, the original schedule shall stand. Whether or not the damaging and rehabilitation of the Hontiveros property would constitute, or would be accepted by the parties as justifiable cause or reason for delay has become inconsequential since no written request for time extension was submitted.<br><br>Applying the stipulated daily rate, the totality of recoverable liquidated damages shall amount to more than a staggering Php43,800,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> which sum even surpasses the total contract price. This cannot be decreed without running afoul of the spirit and express letters of the law. Under Article 2227 of the Civil Code, "[l]iquidated damages, whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if they are iniquitous or unconscionable." Moreover, the fact that KKCA was not able to perform substantial amount of work on the project is immaterial because it is also expressly provided under Article 1229 of the Civil Code that, "[e]ven if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable."<br><br>In view of the foregoing, and considering Colorite's own inaction which contributed to the delay of the project, the Court deems that the amount of liquidated damages, which can be equitably awarded to Colorite should be that corresponding to the period beginning on March 6, 2005 to October 2005, <i>the date when the rehabilitation of the Hontiveros property was completed</i> - plus, a period of six months covering October 31, 2005 to April 30, 2006 <i>representing the sufficient time within which Colorite should have determined whether the project should continue under the original construction contract, or whether the contract should be terminated and the project taken over</i>. The period within which the project shall be completed by another contractor in the event that the original contract was tenninated shall not be considered in the computation of the period of delay pursuant to the Court's ruling in <i>WERR Corporation International v. Highlands Prime Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Accordingly, the amount of liquidated damages shall be Php4,210,000.00 corresponding to the total of 421 days beginning March 6, 2005 up to April 30, 2006.<br><br>Moreover, as the parties have been locked in a prolonged legal battle since July 2007, equity demands that no interest shall be awarded on said amount prior to the finality of this Decision - lest the intention of the law, as expressed in Articles 2227 and 1229 of the Civil Code, be defeated.<br><br><b>KKCA is ordered to finish the project. The parties are to share in the increase in the construction cost over and above the contract price.</b><br><br>The CA and the CIAC agree that: (a) KKCA should see the project to its completion; (b) the escalation clause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> of the construction contract should apply only during and within the contract period; and (c) for the purpose of completing the project, it is but proper that necessary adjustments in the contract price be made to accommodate increase in the prices of materials after the contract period. However, while the CIAC contends that the parties should evenly shoulder the necessary price adjustment on a fifty-fifty basis, the CA's decision is silent on this point.<br><br>For its part, KKCA asserts that it should be released from the obligation of completing the project because the working relationship between the parties has become so strained; hence, the construction project is best to be performed by another contractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> KKCA also argues that to compel it to finish the project is violative of the constitutional guarantee against involuntary servitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>The Court cannot sanction KKCA's argument. Both the doctrine of strained relations and the policy against involuntary servitude are concepts, which only apply to situations where one is in the service of another, respectively, by virtue of an employment contract or by force or compulsion. They cannot apply in reciprocal contracts such as contracts for a piece of work, lest we run afoul with the principle of autonomy and obligatory nature of contracts evenly guaranteed under Article III, Section 10<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> of the Constitution. If KKCA truly believes that it has lawful basis to withdraw from the contract and/or be released therefrom, it should have filed an action for rescission.<br><br>The Court agrees that KKCA should finish the project. The contract subsists, and by all legal measure, the parties should comply with their contractual obligations. For the same reason, the Court does not share the disquisition of the tribunals below that the escalation clause of the contract should apply only during and "within the contract period," and that for the purpose of completing the project, necessary adjustments in the contract price must be made to accommodate increase in the cost of materials and/or labor "after the contract period."<br><br>As the contract continues to be in effect, every stipulation contained therein should, in principle, be held as controlling. Thus, the contract price should remain per agreement of the parties. This has to be for there is nothing in the contract which provides that any of its provisions will only be effective within the stipulated period of completion. In fact, the contract even contemplated the possibility of delay, and as stipulated, it was without prejudice to the effectivity of the escalation clause.<br><br>Owing to the length of time that the project was delayed, the Court agrees that the original contract price will not suffice anymore to cover the cost of completing the project. However, the Court cannot adjust the contract price because it has no authority to rewrite contracts even to foster equity.<br><br>KKCA breached its obligation in failing to provide sufficient soil protection measures, and this was the proximate cause of the delay. In a number of cases, the Court maintained that it is fundamental in the law on damages that the one injured by a breach of contract, or by a wrongful or negligent act or omission shall have a fair and just compensation commensurate to the loss sustained as a consequence of the defendant's act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br>In building contracts, it has been held that the measure of damages for breach is the amount expended by the owner in completing the project and in correcting defects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Hence, the increase in the amount necessary to finish the project, over and above the contract price, should be charged against KKCA as imposable damages. By legal definition, such damages are in the nature of actual or compensatory damages.<br><br>True, in order to legally award actual damages, the same must be duly proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> In a number of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> the Court emphasized that except in those cases where the law authorizes the imposition of punitive or exemplary damages, a party claiming damages must establish by competent evidence the amount of such damages.<br><br>Here, the additional amount for the completion of the project remains unquantifiable. Nevertheless, on principle, it can be awarded because said amount is a necessary incident in the completion of the project. Verily, considering the length of time that the project was delayed, the fact of increase in the construction cost above the contract price is beyond proof, and the utilization of said amount is an absolute certainty as long as Colorite remains intent on seeing the project through.<br><br>Quite similar to the issue at hand, in the case of <i>Baylen Corporation v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> the Court awarded actual damages in the amount of Php603,160.00 representing the increase in construction cost. Said amount was adjudged in consideration of the commissioner's report and not because it was proven as the amount of actual loss. Indeedthere was no way of proving the actual amount of increase in construction cost, for as in this case, the project in said case was yet to be completed.<br><br>However, considering that Colorite is also to be blamed for the delay of the project, it would be unjust to rule that KKCA should shoulder the entire amount as it will be tantamount to unjust enrichment on the part of Colorite. Thus, the parties should commonly share the amount of the increase in construction cost.<br><br>However, as previously discus.sed, Colorite's fault or inaction was determined to have begun on May 1, 2006. Hence, Colorite cannot be regarded as at fault for the first year of delay.<br><br>Under the circumstances, the Court deems that a sharing of the increase in the construction cost at the ratio of 40o/o for Colorite and 60o/o for KKCA is equitable.<br><br>On the basis of the same reasoning, the amount spent for maintenance cost up to April 30, 2006 shall be for the sole account of KKCA. Maintenance cost spent from May 1, 2006 onward shall be equally shared by the parties.<br><br>Respecting the issues on whether Colorite is liable for the payment of Design Fee and ECC Permit, the Court agrees with the findings of the tribunals below.
