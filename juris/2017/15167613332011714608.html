This already constituted permanent disability, which would merit the award of total and permanent disability benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, the Labor Arbiter denied Mabunay's claims for medical expenses and future medical expenses for being bereft of factual bases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> The Labor Arbiter also dismissed Sharpe Sea's argument that it should no longer be held liable for any claims against it in light of the Affidavit of Assumption of Responsibility<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it executed with Benhur Shipping Corporation (Benhur). The Labor Arbiter stated that Mabunay was not privy to the agreement between Sharpe Sea and Benhur, which happened after Mabunay signed his contract of employment; hence, Sharpe Sea should still be held liable for the award in Mabunay's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondent<strong> SHARPE SEA PERSONNEL, INC.</strong> to pay complainant Macario G.

Talavera </em>upheld the award of a Grade 8 disability benefit for a spinal injury similar to Mabunay's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> The<em> fallo</em> of the NLRC Resolution read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of this Commission is MODIFIED. Complainant Macario Mabunay, Jr. is declared to be entitled only to US$16,795.00 corresponding to Grade 8 disability grading under the POEA Standard Employment Contract.

It rebuked the NLRC for failing to rule on the admissibility of the belatedly filed evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p> The Court of Appeals also ruled that Mabunay was entitled to attorney's fees, moral, and exemplary damages since Sharpe Sea acted with bad faith in belatedly submitting a Grade 8 disability rating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Finally, it granted Mabunay's claim for actual expenses in the form of transportation expenses, magnetic resonance imaging, and doctor's fees since they were adequately supported with receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> The<em> fallo </em>of the Court of Appeals Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, the petition is <strong>PARTLY GRANTED</strong>.

Instead, it is the POEA-SEC itself that provides the requisites for the determination and award of disability compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Petitioners posit that Article 192(c)(i) of the Labor Code, which provides for total and permanent disability if the worker is unable to perform his job for more than 120 days, is only applicable to claims before the Employees Compensation Commission and not to claims covered by the POEA-SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> Furthermore, petitioners likewise assert that the POEA-SEC mandates a company-designated physician to conduct the medical evaluation and provide the disability grading, if applicable. The POEA-SEC provides a procedure for resolution should the seafarer disagree with the company-designated physician's assessment. However, respondent failed to comply with this established procedure; thus, he should be bound by the company-designated physician's assessment of a Grade 8 disability rating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners stress that the disability compensation scheme for seafarers is governed by a special law, the POEA-SEC, in recognition of the reality that "seafarers belong to a class of their own"; hence, the POEA-SEC provisions on disability compensation should be applied by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners likewise claim that they are not guilty of bad faith since they shouldered respondent's treatment and rehabilitation expenses; therefore, the award of damages and attorney's fees was baseless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners state that the belated submission of the medical certificate with Grade 8 rating was because respondent's medical treatment was extended due to his back operation. Petitioners aver that they never intended to conceal respondent's medical condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> As directed by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the parties exchanged pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> After giving due course to the petition, this Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> directed the parties to file their respective memoranda. </p><p> In respondent's Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> he insists that he repeatedly requested Dr. Cruz and Dr. Leonido Castillo (Dr. Castillo), the company­ designated physicians, to assess the degree of his disability but they refused to do so. Left with no other choice, he consulted with Dr. Raymundo and Dr. Fernando, who both concluded that he was unfit to work as a seaman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> Respondent contends that Dr. Cruz abdicated the duty imposed on him by the POEA-SEC when he refused to timely issue an assessment of respondent's disability grading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p><p> Respondent also points out that it was impossible to engage the opinion of a third doctor jointly agreed upon by the parties, as required by the POEA-SEC, since 240 days had already lapsed since his repatriation, without Dr. Cruz issuing a disability assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> Respondent emphasizes that petitioners failed to adequately explain their belated submission of Dr. Cruz's medical report with an interim assessment of Grade 8. The medical report was dated August 18, 2009, yet it was only submitted on July 19, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> To support his claims for damages, respondent adopts the findings of the Court of Appeals and also refers to the inhuman treatment he experienced aboard M/V Larisa, where he was expected to continue working despite informing his superior that he was under extreme pain. Furthermore, his medical treatment was stopped even if he had not yet fully recuperated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p><p> In their Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> petitioners continue to assert that the Grade 8 disability rating issued by Dr. Cruz should enjoy primacy over the findings of respondent's private physicians.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners also deny that they acted in bad faith or in an oppressive or malicious manner against respondent, since they shouldered all his medical expenses and were merely acting within the rights provided them by the POEA-SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> This Court resolves the following issues: </p><p> First, whether or not the Grade 8 disability rating of the company­ designated physician should be upheld over the contrary findings of respondent's private physicians; and </p> <p> Second, whether or not there is sufficient basis for the award of damages and attorney's fees. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> As part of a seafarer's deployment for overseas work, he and the vessel owner or its representative local manning agency are required to execute the POEA-SEC. Containing the standard terms and conditions of seafarers' employment, the POEA-SEC is deemed included in their contracts of employment in foreign ocean-going vessels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p><p> Petitioner Sharpe Sea and respondent Mabunay entered into a contract of employment on March 23, 2009;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> hence, the 2000 POEA-SEC is the applicable version. </p><p> Section 20(B) provides the two (2) requisites of compensable disability: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 20.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS </p> <p> The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers <strong>work­ related </strong>injury or illness <strong>during the term of his contract </strong>are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> It is not disputed that respondent encountered an accident a day after he boarded M/V Larisa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Upon repatriation and after careful monitoring, Dr. Cruz recommended that he undergo "discectomy for decompression of cervical area with fusion and bone grafting and fixation of cervical plates and screws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In other words, respondent underwent spine surgery and had cervical plates and screws attached on parts of his cervical discs to remove the pressure on his nerve root or spinal cord.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners insist that the Grade 8 disability rating issued by Dr. Cruz should be adhered to; as provided for under Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC, the governing law between the parties. Section 20(B)(3) reads: </p><ol start="3"><li> Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. </li></ol> <blockquote> <p> For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits. </p> <p> If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties. </p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners fault respondent for not consulting a third doctor when his private physicians disagreed with the Grade 8 disability assessment of the company-designated physician. </p><p> Petitioners fail to convince. </p><p> Petitioners repeatedly claimed before the proceedings in the labor tribunals that Dr. Cruz gave respondent a Grade 8 disability assessment, yet the records show that petitioners failed to substantiate their claim. The Labor Arbiter stated: </p><blockquote> <p> A perusal over the records shows that respondents' allegation that their company-designated physicians' assessment of complainant's disability Grading 8, was not submitted. <em>It is not in the records</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The NLRC then affirmed the Labor Arbiter's findings that petitioners failed to support their claim of respondent's Grade 8 disability assessment: </p><blockquote> <p> Despite the company[-]designated doctor's finding that complainant was suffering from the aforequoted illness, there is no evidence on record that complainant was given a disability grading of grade 8 as claimed by the respondents. <em>The record of the case does not show any proof of such disability grading given by the company[­]designated physician</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> However, petitioners somehow managed to produce proof of Dr. Cruz's Grade 8 medical report with the disability assessment and attached it to their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of the NLRC Decision. Furthermore, petitioners did not explain in its Motion why Dr. Cruz's medical report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> dated August 18, 2009 was only submitted into evidence two (2) years after, or on July 19, 2011. </p><p>While it is true that technical rules of evidence are not binding in labor cases and the NLRC is not precluded from receiving evidence for the first time on appeal, the delay in the submission of evidence must be adequately explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners half-heartedly tried to explain the belated filing of the medical certificate in its Petition: </p><blockquote> <p> Petitioners submitted with their Motion for Reconsideration that was filed with the NLRC, the medical certificate of Respondent stating forth therein that his disability grading is a Grade 8. However, the fact that Respondent was given a Grade 8 disability rating was earlier mentioned by Petitioners in their Comment On/Opposition to the Partial Appeal of Respondent that was also filed with the NLRC.<em> The belated submission of the medical certificate is due to the fact that Respondents medical treatment was extended since Respondent needed the aforecited procedure, discectomy, in order to treat his spondylosis</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Respondent filed his complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> on January 21, 2010. When mediation proceedings before the Labor Arbiter failed, the parties were directed to file their respective position papers. On July 8, 2010, petitioners filed their Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> to which they could have attached the medical report with the disability rating. However, they failed to do so. </p><p> Petitioners could have also attached the medical report in their Memorandum on Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> dated October 26, 2010, or in their Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> dated November 5, 2010 to respondent's appeal. Again, they failed to do so. Petitioners failed to clarify why a document available as early as August 18, 2009 was only submitted into evidence on July 19, 2011, giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that it was nonexistent on the date indicated in the medical report. </p><p> Manning and shipping companies are always in a better position than their employees in accessing, preserving, and presenting their evidence. In this case, despite the uncontested disability of the employee, he presented all his evidence, even going to the extent of consulting two (2) other doctors after the company-designated physicians refused to provide a disability rating.</p><p> This Court notes that petitioners' actuation on the belated presentation of a suspiciously ante-dated medical certificate borders on a contemptuous act that, under ordinary circumstances, may amount to disciplinary charges against counsel. </p><p> Nonetheless, even if this Court accepted petitioners' explanation on the belated submission of the disability rating into evidence, it is worthy to note that Dr. Cruz only issued an interim disability rating: </p><blockquote> <p> The<em> interim disability grading</em> under the POEA schedule of disabilities is Grade 8 total stiffness of the neck due to fracture or dislocation of the cervical spines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> <em>Magsaysay Maritime Corp. v. Cruz</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> emphasized that a company­ designated physician is expected to come up with a definite assessment of a seafarer's fitness or lack of fitness to work or to determine the seafarer's degree of disability within a period of 120 or 240 days from repatriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> <em>Magsaysay Maritime Corp</em>. stated that an interim disability grading is merely an initial prognosis and does not provide sufficient basis for an award of disability benefits, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Notably, the September 5, 2008 Report provides: "Interim Disability Grade: If a disability grading will be made today[,] our patient falls under 'Moderate rigidity of two thirds loss of motion or lifting power' — Grade (8) eight." <em>Being an interim disability grade, this declaration is an initial determination of respondent’s condition for the time being.</em> It is only an initial prognosis of the health status of respondent because after its issuance, respondent was still required to return for re-evaluation, and to continue therapy and medication; as such, <em>it does not fully assess respondent’s condition and cannot provide sufficient basis for the award of disability benefits in his favor</em>. </p> <p> Moreover, in <em>Carcedo v. Maine Marine Philippines, Inc., the Court did not give credence to the disability assessment given by the company designated doctor as the same was merely interim and not definite. </em>This is because after its issuance, Dario A. Carcedo (seafarer therein) still continued to require medical attention. Similarly, herein respondent needed further treatment and physical therapy even after the Interim Disability Grade was given by the company-designated doctor on September 5, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> After Dr. Cruz issued the interim disability rating of Grade 8, respondent underwent a discectomy where Dr. Cruz's only feedback was that respondent "tolerated the procedure well."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> This is not the "definite and conclusive assessment of the seafarers disability or fitness to return to work"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> required by law from the company-designated physician or appointed third-party physician that would have the effect of binding the parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> </p><p> Clearly, Dr. Cruz, Dr. Castillo, or any other company-designated physician failed to issue respondent either a fit-to-work certification or a final disability rating after his operation and before the lapse of 240 days from his repatriation. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err when it considered respondent to be permanently and totally disabled. This follows the ruling in <em>Kestrel Shipping v. Munar</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> where this Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> Indeed, under Section 32 of the POEA-SEC, only those injuries or disabilities that are classified as Grade 1 may be considered as total and permanent. However, if those injuries or disabilities with a disability grading from 2 to 14, hence, partial and permanent, would incapacitate a seafarer from performing his usual sea duties for a period of more than 120 or 240 days, depending on the need for further medical treatment, then he is, under legal contemplation, totally and permanently disabled. In other words, an impediment should be characterized as partial and permanent not only under the Schedule of Disabilities found in Section 32 of the POEA SEC but should be so under the relevant provisions of the Labor Code and the Amended Rules on Employee Compensation (AREC) implementing Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code. That while the seafarer is partially injured or disabled, he is not precluded from earning doing the same work he had before his injury or disability or that he is accustomed or trained to do. Otherwise, if his illness or injury prevents him from engaging in gainful employment for more than 120 or 240 days, as the case may be, he shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled. </p> <p> <em>Moreover, the company-designated physician is expected to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarers fitness to work or permanent disability within the period of 120 or 240 days. That should he fail to do so and the seafarer’s medical condition remains unresolved, the seafarer shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> With the company designated physicians' failure to issue either a fit­ to work certification or a final disability rating within the prescribed periods, respondent's disability was rightfully deemed to be total and permanent. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Respondent justifies his claim for damages by alleging the inhuman treatment he received aboard M/V Larisa, where he was made to continue working even after he reported his accident and the excruciating pain in his back. Respondent also points to the arbitrary stoppage of his medical treatment to substantiate his claim for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup></p><p> The Court of Appeals, in turn, awarded respondent moral and exemplary damages because of petitioners' bad faith in belatedly submitting the disability rating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> </p><p> This Court sees no reason to reverse the findings of the Court of Appeals. </p><p> Bad faith is not simply bad judgment or negligence. "[I]t imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong. It means a breach of a known duty through some motive or interest or ill-will that partakes of the nature of fraud."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> </p><p> By not timely releasing Dr. Cruz's interim disability grading, petitioners revealed their intention to leave respondent in the dark regarding his future as a seafarer and forced him to seek diagnosis from private physicians. Petitioners' bad faith was further exacerbated when they tried to invalidate the findings of respondent's private physicians, for his supposed failure to move for the appointment of a third-party physician as required by the POEA-SEC, despite their own deliberate concealment of their physician's interim diagnosis from respondent and the labor tribunals. Thus, this Court concurs with the Court of Appeals when it stated: </p><blockquote> <p> We also grant petitioner's prayer for moral and exemplary damages. Private respondents acted in bad faith when they belatedly submitted petitioner's Grade 8 disability rating only via their motion for reconsideration before the NLRC. By withholding such disability rating from petitioner, the latter was compelled to seek out opinion from his private doctors thereby causing him mental anguish, serious anxiety, and wounded feelings, thus, entitling him to moral damages of P50,000.00. Too, by way of example or correction for the public good, exemplary damages of P50,000.00 is awarded. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, in light of petitioners' patently malicious act in belatedly submitting an ante-dated medical report, this Court increases the award of moral damages from P50,000.00 to P100,000.00 as compensation for the anxiety and inconvenience that respondent suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> The award of exemplary damages is also increased from P50,000.00 to P100,000.00 to serve as a deterrent against the commission of similar oppressive acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p><p> Considering that the NLRC absolved petitioner Moises R. Florem, Jr. from personal liability in the absence of evidence that he had a direct hand in denying respondent's disability claims<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> and that this finding was never contested by any of the parties, this Court sees no reason to disturb this ruling.</p><p> Shipping companies should constantly be reminded of the humanity of their employees. Seafarers who leave their families for extended periods to pilot and maintain ships that bring profit for these corporations deserve better treatment than how respondent was treated in this case. In the ultimate analysis, if ever there will be a day of judgment, all of us will be held to account as to how we treated our fellow human beings, not by the amount of profit we generated for our corporations. </p><p> Petitioners could have done better in this case. With this judgment, this Court ends respondent’s travails and can only hope that the benefits this Court now awards can assuage his suffering. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the Petition for Review is <strong>DENIED</strong> for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals October 24, 2012 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 123318 is<strong> AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</strong>.
