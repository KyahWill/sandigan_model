However, the Court of Appeals found that the NDC prevented its execution by deliberately delaying its review of Galleon's financial accounts: </p><blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, it is evident that the period for the payment of the purchase price is entirely dependent on the execution of a share purchase agreement by the parties. The evidence on record, however, show that the <em>defendant-appellant NDC itself voluntarily prevented the execution of a share purchase agreement when it reneged on its various obligations under the Memorandum of Agreement</em>. The evidence on record show that the share purchase agreement was not formally executed because then Minister Roberto Ongpin claimed that the accounts of defendant Galleon had to be reviewed and cleared up before the share purchase agreement is signed. While defendant Galleon made its financial records available to defendant-appellant NDC for their review, the latter never made any serious effort to review the financial accounts of the defendant Galleon, hence, effectively preventing the execution of the share purchase agreement. Consequently, the condition for the running of the period for the payment of the purchase price of the shares of stocks in defendant Galleon by the defendant-appellant NDC,<em> i.e</em>., the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, was deemed fulfilled as it was the defendant-appellant NDC itself which prevented it from happening. Under Article 1186 of the Civil Code, a "condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfilment." This applies in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Regional Trial Court likewise found that respondent Cuenca, as Galleon's representative, initiated moves for the preparation and execution of the share purchase agreement and NDC's takeover of Galleon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Nonetheless, despite Cuenca's efforts, the share purchase agreement was never formally executed: </p><blockquote> <p> Assuming that the share purchase agreement was a condition for the effectivity of the Memorandum of Agreement (dated 10 August 1981), said condition is deemed fulfilled by virtue of Art. 1186 of the Civil Code, which provides that "<em>the condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment.</em>" Plaintiff Cuenca, as representative of the former shareholders of defendant Galleon, in order to clear up the accounts preparatory to the execution of the share purchase agreement, created a team to prepare a statement of defendant Galleon's outstanding accounts which statement of account was intended to be included as part of the annexes of the said share purchase agreement.

Ines, Cuenca, Tinio, Cuenca Investment and Universal Holdings should have initiated the execution of the share purchase agreement. However, the share purchase agreement was never executed, through no fault of Galleon's stockholders. </p><p> In clause 4 of the Memorandum of Agreement, NDC as the buyer was to verify the warranty of the Galleon shareholders that P46,740,755.00 was paid for Galleon's 46,740,755 common shares with par value of P1.00 per share. The results of the verification would have determined the final purchase price to be paid to the Galleon shareholders. Nonetheless, despite the verification still to be done, both parties agreed to execute the share purchase agreement as soon as possible but not more than sixty days from the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement. </p><p> We uphold the Court of Appeals' finding that the failure to execute the share purchase agreement was brought about by NDC's delay in reviewing the financial accounts submitted by Galleon's stockholders. The Memorandum of Agreement was executed on August 10, 1981, giving the parties no more than sixty days or up to October 9, 1981, to prepare and sign the share purchase agreement. However, it was only on April 26, 1982, or more than eight months after the Memorandum of Agreement was signed, did NDC's General Director submit his recommendation on Galleon's outstanding account. Even then, there was no clear intention to execute a share purchase agreement as compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement. Article 1186 of the Civil Code is categorical that a "condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfilment." Considering NDC's delay, the execution of the share purchase agreement should be considered fulfilled with NDC as the new owner of 100% of Galleon's shares of stocks. </p><p> The due execution of the share purchase agreement is further bolstered by Article 1198(4) of the Civil Code, which states that the debtor loses the right to make use of the period when a condition is violated, making the obligation immediately demandable: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1198. The debtor shall lose every right to make use of the period: </p> <p> (1) When after the obligation has been contracted, he becomes insolvent, unless he gives a guaranty or security for the debt; </p> <p> (2) When he does not furnish to the creditor the guaranties or securities which he has promised; </p> <p> (3) When by his own acts he has impaired said guaranties or securities after their establishment, and when through a fortuitous event they disappear, unless he immediately gives new ones equally satisfactory; </p> <p> <i>(4) When the debtor violates any undertaking, in consideration of which the creditor agreed to the period; </i></p> <p> (5) When the debtor attempts to abscond.
