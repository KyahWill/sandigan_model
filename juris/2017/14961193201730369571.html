Recto Avenue and T. Mapua Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila and immediately poked said arms upon RAYMOND IGNACIO y GAA, and announced the hold­up, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously took, robbed and carried away the Nokia 6680 worth [P]14,000.00, Philippine Cu[r]rency, of said Raymond G.

The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery in band defined and punished under Art. 294 in relation to Article 295 of the Revised Penal Code without any mitigating or aggravating circumstances attendant to its commission granting the accused the benefit of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, all the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term ranging from four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> maximum, as maximum.<br><br>The accused shall be credited with the full extent of their preventive imprisonment under Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Their bodies shall be committed to the custody of the Director of the Bureau of Correction, National Penitentiary, Muntinglupa (sic) City thru the City Jail Warden of Manila.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>All the accused appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Amparo, in particular, argued that he and Salmeo should be acquitted since the witnesses for the prosecution did not testify that they performed any act in furtherance of the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2012, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dismissing the appeal.<br><br>The Court of Appeals noted that Amparo had abandoned his earlier defense of alibi, and was arguing that there was no evidence that he actively participated in the commission of the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It found, however, that he was "caught red-handed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> with a weapon during the robbery, which was sufficient to establish that he had a common unlawful purpose with the rest of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Amparo filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which was denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated November 29, 2012. Hence, the Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> was filed.<br><br>Petitioner argues that Ignacio did not implicate him as a co-conspirator in his testimony since he did not even witness how the weapon was allegedly recovered by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> He points out that the bank employee who allegedly pinpointed him as part of the group, and the police officer who allegedly recovered the bladed weapon from him were not brought to court to testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> He asserts that he was arrested, not for his participation during the robbery, but due to his alleged possession of a bladed weapon, which was a violation of the city ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General maintains that the prosecution was able to prove petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It points out that direct proof is unnecessary to prove conspiracy since conspiracy can be inferred from the acts of the accused that they all had a common purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It argues that the prosecution was able to show that petitioner and his co-accused had the common objective of committing an armed robbery inside the jeepney and armed themselves with knives to accomplish their objective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In his Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> petitioner insists that the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses failed to implicate him as a co-conspirator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He also argued that there was no proof that a knife was recovered from his person, and other than this allegation, the prosecution was unable to prove that he committed any other overt act constituting the crime of robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The sole issue in this case is whether the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in finding that petitioner was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with band.<br><br>Robbery is the taking, with the intent to gain, of personal property belonging to another by use of force, violence or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Under Article 294 (5)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in relation to Article 295,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and Article 296<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, robbery in band is committed when four (4) or more malefactors take part in the robbery. All members are punished as principals for any assault committed by the band, unless it can be proven that the accused took steps to prevent the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Even if the crime is committed by several malefactors in a motor vehicle on a public highway, the crime is still classified as robbery in band, not highway robbery or brigandage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> under Presidential Decree No. 532.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It is highway robbery only when it can be proven that the malefactors primarily organized themselves for the purpose of committing that crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In this instance, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner was guilty of robbery in band.<br><br>Ignacio testified on cross-examination that Guarino announced a hold­up, and that Alcubar pointed a weapon at him, forcing him to take off his necklace and hand over his mobile phone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> He did not see what petitioner was doing at the time of the incident since petitioner and his co-accused Salmeo were seated beside the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Ignacio's failure to see what petitioner was doing during the robbery is justified considering that the configuration of a jeepney bench makes it hard to see precisely what passengers seated in the front seat are doing.<br><br>Ignacio was also able to testify that he saw both Salmeo and petitioner place their knives on the jeepney bench when the police fired a warning shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> SPO3 Perez corroborated this, and testified that there were eight (8) other passengers in the jeepney, who pointed out all four (4) of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> After making the arrests, the four (4) accused were frisked, and a fan knife was recovered from petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Petitioner initially offered a defense of alibi before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> He abandoned this defense on appeal after the trial court concluded that petitioner's alibi was not enough to overcome Ignacio's positive identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> He then argued before the Court of Appeals that while Ignacio might have seen him at the scene of the crime, there was no evidence of petitioner's exact involvement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> His changing defenses, however, only show the weakness of his arguments. Nevertheless, a conviction stands not on the weakness of the defense, but on the strength of the prosecution's evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> As discussed, the evidence of the prosecution was strong enough to overcome the presumption of innocence.<br><br>Under Article 294 (5) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the imposable penalty for robbery is <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its medium period. Article 295 of the same Code, however, qualifies the penalty to its maximum period if the robbery is committed by a band. Thus, the proper penalty is <i>prision mayor</i> in its maximum period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, in the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the minimum penalty shall be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, <i>prision mayor</i> minimum, or from six (6) years and one (1) day to eight (8) years. The maximum of the penalty shall be within the range of the medium period of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, or from eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to nine (9) years and four (4) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The trial court imposed a penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months as minimum and ten (10) years as maximum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> which is not within the prescribed range. Thus, the imposable penalty must be modified to six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> minimum to nine (9) years and four (4) months of <i>prision mayor</i> medium as maximum.<br><br>However, per the January 19, 2016<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> letter of Bureau of Corrections P/Supt. I Roberto R. Rabo, petitioner's maximum sentence imposed by the trial court had already expired upon adjustment of his sentence pursuant to Republic Act No. 10592.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It is noted, however, that the Bureau of Corrections does not detail how the maximum sentence was adjusted. Nevertheless, the service of the modified penalty is rendered moot since the Bureau of Corrections certified that the adjusted penalty was based on the maximum penalty imposed by the trial court. Thus, petitioner is ordered released unless he is detained for some other lawful cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The judgment of conviction in the Decision dated January 31, 2012 in CA-G.R. CR No. 33386 and Criminal Case No. 07-252654 is <b>AFFIRMED</b>. The imposable penalty is <b>MODIFIED</b>. Petitioner Ramon Amparo y Ibañez is found <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery in band defined and punished under Article 294 in relation to Article 295 of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> minimum to nine (9) years and four (4) months of <i>prision mayor</i> medium as maximum.<br><br>Since petitioner has already served more than the penalty imposed upon him by the trial court in Criminal Case No. 07-252654, his immediate release from custody is hereby <b>ORDERED</b> unless he is detained for some other lawful cause.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Peralta, Mendoza</i>, and <i>Perlas-Bernabe</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> <i>JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated as Fifth Member of the Second Division per S.O.
