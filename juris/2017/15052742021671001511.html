				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The base figure in the determination of full backwages is fixed at the salary rate received by the employee at the time he was illegally dismissed.

While the term "backwages" used in Article 279 of the Labor Code includes the benefits which the complainant should have received had he not been dismissed from work, benefits which are not prescribed by law of those referring to benefits granted by the employer either pursuant to the CBA or its benevolence, cannot be recognized unless duly proved. The decision dated 29 November 2000, which is the subject of the instant execution proceedings, did not recognize the foregoing alleged CBA and company issued benefits, although they were enumerated by complainant in his position paper. Neither did we find the basis of these alleged CBA negotiated benefits. While complainant attached a few pages of what purports to be their collective bargaining agreement, the effectivity date thereof was never presented for the NLRC and for us to determine the dates of their applicability. Thus, complainant's entitlement to these benefits was not substantially proven. For the same reason, we have no basis to consider the same. Except for the bare allegation that he should have been paid these benefits, no proof of such grant was presented by complainant.<br><br>Corollary, we can only recognize the legally mandated benefits that need not be established by substantial evidence, <i>i.e.</i>, the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and service incentive 1eave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On June 29, 2010, the NLRC issued its resolution remanding the case to the Labor Arbiter for the recomputation of the backwages inclusive of the benefits granted under the CBA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> disposing:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision dated 10 January 2010 is MODIFIED.

It cited <i>Fulache v.

Bank of the Philippine Islands</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> UCCI posits that in determining the respondent's backwages the prospective increases in wages as well as the benefits provided in the CBA should be excluded; that, as a consequence, the base figure for computing the respondent's backwages should be his basic salary prevailing at the time of his dismissal, unqualified by deductions or increases; that the ruling of the CA and the NLRC to include the CBA-granted benefits was without legal basis and was contrary to prevailing jurisprudence; and that at any rate the respondent did not establish that he was enjoying such CBA benefits at the time of his dismissal.<br><br>In contrast, the respondent, now represented by his parents, manifests that he would not oppose the computation of the backwages in accordance with the <i>BPI Employees' Union-Metro Manila</i> ruling, provided that: (1) the 12% interest <i>per annum</i> imposed from the time when the decision became final until full payment based on <i>BPI Employees' Union-Metro Manila</i> should be applied herein; and (2) that all CBA benefits being received by the respondent at the time of his dismissal should be added to his basic salary. He maintains that UCCI should alone be held liable for the payment of backwages instead of being held jointly liable with UELO.<br><br>In riposte, UCCI argues that it could not be solely held liable for the payment of backwages because of the express ruling of the NLRC on November 29, 2000 (as upheld by the CA and affirmed by this Court) declaring it and UELO liable for illegal dismissal; and that the respondent cannot belatedly raise the matter during the period of execution inasmuch as the matter should have been properly raised while the NLRC's decision was still on appeal.<br><br>In fine, the Court shall now determine the following, namely: (1) the correct basis for computing the backwages of the respondent; (2) the nature of UCCI's liability for payment of full backwages; and (3) the proper interest rate to be imposed on the judgment award.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>I<br><br>Backwages include all benefits previously enjoyed by the illegally dismissed employee</b><br></center><br>The extent of the backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee has been set in Article 279<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Article 279. Security of Tenure. - In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. <b>An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.</b><br></blockquote>The settled rule is that full backwages shall be pegged at the wage rate at the time of the employee's dismissal, unqualified by any deductions and increases, thus:<br><blockquote>[T]he determination of the salary base for the computation of backwages requires simply an application of judicial precedents defining the term "backwages." An unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal. Furthermore, the award of salary differentials is not allowed, the established rule being that upon reinstatement, illegally dismissed employees are to be paid their backwages without deduction and qualification as to any wage increases or other benefits that may have been received by their co-workers who were not dismissed or did not go on strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The base figure for the computation of backwages should include not only the basic salary but also the regular allowances being received, such as the emergency living allowances and the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay mandated by the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The purpose for this is to compensate the worker for what he has lost because of his dismissal, and to set the price or penalty on the employer for illegally dismissing his employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Conformably with the foregoing guidelines, the Labor Arbiter did not err in using P11,194.00 as the base figure because the sum represented the respondent's wage rate at the time of his dismissal on February 22, 1996. Also, the Labor Arbiter properly included in the computation the respondent's 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and service incentive leave.<br><br>The respondent insisted before the Labor Arbiter that his CBA ­granted benefits should be included, but UCCI opposed, citing the 2011 ruling in <i>BPI Employees' Union-Metro Manila v. Bank of the Philippine Islands</i>. It contended that any computation that reflected increases during the period of his dismissal would be incorrect for want of legal basis and for being contrary to prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br>We agree with UCCI.<br><br>The base figure to be used in reckoning full backwages is the salary rate of the employee at the time of his dismissal. The amount does not include the increases or benefits granted during the period of his dismissal because time stood still for him at the precise moment of his termination, and move forward only upon his reinstatement. Hence, the respondent should only receive backwages that included the amounts being received by him at the time of his illegal dismissal but not the benefits granted to his co­employees after his dismissal.<br><br>The Court is also aware of the reality that salary increases and benefits are not automatically given to the worker, but are given subject to conditions. As such, the respondent's claim for the increases in salary, meal subsidy, safety incentive pay, SOFA, financial grant and medical assistance for the period from 1997 until 2007, and one-time CBA increase, should be excluded from his backwages.<br><br>CBA allowances and benefits that the respondent was regularly receiving before his illegal dismissal on February 22, 1996 should be added to the base figure of P11,194.00. This is because Article 279 of the <i>Labor Code</i> decrees that the backwages shall be "<i>inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent</i>." Considering that the law does not distinguish between the benefits granted by the employer and those granted under the CBA, he should not be denied the latter benefits.<br><br>Nonetheless, the respondent still had to prove his entitlement to the benefits by submitting proof of his having received the same at the time of his illegal dismissal. In <i>BPI Employees' Union-Metro Manila</i>, the claim for CBA benefits such as the signing bonus, medical and doctor's allowance, and dental allowance was denied because the employee was unable to prove that he was receiving such benefits at the time of the illegal dismissal. To do so, therefore, the respondent must have submitted before the Labor Arbiter sufficient evidence establishing his receiving meal subsidy, SOFA, financial grant, medical assistance, built-in overtime and night shift differential, rice subsidy, uniform allowance, Christmas package, vacation and sick leave at the time he was dismissed. Yet, the respondent was unable to discharge his burden because the relevant documents, including the CBA, had been in UCCI's exclusive possession and custody. Unfortunately, the Labor Arbiter did not rule on his motion to compel the production of the documents by subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> because, as the NLRC put it:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>The Labor Arbiter did not recognize the CBA benefits which complainant alleged should have been included in the computation because the complainant failed to prove the same. On 2 June 2008, the complainant filed a motion xxxx for computation of backwages and issuance of subpoena to the personnel manager/payroll officer or any employee of respondent employer-company to bring documents as well as the Collective Bargaining Agreement in force related to the latest salary/benefits of a Senior Utilities Operator and to testify thereon. This motion was not resolved by the Labor Arbiter. xxxx On 1 July 2008, respondent [UCCI] in its personnel action form xxx admitted complainant's re-instatement salary to be P26,614.00 per month. The difference or disparity between the amount of P11,194.00 allegedly complainant's salary at the time of his dismissal on 26 February 2006 and P26,614.00 salary of complainant for the month of July 2008 should have prompted the Labor Arbiter to dig deeper into the allegations of complainant that he is entitled to other benefits under the CBA, the same to form part of the full backwages awarded to him.<br></blockquote>The observations of the CA on this are adopted with approval, to wit:<br><blockquote>In the case at bench, it is undisputed that private respondent was a regular employee of petitioner UCCI and a member of UELO. A perusal of the records also shows that his expulsion from the union was deemed unjustified. This was the finding of the Former Sixth Division of this Court in its Decision dated January 18, 2002. Had private respondent not been unlawfully ousted from the union and unjustly terminated from work, he would have been entitled to the benefits being regularly received by the employees of petitioner UCCI who are members of the bargaining unit. As aptly noted by the NLRC, petitioner UCCI failed to submit the documents providing the details of benefits granted to its employees from the time of private respondent's dismissal on February 22, 1996 up to the date of his reinstatement. The presumption that evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced thus applies. Consequently, We sustain the NLRC's ruling that private respondent's full backwages should be re-computed in order to include the benefits regularly given to petitioner UCCI's employees under the CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>We consider as patent error on the part of the Labor Arbiter to declare that the respondent had not proved his entitlement to the CBA benefits. Accordingly, the remand to enable the proper determination of the CBA benefits that the respondent had been receiving as of February 22, 2006 is proper and necessary.<br><br><center><b>II<br><br>UCCI is solely liable for the payment of backwages</b><br></center><br>The respondent submits that UCCI, as the employer, was solely liable for the payment of backwages. UCCI counters that the NLRC's decision promulgated on November 29, 2000, which the Court already affirmed, declared both UCCI and the UELO as liable for the backwages to the respondent; and insists that because the NLRC's decision had already become final and executory, no modifications thereof can be allowed without violating the rule on immutability of a final decision.<br><br>UCCI is mistaken.<br><br>The November 29, 2000 decision of the NLRC faulted the UCCI for dismissing the respondent without cause and for non-observance of procedural due process. The body of the decision explained how the UELO had wrongly expelled him from its membership, but such explanation was made only to highlight how the UCCI had not conducted its own investigation of the circumstances behind his expulsion in order to determine for itself whether or not the union security clause was applicable. Although the NLRC did not include in the body of its decision anything to the effect that UELO should be liable for the respondent's expulsion, it nonetheless decreed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and a new one entered <b>finding respondents liable for illegal dismissal and ordering them to reinstate complainant to his former position without loss of seniority rights and with full backwages</b> from the date of dismissal on 22 February 1996 to the date of actual reinstatement.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>There is thus a conflict between the body of the decision and the dispositive portion or the <i>fallo</i>. As a rule, the <i>fallo</i> controls in such a situation on the theory that the <i>fallo</i> is the final order, while the opinion stated in the body is a mere statement ordering nothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, where the inevitable conclusion from the body of the decision is so clear as to show that there was a mistake in the dispositive portion, the body of the decision should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Indeed, the rationality of the decision should justify the <i>fallo</i>. To say otherwise is to tolerate a farce. We have no doubt at all that the exception fully applies herein.<br><br>Verily, the petitioner, as the employer effecting the unlawful dismissal, was solely liable for the backwages of the respondent, its employee. In <i>General Milling Corporation v. Casio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we explained the liability of the employer in case of the unlawful termination pursuant to the union security provision of the CBA, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>xxxx Despite a closed shop provision in the CBA and the expulsion of Casio, <i>et al.</i> from IBP-Local 31, law and jurisprudence imposes upon GMC the obligation to accord Casio, <i>et al.</i> substantive and procedural due process before complying with the demand of IBP-Local 31 to dismiss the expelled union members from service. The failure of GMC to carry out this obligation makes it liable for illegal dismissal of Casio, <i>et al.</i><br><br>In <i>Malayang Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa M. Greenfield</i>, the Court held that notwithstanding the fact that the dismissal was at the instance of the federation and that the federation undertook to hold the company free from any liability resulting from the dismissal of several employees, the company may still be held liable if it was remiss in its duty to accord the would-be dismissed employees their right to be heard on the matter.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br></div><center><b><br>The interest rate to be imposed on the judgment award</b><br></center><br>The position of the respondent that the interest rate to be imposed on the monetary award should be fixed at 12% <i>per annum</i> reckoned from the finality of the decision of the NLRC until full payment is warranted and upheld. Pursuant to Article 2209 of the <i>Civil Code</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> interest at the legal rate should be imposed on the monetary awards in favor of the respondent because UCCI incurred a delay in discharging its legal obligations to pay him full backwages. In <i>BPI Employees Union-Metro Manila</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court, conformably with <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.

Considering that the decision of the NLRC in favor of the respondent became final and executory on November 17, 2003, <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc.</i> was the prevailing rule on the legal rate of interest.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the Motion for Substitution filed by the Heirs of Victoriano B.
