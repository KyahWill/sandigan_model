				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> are the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated September 14, 2015 and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 2, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 133794 and 133833, which, <i>inter alia</i>, ruled that petitioner Fabricator Philippines, Inc. (petitioner) illegally dismissed respondent Jeanie Rose Q. Estolas (respondent).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The instant case arose from a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for illegal dismissal with claims for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees filed before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) by respondent against petitioner, a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of motorcycle parts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and its President, Victor Lim (Lim).<br><br>Respondent alleged that petitioner hired her as a welder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Before break time of July 2, 2011, while waiting for a replacement part she requested to be installed on the welding machine she was using, respondent took a seat and rested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At that time, another employee, Rosario Banayad (Banayad), passed by and saw her sitting, then uttered "<i>Ayos ka ha</i>." The matter was brought to the attention of Assembly Action Team Leader, Warlito Abaya (Abaya), who confronted respondent about the said incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thereafter, while Abaya and Banayad were talking to each other, respondent told the latter in the vernacular "<i>Ang kitid ng utak mo[.] [B]akit hindi mo muna ako tinanong kung bakit ako nakaupo[?] [B]akit hindi mo muna tinanong kung ano [ang] nasa likod ng nakita mo?</i>" Banayad retorted, saying, "<i>Matapang ka ha! Matapang ka!</i>" Respondent replied, "<i>Candy, ikaw pa naman ang nagdadasal araw-araw, tapos ganyan ang ugali mo!</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Consequently, Abaya directed respondent to see Lim in his office. During their meeting, the latter allegedly asked what she would feel if he would hit her ear, then proceeded to hit her ear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Respondent reasoned out that she did not hit Banayad's ear and that it was the latter who provoked her. However, Lim insisted that respondent was rude towards Banayad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, on July 13, 2011, respondent was issued a suspension order effective the following day for a period of three (3) days. While she was in the locker area, the company guard on duty informed respondent to report for work the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>A few months later, or on October 17, 2011, Lim told respondent to resign and that his lawyer will see her on October 19, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On November 25, 2011, respondent was again instructed not to report for work until she and Lim have talked. On November 28, 2011, Lim directed respondent to sign a paper, which she refused as it pertained to the promotion of Banayad as Strategy and Control Group-Senior Assistant 1. On November 30, 2011, respondent received a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> from Lim directing her to seek the assistance of a lawyer for the hearing on December 7, 2011. At the scheduled hearing, respondent was required to sign the statements of Banayad and other witnesses, which she refused to follow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thereafter, on December 16, 2011, respondent was served a notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of termination effective December 17, 2011, finding her guilty of serious misconduct. Hence, respondent filed the aforementioned complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For their part,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> petitioner and Lim maintained that respondent was validly dismissed for gross misconduct, as: (<i>a</i>) she was caught sitting down during office hours; and (<i>b</i>) she insulted and uttered offensive language towards her superior, Banayad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> They further pointed out that they sent respondent various memoranda regarding the incident, but the latter refused to receive the same. Thus, they were constrained to terminate her employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Labor Arbiter's Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated September 17, 2012, the Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in favor of respondent, and accordingly, ordered petitioner and Lim to pay her separation pay with full backwages in the total amount of P167,324.29.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The LA found that while respondent may have indeed committed acts of misconduct, the same were not willful and intentional in character. The LA added that there was no wrongful intent, but a mere spur of the moment incident prompted by a simple miscommunication among workmates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As such, the penalty meted on respondent, <i>i.e.</i>, dismissal, was not commensurate to the offense charged against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner and Lim appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to the NLRC.<br><br><center><b>The NLRC Ruling</b><br></center><br>Initially, the NLRC issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated January 31, 2013 dismissing the appeal on technical grounds. Upon reconsideration, however, the NLRC promulgated a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated August 30, 2013 modifying the LA ruling by deleting the award of separation pay and backwages, and in lieu thereof, ordered respondent's reinstatement to her former position without loss of seniority rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The NLRC agreed with the LA's finding that while respondent indeed committed an act of misconduct, the same was not of a serious and grave character so as to warrant respondent's dismissal for a just cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, the NLRC found it appropriate to delete the award of backwages in respondent's favor, opining that this is a commensurate penalty for the latter's act of professional misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Both parties moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which were, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated November 29, 2013. Dissatisfied, they elevated the matter to the CA <i>via</i> their respective petitions for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated September 14, 2015, the CA reinstated the LA ruling with modifications: (<i>a</i>) ordering petitioner to pay respondent backwages from the time she was illegally dismissed until finality of the ruling less her salary for fifteen (15) days corresponding to her suspension, and separation pay computed from the time respondent was hired until finality of the decision, plus legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid; (<i>b</i>) absolving Lim from any personal liability arising from respondent's illegal dismissal; and (<i>c</i>) ordering the LA to make a recomputation of the total monetary benefits awarded and due respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Agreeing with the findings of the labor tribunals <i>a quo</i>, the CA held that respondent's acts did not amount to gross misconduct that would have justified her termination from work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this regard, it found that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in deleting the award of backwages, pointing out that respondent was already suspended for three (3) days for her misconduct, and thus, a second disciplinary proceeding, which resulted in her dismissal, as well as the consequent filing of the instant case, was no longer warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Nonetheless, the CA opined that respondent's infraction was minor, for which a fifteen (15)-day suspension would have sufficed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Anent respondent's claim for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, the CA pointed out that she never appealed the LA ruling which did not grant her such monetary awards, rendering the same final as to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Moreover, she failed to present competent evidence to support her claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA absolved Lim from any personal liability as it was not shown that he acted with malice and bad faith in dismissing respondent from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> but the same was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated May 2, 2016; hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's Resolution is whether or not the CA correctly ruled that respondent was illegally dismissed.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>Article 297 (formerly Article 282)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as amended, lists serious misconduct as one of the just causes for an employee's dismissal from work, pertinent portions of which read:<br><blockquote>Article 297 [282].<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>Termination by Employer</i>. — An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<br><br>(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Misconduct is defined as an improper or wrong conduct. It is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment. To constitute a valid cause for the dismissal within the text and meaning of the foregoing provision, the following elements must concur: (<i>a</i>) the misconduct must be serious; (<i>b</i>) it must relate to the performance of the employee's duties, showing that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer; and (<i>c</i>) it must have been performed with wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, the tribunals <i>a quo</i> aptly observed that while respondent indeed committed some sort of misconduct when she engaged in a verbal tussle with Banayad during work hours and in front of their superior, Abaya, the same was not serious enough to warrant respondent's dismissal. Neither was it shown that respondent performed such act of misconduct with wrongful intent nor did the same render her unfit to continue working for petitioner. As such, the tribunals <i>a quo</i> correctly concluded that petitioner illegally dismissed respondent. It is settled that "where the factual findings of the labor tribunals or agencies conform to, and are affirmed by the CA, the same are accorded respect and finality and are binding upon this Court,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Moreover, it is well to stress that on July 13, 2011, petitioner already issued an order suspending respondent for a period of three (3) days on account of her misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, petitioner could no longer subject respondent to another disciplinary proceeding based on the same act of misconduct. Clearly, respondent could not have been validly terminated from work.<br><br>As the fact of illegal dismissal has already been established, respondent is entitled to two (2) separate and distinct reliefs, namely: (<i>a</i>) backwages; and (<i>b</i>) reinstatement or the payment of separation pay if the reinstatement is no longer viable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As to backwages, the Court upholds the CA's award of the same in respondent's favor, as "the payment of backwages is a form of relief that restores the income that was lost by reason of the unlawful dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> However, the CA erred in imposing on respondent a fifteen (15)-day suspension for the latter's acts, with the equivalent monetary value corresponding to such suspension to be deducted from respondent's award of backwages. To reiterate, respondent was already meted a three (3)-day suspension for her act of misconduct and hence could no longer be further penalized for the same,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which thus renders such further penalty from the CA without any legal basis. In this light, the Court deems it appropriate to delete the aforesaid erroneous imposition, and consequently, award full backwages to respondent.<br><br>Anent the issue of reinstatement or payment of separation pay, it must be stressed that "[r]einstatement is a restoration to a state from which one has been removed or separated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, "[u]nder the doctrine of strained relations, the payment of separation pay is considered an acceptable alternative to reinstatement when the latter option is no longer desirable or viable. On one hand, such payment liberates the employee from what could be a highly oppressive work environment. On the other hand, it releases the employer from the grossly unpalatable obligation of maintaining in its employ a worker it could no longer trust."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In this case, while the LA and the CA did not discuss the basis for awarding separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, the Court nonetheless deems such award proper, considering that the underlying circumstances which led to respondent's unlawful termination, which had certainly created an atmosphere of animosity and antagonism between the employer and the employee, and hence, warrants the application of the doctrine of strained relations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
