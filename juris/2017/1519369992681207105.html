The Court <i>En Banc</i> clarified that RA No. 9337 did not repeal the tax privilege granted to PAGCOR under PD No. 1869, with respect to its income from gaming operations. What RA No. 9337 withdrew was PAGCOR's exemption from corporate income tax on its income derived from other related services, previously granted under Section 27(C) of RA No. 8424. The Court <i>En Banc</i> explained: </p><blockquote> <p> After a thorough study of the arguments and points raised by the parties, and in accordance with our Decision dated March 15, 2011, we sustain [PAGCOR's] contention that its income from gaming operations is subject only to five percent (5%) franchise tax under P.D. 1869, as amended, while its income from other related services is subject to corporate income tax pursuant to P.D. 1869, as amended, as well as R.A. No. 9337. This is demonstrable. </p> <p> <em><strong>First.</strong></em> Under P.D. 1869, as amended, [PAGCOR] is subject to income tax only with respect to its operation of related services. Accordingly, the income tax exemption ordained under Section 27(c) of R.A. No. 8424 clearly pertains only to [PAGCOR's] income from operation of related services. Such income tax exemption could not have been applicable to [PAGCOR's] income from gaming operations as it is already exempt therefrom under P.D. 1869, as amended, to wit: </p> <p> SECTION 13. Exemptions. — </p> <blockquote> <p>x x x x </p> <p> (2) Income and other taxes. — (a) Franchise Holder: <em><strong>No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation; nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise.</strong></em> Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority. </p> </blockquote> <p> Indeed, the grant of tax exemption or the withdrawal thereof assumes that the person or entity involved is subject to tax. This is the most sound and logical interpretation because [PAGCOR] could not have been exempted from paying taxes which it was not liable to pay in the first place. This is clear from the wordings of P.D. 1869, as amended, imposing a franchise tax of five percent (5%) on its gross revenue or earnings derived by [PAGCOR] from its operation under the Franchise<em> in lieu </em>of all taxes of any kind or form, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, which necessarily include corporate income tax. </p> <p> In other words, there was no need for Congress to grant tax exemption to [PAGCOR] with respect to its income from gaming operations as the same is already exempted from all taxes of any kind or form, income or otherwise, whether national or local, under its Charter, save only for the five percent (5%) franchise tax. The exemption attached to the income from gaming operations exists independently from the enactment of R.A. No. 8424. To adopt an assumption otherwise would be downright ridiculous, if not deleterious, since [PAGCOR] would be in a worse position if the exemption was granted (then withdrawn) than when it was not granted at all in the first place. </p> <p> Moreover, as may be gathered from the legislative records of the Bicameral Conference Meeting of the Committee on Ways and Means dated October 27, 1997, the exemption of [PAGCOR] from the payment of corporate income tax was due to the acquiescence of the Committee on Ways and Means to the request of [PAGCOR] that it be exempt from such tax. Based on the foregoing, it would be absurd for [PAGCOR] to seek exemption from income tax on its gaming operations when under its Charter, it is already exempted from paying the same. </p> <p> <b><i>Second. </i></b>Every effort must be exerted to avoid a conflict between statutes; so that if reasonable construction is possible, the laws must be reconciled in that manner. </p> <p> As we see it, there is no conflict between P.D. 1869, as amended, and R.A. No. 9337. The former lays down the taxes imposable upon [PAGCOR], as follows: (1) <i>a five percent (5%) franchise tax </i>of the gross revenues or earnings derived from its operations conducted under the Franchise, which shall be due and payable in <i>lieu</i> of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial or national government authority; (2) <i>income tax</i> for income realized from other necessary and related services, shows and entertainment of [PAGCOR]. With the enactment of R.A. No. 9337, which withdrew the income tax exemption under R.A. No. 8424, petitioner's tax liability on income from other related services was merely reinstated. </p> <p> It cannot be gainsaid, therefore, that the nature of taxes imposable is well defined for each kind of activity or operation. There is no inconsistency between the statutes; and in fact, they complement each other. </p> <p> <b><i>Third. </i></b>Even assuming that an inconsistency exists, P.D. 1869, as amended, which expressly provides the tax treatment of [PAGCOR's] income prevails over R.A. No. 9337, which is a general law. It is a canon of statutory construction that a special law prevails over a general law — regardless of their dates of passage — and the special is to be considered as remaining an exception to the general. The <i>rationale</i> is: </p> <blockquote> <p> Why a special law prevails over a general law has been put by the Court as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x x </p> <p> x x x The Legislature consider and make provision for all the circumstances of the particular case. <b><i>The Legislature having specially considered all of the facts and circumstances in the particular case in granting a special charter, it will not be considered that the Legislature, by adopting a general law containing provisions repugnant to the provisions of the charter, and without making any mention of its intention to amend or modify the charter, intended to amend, repeal, or modify the special act. </i></b>(<em>Lewis vs. Cook County, 74 Ill. App., 151; Philippine Railway Co. vs. Nolting</em>, 34 Phil., 401.) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Where a general law is enacted to regulate an industry, it is common for individual franchises subsequently granted to restate the rights and privileges already mentioned in the general law, or to amend the later law, as may be needed, to conform to the general law. However, if no provision or amendment is stated in the franchise to effect the provisions of the general law, it cannot be said that the same is the intent of the lawmakers, for repeal of laws by implication is not favored. </p> <p> In this regard, we agree with [PAGCOR] that if the lawmakers had intended to withdraw [PAGCOR's] tax exemption of its gaming income, then Section 13(2)(a) of P.D. 1869 should have been amended expressly in R.A. No. 9487, or the same, at the very least, should have been mentioned in the repealing clause of R.A. No. 9337. However, the repealing clause never mentioned [PAGCOR's] Charter as one of the laws being repealed. On the other hand, the repeal of other special laws, namely, Section 13 of R.A. No. 6395 as well as Section 6, fifth paragraph of R.A. No. 9136, is categorically provided under Section 24(a) (b) of R.A. No. 9337, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> SEC. 24. <em>Repealing Clause</em>. — The following laws or provisions of laws are hereby repealed and the persons and/or transactions affected herein are made subject to the value-added tax subject to the provisions of Title IV of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended: </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><div align="center">(A) </div></td> <td width="93%"><div align="justify"><em><strong>Section 13 of R.A.

Otherwise, Congress would have painstakingly enumerated the rights and privileges that it wants to withdraw, given that a franchise is a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person. Thus, the extension of [PAGCOR's] franchise under the same terms and conditions means a continuation of its tax exempt status with respect to its income from gaming operations. Moreover, all laws, rules and regulations, or parts thereof, which are inconsistent with the provisions of P.D. 1869, as amended, a special law, are considered repealed, amended and modified, consistent with Section 2 of R.A. No. 9487, thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. <em>Repealing Clause</em>. — All laws, decrees, executive orders, proclamations, rules and regulations and other issuances, or parts thereof, which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby repealed, amended and modified. </p> </blockquote> <p> It is settled that where a statute is susceptible of more than one interpretation, the court should adopt such reasonable and beneficial construction which will render the provision thereof operative and effective, as well as harmonious with each other. </p> <p> Given that [PAGCOR's] Charter is not deemed repealed or amended by R.A. No. 9337, [PAGCOR's] income derived from gaming operations is subject only to the five percent (5%) franchise tax, in accordance with P.D. 1869, as amended. With respect to [PAGCOR's] income from operation of other related services, the same is subject to income tax only. The five percent (5%) franchise tax finds no application with respect to [PAGCOR's] income from other related services, in view of the express provision of Section 14(5) of P.D. 1869, as amended, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> Section 14. Other Conditions. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (5) Operation of related services. — The Corporation is authorized to operate such necessary and related services, shows and entertainment. <em><strong>Any income that may be realized from these related services shall not be included as part of the income of the Corporation for the purpose of applying the franchise tax</strong></em>, but the same shall be considered as a separate income of the Corporation and shall be subject to income tax. </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, it would be the height of injustice to impose franchise tax upon [PAGCOR] for its income from other related services without basis therefor. </p> <p> For proper guidance, the first classification of PAGCOR's income under RMC No. 33-2013 (<em>i.e</em>., income from its operations and licensing of gambling casinos, gaming clubs and other similar recreation or amusement places, gambling pools) should be interpreted in relation to Section 13(2) of P.D. 1869, which pertains to the income derived from issuing and/or granting the license to operate casinos to PAGCOR's contractees and licensees, as well as earnings derived by PAGCOR from its own operations under the Franchise. On the other hand, the second classification of PAGCOR's income under RMC No. 33-2013 (<em>i.e</em>., income from other related operations) should be interpreted in relation to Section 14(5) of P.D. 1869, which pertains to income received by PAGCOR from its contractees and licensees in the latter's operation of casinos, as well as PAGCOR's own income from operating necessary and related services, shows and entertainment. </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> In view of the foregoing disquisition, [the CIR], therefore, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it issued RMC No. 33-2013 subjecting both income from gaming operations and other related services to corporate income tax and five percent (5%) franchise tax. This unduly expands our Decision dated March 15, 2011 without due process since the imposition creates additional burden upon petitioner. Such act constitutes an overreach on the part of the respondent, which should be immediately struck down, lest grave injustice results. More, it is settled that in case of discrepancy between the basic law and a rule or regulation issued to implement said law, the basic law prevails, because the said rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the basic law. </p> <p> In fine, we uphold our earlier ruling that Section 1 of R.A. No. 9337, amending Section 27(c) of R.A. No. 8424, by excluding [PAGCOR] from the enumeration of GOCCs exempted from corporate income tax, is valid and constitutional. In addition, we hold that: </p> <ol><li><u>[PAGCOR's] tax privilege of paying five percent (5%) franchise tax<em> in lieu </em>of all other taxes with respect to its income from gaming operations, pursuant to P.D. 1869, as amended, is<em> not</em> repealed or amended by Section 1(c) of R.A.

Accordingly, [the CIR] is <b>ORDERED</b> to cease and desist the implementation of RMC No. 33-2013 insofar as it imposes: (1) corporate income tax on [PAGCOR's] income derived from its gaming operations; and (2) franchise tax on [PAGCOR's] income from other related services. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Underscoring supplied; citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, the assessments for deficiency income tax covers both PAGCOR's income derived from gaming operations and other related services. Considering that the Court <i>En Banc</i> has already ruled that PAGCOR, under its Charter, remains to be exempt from income tax on its gaming operations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> then PAGCOR should only be made liable to pay for deficiency income tax on its income derived from other related services for taxable years 2005 and 2006.

In said case, the Court ruled that FBT is not covered by the exemptions provided under PD No. 1869; and considering that PAGCOR failed to present any evidence showing that the fringe benefits granted to its officers were necessary to its business or for its convenience, the deficiency FBT assessments on PAGCOR's car benefit plan was upheld, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>a. Final Withholding Tax on Fringe Benefits</b></p> <p> The recomputed assessment for deficiency final withholding taxes related to the car plan granted to PAGCOR's employees and for its payment of membership dues and fees.</p> <p> Under Section 33 of the NIRC, FBT is imposed as:</p> <blockquote> <p> A final tax of thirty-four percent (34%) effective January 1, 1998; thirty-three percent (33%) effective January 1, 1999; and thirty-two percent (32%) effective January 1, 2000 and thereafter, is hereby imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefit furnished or granted to the employee (except rank and file employees as defined herein) by the employer, whether an individual or a corporation (unless the fringe benefit is required by the nature of, or necessary to the trade, business or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer). The tax herein imposed is payable by the employer which tax shall be paid in the same manner as provided for under Section 57 (A) of this Code.</p> </blockquote> <p> <b>FBT is treated as a final income tax on the employee that shall be withheld and paid by the employer on a calendar quarterly basis. As such, PAGCOR is a mere withholding agent inasmuch as the FBT is imposed on PAGCOR's employees who receive the fringe benefit. <u>PAGCOR's liability as a withholding agent is not covered by the tax exemptions under its Charter.</u></b></p> <p> The car plan extended by PAGCOR to its qualified officers is evidently considered a fringe benefit as defined under Section 33 of the NIRC. To avoid the imposition of the FBT on the benefit received by the employee, and, consequently, to avoid the withholding of the payment thereof by the employer, PAGCOR must sufficiently establish that the fringe benefit is required by the nature of, or is necessary to the trade, business or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer.</p> <p> PAGCOR asserted that the car plan was granted "not only because it was necessary to the nature of the trade of PAGCOR but it was also granted for its convenience." The records are lacking in proof as to whether such benefit granted to PAGCOR's officers were, in fact, necessary for PAGCOR's business or for its convenience and advantage. Accordingly, PAGCOR should have withheld the FBT from the officers who have availed themselves of the benefits of the car plan and remitted the same to the BIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In the same vein, PAGCOR, in this case, did not adduce any proof, other than bare allegations, that the car plan granted to its officers was ultimately for the benefit of its business or for its convenience or advantage.

No. 8424), as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> SEC. 108. <em>Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties</em>. — </p> <p> (A) <em>Rate and Base of Tax</em>. — There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to ten percent (10%) of gross receipts derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties: x x x </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (B) <em><strong>Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate.</strong></em>—The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate; </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (3) <strong>Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws </strong>or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively <strong>subjects the supply of such services to zero percent (0%) rate</strong>; </p> <p> x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> As pointed out by petitioner, although R.A. No. 9337 introduced amendments to Section 108 of R.A. No. 8424 by imposing VAT on other services not previously covered, it did not amend the portion of Section 108 (B) (3) that subjects to zero percent rate services performed by VAT-registered persons to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to 0% rate. </p> <p> Petitioner's exemption from VAT under Section 108 (B) (3) of R.A. No. 8424 has been thoroughly and extensively discussed in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acesite (Philippines) Hotel Corporation</em>. Acesite was the owner and operator of the Holiday Inn Manila Pavilion Hotel. It leased a portion of the hotel's premises to PAGCOR. It incurred VAT amounting to P30,152,892.02 from its rental income and sale of food and beverages to PAGCOR from January 1996 to April 1997. Acesite tried to shift the said taxes to PAGCOR by incorporating it in the amount assessed to PAGCOR. However, PAGCOR refused to pay the taxes because of its tax-exempt status. PAGCOR paid only the amount due to Acesite minus VAT in the sum of P30,152,892.02. Acesite paid VAT in the amount of P30,152,892.02 to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, fearing the legal consequences of its non-payment. In May 1998, Acesite sought the refund of the amount it paid as VAT on the ground that its transaction with PAGCOR was subject to zero rate as it was rendered to a tax-exempt entity. The Court ruled that PAGCOR and Acesite were both exempt from paying VAT, thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x x </p> <p> <b>PAGCOR is exempt from payment of indirect taxes</b> </p> <p> It is undisputed that P.D. 1869, the charter creating PAGCOR, grants the latter an exemption from the payment of taxes. Section 13 of P.D. 1869 pertinently provides: </p> <blockquote> <p align="justify"> Sec. 13.<em> Exemptions.</em> — </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (2) <em>Income and other taxes. </em>— (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation; nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise. Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority. </p> <p> (b) <em>Others</em>: The exemptions herein granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s), association(s), agency(ies), or individual(s) with whom the Corporation or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise and to those receiving compensation or other remuneration from the Corporation or operator as a result of essential facilities furnished and/or technical services rendered to the Corporation or operator. </p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner contends that the above tax exemption refers only to PAGCOR's direct tax liability and not to indirect taxes, like the VAT. </p> <p> We disagree. </p> <p> <b>A close scrutiny of the above provisos clearly gives PAGCOR a blanket exemption to taxes with no distinction on whether the taxes are direct or indirect. </b>We are one with the CA ruling that PAGCOR is also exempt from indirect taxes, like VAT, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> Under the above provision [Section 13 (2) (b) of P.D. 1869], the term "Corporation" or operator refers to PAGCOR. Although the law does not specifically mention PAGCOR's exemption from indirect taxes, <strong>PAGCOR is undoubtedly exempt from such taxes because the law exempts from taxes persons or entities contracting with PAGCOR in casino operations.</strong> Although, differently worded, the provision clearly exempts PAGCOR from indirect taxes.<strong> In fact, it goes one step further by granting tax exempt status to persons dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations. </strong>The unmistakable conclusion is that PAGCOR is not liable for the P30,152,892.02 VAT and neither is Acesite as the latter is effectively subject to zero percent rate under Sec. 108 B (3), R.A. 8424. (Emphasis supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p> Indeed, by extending the exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR, the legislature clearly granted exemption also from indirect taxes. It must be noted that the indirect tax of VAT, as in the instant case, can be shifted or passed to the buyer, transferee, or lessee of the goods, properties, or services subject to VAT. <b>Thus, by extending the tax exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations, it is exempting PAGCOR from being liable to indirect taxes.</b></p> <p> <b>The manner of charging VAT does not make PAGCOR liable to said tax.</b> </p> <p> It is true that VAT can either be incorporated in the value of the goods, properties, or services sold or leased, in which case it is computed as 1/11 of such value, or charged as an additional 10% to the value. Verily, the seller or lessor has the option to follow either way in charging its clients and customer. In the instant case, Acesite followed the latter method, that is, charging an additional 10% of the gross sales and rentals. Be that as it may, the use of either method, and in particular, the first method, does not denigrate the fact that PAGCOR is exempt from an indirect tax, like VAT. </p> <p> <b>VAT exemption extends to Acesite</b> </p> <p> Thus, while it was proper for PAGCOR not to pay the 10% VAT charged by Acesite, the latter is not liable for the payment of it as it is exempt in this particular transaction by operation of law to pay the indirect tax. Such exemption falls within the former Section 102 (b) (3) of the 1977 Tax Code, as amended (<b>now Sec. 108 [b] [3] of R.A. 8424</b>), which provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> Section 102. <em>Value-added tax on sale of services</em>. — (a) Rate and base of tax — There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to 10% of gross receipts derived by any person engaged in the sale of services x x x; Provided, that the following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to 0%. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (3) <b>Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws </b>or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to zero (0%) rate (emphasis supplied). </p> </blockquote> <p> The rationale for the exemption from indirect taxes provided for in P.D. 1869 and the extension of such exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations are best elucidated from the 1987 case of <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. John Gotamco &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, where the absolute tax exemption of the World Health Organization (WHO) upon an international agreement was upheld. We held in said case that the exemption of contractee WHO should be implemented to mean that the entity or person exempt is the contractor itself who constructed the building owned by contractee WHO, and such does not violate the rule that tax exemptions are personal because the <b>manifest intention of the agreement is to exempt the contractor so that no contractor's tax may be shifted to the contractee WHO. Thus, the proviso in P.D. 1869, extending the exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations, is clearly to proscribe any indirect tax, like VAT, that may be shifted to PAGCOR</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied; citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The CIR, however, argues that the Court's ruling in<em> Acesite</em> does not apply to this case because <em>Acesite</em> was based on the old Tax Code (1977 NIRC); while the assessments being made in the present case is in accordance with the 1997 NIRC, as amended by RA No. 9337. </p><p> The CIR's contention is untenable. </p><p> In the same PAGCOR case, the Court explained that while the basis of PAGCOR's exemption in <em>Acesite</em> was Section 102(b) of the 1977 NIRC, said provision was retained in the 1997 NIRC, as amended by RA No. 9337. Hence, the legislative intent is for PAGCOR to remain exempt from VAT even with the enactment of RA No. 9337. The CTA therefore was correct in cancelling the deficiency VAT assessments issued against PAGCOR for lack of legal basis. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing considerations, the petition filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in G.R. Nos. 210704 &amp; 210725 is hereby <b>DENIED</b>; while the petition filed by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation in G.R. Nos. 210689-90 is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
