				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeking to set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 25, 2009 and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated April 23, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 110511. The question is whether courts may approve an attachment bond which has been reinsured as to the excess of the issuer's statutory retention limit.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Petitioner Communication and Information Systems Corporation (CISC) and respondent Mark Sensing Australia Pty. Ltd. (MSAPL) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (MOA) dated March 1, 2002 whereby MSAPL appointed CISC as "the exclusive AGENT of [MSAPL] to PCSO during the [lifetime] of the recently concluded Memorandum of Agreement entered into between [MSAPL], PCSO and other parties." The recent agreement referred to in the MOA is the thermal paper and bet slip supply contract (the Supply Contract) between the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), MSAPL, and three other suppliers, namely Lamco Paper Products Company, Inc. (Lamco Paper), Consolidated Paper Products, Inc. (Consolidated Paper) and Trojan Computer Forms Manufacturing Corporation (Trojan Computer Forms).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> As consideration for CISC's services, MSAPL agreed to pay CISC a commission of 24.5% of future gross sales to PCSO, exclusive of duties and taxes, for six years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After initially complying with its obligation under the MOA, MSAPL stopped remitting commissions to CISC during the second quarter of 2004. MSAPL justified its action by claiming that Carolina de Jesus, President of CISC, violated her authority when she negotiated the Supply Contract with PCSO and three of MSAPL's competitors. According to MSAPL, it lost almost one-half of its business with PCSO because the Supply Contract provided that MSAPL's business with PCSO shall be limited to the latter's Luzon operations, with MSAPL supplying 70% of thermal rolls and 50% of bet slips. MSAPL pointed out that it used to have a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) Agreement with PCSO where it undertook to build a thermal paper and bet slip manufacturing facility to supply all requirements of PCSO. However, PCSO unilaterally cancelled the BOT Agreement and granted supply contracts to Lamco Paper, Consolidated Paper and Trojan Computer Forms, which ultimately resulted in litigation between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The suit was eventually settled when PCSO, MSAPL, and the three other suppliers entered into the Supply Contract, which was submitted and approved by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 224 of Quezon City, as a compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> MSAPL felt shortchanged by CISC's efforts and thus decided to withhold payment of commissions.<br><br>As a result of MSAPL's refusal to pay, CISC filed a complaint before the RTC in Quezon City for specific performance against MSAPL, Mark Sensing Philippines, Inc. (MSPI), Atty. Ofelia Cajigal, and PCSO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> CISC prayed that private respondents be ordered to comply with its obligations under the MOA. It also asked the RTC to issue a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and/or writ of attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The RTC denied CISC's prayer for mandatory injunctive relief but ordered the PCSO to hold the amount being contested until the final determination of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It later reversed itself, holding that its jurisdiction is limited to the amount stated in the complaint and therefore had no jurisdiction to order PCSO to withhold payments in excess of such amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This order of reversal became the subject of a separate petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by CISC before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 96620.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The CA later reversed the RTC and ordered that the additional docket fees shall constitute a lien on the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 10, 2007, the RTC granted CISC's application for issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment, stating that "the non-payment of the agreed commission constitutes fraud on the part of the defendant MSAPL in their performance of their obligation to the plaintiff."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The RTC found that MSAPL is a foreign corporation based in Australia, and its Philippine subsidiary, MSPI, has no other asset except for its collectibles from PCSO. Thus, the RTC concluded that CISC may be left without any security if ever MSAPL is found liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> But the RTC limited the attachment to P4,861,312.00, which is the amount stated in the complaint, instead of the amount sought to be attached by CISC, <i>i.e.</i>, P113,197,309.10.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The RTC explained that it "will have to await the Supreme Court judgment over the issue of whether [it] has jurisdiction on the amounts in the excess of the amount prayed for by the plaintiff in their complaint" since MSAPL appealed the adverse judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 96620 to us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> We later denied MSAPL's petition for review assailing the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 96620 (subsequently docketed as G.R. No. 179073) in a Resolution dated November 12, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It became final and executory on March 25, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In view of this development, CISC moved to amend the order of attachment to include unpaid commissions in excess of the amount stated in the complaint. On December 22, 2008, the RTC granted CISC's motion and issued a new writ of preliminary attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On <b>April 13, 2009</b>, the RTC, acting on the partial motions for reconsideration by both CISC and MSAPL, modified the amount covered by the writ to reflect the correct amount prayed for by CISC in its previous motion to amend the attachment order conditioned upon the latter's payment of additional docket fees. It also denied MSAPL's opposition to the attachment order for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On <b>July 2, 2009</b>, the RTC modified its order insofar as it allowed CISC to pay docket fees within a reasonable time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On <b>July 8, 2009</b>, CISC posted a bond in the amount of P113,197,309.10 through Plaridel Surety and Insurance Company (Plaridel) in favor ofMSAPL, which the RTC approved on the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Two days later, MSAPL filed a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond because of questions regarding the financial capacity of Plaridel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> But before the RTC could act on this motion, MSAPL, apparently getting hold of Plaridel's latest financial statements, moved to recall and set aside the approval of the attachment bond on the ground that Plaridel had no capacity to underwrite the bond pursuant to Section 215 of the old Insurance Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> because its net worth was only P214,820,566.00 and could therefore only underwrite up to P42,964,113.20.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> On <b>September 4, 2009</b>, the RTC denied MSAPL's motion, finding that although Plaridel cannot underwrite the bond by itself, the amount covered by the attachment bond "was likewise reÂ­insured to sixteen other insurance companies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, "for the best interest of both parties," the RTC ordered Plaridel to submit proof that the amount of P95,819,770.91 was reinsured. Plaridel submitted its compliance on September 11, 2009, attaching therein the reinsurance contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On <b>September 18, 2009</b>, MSAPL, MSPI and Atty. Ofelia Cajigal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 110511, assailing the Orders of the RTC dated April 13, 2009, July 2, 2009, July 8, 2009, and September 4, 2009. In its now-assailed Decision elated November 25, 2009, the CA granted the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It concluded that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was filed on time because MSAPL did not abandon their right to impugn the evidence submitted in the application for the writ of preliminary attachment, because they filed a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond. On the merits, it held that the RTC exceeded its authority when it "ordered the issuance of the writ [of preliminary attachment] despite a dearth of evidence to clearly establish [CISC's] entitlement thereto, let alone the latter's failure to comply with all requirements therefor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Noting that the posting of the attachment bond is a jurisdictional requirement, the CA concluded that since Plaridel's capacity for single risk coverage is limited to 20% of its net worth, or P57,866,599.80, the RTC "should have set aside the second writ outright for non-compliance with Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 57."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>After the CA perfunctorily denied CISC's motion for reconsideration on April 23, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> it filed this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>CISC argues that the CA erred in giving due course to the petition insofar as it challenged the Orders dated April 13, 2009, July 2, 2009, and July 8, 2009 because the reglementary period to challenge these Orders already lapsed by the time private respondents filed their petition for <i>certiorari</i> below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In response, MSAPL contends that since they continued to assail the additional attachment from the time it was first issued, the 60-day period should be counted from the final denial of their challenge to the additional attachment, which was on September 4, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>MSAPL's theory is similar to that proffered by one of the parties in the case of <i>San Juan, Jr. v. Cruz</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The petitioner therein filed second and third motions for reconsideration from an interlocutory order by the trial court. When he filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA, he counted the 60-day reglementary period from the notice of denial of his third motion for reconsideration. He argued that since there is no rule prohibiting the filing of a second or third motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order, the 60-day period should be counted from the notice of denial of the last motion for reconsideration. In resolving the question of when the reglementary period for filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> shall be counted, we held that the "60-day period shall be reckoned from the trial court's denial of his first motion for reconsideration, otherwise indefinite delays will ensue."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Applying the rule in <i>San Juan</i>, MSAPL's challenge to the order dated April 13, 2009 was clearly time-barred. The 60-day reglementary period for challenging the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment should be counted from April 27, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the date when MSAPL received a copy of the April 13, 2009 Order denying MSAPL's motion for reconsideration of the December 22, 2008 Order which granted CISC's motion to amend the writ of preliminary attachment. The CA, however, considered MSAPL's act of filing a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond as a definitive indication that private respondents have not "abandoned their right to impugn the evidence submitted in the application for the second writ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This is erroneous for two reasons: <i>first</i>, MSAPL's motion never impugned the propriety and factual bases of the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment; and <i>second</i>, even if it did, the motion would be considered as a second motion for reconsideration, which could not have stayed the reglementary period within which to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> assailing an interlocutory order. We emphasize that the provisions on reglementary periods are strictly applied, indispensable as they are to the prevention of needless delays, and are necessary to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial business. The timeliness of filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is mandatory and jurisdictional, and should not be trifled with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the Orders dated July 2, 2009 and July 8, 2009 resolved incidental issues with respect to the issuance of the amended writ of attachment, namely: (1) when the additional docket fees should be paid; and (2) the approval of the attachment bond. As regards the first incidental issue, the RTC allowed CISC to pay the additional docket fees "within a reasonable time but in no case beyond its applicable prescriptive or reglementary period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> MSAPL, instead of filing a motion for reconsideration of the July 2, 2009 Order, elected to file a motion to compel CISC to pay the required docket fees on August 14, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Evidently, MSAPL already recognized the validity of the July 2, 2009 Order and sought CISC's compliance with the Order. Notably, the motion remained pending before the RTC when MSAPL filed its petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA. We find that the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, insofar as it questions the alleged non-payment of docket fees, was prematurely filed because the RTC has yet to rule on this issue. A petition for <i>certiorari</i> may be resorted to only when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It is not up to parties to preempt the trial court's action on their motions. Absent any showing of unreasonable delay on the part of the RTC-and there is none here, considering the short period between the filing of the motion and the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, as well as the various incidents pending <i>a quo</i>-MSAPL's recourse to theCA was premature. The more appropriate remedy for MSAPL would have been to move for the RTC to resolve its pending motion instead of precipitately raising this matter in its petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>This leaves the July 8, 2009 Order which approved the attachment bond Plaridel submitted. It was directly challenged by MSAPL when the latter tiled a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond because of questions regarding Plaridel's financial capacity. Before the RTC could act on the motion, however, MSAPL filed an urgent motion to recall and set aside the approval of the attachment bond, dated July 21, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> on the ground that the attachment bond underwritten by Plaridel exceeded its retention limit under the Insurance Code. The RTC resolved these two motions jointly in its September 4, 2009 Order, holding that Section 215 allows insurance companies to insure a single risk in excess of retention limits provided that the excess amount is ceded to reinsurers, and consequently affirming its approval of the attachment bond. In turn, the September 4, 2009 Order became the anchor of MSAPL's petition for <i>certiorari</i>. Although not captioned as "motions tor reconsideration," the twin motions filed by MSAPL directly challenged the approval of the attachment bond, and the September 4, 2009 Order was the second time the RTC passed upon the issue concerning the sufficiency of the bond. Therefore, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by MSAPL on September 18, 2009, insofar as it assailed both the July 8, 2009 and September 4, 2009 Orders, was timely filed.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>We now resolve the sole substantive issue before us: whether the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it approved the attachment bond whose face amount exceeded the retention limit of the surety.<br><br>Section 215 of the old Insurance Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the law in force at the time Plaridel issued the attachment bond, limits the amount of risk that insurance companies can retain to a maximum of 20% of its net worth. However, in computing the retention limit, risks that have been ceded to authorized reinsurers are <i>ipso jure</i> deducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In mathematical terms, the amount of retained risk is computed by deducting ceded/reinsured risk from insurable risk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> If the resulting amount is below 20% of the insurer's net worth, then the retention limit is not breached. In this case, both the RTC and CA determined that, based on Plaridel's financial statement that was attached to its certificate of authority issued by the Insurance Commission, its net worth is P289,332,999.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Plaridel's retention limit is therefore P57,866,599.80, which is below the Pl13,197,309.10 face value of the attachment bond. However, it only retained an insurable risk of P17,377,938.19 because the remaining amount of P98,819,770.91 was ceded to 16 other insurance companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, the risk retained by Plaridel is actually P40 Million below its maximum retention limit. Therefore, the approval of the attachment bond by the RTC was in order. Contrary to MSAPL's contention that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion, we find that the RTC not only correctly applied the law but also acted judiciously when it required Plaridel to submit proof of its reinsurance contracts after MSAPL questioned Plaridel's capacity to underwrite the attachment bond. Apparently, MSAPL failed to appreciate that by dividing the risk through reinsurance, Plaridel's attachment bond actually became more reliable-as it is no longer dependent on the financial stability of one company-and, therefore, more beneficial to MSAPL.<br><br>In cancelling Plaridel's insurance bond, the CA also found that because the reinsurance contracts were issued in favor of Plaridel, and not MSAPL, these failed to comply with the requirement of Section 4, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court requiring the bond to be executed to the adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This led the CA to conclude that "the bond has been improperly and insufficiently posted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> We reverse the CA and so hold that the reinsurance contracts were correctly issued in favor of Plaridel. A contract of reinsurance is one by which an insurer (the "direct insurer" or "cedant") procures a third person (the "reinsurer") to insure him against loss or liability by reason of such original insurance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It is a separate and distinct arrangement from the original contract of insurance, whose contracted risk is insured in the reinsurance agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The reinsurer's contractual relationship is with the direct insurer, not the original insured, and the latter has no interest in and is generally not privy to the contract of reinsurance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Put simply, reinsurance is the "insurance of an insurance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>By its nature, reinsurance contracts are issued in favor of the direct insurer because the subject of such contracts is the direct insurer's risk-in this case, Plaridel's contingent liability to MSAPL and not the risk assumed under the original policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The requirement under Section 4, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court that the applicant's bond be executed to the adverse party necessarily pertains only to the attachment bond itself and not to any underlying reinsurance contract. With or without reinsurance, the obligation of the surety to the party against whom the writ of attachment is issued remains the same.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
