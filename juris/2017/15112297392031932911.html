One (1) of the issues resolved in G.R. No. 206528 was whether the rehabilitation of respondents was feasible. This Court found that rehabilitation was not possible and thoroughly explained:<br><br>....<br><br><blockquote><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>Rehabilitation is statutorily defined under Republic Act No. 10142, otherwise known as the "Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010" (FRIA), as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Definition of Terms. </i>— As used in this Act, the term:<br><br>....<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(gg)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Rehabilitation</i> shall refer to the <b>restoration of the debtor to a condition of successful operation and solvency,</b> if it is shown that its continuance of operation is economically feasible and its creditors can recover by way of the present value of payments projected in the plan, more if the debtor continues as a going concern than if it is immediately liquidated. (Emphasis supplied)</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>Case law explains that corporate rehabilitation contemplates a continuance of corporate life and activities in an effort <b><u>to restore and reinstate the corporation to its former position of successful operation and solvency</u>, the purpose being to enable the company to gain a new lease on life and allow its creditors to be paid their claims out of its earnings.</b> Thus, the basic issues in rehabilitation proceedings concern the viability and desirability of continuing the business operations of the distressed corporation, all with a view of effectively restoring it to a state of solvency or to its former healthy financial condition through the adoption of a rehabilitation plan.<br><br><center><b>III.</b></center><br><br>In the present case, however, the Rehabilitation Plan failed to comply with the minimum requirements, <i>i.e.</i>: <i>(a) </i>material financial commitments to support the rehabilitation plan; and <i>(b) </i>a proper liquidation analysis, under Section 18, Rule 3 of the 2008 Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation 80 (Rules), which Rules were in force at the time respondents' rehabilitation petition was filed on April 8, 2011:<br><br><blockquote>Section 18. <i>Rehabilitation Plan. </i>— The rehabilitation plan <u>shall</u> include (a) the desired business targets or goals and the duration and coverage of the rehabilitation; (b) the terms and conditions of such rehabilitation which shall include the manner of its implementation, giving due regard to the interests of secured creditors such as, but not limited, to the non-impairment of their security liens or interests; (c) <b>the material financial commitments to support the rehabilitation plan;</b> (d) the means for the execution of the rehabilitation plan, which may include debt to equity conversion, restructuring of the debts, <i>dacion en pago </i>or sale or exchange or any disposition of assets or of the interest of shareholders, partners or members; (e) <b>a liquidation analysis setting out for each creditor that the present value of payments it would receive under the plan is more than that which it would receive if the assets of the debtor were sold by a liquidator within a six-month period from the estimated date of filing of the petition;</b> and (f) such other relevant information to enable a reasonable investor to make an informed decision on the feasibility of the rehabilitation plan. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The Court expounds.<br><br><div align="center"><b><u>A. Lack of Material Financial Commitment </u></b><br><b><u>to Support the Rehabilitation Plan.</u></b><br></div><br>A material financial commitment becomes significant in gauging the resolve, determination, earnestness, and good faith of the distressed corporation in financing the proposed rehabilitation plan. This commitment may include the <b>voluntary undertakings</b> of the stockholders or the would-be investors of the debtor-corporation indicating their readiness, willingness, and ability to contribute funds or property <b><u>to guarantee the continued successful operation of the debtor-corporation during the period of rehabilitation.</u></b><br><br>In this case, respondents' Chief Operating Officer, Primo D. Mateo, Jr., in his executed Affidavit of General Financial Condition dated April 8, 2011, averred that respondents <u>will not</u> require the infusion of additional capital as he, instead, proposed to have all accrued penalties, charges, and interests waived, and a reduced interest rate prospectively applied to all respondents' obligations, in addition to the implementation of a two (2)-year grace period. Thus, there appears to be no concrete plan to build on respondents' beleaguered financial position through substantial investments as the plan for rehabilitation appears to be pegged merely on financial reprieves. Anathema to the true purpose of rehabilitation, a distressed corporation cannot be restored to its former position of successful operation and regain solvency by the sole strategy of delaying payments/waiving accrued interests and penalties at the expense of the creditors.<br><br>The Court also notes that while respondents have substantial total assets, a large portion of the assets of Fastech Synergy and Fastech Properties is comprised of noncurrent assets, such as advances to affiliates which include Fastech Microassembly, and investment properties which form part of the common assets of Fastech Properties, Fastech Electronique, and Fastech Microassembly. Moreover, while there is a claim that <i>unnamed </i>customers have made investments by way of consigning production equipment, and advancing money to fund procurement of various equipment intended to increase production capacity, this can hardly be construed as a material financial commitment which would inspire confidence that the rehabilitation would turn out to be successful. Case law holds that nothing short of legally binding investment commitment/s from third parties is required to qualify as a material financial commitment. Here, no such binding investment was presented.<br><br><div align="center"><b><u>B. Lack of Liquidation Analysis.</u></b><br></div><br>Respondents likewise failed to include any liquidation analysis in their Rehabilitation Plan. The total liquidation assets and the estimated liquidation return to the creditors, as well as the fair market value vis-a-vis the forced liquidation value of the fixed assets were not shown. As such, the Court could not ascertain if the petitioning debtor's creditors can recover by way of the present value of payments projected in the plan, more if the debtor continues as a going concern than if it is immediately liquidated. This is a crucial factor in a corporate rehabilitation case, which the CA, unfortunately, failed to address.<br><br><div align="center"><b><u>C. Effect of Non-Compliance.</u></b><br></div><br>The failure of the Rehabilitation Plan to state any material financial commitment to support rehabilitation, as well as to include a liquidation analysis, renders the CA's considerations for approving the same, <i>i.e., </i>that: <i>(a) </i>respondents would be able to meet their obligations to their creditors within their operating cash profits and other assets without disrupting their business operations; <i>(b) </i>the Rehabilitation Receiver's opinion carries great weight; and <i>(c) </i>rehabilitation will be beneficial for respondents' creditors, employees, stockholders, and the economy, as actually <b>unsubstantiated,</b> and hence, insufficient to decree the feasibility of respondents' rehabilitation. It is well to emphasize that the remedy of rehabilitation should be denied <i>to </i>corporations that do not qualify under the Rules. Neither should it be allowed to corporations whose sole purpose is to delay the enforcement of any of the rights of the creditors.<br><br>Even if the Court were to set aside the failure of the Rehabilitation Plan to comply with the fundamental requisites of material financial commitment to support the rehabilitation and an accompanying liquidation analysis, a review of the financial documents presented by respondents fails to convince the Court of the feasibility of the proposed plan.<br><br><center><b>IV.</b></center><br><br>The test in evaluating the economic feasibility of the plan was laid down in <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Sarabia Manor Hotel Corporation (Bank of the Philippine Islands), </i>to wit;<br><br><blockquote>In order to determine the feasibility of a proposed rehabilitation plan, it is imperative that a thorough examination and analysis of the distressed corporation's financial data must be conducted. If the results of such examination and analysis show that there is a real opportunity to rehabilitate the corporation in view of the assumptions made and financial goals stated in the proposed rehabilitation plan, then it may be said that a rehabilitation is feasible. In this accord, the rehabilitation court should not hesitate to allow the corporation to operate as an on-going concern, albeit under the terms and conditions stated in the approved rehabilitation plan. On the other hand, if the results of the financial examination and analysis clearly indicate that there lies no reasonable probability that the distressed corporation could be revived and that liquidation would, in fact, better subserve the interests of its stakeholders, then it may be said that a rehabilitation would not be feasible. In such case, the rehabilitation court may convert the proceedings into one for liquidation.</blockquote><br><br>In the recent case of <i>Viva Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Keppel Philippines Mining, Inc.</i>, the Court took note of the characteristics of an economically feasible rehabilitation plan as opposed to an infeasible rehabilitation plan:<br><br><blockquote>Professor Stephanie V. Gomez of the University of the Philippines College of Law suggests specific characteristics of an economically feasible rehabilitation plan:<br><br><blockquote>a. The debtor has assets that can generate more cash if used in its daily operations than if sold.<br><br>b. Liquidity issues can be addressed by <i>a practicable business plan </i>that will generate enough cash to sustain daily operations.<br><br>c. The debtor has a definite source of financing for the proper and full implementation of a Rehabilitation Plan that is anchored on realistic assumptions and goals.</blockquote><br><br>These requirements put emphasis on liquidity: the cash flow that the distressed corporation will obtain from rehabilitating its assets and operations. A corporation's assets may be more than its current liabilities, but some assets may be in the form of land or capital equipment, such as machinery or vessels. Rehabilitation sees to it that these assets generate more value if used efficiently rather than if liquidated.<br><br>On the other hand, this court enumerated the characteristics of a rehabilitation plan that is infeasible:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">the absence of a sound and workable business plan; </div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">baseless and unexplained assumptions, targets and goals; </div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">speculative capital infusion or complete lack thereof for the execution of the business plan; </div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">cash flow cannot sustain daily operations; and </div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(e)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">negative net worth and the assets are near full depreciation or fully depreciated.</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>In addition to the tests of <i>economic feasibility, </i>Professor Stephanie V. Gomez also suggests that the Financial and Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010 emphasizes on rehabilitation that provides for better <i>present value recovery </i>for its creditors.<br><br>Present value recovery acknowledges that, in order to pave way for rehabilitation, the creditor will not be paid by the debtor when the credit falls due. The court may order a suspension of payments to set a rehabilitation plan in motion; in the meantime, the creditor remains unpaid. By the time the creditor is paid, the financial and economic conditions will have been changed. Money paid in the past has a different value in the future. It is unfair if the creditor merely receives the face value of the debt. Present value of the credit takes into account the interest that the amount of money would have earned if the creditor were paid on time.<br><br>Trial courts must ensure that the projected cash flow from a business' rehabilitation plan allows for the closest present value recovery for its creditors. If the projected cash flow is realistic and allows the corporation to meet all its obligations, then courts should favor rehabilitation over liquidation. However, if the projected cash flow is unrealistic, then courts should consider converting the proceedings into that for liquidation to protect the creditors.</blockquote><br><br>A perusal of the 2009 audited financial statements shows that respondents' cash operating position was not even enough to meet their maturing obligations. Notably, their current assets were materially lower than their current liabilities, and consisted mostly of advances to related parties in the case of Fastech Microassembly, Fastech Electronique, and Fastech Properties. Moreover, the independent auditors recognized the absence of available historical or reliable market information to support the assumptions made by the management to determine the recoverable amount (value in use) of respondents' properties and equipment.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents' unaudited financial statements for the year 2010, and the months of February and March 2011 were unaccompanied by any notes or explanation on how the figures were arrived at. Besides, respondents' cash operating position remained insufficient to meet their maturing obligations as their current assets are still substantially lower than their current liabilities. The Court also notes the RTC-Makati's observation that respondents added new accounts and/or deleted/omitted certain accounts, but failed to explain or justify the same.<br><br>Verily, respondents' Rehabilitation Plan should have shown that they have enough serviceable assets to be able to continue its business operation. In fact, as opposed to this objective, the revised Rehabilitation Plan still requires "front load Capex spending" to replace common equipment and facility equipment to ensure sustainability of capacity and capacity robustness, thus, further sacrificing respondents' cash flow. In addition, the Court is hard-pressed to see the effects of the outcome of the streamlining of respondents' manufacturing operations on the carrying value of their existing properties and equipment.<br><br>In fine, the Rehabilitation Plan and the financial documents submitted in support thereof fail to show the feasibility of rehabilitating respondents' business.<br><br><center><b>V.</b></center><br><br>The CA's reliance on the expertise of the court-appointed Rehabilitation Receiver, who opined that respondents' rehabilitation is viable, in order to justify its finding that the financial statements submitted were reliable, overlooks the fact that the determination of the validity and the approval of the rehabilitation plan is not the responsibility of the rehabilitation receiver, but remains the function of the court. The rehabilitation receiver's duty <i>prior </i>to the court's approval of the plan is to study the best way to rehabilitate the debtor, and to ensure that the value of the debtor's properties is reasonably maintained; and <i>after </i>approval, to implement the rehabilitation plan. Notwithstanding the credentials of the court-appointed rehabilitation receiver, the duty to determine the feasibility of the rehabilitation of the debtor rests with the court. While the court may consider the receiver's report favorably recommending the debtor's rehabilitation, it is not bound thereby if, in its judgment, the debtor's rehabilitation is not feasible.<br><br>The purpose of rehabilitation proceedings is not only to enable the company to gain a new lease on life, but also to allow creditors to be paid their claims from its earnings when so rehabilitated. Hence, the remedy must be accorded only after a judicious regard of all stakeholders' interests; it is not a one-sided tool that may be graciously invoked to escape every position of distress. Thus, the remedy of rehabilitation should be denied to corporations whose insolvency appears to be irreversible and whose sole purpose is to delay the enforcement of any of the rights of the creditors, which is rendered obvious by: <i>(a) </i>the absence of a sound and workable business plan; <i>(b) </i>baseless and unexplained assumptions, targets, and goals; and <i>(c) </i>speculative capital infusion or complete lack thereof for the execution of the business plan, as in this case.<br><br><center><b>VI.</b></center><br><br>In view of all the foregoing, the Court is therefore constrained to grant the instant petition, notwithstanding the preliminary technical error as above-discussed. A distressed corporation should not be rehabilitated when the results of the financial examination and analysis clearly indicate that there lies no reasonable probability that it may be revived, to the detriment of its numerous stakeholders which include not only the corporation's creditors but also the public at large. In <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands;</i><br><br><blockquote>Recognizing the volatile nature of every business, the rules on corporate rehabilitation have been crafted in order to give companies sufficient leeway to deal with debilitating financial predicaments in the hope of restoring or reaching a sustainable operating form if only to best accommodate the various interests of all its stakeholders, may it be the corporation's stockholders, its creditors, and even the general public.</blockquote><br><br>Thus, the higher interest of substantial justice will be better subserved by the reversal of the CA Decision. Since the rehabilitation petition should not have been granted in the first place, it is of no moment that the Rehabilitation Plan is currently under implementation. While payments in accordance with the Rehabilitation Plan were already made, the same were only possible because of the financial reprieves and protracted payment schedule accorded to respondents, which, as above-intimated, only works at the expense of the creditors and ultimately, do not meet the true purpose of rehabilitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>The dispositive portion of the June 28, 2016 Decision in G.R. No. 206528 read:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated September 28, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 5, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
