				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As the administrative agency tasked with resolving issues pertaining to the construction industry, the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission enjoys a wide latitude in recognition of its technical expertise and experience.

This is due to its diminished financial capability due to DPWH's late payments, changes in the project involving payment terms, peace and order problems, and previous agreement by the parties.<br><br>On July 16, 2004, then DPWH Acting Secretary Florante Soriquez accepted the Joint Venture's request for mutual termination of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After hearing and submission of the parties' respective memoranda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> CIAC promulgated an Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on March 1, 2005, directing DPWH to pay the Joint Venture its money claims plus legal interest.

However, the Court of Appeals ruled that CIAC was correct when it awarded legal interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals sustained the Joint Venture's argument on the non-inclusion of a clear finding of its entitlement to time extensions in the dispositive portion of the CIAC Award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court of Appeals held that CIAC did not clearly dispose of the matter:<br><blockquote>Yet, a close scrutiny of the foregoing disposition shows that it does not refer to the 133 days as per Variation Order No. 2 since CIAC made mention that the project is already terminated and the entire volume under said Order "will not be consumed". Whether or not the Claimant then deserves to get the full 133 calendar days is a matter that has to be clearly resolved. On this, We hold that this Court is not prepared to engage into a technical bout that only the expertise of the CIAC can pass upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals did not accept DPWH's argument that the case was already moot and academic. According to the Court of Appeals, when the Joint Venture requested for the mutual termination of the Contract on July 8, 2004, it did not waive its right to be paid the amounts due to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, however, raised a concern with regard to CIAC's order for DPWH to pay its liabilities in US dollars. It held that the parties have agreed that "all payments for works carried out after 31 May 2003 and related price escalation claims and retention releases in the contract will be in pesos only, therefore no foreign exchange payments." This was never contested by the Joint Venture; hence, it may be presumed that it acquiesced to the request of the DPWH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed Decision is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> to include the award to the Claimant of time extensions per: 1) delay in payment at One Hundred Eight (108) days, and 2) extension Twenty Nine (29) days due to peace and order situation.<br><br>Re 1) the award of time extension per Variation Order No. 2-as stated earlier elsewhere in the Decision, the CIAC must make a vivid presentation of the number of calendar days the Claimant is entitled to, and 2) the conversion rate in pesos of the awarded foreign exchange payments states, <i>supra</i>, in the assailed Decision, these matters are hereby <b>REMANDED</b> to the CIAC for proper disposition.

Ebdane was submitted to the Office of the Solicitor General. In the same Resolution, this Court granted the Office of the Solicitor General's motion to admit the attached verification and to substitute and attach it to the petition.<br><br>This Court ruled before that: "the lack of a certification against forum shopping, unlike that of verification, is generally not cured by its submission after the filing of the petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Nevertheless, exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> exist, as in the case at bar, and it is more prudent to resolve the case on its merits than dismiss it on purely technical grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals held that the mutual termination of the Contract by the parties did not render the case moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Accordingly, when respondent requested for the mutual termination of the Contract, it did not waive its right to be paid the amounts due to it as shown in its letter:<br><blockquote>In view of the above considerations, we hereby respectfully request for MUTUAL TERMINATION of our Contract. <i>Our availment of this remedy does not mean though that we are waiving our rights</i> (1) to be paid for any and all monetary benefits due and owing to us under the contract such as but not limited to payments for works already done, materials delivered on site which are intended solely for the construction and completion of the project, price escalation, etc., (2) and without prejudice to our outstanding claims and entitlements that are lawfully due to us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in rendering the assailed Decision, considering that the case is already moot and academic. Petitioner insists that "the parties' mutual termination of their contract prior to the adjudication of this case by the CIAC on March 1, 2005, rendered the proceedings before CIAC moot and academic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>According to petitioner, the principle of unjust enrichment does not apply in this case "because respondent has incurred negative slippage/delay in carrying out their contractual obligations due to reasons attributable to it. Moreover, the parties' mutual termination of the contract rendered the proceedings before the CIAC moot because there was no more contract to be enforced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's argument is untenable.<br><br>Indeed, the rule is that courts will not rule on moot cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, the moot and academic principle is "not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the courts in resolving a case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Exceptions exist that would not prevent a court from taking cognizance of cases seemingly moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In <i>Carpio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court held that a case could not be deemed moot and academic when there remains an unresolved justiciable controversy. In that case, this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' assailed resolutions, which denied petitioner's prayer for dismissal based on the argument that the Sheriff's execution pending appeal of the trial court's decision rendered the case moot and academic. This Court held that:<br><blockquote><i>[I]t is obvious that there remains an unresolved justiciable controversy in the appealed case</i> for accion publiciana. In particular, did respondent-spouses Oria really encroach on the land of petitioner? If they did, does he have the right to recover possession of the property? Furthermore, without preempting the disposition of the case for accion publiciana pending before the CA, we note that if respondents built structures on the subject land, and if they were builders in good faith, they would be entitled to appropriate rights under the Civil Code. <i>This Court merely points out that there are still issues that the CA needs to resolve in the appealed case before it.</i><br><br>Moreover, there are also the questions of whether respondents should be made to pay back monthly rentals for the alleged encroachment; and whether the reward of attorney's fees, which are also being questioned, was proper. <i>The pronouncements of the CA on these issues would certainly be of practical value to the parties.</i> After all, should it find that there was no encroachment, for instance, respondents would be entitled to substantial relief. In view of all these considerations, it cannot be said that the main case has become moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In this case, issues arising from the mutually terminated Contract are not moot and academic. As the Court of Appeals found, there are actual substantial reliefs that respondent is entitled to. There is a practical use or value to decide on the issues raised by the parties despite the mutual termination of the Contract between them. These issues include the determination of amounts payable to respondent by virtue of the time extensions, respondent's entitlement to price adjustments due to the delay of the issuance of the Notice to Proceed, additional costs, actual damages, and interest on its claims. The agreement to mutually terminate the Contract did not wipe out petitioner's obligation to pay respondent on works done before the Contract's termination on October 27, 2004.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>According to petitioner, the filing of the claim before CIAC was premature, since under CIAC rules, there must be an exhaustion of administrative remedies first before government contracts are brought to it for arbitration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, denies violating the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies. It claims that it sent at least 17 demand letters to petitioner, four (4) of which were sent to the DPWH Secretary directly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's argument fails to convince.<br><br>The case is not premature. The pertinent provision on available administrative remedies can be found in Sub-Clause 67.1 of the Conditions of Contract:<br><blockquote><center>Settlement of Disputes<br></center><br>Engineer's Decision 67.1 If a dispute of any kind whatsoever arises between the Employer and the Contractor in connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the Works, whether during the execution of the Works or after their completion and whether before or after repudiation or other termination of the Contract, including any dispute as to any opinion, instruction, determination, certificate or valuation of the Engineer, <i>the matter in dispute shall, in the first place, be referred in writing to the Engineer, with a copy to the other party</i>.

It would therefore be an exercise in futility if Claimant, after it had sent respondent the seventeen (17) demand letters and despite the unequivocal admission by Respondent's foreign consultant in charge of the project of respondent's liability and failure to pay (Annex C of the Complaint), will further be required to undergo another series of presentation and exchange of documentation. Moreover, Respondent has not indicated any practical benefit of resending the demand to the Secretary nor any prejudice for not doing so.<br><br>In this particular contract project, the procedural requirements governing the Settlement of Disputes is specifically provided under Clause 67 of the Conditions of the Contract which Claimant has complied with pursuant to the first paragraph of its letter dated September 10, 2004 (annex R) pertinent provisions thereof is read, as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Pursuant to the provision of Clause 67.1 of the conditions of contracts, we are formally referring to your good office several office several [sic] points of disagreement between the position you have taken and the position we have argued for. These were already the subject of voluminous correspondence between your good self and our company but no clear-cut resolution of the issues raised was ever made."<br></div><br>In the last paragraph of the letter on September 10, 2004 (Annex "R"), Claimant has requested Respondent for a definitive ruling on the disputes which were enumerated therein so that Claimant could avail of the remedies given to it by the aforesaid Clause 67.1. In spite of Claimant's request, respondent DPWH did not act on the same.<br><br>The evidence also disclosed that as far as delayed payments are concerned, Claimant made various verbal and written demands for payment as evidenced by Exhibits "E" to "E-16" or starting December 5, 2000. The demands were not heeded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>A total of 17 demand letters were sent to petitioner to no avail. To require respondent to wait for the DPWH Secretary's response while respondent continued to suffer financially would be to condone petitioner's avoidance of its obligations to respondent. Hence, even assuming that sub­clause 67.1 was not applicable, the case would still fall within the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> since strict application of the doctrine will be set aside when requiring it would only be unreasonable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Petitioner avers that the Court of Appeals gravely erred in rendering the assailed decision because it completely ignored, overlooked, or misappreciated facts of substance, which, if duly considered, would materially affect the outcome of the case.

Arbitration, Any and all disputes arising from the implementation of a contract covered by this Act shall be submitted to arbitration in the Philippines according to the provisions of Republic Act No. 876, otherwise known as the "Arbitration Law": <i>Provided, however, That, disputes that are within the competence of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission to resolve shall be referred thereto</i>. The process of arbitration shall be incorporated as a provision in the contract that will be executed pursuant to the provisions of this Act: Provided, That by mutual agreement, the parties may agree in writing to resort to alternative modes of dispute resolution. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>CIAC's authority to arbitrate construction disputes was then incorporated into the general statutory framework on alternative dispute resolution through Republic Act No. 9285, the "Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004". Section 34 of Republic Act No. 9285 specifically referred to the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, while Section 35 confirmed CIAC's jurisdiction:<br><blockquote><center>CHAPTER 6 - ARBITRATION OF CONSTRUCTION DISPUTES<br></center><br>Section 34. Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law. - The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Constitution Industry Arbitration Law.<br><br>Section 35. Coverage of the Law. - Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the "Commission") shall include those between or among parties to, or who are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by reference whether such parties are project owner, contractor, subcontractor, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy in a construction project.<br><br>The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is "commercial" pursuant to Section 21 of this Act.<br></blockquote>As a general rule, findings of fact of CIAC, a quasi-judicial tribunal which has expertise on matters regarding the construction industry, should be respected and upheld. In <i>National Housing Authority v. First United Constructors Corp.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court held that CIAC's factual findings, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, will not be overturned except as to the most compelling of reasons:<br><blockquote>As this finding of fact by the CIAC was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and it being apparent that the CIAC arrived at said finding after a thorough consideration of the evidence presented by both parties, the same may no longer be reviewed by this Court. <i>The all too-familiar rule is that the Court will not, in a petition for review on certiorari, entertain matters factual in nature, save for the most compelling and cogent reasons</i>, like when such factual findings were drawn from a vacuum or arbitrarily reached, or are grounded entirely on speculation or conjectures, are conflicting or are premised on the supposed evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record or when the inference made is manifestly mistaken or absurd. This conclusion is made more compelling by the fact that the CIAC is a quasi-judicial body whose jurisdiction is confined to construction disputes. Indeed, settled is the rule that findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but finality when affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In distinguishing between commercial arbitration, voluntary arbitration under Article 219(14) of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and construction arbitration, <i>Freuhauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> ruled that commercial arbitral tribunals are purely ad hoc bodies operating through contractual consent, hence, they are <i>not</i> quasi-judicial agencies. In contrast, voluntary arbitration under the Labor Code and construction arbitration derive their authority from statute in recognition of the public interest inherent in their respective spheres. Furthermore, voluntary arbitration under the Labor Code and construction arbitration exist independently of the will of the contracting parties:<br><blockquote>Voluntary Arbitrators resolve labor disputes and grievances arising from the interpretation of Collective Bargaining Agreements. These disputes were specifically excluded from the coverage of both the Arbitration Law and the ADR Law.<br><br>Unlike purely commercial relationships, the relationship between capital and labor are heavily impressed with public interest. Because of this, Voluntary Arbitrators authorized to resolve labor disputes have been clothed with quasi-judicial authority.<br><br>On the other hand, commercial relationships covered by our commercial arbitration laws are purely private and contractual in nature. Unlike labor relationships, they do not possess the same compelling state interest that would justify state interference into the autonomy of contracts. Hence, commercial arbitration is a purely private system of adjudication facilitated by private citizens instead of government instrumentalities wielding quasi-judicial powers.<br><br>Moreover, judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a tribunal by the parties alone. The Labor Code itself confers subject-matter jurisdiction to Voluntary Arbitrators.<br><br><i>Notably, the other arbitration body listed in Rule 43 - the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) - is also a government agency attached to the Department of Trade and Industry. Its jurisdiction is likewise conferred by statute. By contrast, the subject­ matter jurisdiction of commercial arbitrators is stipulated by the.parties.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>V</b><br></div><br>Petitioner argues that respondent is not entitled to US$358,227.95, as the foreign component of the Contract, because it is not yet legally demandable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In declaring that petitioner should pay the amount as the foreign component of the project, CIAC held that petitioner did not deny said amount in its answer and that respondent's failure to renew its Letter of Credit does not justify petitioner's act in withholding the dollar component of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that the delay in payment was due to the negative slippage incurred by respondent and its failure to renew its Letter of Credit.

This concerns CIAC's order to DPWH to pay its alleged liability to the Claimant in US dollars. <i>It is worthy to note that aside from the agreement of the parties - particularly in paragraph 5 of the contract, supra, to fix the exchange rate at P34.9 for every US$1.00, the Claimant itself has acknowledged in its request that it was advised by the DPWH per its letter dated 13 August 2003 that all payments for works earned out after 31 March 2003 and related price escalation claims and retention releases in the contract will be in pesos only, therefore no foreign exchange payments.</i> This fact was never contested by the Claimant thereby creating a presumption that it has acquiesced to the request of the DPWH. Thus, We cannot see Our way through on why the CIAC has still to make a ruling on the Interest Computation of Delayed Payment at 6% Per Annum at US$45,206.14 as well as the Foreign Component of US$358,227.95 plus legal interest at US$18.313.79 citing the exemption of transactions where the funds involved are the proceeds of loans or investments made through bona fide intermediaries or agents, by foreign government and banking institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) from the coverage of Republic Act 529 otherwise known a[s] "An Act to Assure Uniform Value to Philippine Coin and Currency".

When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi­-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on "Damages" of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.<br><br>II.

Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).
