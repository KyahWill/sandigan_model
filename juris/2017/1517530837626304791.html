				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the 30 April 2015 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (<em>CA</em>) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00473-MIN, which affirmed the 30 July 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, Zamboanga City (<em>RTC</em>), in Criminal Case No. 15599, finding accused Ustadz Ibrahim Ali y Kalim (<em>Ali</em>) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention, defined and penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (<em>RPC</em>). <p align="center"> <b>THE FACTS</b> </p><p> In an Information dated 17 December 1998, Ali, together with Abdul Hassan (<em>Hassan</em>), and individuals identified as "Jul" and Amat," were charged with the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the RPC. Only Ali was the subject of the criminal proceedings because his co-accused Hassan, Jul, and Amat remain at large. The accusatory portion of the information reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about December 14, 1998, in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named accused being then armed with high powered firearm, conspiring and confederating together, mutually aiding and assisting with one another, by means of force and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, KIDNAP the person of CHRISTIA OLIZ y EUCOGCO, a young woman, 19 years old, particularly on the occasion when she was together with her employer named Antonio Yu Lim Bo and the latter's wife and daughter, on board a Blue Nissan Vehicle then driven by one Rene Igno who was ordered by the herein accused to stop said vehicle somewhere at the vicinity of EAAB at Sta. Maria Road, this City, and thereafter through intimidation, commandeered and drove said vehicle with all its occupants aboard towards San Roque and finally to the area of Pitogo beach with the clear intention on the part of the accused to extort ransom money from said victim or other person; however, when victim Christia Oliz alighted from the vehicle and was walking towards the direction of Pitogo beach she was able to run away and with the timely assistance of some residents thereat as well as the arrival of the police authorities, prompted all the accused to escape except accused Ustadz Ibrahim Ali y Kalim who was arrested thus briefly depriving the liberty of said victim against her will; furthermore, the commission of said crime has been attended by the aggravating circumstance of NIGHT TIME AND USE OF MOTOR VEHICLE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> During his arraignment, Ali, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded "Not Guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Evidence for the Prosecution</i></b> </p><p> The prosecution presented six (6) witnesses, namely: Senior Police Officer 2 Salvador F. Arcillas, Police Inspector Jesus Belarga, private complainant Christia Oliz (<em>Oliz</em>), Police Inspector Jose Bayani Gucela, Mario C. Agarte, Police Officer 3 Bernardino Bayot. Their combined testimonies tended to establish the following: </p><p> On 14 December 1998, at around 7:30P.M., Antonio Lim (<em>Antonio</em>), Mary Lim (<em>Mary</em>), and Cherry Lim (<em>Cherry</em>) left their family-owned grocery and were on their way to their house in Pasonanca, Zamboanga City, on board a Nissan vehicle. With them were their driver Rene Igno (<em>Igno</em>) and Oliz, their helper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> When they were near Edwin Andrews Airbase (<em>EAAB</em>) along Sta. Maria Road, Igno stopped the car to avoid bumping into a motorcycle with three persons on board. The three men, later identified as Ali, Hassan, and Amat, approached the Nissan vehicle and told the passengers that they were policemen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> They ordered Antonio and Igno to transfer to the back of the vehicle and sit with Oliz, Mary, and Cherry. The passengers were told that they would be brought to the police station on a tip that they were transporting contraband goods. Thereafter, the three armed men boarded the Nissan vehicle with Amat in the driver's seat, Ali beside him, and Hassan at the back with the other passengers. Once inside, Ali instructed Hassan to handcuff Igno and Antonio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> Amat did not stop when they reached the Sta. Maria police station but kept on driving. Due to the buildup of traffic at the intersection after the Sta. Maria police station, Mary was able to escape her captors by jumping out of the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Amat continued to drive towards Pitogo and then veered towards the beach. There, the occupants were ordered to alight from the vehicle. Oliz was able to escape when she saw a woman walking nearby because only Antonio, Cherry, and Igno were guarded. She then told the woman that her employer was being kidnapped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Oliz was then accompanied to a nearby house where they contacted the authorities. Before the police arrived, Oliz heard a commotion outside and saw bystanders mauling Ali. Oliz told the people around that he was their abductor. When the police arrived, Ali was turned over to the authorities who brought him to the police station together with Oliz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Evidence for the Defense</i></b> </p><p> The defense presented four (4) witnesses, namely: Ali's sister Nauda Ali (<em>Nauda</em>), Ali's wife Rahima Saulan (<em>Rahima</em>), Ali's cousin Siddik Alfad Abubakar (<em>Siddik</em>), and the accused himself. Their testimonies sought to prove the following: </p><p> On 14 December 1998, Ali, Rahima, and Nauda left Manalipa to proceed to Sinunuc and stay in Siddik's house before going home to Pagadian City. On their way to Sinunuc, they parted ways in Zamboanga City because Ali wanted to pray at the Sta. Barbara Mosque; Rahima and Nauda went ahead to Siddik's place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> At around 7:00P.M., while Ali was waiting outside the Mosque for a ride to Sinunuc, he met Hassan, who was riding a motorcycle with Amat. Hassan told him to ride with them as they would be going somewhere in Recodo. When they were near the EAAB, Hassan overtook a motor vehicle and almost collided with it. Amat approached the driver of the motor vehicle while Hassan went to the other side. Amat and Hassan eventually boarded the vehicle with the latter forcing Ali to do the same. Hassan pushed Ali inside while he was holding a gun and told him to follow or he would be in trouble. Meanwhile, Hassan ordered a certain Jun<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to ride the motorcycle and follow them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> As Amat was driving, Ali asked what they were doing but was told to stop talking and just follow. Upon reaching Sinunuc, Ali asked Amat to stop the vehicle so he could get off but he was ignored. Eventually, they stopped at the seashore of Pitogo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> There, all the occupants alighted with Hassan and Amat escorting and guarding Antonio, Cherry, Igno, and Oliz further down the seashore. Ali remained by the vehicle. Later, Jun arrived on Hassan's motorcycle. After sensing something suspicious with his companions, Ali decided to walk away and proceed to the main road to catch a ride to Sinunuc. While he was waiting for transportation, several persons suddenly held him and beat him up, accusing him of being a thief. Ali was eventually brought to a house where the beatings continued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> After a few minutes, policemen arrived at the house where Ali was held. He was made to board the police vehicle where he was blindfolded and beaten again. Ali was detained at the police station where he was forced to admit to the kidnapping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>The RTC Ruling</i></b> </p><p> In its 30 July 1999 decision, the RTC found Ali guilty of violating Article 267 of the RPC, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Court finds the accused<strong> IBRAHIM ALI y KALIM GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT</strong> as principal of the crime of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention defined and penalized under Article 267, paragraphs 2 and of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7659, and <strong>SENTENCES</strong> said accused to suffer the penalty of <strong>RECLUSION PERPETUA</strong> with the accessory penalties provided by law and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Aggrieved, Ali appealed before the CA. </p><p> <b><i>The CA Ruling</i></b> </p><p> In its assailed 30 April 2015 decision, the CA affirmed the RTC decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the instant Appeal is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The assailed Decision dated 30 July 1999 of the trial court is AFFIRMED in toto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Hence, this appeal, anchored on the following: </p> <p align="center"><strong>ISSUES </strong></p> <p align="center"> I </p><blockquote> <p> WHETHER THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF SERIOUS ILLEGAL DETENTION; AND </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> II </p><blockquote> <p> WHETHER THE ACCUSED WAS IDENTIFIED WITH MORAL CERTAINTY. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>THE COURT'S RULING</b> </p><p> The appeal has no merit. </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Period of detention immaterial if victim is a female</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Ali argues that he could not be guilty of the crime of Serious Illegal Detention because the alleged deprivation of liberty did not last for more than three (3) days as the incident only lasted for about an hour or two. In order for the accused to be guilty of serious illegal detention, the following elements must concur: (a) the offender is a private individual; (b) he or she kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (c) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (d) in the commission of the offense any of the following circumstances is present: (1) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three days; (2) it is committed by simulating public authority; (3) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill the victim are made; or (4) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> In other words, deprivation of liberty is qualified to serious illegal detention if<strong> at least one</strong> of the following circumstances exists: (a) detention lasts for more than three (3) days; (b) accused simulated public authority; (c) victim suffers serious physical injuries or is threatened to be killed; or (d) the victim is a minor, female or public officer. </p><p> In the case at bar, the elements of serious illegal detention were duly proven by the prosecution. <em>First</em>, Ali and his cohorts were clearly private individuals.<em> Second</em>, they deprived Oliz of her liberty. This was manifested by the fact that they forcibly boarded the vehicle and placed Igno and Antonio in handcuffs evincing their intent to detain the occupants of the motor vehicle. <em>Third</em>, Oliz was a female victim. The CA was correct in ruling that the period of detention became immaterial in view of the victim's circumstances. If, during the deprivation of liberty, any of the circumstances under Article 267(4) of the RPC occurs, i.e, the victim was a female, the crime of serious illegal detention is consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Intent to detain or restrain the victim's movement is tantamount to illegal detention.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Ali likewise assails that there was insufficient evidence to hold that he forcefully transported, locked up or restrained Oliz and her companions especially considering that the alleged handcuffs were never presented in court. The essence of serious illegal detention is the actual deprivation of the victim's liberty, coupled with the indubitable proof of intent of the accused to effect such deprivation—it is enough that the victim is restrained from going home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It contemplates situations where the victim is restricted or impeded in one's liberty to move.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Oliz's testimony clearly demonstrates the intent of the accused to deprive her and her companions of their liberty, to wit: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">FISCAL NUVAL: </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">Aside from asking the license of the driver, what else did they tell you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">They told us there was a tip that we were bringing contraband goods.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did they identify themselves? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What did they tell you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">They said that they are policemen.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Then, what happen (sic) after that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">They went inside our vehicle and they asked the driver and this Boa to transfer at the back seat, together with us. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">You said three persons approached your vehicle two of them went inside the front seat, one on the behind the steering wheel (sic) and other one sitting beside him and the other one went at the back of that vehicle, now, tell us where did this accused sat (sic)?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">At the front seat also. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he behind the steering wheel?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">No, he was sitting at the side of the driver. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And after he sat beside the driver's seat, what did this person do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He instructed that Rene will be handcuffed.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">To whom did he instruct to handcuffed (sic) this Rene?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">His companion, the one sitted (sic) at the back.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What did this person at the back do, after this accused instructed him to handcuffed (sic) Rene Egno?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Then his companion handcuffed Egno. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">x x x x </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT: </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Then after Sta.

They misrepresented themselves as policemen and claimed they would bring Oliz and her companions to the police station; but they never got there and were let go only when they arrived at Pitogo. Further, Oliz categorically stated that Ali ordered his companions to handcuff Antonio and Igno. As pointed out by the CA, Oliz's testimony demonstrates that her freedom of movement was effectively restrained by the abductors who exercised complete control and dominion over the person of the victims. </p> <table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><em><strong>Oliz identified Ali as the accused in a categorical and straightforward manner. </strong></em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Ali also challenges Oliz's identification of him claiming that her testimony was marred with inconsistencies and that she was only able to identify him after reading the newspapers two days after the incident. We have held that inconsistencies on immaterial details do not negate the probative value of the testimony of a witness regarding the very act of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In fact, minor inconsistencies tend to strengthen the credibility of the witness because it shows that the testimony was not rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p> <p> In the case at bar, the inconsistencies, e.g., the position of the occupants inside the vehicle, assailed by Ali, pertain to trivial matters.

Oliz was able to distinguish and identify accused considering their proximity inside the vehicle and the duration of the captivity. Thus, she was intimately familiar with Ali's facial features and voice—enough to lend credibility to her identification of the accused. </p> <p> Ali's contention that Oliz was only able to identify him after reading the newspaper is erroneous.

He admitted that he was with Hassan and Amat when their motorcycle stopped in front of the Nissan vehicle; and that the three decided to board the vehicle and take control. Ali merely denied his participation feigning that Hassan coerced him. </p> <p> This, however, is refuted by the categorical and straightforward testimony of Oliz that it was Ali who was giving commands to his companions. Thus, he could not have been an unwilling participant as he was in fact the one calling the shots. Further, even if Ali were to be believed, nothing in his testimony shows that Hassan exerted such force or coercion or uttered threats that would have deprived Ali with the free exercise of his will. Absent any showing that Oliz was motivated by ill will to falsely testify against Ali, her testimony should be granted credence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> especially since it was candid, straightforward, and devoid of any material inconsistencies. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
