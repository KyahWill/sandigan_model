The IR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> stated that the 914 desks were received by Delos Reyes, and inspected by Agustin and Domato. The team found out that there was no delivery by the BIWP because the 914 desks could not be located and there was no report from Sultan Kudarat Schools Division of the delivery;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> thus, the government suffered damages in the amount of P457,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>To prove the allegations in Crim.

An MR,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated 23 November 1992, which was one of the several MRs attached to DV 92124698, indicated that 96 desks were received from Pundaodaya by Milner A Pancho, "In-Charge" of Mainit Elementary School. Upon inspection, the team found out that only 48 desks were delivered by NWP to Mainit Elementary School, which was confirmed by the Certificate of Validation and Inspection stating that only 48 desks were actually received by Pancho. The NWP DR No. 0047<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> showed that 3,114 desks were delivered in bulk to the Division of Iligan despite the agreement for door-to-door delivery to the identified school recipients. For Iligan City, the combination scheme was adopted, i.e., the desks were delivered to the division office, and the others to the recipient elementary schools. With regard to Sultan Kudarat and Marawi City, the deliveries were made in bulk to the division offices and received by the division superintendents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>One MR,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated 23 November 1992, for 48 desks, was signed by the principal of Carbide Village Elementary School, proving that only 48 desks were delivered. Sixteen other MRs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> indicated deliveries to schools. Because there were only 48 instead of 96 desks that should have been delivered to Mainit Elementary School, the government was unduly damaged in the amount equivalent to what was paid for the undelivered 48 desks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 24788, Soriano identified the 14 December 1992 DV No. 92124700,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> in the amount of P1,853,500.00, as payment for the 3,707 desks delivered by NWP to the Sultan Kudarat Schools Division. After a review of the MRs submitted by the division superintendent, the team found that out of 3,707 desks only 2,008 were delivered; thus, a shortage of 1,699 desks which caused damages to the government in the amount of P849,500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The MR,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated 1 December 1992, for the receipt of the 3,707 desks was signed by Sabandaya Balabagan, the Schools Division Superintendent, which proved that there was a delivery in bulk to the division office instead of a door-to-door delivery to recipient schools. The door-to-door delivery would have been advantageous to the government because it would have saved it the expense in delivering the desks to the various schools.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Relative to Crim.

Paragoso claimed that Dy was sick at the time of the assailed transactions and was unable to attend to his business; thus, he was requested by Dy to manage AAA. Paragoso personally supervised the delivery of the desks to the recipient schools. AAA delivered the desks and the corresponding DRs were returned to the company duly signed by the personnel of the recipient schools. There were no complaints from the DECS after AAA delivered the desks to the recipient schools and even subsequent to the company's receipt of payment from the DECS RO XII. Paragoso came to know of the DECS Regional Directors (RDs) of Cotabato City only when AAA was being sued. He was not informed that COA had inspected and had counted the desks delivered by AAA. The RDs and Dy requested the COA for a recount of the desks, but their request was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>To fortify his defense, Kadon testified that he assumed office as RD of Region XII only on 14 April 1992. It was only towards the latter part that he participated in the assailed transactions with AAA. He followed the standard procedure in signing the check to pay AAA, i.e., after the goods are delivered by the supplier, these are inspected by the Inspection Committee; if the goods are in order, the IR and the Acceptance Report are prepared and thereafter submitted to the accountant for payment; the check is forwarded to his office but only if the documents are in order and already signed by the concerned officials.<br><br>For DV 92093173,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Kadon claimed that all the mandatory enclosures were attached to the original DV when this was presented for his signature.

(emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On the one hand, Sec. 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 2. <i>Time for filing; extension</i>.</b> - <b>The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment.</b> On motion duly filed and served, with full payment of the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme Court may for justifiable reasons grant an extension of thirty (30) days only within which to file the petition. (emphasis supplied)<br><br>Definite from these quoted provisions is that an accused has only <b>fifteen days</b> from promulgation or notice of judgment within which to file before the Sandiganbayan a motion for reconsideration or to file before this Court a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Considering that Navera and Delos Reyes did not seek a reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan's decision, their recourse would have been to file a petition for review on certiorari within fifteen days from 25 November 2009, or until 10 December 2009. Therefore, insofar as Navera and Delos Reyes are concerned, their petition, submitted to this Court only on 27 August 2010, was filed way beyond the 15-day reglementary period. Navera and Delos Reyes' right to appeal had long prescribed, thus, the decision is no longer open to an appeal.<br></blockquote><b><i>The petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court relates to questions of law.</i></b><br><br>A petition pursuant to Sec. 1, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure pertains to questions of law and not to factual issues, thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Filing of Petition with Supreme Court. A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. <b>The petition shall raise only questions of law</b> which must be distinctly set forth. (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court has been consistent in differentiating a question of law from a question of fact, viz:<br><blockquote>A question of law arises when there is a doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be a question of law, it must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts and circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question is one of fact. Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question offact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br></blockquote>The general rule is that the Court is not a trier of facts, and it is not its function to examine, review or evaluate the evidence all over again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Issues raised before the Court on whether the prosecution's evidence proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, whether the presumption of innocence was: properly accorded the accused, whether there was sufficient evidence to support a charge of conspiracy, or whether the defense of good faith was correctly appreciated are all, in varying degrees, questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> A reading of the issues raised by the petitioners will readily show that these are questions of fact in which its resolution would involve a scrutiny of the evidence introduced before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The general rule nonetheless is not set in stone as to not admit chiseled exceptions. Indeed, accruing jurisprudence instructs on the exceptions to the general rule, viz: (1) where the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise, and conjectures; (2) where the inference madis manifestly mistaken; (3) where there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) where the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (5) where the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Conversely, the well-entrenched doctrine, constantly strengthened and invigorated byjudicial pronouncements, is that exceptions must be alleged, substantiated, and proved by the parties so this Court may evaluate and review the facts of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that the petitions are bereft of any persuasive showing as to the presence of any of the above circumstances to warrant a factual re­evaluation of the cases. The petitioners had obviously fumbled in their task of substantiating their petitions so as to fall within the jurisprudentially recognized exceptions to the rule. But even if the Court were to stretch the concept of these exceptions to the snapping point and examine the records again, the only indisputable conclusion that could be drawn from the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan was that the anti-graft court had not erred in finding the petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charges against them.<br><br><u><b>G.R. Nos. 193020, and 193040-193042</b></u><br><br>Cedeño was charged and found guilty in Crim. Case Nos. 24784, 24785, 24787, and 24789 for having signed the IRs attached to the corresponding DVs. In propounding the proposition that he had not conspired with his co-accused and that there was no positive evidence proving his participation in the anomalous transactions, he averred that he did not sign the IRs pertinent to Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785, and that Romano did not identify him as a signatory to the transactions in Crim. Case Nos. 24787 and 24789.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br><b>a. Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785</b><br><br>The records show that only the IRs attached to the DVs pertinent to Crim. Case Nos. 24786 to 24789 bore the signature of Cedeño. There is therefore colorable truth to his assertion that he did not sign the IRs for Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785. This fact notwithstanding, the Court could not find that his liability had lessened based solely on the trifling excuse that his signature did not appear in the IRs: for Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785.<br><br>It must be noted that Cedeño had admitted that he was a member of the inspectorate team composed of himself, the COA resident auditor, and the supply officer. He acknowledged that the function of the inspectorate team was to inspect and confirm the deliveries made by the supplier to the designated areas. He claimed that the subject vouchers, which had passed through his office and the other offices, were genuine since they bore no erasures or falsification.<br><br>The IRs for Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785 were signed by Reyes, Domato, and Agustin in their respective capacities as supply officer, auditor, and inspector. Obviously, Agustin should not have signed the IRs pertinent to these two cases considering that, by Cedeño's testimony, it was he (Cedeño) who was part of the inspectorate team. Cedeño failed to offer any explanation why Agustin signed the IR or as to the circumstances that would justify Agustin signing on his behalf.<br><br>Cedeño cannot feign ignorance by saying he was not aware that the IRs in Crim. Case Nos. 24784 and 24785 were signed by Agustin. The DVs for these cases, as confirmed by Cedeño, were genuine and had passed through his office for his signature. Taking into account the fact that the IR was one of the required attachments to a DV, it can easily be deduced that Cedeño had gone through the IR as this appears to be the only document that should have been signed by him. The fact that the IR was signed by Agustin and not by him should have pricked his curiosity and prompted inquiry, yet Cedeño ignored this and allowed the processing of payment to the supplier thereby conforming to the findings of Agustin, Delos Reyes, and Domato that the items delivered were in accordance with the specification, quality, and quantity required. Surely, Cedeño even acknowledged that had he not signed the IRs, the suppliers would not have been paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><b>b. Crim. Case Nos. 24787 and 24789</b><br><br>There is no issue that the IRs for Crim. Case Nos. 24787 and 24789 were signed by Cedeño. The pretentious defense offered by Cedeño that his signature was not identified by Romano during the latter's testimony fails to convince. There was no need for Romano to enumerate each and every signatory to the documents in these cases and state with particularity in what capacity the signatories affixed their signatures in order that the Sandiganbayan may hold the signatories liable for their crimes. For sure, a completely different declaration might have been arrived at where there was a persuasive and credible explanation from Cedeño that his signature had been forged or that someone, without his knowledge and authority, had signed on his behalf. Nothing from the records, however, yielded even the slightest indication that the signature of Cedeño in the subject IRs had been forged or that someone had signed for him. It must be noted that Cedeño never asserted that the signatures appearing on the IRs were not his, thus confirming that he was the one who had affixed his signature on the documents.<br><br>Equally important is that the Court can easily discern from the IRs what matters Cedeño was certifying to when he affixed his signature on the documents. To stress, he did not deny his signatures on the subject IRs which plainly, prove that he had acted as the inspector of the inspectorate team; and he,, together with the supply officer and the concerned resident auditor, had certified that the items were delivered according to specification, quality, and quantity indicated in the contract, notwithstanding the fact that there were short deliveries.<br><br>To challenge the ruling of the Sandiganbayan that he conspired with his co-accused, Cedeño invoked the principles laid down by the Court in <i>Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> and <i>Albert v. Gangan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Cedeño failed to consider that the factual milieu of the cases on which he based his claim were entirely dissimilar from his case. In <i>Magsuci</i> and <i>Albert</i>, both petitioners were heads of their offices, i.e., Magsuci was the Regional Director of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (<i>BFAR)</i> RO X, while: Albert was the President of the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (<i>NHMFC</i>).<br><br>In <i>Magsuci</i>, the petitioner had just assumed office as BFAR RD when he read the accomplishment report and the certification on the construction of a 40-ton ice making plant, including a 150-ton ice storage and 350-ton cold storilge facility in Surigao City. He then directed the issuance of the DV to pay the contractor, Dexter Corporation (<i>Dexter</i>), and the preparation of the checks. He signed the DV and the checks which, together with all the attachments, were forwarded to the BFAR Central Office. It was found out later that there was no such installation and construction of a 40-ton ice making plant; hence, the petitioner and the general manager of Dexter were charged and were subsequently found guilty by the Sandiganbayan of the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public documents.<br><br>In <i>Albert</i>, the COA found the petitioner as one of those personally liable for the amount of P36,796,711.55, which represented the loan proceeds for a project. COA anchored the liability of the petitioner on the grounds that he was the final approving authority of the assailed transaction, and that the officers and employees who processed the same were directly under his supervision.<br><br>In finding the petitions of both <i>Magsuci</i> and <i>Albert</i> meritorious, the Court took into account the absence of conspiracy: for Magsuci, it was the fact that the actions he had taken were the functions he had to discharge in relation to his office and that there was no intimation that he had knowledge of the irregularities committed by his co-accused. In the case of Albert, his guilt as a conspirator was not established beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, the Court found applicable the established rule that an officer who signs or initials a voucher as it is going the rounds does not necessarily mean that the said person was part of a conspiracy in an illegal scheme. To buttress its ruling as to the absence of conspiracy, the Court cited in <i>Albert</i> its earlier declaration in <i>Pareño v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> viz:<br><blockquote>It is rather apparent that under the Sandiganbayan's decision, a department secretary, bureau chief, commission chairman, agency head, department head or chief of office would be equally culpable for every crime arising from any transactions or held guilty of conspiracy simply because <i>he was the last of a long line of officials or employees who acted upon or affixed his signature to a transaction</i>. We cannot allow this because guilt must be premised on a more knowing personal, and deliberate participation of each individual who is charged with others as part of a conspiracy. <i>There must be more convincing proof</i> which in this case is wanting.<br></blockquote>Noteworthy, in both <i>Magsuci</i> and <i>Albert</i>, the Court reiterated its ruling in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> viz:<br><blockquote>We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of office plagued by all too common problems - dishonest or negligent subordinates, overwork, multiple assignments or positions, or plain incompetence - is suddenly swept into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not personally examine every single detail, painstakingly trace every step from inception, and investigate the motives of every person involved in a transaction before affixing his signature as the final approving authority.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed records, inspected :documents, received procedures and questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office could personally do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the impossible. <i>All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations.</i> If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the auditor is not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of the bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, inquire whether the correct amount of food was served, and otherwise personally look into the reimbursement voucher's accuracy, propriety and sufficiency. There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail. <i>Any executive head of even small government agencies or commissiqns can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.</i><br><br>There should be other grounds than the mere signature or approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction.<br></blockquote>It must be emphasized that <i>Arias</i> involved the culpability of a final approving authority on the basis of criminal conspiracy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> or where, in the performance of his official duties, the head of an office is being held to answer for his act of relying on the acts of his subordinate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> To the point of being repetitive, Cedeño was the appointed inspector of the office and was a member of the inspectorate team. The very name and function of his office render necessary his inspection of the items in these transactions. Indeed, the phrase "Inspected by" before his name in the IR confirm that, before he affixed his signature, he had personally inspected the items and had found them to be in accordance with the specification, quality, and quantity as stated in the contract. The mandate of his office undoubtedly required no less, i.e., that he should have personally inspected the items that were purchased by DECS RO XII before he affixed his signature on the IR.<br><br><u><b>G.R. Nos. 193349-193354</b></u><br><br>Pundaodaya and Adiong aver that because the factual circumstances prevailing in these cases were the same as with Kadon and Dy, who were both acquitted by the Sandiganbayan upon their seeking a reconsideration of its decision, they (Pundaodaya and Adiong) should likewise be found innocent of the charges against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>In resolving the motion for reconsideration of Kadon, the Sandiganbayan appreciated the fact that Kadon had just transferred to Region XII and that his participation was only towards the latter part of the assailed transactions. Kadon did not have any opportunity to be in cahoots with co-accused because of the little time he had from the date of his assumption of duty in Region XII to the time he signed the DVs. More importantly, in a related case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> involving these transactions before the Office of the President, the Executive Secretary found basis for the reduction of the penalty imposed on Kadon, from suspension from office to three (3) months without pay, on account of the factual finding that "<i>x x x, as shown in the documents appended to his motion, (Kadon) called and held meetings with responsible DECS officials of the region to discuss and take up matters covered by the papers ready for his signature</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>As regards Dy who was impleaded in Crim. Case Nos. 24786 and 24789, the Sandiganbayan found that, other than being the owner of AAA, no proof was presented that he had participated in or had knowledge of the subject transactions. On the other hand, Paragoso admitted that, as manager of AAA, he was the one who signed the contracts with DECS and who received the payments for AAA's account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>Significantly, the present petition, which is but a reiteration of the motion for reconsideration of Pundaodaya, Adiong, Kadon, Dy, and Cendeno, was found by the Sandiganbayan to have been argued merely for Kadon and Dy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> The Court sees no differently. Indeed, an assiduous reading of the testimonies of Kadon, Dy, and Paragoso which were quoted in the petition fails to convince that Pundaodaya and Adiong were similarly situated as Kadon and Dy.<br><br><b><i>The guilt of the petitioners had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</i></b><br><br>Pundaodaya, Adiong, and Cedeño were charged with violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, the elements of which are as follows:<br><blockquote>1) The accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;<br><br>2) He must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and<br><br>3) That his action caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>The first element is not at issue in any of these cases. On the second and third elerrients, the Sandiganbayan held that the petitioners "displayed evident bad faith in the exercise of their functions and at the same time extended unwarranted benefits or partiality to the private persons who owned the business establishments with whom they entered into contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>Records will reveal that the findings of the team had not been successfully refuted by Pundaodaya, Adiong, and Cedeño. There were but bare claims by the petitioners that they had performed their duties by reviewing the documents, and that the suppliers had made complete deliveries of the desks.<br><br>Jurisprudence instructs that bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br><i>We quote Zoleta</i> -<br><blockquote>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy does not need to be proven by direct evidence and may be inferred from the conduct before, during, and after the commission of the crime - indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all. Conspiracy is present when one concurs with the criminal design of another, as shown by an overt act leading to the crime committed. It may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote>The word unwarranted means lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized or without justification or adequate reason. Advantage means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit, profit or gain of any kind; benefit from some course of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>It is clear in these cases that there was no justification or adequate reason for Pundaodaya, Adiong, Cedeño, and the other accused public officers to process the full payment for the desks. The truth that Pundaodaya, Adiong, Cedeño, and their co-accused were able to have the DVs processed through the execution of documents, i.e., IRs, MRs, and DRs, to evidence full deliveries of the desks despite the inexistent and short deliveries, clearly prove that they had acted in bad faith in the discharge of their duties in order to attain a common purpose, i.e., to extend undue advantage and unwarranted benefits to the suppliers, causing great disadvantage and injury to the government.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>DENIED</b>.
