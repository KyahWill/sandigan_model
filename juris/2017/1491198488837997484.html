				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The venue for a petition for voluntary insolvency proceeding under the Insolvency Law is the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the insolvent debtor resides. A corporation is considered a resident of the place where its principal office is located as stated in its Articles of Incorporation.

It found Royal Ferry to have sufficiently shown full compliance with the requirements of the Insolvency Law on venue and that it had abandoned its Makati office and moved to Manila. The Regional Trial Court also noted that when the Branch Sherriff confiscated Royal Ferry's books and personal assets, the properties were taken from a Manila address, at Room 203, BF Condominium Building, Andres Soriano corner Streets, Intramuros, Manila.<br><br>Pilipinas Shell moved for reconsideration on February 24, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated June 15, 2006, the Regional Trial Court reconsidered the denial of Pilipinas Shell's Motion to Dismiss.

The Motion to Dismiss is granted. The Petition for Voluntary Insolvency is hereby ordered DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, Royal Ferry filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on October 26, 2006.

It overturned the grant of the Motion to Dismiss since Pilipinas Shell failed to secure the written consent of all the creditors of Royal Ferry.<br><br>On the alleged jurisdictional defects of Royal Ferry's Petition for Voluntary Insolvency, the Court of Appeals found that "the [Manila Regional Trial Court] has jurisdiction over the instant case, and therefore, has the authority to render a decision on it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It likewise found that Manila was the proper venue for the case because "the cities of Makati and Manila are part of one region, or even a province, city or municipality, if Section 51 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines is taken by analogy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Court of Appeals stated that Section 82<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the Insolvency Law dictates that an order granting an adjudication of insolvency is appealable only to the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Pilipinas Shell moved for reconsideration, but the Motion was denied on May 26, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Hence, this Petition was filed on July 20, 2009.<br><br>Petitioner contended that the Court of Appeals should not have taken cognizance of respondent Royal Ferry's appeal because it "failed to comply with Section 13, paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (h), Rule 44 of the Rules of Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Petitioner claimed that the Court of Appeals erred when it held that the "petition for voluntary insolvency [was filed] in the proper venue since the cities of Makati and Manila are part of one region[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> According to petitioner, there was no reason to consider Makati and Manila as part of one region or province for the purpose of determining venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Moreover, petitioner argued that since respondent's Articles of Incorporation stated that its principal office was located at 2521 A. Bonifacio St., Bangkal, Makati City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Petition for Voluntary Insolvency should have been filed in Makati, not in Manila.

CV No. 102522,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> made the present Petition moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In CA-G.R. CV No. 102522, the Court of Appeals deemed the stipulations of the Compromise Agreement valid and not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing premises considered, the Compromise Agreement is hereby <b>APPROVED</b> and judgment is hereby rendered in accordance therewith.

It claimed that the Compromise Agreement was only between Pilipinas Shell, and Antonino R. Gascon, Jr., and Jonathan D. Gascon (the Gascons).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Respondent was not a party to the agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Petitioner argued that it had agreed to waive any action against respondent's officers, directors, employees, stockholders, and successors-in-interest, but that it did not agree to waive its claim against respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>On October 25, 2016, respondent filed a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> stating that petitioner was held solidarity liable with the Gascons in CA-G.R. CV No. 102522. Thus, when petitioner "released the Gascons, two (2) of the solidary debtors, of all their obligations",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> petitioner effectively extinguished the entire obligation under Article 1215<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> of the Civil Code.<br><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><br>First, whether this Petition is moot and academic in light of the Compromise Agreement dated August 4, 2015;<br><br>Second, whether the Court of Appeals erred in taking cognizance of Royal Ferry's appeal despite its violation of Rule 44, Section 13 of the Rules of Court; and<br><br>Lastly, whether the Petition for Insolvency was properly filed.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Respondent argues that the Petition is moot and academic in light of the Compromise Agreement. It alleges that petitioner has abandoned its claim against respondent and, consequently, lost its status as respondent's creditor. Thus, petitioner has no more interest in the case and can no longer question the insolvency proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>For its part, petitioner contends that it has waived only its claims against "[respondent's] Antonino R. Gascon, Jr. and Jonathan D. Gascon and its other officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors-in-interest and did <b><u>not</u></b> waive or abandon any of its claims against [respondent]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis in the original).<br><br>Petitioner has not abandoned its claim against respondent. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Compromise Agreement provide:<br><blockquote>4. The FIRST PARTY waives any further action of whatsoever nature, whether past, present or contingent, in connection with the causes of action against the SECOND PARTY and THIRD PARTY alleged in its complaint in Civil Case No. 05-773, entitled "<i>Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Royal Ferry Services, Inc., Antonino R. Gascon, Jr. and Jonathan D. Gascon</i>" already partially resolved by the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 141 in its Partial Decision dated 20 May 2013 and Order dated 3 December 2013;<br><br>5. Should the Supreme Court of the Philippines rule in favor of the FIRST PARTY in "<i>Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Royal Ferry Services, Inc.</i>" (G.R. No. 188146), or otherwise reinstate the Orders dated 15 June 2006 and 16 October 2006 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 24, dismissing the Petition for Voluntary Insolvency filed by Royal Ferry Services, Inc., the FIRST PARTY agrees not to hold the officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors-in-interest of Royal Ferry Services, Inc., the SECOND PARTY, the THIRD PARTY, and the heirs and assigns of the foregoing personally liable for the obligations of Royal Ferry Services, Inc. to the FIRST PARTY, and, instead, abandon completely all causes of action against said officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors-in-interest of Royal Ferry Services, Inc., the SECOND PARTY, the THIRD PARTY, and their heirs and assigns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>The Compromise Agreement was between petitioner and the Gascons. Contrary to its claim, respondent was not a party to the agreement. Nowhere in the Compromise Agreement did petitioner agree to waive its claim against respondent.<br><br>In CA-G.R. CV No. 102522, petitioner held the Gascons solidarity liable with respondent for the same debt that petitioner was claiming in these proceedings. It is on this basis that respondent now asserts that it is a solidary debtor with the Gascons and can, thus, acquire the benefit stipulated in Article 1215<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the Civil Code.<br><br>Respondent did not present any other proof of this alleged solidary liability. In CA-G.R. CV No. 102522, one of petitioner's contentions was whether the corporate veil should be pierced to make the Gascons liable for respondent's liabilities. Before the Court of Appeals could rule on the matter, however, the Compromise Agreement had been executed and the case was closed.<br><br>A case is moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy because of supervening events so that a declaration would be of no practical use or value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> As respondent has failed to establish that petitioner has abandoned its claim against it, petitioner continues to have an interest in the insolvency proceeding.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>On the issue of the formal defects of respondent's appeal, we uphold the Court of Appeals Decision to rule on the merits of the case.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that respondent's Appellant's Brief has failed to comply with Rule 44, Section 13, paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote>(a) First, the Appellant's Brief is bereft of page references to the record in its "Statements of Facts and of the Case" and its discussion supporting its assignment of errors, in violation of Section 13 (c), (d) and (f) of Rule 44.<br><br>(b) Second, the Appellant's Brief failed to include a statement of the issues of fact or law to be submitted to [the Court of Appeals] for judgment, in violation of Section 13(e), Rule 44.<br><br>(c) Third, the Appellant's Brief does not contain the page of the report on which the citation of authorities is found, in violation of Section 13(f), Rule 44.<br><br>(d) Fourth, the table of cases is not alphabetically arranged, in violation of Section 13(a), Rule 44.<br><br>(e) Fifth, the Appellants Brief does not contain, as an appendix, a copy of the judgment or final order appealed from, in violation of Section 13(h), Rule 44.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, respondent argues that it has substantially complied with the requirements under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It claims that the absence of page references to the record in its "Statements of Facts and of the Case" has not automatically resulted in the dismissal of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Further, as the records of this case are not voluminous, the Court of Appeals was not inconvenienced by the lapse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Respondent likewise claims that although the Appellant's Brief did not specifically contain the phrase "statement of issues," the three errors in issue were identifiable through a reading of the Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It claims that its failure to append a copy of the trial court Order has been mooted because the Court of Appeals has issued the Resolution requiring them to submit copies of the assailed Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Lastly, respondent argues that it only cited five (5) cases in the Brief. Hence, a citation of authorities was unnecessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in deciding to rule on the merits. The term "may" in Rule 50, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the Rules of Court means that the Court of Appeals has discretion to dismiss an appeal based on the enumerated grounds. The Court of Appeals exercised its discretion when it decided that the interest of justice would be better served by overlooking the pleading's technical defects. Time and again, this Court has declared that dismissal on purely technical grounds is frowned upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It is judicial policy to determine a case based on the merits so that the parties have full opportunity to ventilate their cause and defenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The Court of Appeals did not err in taking cognizance of the appeal.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The Petition for Insolvency was properly filed before the Regional Trial Court of Manila.<br><br>The first insolvency law, Republic Act No. 1956, was entitled "An Act Providing for the Suspension of Payments, the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, the Protection of Creditors, and the Punishment of Fraudulent Debtors (Insolvency Law)". It was derived from the Insolvency Act of California (1895), with few provisions taken from the United States Bankruptcy Act of 1898.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> With the enactment of Republic Act No. 10142, otherwise known as the Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010 (FRIA), the Insolvency Law was expressly repealed on July 18, 2010. The FRIA is currently the special law that governs insolvency. However, because the relevant proceedings in this case took place before the enactment of the FRIA, the case needs to be resolved under the provisions of the Insolvency Law.<br><br>Insolvency proceedings are defined as the statutory procedures by which a debtor obtains financial relief and undergoes judicially supervised reorganization or liquidation of its assets for the benefit of its creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that the Regional Trial Court of Manila obtained jurisdiction because in its Petition for Voluntary Insolvency, respondent alleged that its principal office was then found in Manila. On the other hand, petitioner argues that filing the petition before the Regional Trial Court of Manila was a patent jurisdictional defect as the Regional Trial Court of Manila did not have territorial jurisdiction over respondent's residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Petitioner confuses the concepts of jurisdiction and venue. In <i>City of Lapu-Lapu v. Phil. Economic Zone Authority</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><blockquote>On the one hand, jurisdiction is "the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong." Jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law. Thus, an action may be filed only with the court or tribunal where the Constitution or a statute says it can be brought. Objections to jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be brought at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. When a case is filed with a court which has no jurisdiction over the action, the court shall <i>motu proprio</i> dismiss the case.<br><br>On the other hand, venue is "the place of trial or geographical location in which an action or proceeding should be brought." In civil cases, venue is a matter of procedural law. A party's objections to venue must be brought at the earliest opportunity either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer; otherwise the objection shall be deemed waived. When the venue of a civil action is improperly laid, the court cannot <i>motu proprio</i> dismiss the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Wrong venue is merely a procedural infirmity, not a jurisdictional impediment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law, while venue is a matter of procedural law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Jurisdiction is conferred by law, and the Insolvency Law vests jurisdiction in the Court of First Instance—now the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>Jurisdiction is acquired based on the allegations in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The relevant portion of respondent's Petition for Voluntary Insolvency reads:<br><blockquote>Petitioner was incorporated on 18 October 1996 with principal place of business in 2521 A. Bonifacio Street, Bangkal, Makati City. At present and during the past six months, [Royal Ferry] has held office in Rm. 203 BF Condo Building, Andres Soriano cor. Solana St., Intramuros, Manila, within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, where its books of accounts and most of its remaining assets are kept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 14 of the Insolvency Law specifies that the proper venue for a petition for voluntary insolvency is the Regional Trial Court of the province or city where the insolvent debtor has resided in for six (6) months before the filing of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In this case, the issue of which court is the proper venue for respondent's Petition for Voluntary Insolvency comes from the confusion on an insolvent corporation's residence.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the residence of a corporation depends on what is stated in its articles of incorporation, regardless of whether the corporation physically moved to a different location. On the other hand, respondent posits that the fiction of a corporation's residence must give way to uncontroverted facts.<br><br>In <i>Young Auto Supply Co. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><blockquote>A corporation has no residence in the same sense in which this term is applied to a natural person. But for practical purposes, a corporation is in a metaphysical sense a resident of the place where its principal office is located as stated in the articles of incorporation... The Corporation Code precisely requires each corporation to specify in its articles of incorporation the "place where the principal office of the corporation is to be located which must be within the Philippines"... The purpose of this requirement is to fix the residence of a corporation in a definite place, instead of allowing it to be ambulatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Young Auto Supply</i> dealt with the venue of a corporation's personal action by applying the provisions of the Rules of Court. Nonetheless, the Rules of Court also provides for when its provisions on venue do not apply. Rule 4, Section 4 provides:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 4 <br><i>Venue of Actions</i><br></center>....<br><br>SECTION 4. <i>When Rule not applicable</i>. — This Rule shall not apply.<br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> In those cases where a specific rule or law provides otherwise; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where the parties have validly agreed in writing before the filing of the action on the exclusive venue thereof.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As there is a specific law that covers the rules on venue, the Rules of Court do not apply.<br><br>The old Insolvency Law provides that in determining the venue for insolvency proceedings, the insolvent corporation should be considered a resident of the place where its actual place of business is located six (6) months before the filing of the petition:<br><blockquote>Sec. 14. Application. — An insolvent debtor, owing debts exceeding in amount the sum of one thousand pesos, may apply to be discharged from his debts and liabilities by petition to the Court of First Instance of province or city <i>in which he has resided for six months next preceding the filing of such petition</i>. In his petition he shall set forth his place of residence, the period of his residence therein immediately prior to filing said petition, his inability to pay all his debts in full, his willingness to surrender all his property, estate, and effects not exempt from execution for the benefit of his creditors, and an application to be adjudged an insolvent. He shall annex to his petition a schedule and inventory in the form herein-after provided. The filing of such petition shall be an act of insolvency. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br></blockquote>The law places a premium on the place of residence before a petition is filed since venue is a matter of procedure that looks at the convenience of litigants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In insolvency proceedings, this Court needs to control the property of the insolvent corporation. In <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. S.F. Naguiat Enterprises, Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><blockquote>Conformably, it is the policy of Act No. 1956 to place all the assets and liabilities of the insolvent debtor completely within the jurisdiction and control of the insolvency court without the intervention of any other court in the insolvent debtor's concerns or in the administration of the estate. It was considered to be of prime importance that the insolvency proceedings follow their course as speedily as possible in order that a discharge, if the insolvent debtor is entitled to it, should be decreed without unreasonable delay. "Proceedings of [this] nature cannot proceed properly or with due dispatch unless they are controlled absolutely by the court having charge thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>To determine the venue of an insolvency proceeding, the residence of a corporation should be the actual place where its principal office has been located for six (6) months before the filing of the petition. If there is a conflict between the place stated in the articles of incorporation and the physical location of the corporation's main office, the actual place of business should control.<br><br>Requiring a corporation to go back to a place it has abandoned just to file a case is the very definition of inconvenience. There is no reason why an insolvent corporation should be forced to exert whatever meager resources it has to litigate in a city it has already left.<br><br>In any case, the creditors deal with the corporation's agents, officers, and employees in the actual place of business. To compel a corporation to litigate in a city it has already abandoned would create more confusion.<br><br>Moreover, the six (6)-month qualification of the law's requirement of residence shows intent to find the most accurate location of the debtor's activities. If the address in a corporation's articles of incorporation is proven to be no longer accurate, then legal fiction should give way to fact.<br><br>Petitioner cites <i>Hyatt Elevators and Escalators Corp. v. Goldstar Elevators Phils. Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> where this Court ruled that a corporation's articles of incorporation is the controlling document that determines the venue of a corporation's action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Thus, abandoning the principal office does not affect the venue of the corporation's personal action if the corporation's articles of incorporation were not previously amended to reflect this change.<br><br>Two glaring differences between this case and Hyatt make the latter inapplicable. First, <i>Hyatt</i> found inconclusive the allegation that the petitioner corporation relocated to a different city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Here, the Regional Trial Court found that respondent had sufficiently shown that it had been a resident of Manila for six (6) months before it filed its Petition for Voluntary Insolvency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Second, and more importantly, <i>Hyatt</i> involves a complaint for unfair trade practices and damages—a personal action governed by the Civil Code and the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This case, however, involves insolvency, a special proceeding governed by a special law that specifically qualifies the residence of the petitioner.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>We cannot sustain the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the "petition for voluntary insolvency [was filed] in the proper venue since the cities of Makati and Manila are part of one region[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> This is untenable. Section 14 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 provides several judges to preside over the different branches assigned to Manila and Makati. Thus, the two venues are distinct:<br><blockquote>(d) One hundred seventy-two Regional Trial Judges shall be commissioned for the National Capital Judicial Region. There shall be:<br><br><i>Eighty-two branches (Branches I to LXXXII) for the city of Manila, with seats thereat;</i><br><br>Twenty-five branches (Branches LXXXIII to CVII) for Quezon City, with seats thereat;<br><br>Twelve branches (Branches CVIII to CXIX) for Pasay City, with seats thereat;<br><br>Twelve branches (Branches CXX to CXXXI) for Caloocan City, with seats thereat;<br><br>Thirty-nine branches (Branches CXXXII to CLXX) for the municipalities of Navotas, Malabon, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, Pasig, Pateros, Taguig, Marikina, Paranaque, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa, <i>Branches CXXXII to CL with seats at Makati</i>, Branches CLI to CLXVIII at Pasig, and Branches CLXIX and CLXX at Malabon; and<br><br>Two branches (Branches CLXXI and CLXXII) for the municipality of Valenzuela, with seats thereat. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Despite being in the same region, Makati and Manila are treated as two distinct venues. To deem them as interchangeable venues for being in the same region has no basis in law.<br><br>Respondent is a resident of Manila. The law should be read to lay the venue of the insolvency proceeding in the actual location of the debtor's activities. If it is uncontroverted that respondent's address in its Articles of Incorporation is no longer accurate, legal fiction should give way to fact. Thus, the Petition was correctly filed before the Regional Trial Court of Manila.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED</b>.
