On November 2, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> she filed a <em>Motion to Quash</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Information. Her motion was hinged on the argument that the first element of the crime of bigamy - that is, that the offender has been previously legally married - is not present. In support, Lolita attached a copy of the RTC-Dagupan City <em>Decision</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> declaring the marriage between her and Amado void <em>ab initio</em> on the ground that there was no marriage ceremony between them and what transpired was a marriage by proxy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, in its <em>Order</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated March 20, 2006, the RTC-San Carlos <strong>granted</strong> Lolita's <em>Motion to Quash</em> and dismissed the complaint for bigamy, relying on <em>Morigo v. People</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Due to the significant resemblance of this case to the <em>Morigo</em> case, this Court is constrained to adopt and apply the ruling and principles laid down in <em>Morigo</em>. As succinctly put by the Supreme Court in the case aforementioned[:]</p> <blockquote> <p> "<em>The first element of bigamy as a crime requires that the accused must have been legally married, but in this case, legally speaking, the petitioner was never married to Lucia Barrete. Thus, there is no first marriage to speak of. Under the principle of retroactivity of a marriage being declared void ab initio, the two were never married from the beginning. The contract of marriage is null; it bears no legal effect. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion, for legal purposes, petitioner was not married to Lucia Barrete at the time he contracted the marriage with Maria Lumbago. The petitioner, must perforce, be acquitted of the charge</em>. </p> </blockquote> <p> Since the first marriage has been declared void <em>ab initio</em>, there is no first marriage to begin with in determining the foremost element of bigamy. Such declaration of nullity retroacts to the date of the first marriage. The accused in this case was, under the eyes of the law, never married to Amado Rosete at the time she contracted the marriage with Jose Bumatay. Following this judicial fiat, the defense of good faith and lack of criminal intent has been rendered moot and academic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC-San Carlos concluded that there were "glaring material similarities"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> between <em>Morigo</em> and the case against Lolita. Thus, in dismissing the bigamy case against Lolita, the RTC-San Carlos held that since the first marriage has been declared void <em>ab initio</em>, then, pursuant to the ruling in <em>Morigo</em>, there is no first marriage to begin with in determining the foremost element of bigamy. Such declaration of nullity retroacts to the date of the first marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, accused Lolita in this case was, for all intents and purposes, never married to Amado at the time she contracted the marriage with Jose. Based on the foregoing, the RTC-San Carlos dismissed the Bigamy charge against Lolita. Aggrieved, Jona appealed the RTC-San Carlos' <i>Order</i> to the CA. </p><p> <b><i>The CA Decision</i></b></p><p> In its <em>Decision</em> dated August 28, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the CA <strong>affirmed</strong> the RTC-San Carlos' <em>Order</em> dated March 20, 2006 granting the <em>Motion to Quash</em> and <strong>dismissed</strong> Jona's appeal. The CA resolved the issue of whether the RTC-San Carlos erred in ordering the quashal of the Information for Bigamy on the ground that the criminal liability of the accused had been extinguished when her first marriage was declared null and void<em> ab initio</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> In upholding the RTC-San Carlos' decision, the CA held that:</p><p> <em>First</em>, a motion to quash is the mode by which an accused assails, before entering his plea, the validity of the criminal complaint or information filed against him for insufficiency on its face in point of law, or for a defect apparent on the face of the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Under Rule 117, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, in the hearing of a motion to quash, only such facts as are alleged in the information, and those admitted by the prosecutor, should be taken into account in the resolution thereof unless the Rules expressly permit the investigation of the facts alleged in the motion to quash. However, the Supreme Court has held that under Rule 117, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a motion to quash may be based on factual and legal grounds and that it necessarily follows that facts outside the Information itself may be introduced to prove such grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p>Here, the trial court anchored its acquittal on the <em>Declaration of Nullity</em> issued by the RTC-Dagupan City, on the ground that no actual marriage ceremony took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The RTC-Dagupan City reasoned that there being no first marriage to speak of, there was no legal impediment at the time the accused married Jose Bumatay; and as a consequence, the accused is not guilty of bigamy. Consequently, according to the CA, it is crystal clear that in granting the motion to quash, the RTC-Dagupan City took into consideration the factual findings of the RTC-Dagupan City which led to the latter's declaration that the marriage of Lolita and Amado was null and void<em> ab initio</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> <i>Finally</i>, the CA was not persuaded by Jona's contention that the RTC-San Carlos erred in granting the motion to quash on the basis of the decision declaring the nullity of the first marriage since it is not among the grounds for extinction of criminal liability. The CA agreed with the RTC-San Carlos' conclusion that the extinction of criminal liability presupposes the existence of such liability in the first place, which is later totally obliterated by virtue of a certain circumstance that eventually happens. In the present case, criminal liability never existed from the beginning as the first marriage never validly occurred due to the fact that a marriage ceremony never took place. Hence, there was no criminal liability to extinguish in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> Jona's <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em> was likewise denied by the CA in its <em>Resolution</em> dated February 4, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> finding that the arguments raised in the Motion for Reconsideration are substantially a reiteration of those already passed upon and considered by the CA in its <em>Decision</em>. Jona received a copy of said CA <em>Resolution</em> on February 17, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> On April 5, 2010, Jona filed, in her personal capacity, the instant petition. In a <em>Resolution</em> dated April 28, 2010, the Court required Lolita to file her comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Lolita filed her <em>Comment</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> on June 11, 2010, while Jona filed her <em>Reply (with Compliance)</em> on March 9, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b><i>The Issue</i></b> </p><p>The sole issue brought before this Court is whether the CA committed any reversible error in upholding the RTC-San Carlos' Order granting Lolita's motion to quash the Information for the crime of Bigamy. </p><p align="center"><em><b>The Court's Ruling</b> </em> </p><p> The petition is denied. </p><p>Based on the records, it appears undisputed that Petitioner has no legal personality to assail the dismissal of the criminal case. Rule 110, Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dictates that all criminal actions commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of a public prosecutor. In appeals of criminal cases before the Supreme Court, the authority to represent the State is vested solely in the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> This authority is codified in Section 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 35. <em>Powers and Functions</em>. — The Office of the Solicitor General shall represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer. When authorized by the President or head of the office concerned, it shall also represent government-owned or controlled corporations. The Office of the Solicitor General shall constitute the law office of the Government and, as such, shall discharge duties requiring the services of a lawyer. It shall have the following specific powers and functions:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="98%"><div align="justify"><strong>Represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings</strong>; represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party. (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Thus, in criminal cases, the People is the real party-in-interest and only the OSG can represent the People in criminal proceedings before this Court. Inasmuch as the private offended party is but a witness in the prosecution of offenses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the interest of the private offended party is limited only to the aspect of civil liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It follows therefore that in criminal cases, the dismissal of the case against an accused can only be appealed by the Solicitor General, acting on behalf of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p> <p> In <i>Beams Philippine Export Corp. v. Castillo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> a similar appeal by a private party of a criminal case, the Court cogently disposed, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> "The purpose of a criminal action, in its purest sense, is to determine the penal liability of the accused for having outraged the state with his crime and, if he be found guilty, to punish him for it. In this sense, the parties to the action are the People of the Philippines and the accused. The offended party is regarded merely as a witness for the state." </p> <p> Consequently, the sole authority to institute proceedings before the CA or the SC is vested only on the OSG. Under Presidential Decree No. 478, among the specific powers and functions of the OSG was to "represent the Government in the [SC] and the [CA] in all criminal proceedings x x x." This provision has been carried over to the Revised Administrative Code particularly in Book IV, Title III, Chapter 12 thereof. Clearly, the OSG is the appellate counsel of the People of the Philippines in all criminal cases.</p> <p> Moreover, in<em> Bautista v. Cuneta-Pangilinan,</em> this Court held that in criminal cases, the acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case against him can only be appealed by the OSG, acting on behalf of the State. The private complainant or the offended party may question such acquittal or dismissal only insofar as the civil liability of the accused is concerned. </p> <p> In the present case, a perusal of the petition for <em>certiorari</em> filed by the petitioner before the CA discloses that it sought reconsideration of the criminal aspect of the decision of the RTC, not the civil aspect of the case. xxx</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Clearly, the petition is bereft of any claim for civil liability. In fact, the petitioner did not even briefly discuss the alleged civil liability of the respondents. As such, it is apparent that the petitioner's only desire was to appeal the dismissal of the criminal case against the respondents. Since <em>estafa</em>, however, is a criminal offense, only the OSG has the power to prosecute the case on appeal. Therefore, the petitioner lacked the personality or legal standing to question the RTC decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> While this Court is mindful of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> where the private offended party was allowed to pursue a criminal action on his or her own behalf — such as when there is a denial of due process - such exceptional circumstances do not exist in this case. The OSG, in its <em>Manifestation</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> expressly stated that it will not file a reply to Lolita's <em>comment</em> on the petition for review on certiorari considering that it did not file the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> To be sure, Jona's personality to even institute the bigamy case and thereafter to appeal the RTC-San Carlos' <em>Order</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dismissing the same is nebulous, at best. Settled is the rule that "every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest[,]" who, in turn, is one "who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or by the party entitled to the avails of the suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Within this context, "interest" means material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> To be clear, real interest refers to a present substantial interest, and not a mere expectancy, or a future, contingent, subordinate or consequential interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><p>Here, the record is replete with indications<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> that Jona's natural parents are unknown and she was merely raised as the "foster daughter" of Jose Bumatay, without having undergone the process of legal adoption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> It likewise does not escape the Court's attention that in the <em>Petition for the Issuance of Letters of Administration</em> filed by Rodelio Bumatay (Jose Bumatay's nephew), Jona was described as "claiming to be the adopted [child] of [Jose] but cannot present legal proof to this effect".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Finally, even in her own <em>Reply</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (to the comment to the petition for review), Jona merely denotes herself as "the only child of the late Jose Bumatay,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> without, however, presenting or even indicating any document or proof to support her claim of personality or legal standing. </p><p> Based on the foregoing, the Court does not see the need and will not waste its precious time in even delving into the question of whether or not the CA decision upholding the dismissal of the Bigamy case was erroneous or not. Indeed, in view of the lack of personality of the party who filed the petition, any such discourse by the Court would be obiter and correctly characterized as an advisory opinion.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, this Court resolves to <strong>DENY</strong> the instant petition for lack of merit and <strong>AFFIRM</strong> the Court of Appeals' <em>Decision</em> dated August 28, 2009 and <em>Resolution</em> dated February 4, 2010. </p><p><strong> SO ORDERED.</strong> </p><p> <em>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo</em>, and <em>Perlas-Bernabe, JJ</em>., concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 33-43.
