The NLRC considered the difficulty in proceeding with the execution given the conflicting decisions of the Court of Appeals' Special Second Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 72480 and the Court of Appeals' Fourteenth Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 72509 that were also passed upon by this Court, respectively, in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311 and in G.R. No. 164998. The NLRC ruled:<br><blockquote>At the outset, it must be stated that while this Commission has broad powers within its sphere of jurisdiction, it cannot encroach on judicial power which is the exclusive domain of the courts. The Court of Appeals has two contrasting rulings, one upholding the legality of complainants' dismissal, and the other declaring such dismissal illegal. This Commission has no power to overrule what has been decided by the courts. This is especially true with respect to judgments that have become final and executory not only at the level of the Court of Appeals, but also of the Supreme Court.<br><br>Indeed, there is an insurmountable obstacle in the execution of the decision favoring complainants. If We let execution proceed, We will disregard the Court of Appeals' ruling in the MERALCO petition. On the other hand, We cannot declare complainants to have been legally dismissed as this will contravene the Court of Appeals' ruling in the Frondozo petition.<br><br>Confronted with this dilemma, and in deference to the exercise of the judicial power as the courts may find appropriate, this Commission has no recourse but to enjoin all proceedings until the parties would have exhausted all available judicial remedies toward the possible reconciliation of the contrasting decisions.<br><br>WHEREFORE, there being no speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, MERALCO's prayer for preliminary injunction is GRANTED. All proceedings with this Commission as well as with the Labor Arbiter are hereby enjoined and suspended until further orders from the appropriate court.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Two sets of respondents filed their respective motions for reconsideration. In its Resolution promulgated on 26 May 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the NLRC denied the motions.<br><br>Frondozo, Perez, Zafra, Vito, Cruz, N. dela Cruz, and Diloy filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals assailing the 28 February 2006 and 26 May 2006 Resolutions of the NLRC.<br><br><center><u><b>The Decision of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></center><br>In its 6 March 2007 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the 28 February 2006 and 26 May 2006 Resolutions of the NLRC. According to the Court of Appeals, MERALCO's recourse was due to the two separate petitions before it (CA-G.R. SP No. 72480 and CA-G.R. SP No. 72509) that resulted in two contradictory rulings on the matter of petitioners' dismissal. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the execution of a final judgment is a matter of right on the part of the prevailing party and is mandatory and ministerial on the part of the court or tribunal issuing the judgment. However, the Court of Appeals stated that a suspension or refusal of execution of judgment or order on equitable grounds can be justified when there are facts or events transpiring after the judgment or order had become final and executory, thus materially affecting the judgment obligation.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, finality of the CA Decision in SP No. 72480 on May 24, 2004, is a supervening event which transpired <i>after the CA Decision</i> in SP 72509 (which was in favor of petitioners) had become final and executory, and which decision directly contradicts the ruling in the said case. It may also be noted that the Resolution of the Supreme Court's Third Division in G.R. No. 161311 categorically declared that the petition filed by herein petitioners is being denied for their failure to show that a reversible error has been committed by the appellate court in rendering the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 72480. Hence, with the denial with finality of the petition for review in G.R. No. 161159 (161311) the CA Decision in SP 72480 <i>upholding the dismissal of petitioners</i> has clearly become a legal obstacle to the enforcement of the final and executory decision in SP 72509 which in effect declared petitioners to have been illegally dismissed and upheld their right to back wages computed from December 14, 2001 and up to the date of their actual reinstatement.<br><br>In fine, no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the NLRC in granting preliminary injunction to private respondent MERALCO and enjoining or suspending all proceedings for the implementation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> alias writ of execution earlier issued by Labor Arbiter Guerrero with respect to the back wages/monetary award and reinstatement of petitioners pursuant to the May 29, 2002 Decision of the NLRC as affirmed/modified by the CA Decision in SP No. 72509.<br><br>As to the contention of petitioners that the NLRC should have instead proceeded to reconcile or harmonize the conflicting decisions rendered by the two (2) divisions of the Court, We find the same untenable and runs against established principles of immutability of final judgments in this jurisdiction. In fact, nothing is more settled in law than that once a judgment attains finality it thereby becomes immutable and <i>unalterable</i>. It may no longer be modified in any respect, even if modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.<br><br>We cannot but concur with the NLRC's pronouncement that MERALCO has no speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law for the preservation of its rights and interests, at least insofar only and solely as to avoid the injurious consequences of the <i>2<i>nd</i> alias writ of execution</i> relative to the reinstatement aspect of the final decision in CA-G.R. No. SP 72509.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present petition is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and accordingly DISMISSED for lack of merit.

According to the Court of Appeals, the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the NLRC did not make a distinction between decisions or resolutions decided by the Labor Arbiter and those decided by the Commission in certified cases when an order of reinstatement is involved. Thus, even when the employer had perfected an appeal, the Labor Arbiter must issue a writ of execution for actual or payroll reinstatement of the employees illegally dismissed from the service. The Court of Appeals also cited Article 223 of the Labor Code which provides that the reinstatement aspect of the Labor Arbiter's Decision is immediately executory.<br><br>In this case, the applicable rule is Article 263 of the Labor Code and the NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment, as amended by Resolution No. 02-02, series of 2002. Section 1, Rule III of the NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Execution Upon Final Judgment or Order. Execution shall issue only upon a judgment or order that finally disposes of an action or proceeding, except in specific instances where the law provides for execution pending appeal.<br></blockquote>Article 263(i) of the Labor Code, on the other hand, provides:<br><blockquote>(i) The Secretary of Labor and Employment, the Commission or the voluntary arbitrator shall decide or resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the assumption of jurisdiction or the certification or submission of the dispute, as the case may be. The decision of the President, the Secretary of Labor and Employment, the Commission or the voluntary arbitrator shall be final and executory ten (10) calendar days after receipt thereof by the parties.<br></blockquote>A judicial review of the decisions of the NLRC may be filed before the Court of Appeals <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court but the petition shall not stay the execution of the assailed decision unless a restraining order is issued by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In this case, the NLRC issued an Entry of Judgment stating that the 29 May 2002 NLRC Order became final and executory on 19 June 2002; a Writ of Execution was issued; and MERALCO complied with the payroll reinstatement of petitioners. However, with the promulgation of the 30 May 2003 Decision of the Court of Appeals' Special Second Division, finding that the 6-8 June 1991 strike was illegal, illegal acts marred with violence and coercion were committed, and dismissing petitioners from the service, MERALCO stopped the payroll reinstatement. This prompted petitioners to move for the issuance of an Alias Writ of Execution for the satisfaction of their accrued wages arising from the recall of their payroll reinstatement which Labor Arbiter Guerrero granted on 10 June 2004. Later, a second Alias Writ of Execution was issued.<br><br>As both the NLRC and the Court of Appeals stated, they were confronted with two contradictory Decisions of two different Divisions of the Court of Appeals. The petitions questioning these two Decisions of the Court of Appeals were both denied by this Court and the denial attained finality. The Court of Appeals sustained the NLRC that the 30 May 2003 Decision of the Court of Appeals' Special Second Division is a subsequent development that justified the suspension of the Alias Writs of Execution.<br><br>There are instances when writs of execution may be assailed. They are:<br><blockquote>(1) the writ of execution varies the judgment;<br><br>(2) there has been a change in the situation of the parties making execution inequitable or unjust;<br><br>(3) execution is sought to be enforced against property exempt from execution;<br><br>(4) it appears that the controversy has been submitted to the judgment of the court;<br><br>(5) the terms of the judgment are not clear enough and there remains room for interpretation thereof; or<br><br>(6) it appears that the writ of execution has been improvidently issued, or that it is defective in substance, or issued against the wrong party, or that the judgment debt has been paid or otherwise satisfied, or the writ was issued without authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The situation in this case is analogous to a change in the situation of the parties making execution unjust or inequitable. MERALCO's refusal to reinstate petitioners and to pay their backwages is justified by the 30 May 2003 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 72480. On the other hand, petitioners' insistence on the execution of judgment is anchored on the 27 January 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals' Fourteenth Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 72509. Given this situation, we see no reversible error on the part of the Court of Appeals in holding that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in suspending the proceedings. Grave abuse of discretion implies that the respondent court or tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thus, this Court declared:<br><blockquote>The term "grave abuse of discretion" has a specific meaning. An act of a court or tribunal can only be considered awith grave abuse of discretion when such act is done in a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction." The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility." Furthermore, the use of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is restricted only to "truly extraordinary cases wherein the act of the lower court or quasi­judicial body is wholly void." From the foregoing definition, it is clear that the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 can only strike an act down for having been done with grave abuse of discretion if the petitioner could manifestly show that such act was patent and gross.x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the NLRC did not act in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary, or despotic manner. It suspended the proceedings because it cannot revise or modify the conflicting Decisions of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>However, we need to resolve the issue on the conflicting Decisions in order to put an end to this litigation.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that "the finality of the CA Decision in SP No. 72480 on May 24, 2004, is a supervening event which transpired after the CA Decision in SP No. 72509 (which was in favor of petitioners) had become final and executory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This is not accurate. The Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 72480 was promulgated on 30 May 2003. The Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 72509 was promulgated on 27 January 2004. Even when the cases were elevated to this Court, G.R. No. 161159 and G.R. No. 161311 were resolved first before G.R. No. 164998. The Court's 23 February 2004 Resolution and the 24 May 2004 Resolution, both favoring MERALCO, became final and executory on 15 July 2004 and 2 September 2004, respectively, while the Resolution of&nbsp; 15 June 2005 which denied MERALCO's petition for review became final and executory on 4 October 2005, over a year after the final resolutions in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311.<br><br>Further, contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeals that CA-G.R. SP Nos. 72480 and 72509 attained finality without this Court actually passing upon the merits of the illegal dismissal aspect, this Court actually ruled on the merits of CA-G.R. SP No. 72480. The Court's Third Division denied the petition in G.R. No. 161159 in its 23 February 2004 Resolution on the ground that the petitioners failed to show that a reversible error had been committed by the Court of Appeals in rendering its Decision in CA­ G.R. SP No. 72480. The Court's Third Division also denied the petition in G.R. No. 161311 in its 24 May 2004 Resolution for failure of the petitioners to show that a reversible error had been committed by the appellate court in the same case, CA-G.R. SP No. 72480.<br><br>In <i>Agoy v. Araneta Center, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> this Court explained that "[w]hen the Court does not find any reversible error in the decision of the CA and denies the petition, there is no need for the Court to fully explain its denial, since it already means that it agrees with and adopts the findings and conclusions of the CA. The decision sought to be reviewed and s'et aside is correct." Hence, the Court's Third Division adopted the findings and conclusions reached by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 72480 which dismissed petitioners from the service. The finality of the denial of the petitions in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311 should be given greater weight than the denial of the petition in G.R. No. 164998 on technicality. It can also be interpreted that, in effect, the finality of the denial of the petitions in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311 also removed the jurisdiction of the Court's First Division and bound it to the final resolution in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311. The Court's First Division denied MERALCO's petition for failure to prosecute only on 15 June 2005, long after the denial of the petitions in G.R. Nos. 161159 and 161311 became final and executory on 15 July 2004 and 2 September 2004, respectively.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
