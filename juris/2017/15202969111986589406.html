These lots are claimed by two (2) parties, namely: the Heirs of Lourdes Padayhag, and Southern Mindanao Colleges (SMC). </p> <p>The first two lots (Lot Nos. 2102 and 2104 [Santa Lucia Lots]) are located at Jamisola Street, Santa Lucia District, Pagadian City. The other four lots (Lot Nos. 2883, 2888, 2921, and 2922 [Lumbia Lots]) are located at Lumbia District, Pagadian City.</p> <p> The Director of Lands, acting for and in behalf of the Government, instituted with the then Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur (now RTC of Pagadian City) Cadastral Case No. N-17, GLRO CAD Rec. No. N-468 pursuant to the government's initiative to place all lands under the Cadastral System. </p> <p>On January 4, 1967, Lourdes Padayhag filed her Answer in Cadastral Case No. N-17. </p> <p>On January 18, 1967, SMC filed its Answer in Cadastral Case No. N-17. </p> <p>The Heirs of Lourdes Padayhag [Padayhags] claim that the Spouses Federico and Lourdes Padayhag are the original owners of [the Lumbia] Lots [(Lot Nos. 2883, 2888, 2921, and 2922)]. These lots are part of the 5-hectare landholding of their father, Federico Padayhag. On August 31, 1948, Spouses Federico and Lourdes Padayhag and Southern Mindanao Institute ([SMI,] now Southern Mindanao Colleges) entered into an Agreement Referring to Real Property conveying the possession of these lots to SMI in consideration of 30 shares of stock of SMI. When x x x [SMC] succeeded x x x SMI, x x x Lourdes Padayhag wanted to return the shares of stock issued to them so that the Padayhags could get back the land subject of the contract.</p> <p> As for [the Sta. Lucia Lots (Lot Nos. 2102 and 2104)], the Padayhags [claim] that since 1927 they occupied 300 square meters of Lot [No.] 2102 and 412 square meters of Lot [No.] 2104. However, when a cadastral survey was made on [L]ot [N]os. 2102 and 2104, they were not able to object as they were not informed of such survey. They protested with the Bureau of Lands asserting that there was error in the survey of the boundaries.</p> <p> On the other hand, x x x SMC argued that it bought [L]ot [N]o. 2102 from Mangacop Ampato evidenced by a Deed of Conveyance of Real Estate executed on January 22, 1960; and [L]ot [N]o. 2104 from Adriano Arang evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale executed on January 31, 1964. Likewise, the said conveyance was reflected in the Status Book of the Bureau of Lands. </p> <p> On May 30, 2006, the RTC, sitting as Land Registration Court, rendered a Decision in favor of SMC, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> "WHEREFORE, this court sitting as cadastral court, adjudicates, as it hereby adjudicate and award Lot [N]os. 2102 [and] 2104, situated at comers Jamisola and Aquino Streets, Santa Lucia District, Pagadian City, and Lot [N]os. 2883, 2888, 2921 and 2922, all situated at Pagadian City, together with all the improvements thereon, to [claimant Southern Mindanao Colleges, thru its President, with principal office at Pagadian City. </p> <p>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On July 19, 2006, the Padayhags filed a motion for reconsideration which was granted in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated December 27, 2007, the dispositive portion of which is quoted [below:]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p> <blockquote> <p> "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered granting the Motion for Reconsideration of the [c]laimant Heirs of Lourdes Padayhag and </p> <p> 1.

The OSG argued that the CA did not err in setting aside the May 30, 2006 Decision and December 27, 2007 Resolution of the RTC for having been rendered without jurisdiction and pointed to the lack of publication in the Official Gazette of the notice of the initial hearing as required by Act No. (Act) 2259, the Cadastral Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The OSG cited as additional ground the deprivation of the State of its day in court because the OSG was allegedly not furnished with copies of the court orders, notices and decisions in the cadastral case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> The Padayhags filed a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated May 16, 2013.

Thus, it was erroneous for the CA to have required an additional publication of the said notice in a newspaper of general circulation. Such requirement was imposed only with the passage of PD 1529.</p><p> As proof of the publication in two successive issues of the Official Gazette of the Notice of Initial Hearing for Cadastral Case No. N-17, LRC Cadastral Record No. N-468, the Padayhags submitted to the Court microfilm print-outs of the issues of the Official Gazette on October 24 and 31, 1966, Volume 62, Number 43, pages 8044 to 8047, and Number 44, pages 8312 to 8315 certified by the University of the Philippines Library, Media Service Section, Diliman, Quezon City. Adriano Arang, Mangacap Ampato, and Federico Padayhag, Jr. appear in the said issues among the many claimants of the 1,409 lots with a combined area of 236,6925 hectares situated in the then Municipality of Pagadian, Province of Zamboanga del Sur and designated as Pagadian Public Lands Subdivision Pis-119, Case 1. Mangacap Ampato or "Mangacop Ampato" and Adriano Arang are allegedly predecessors-in-interest of SMC. The case in the RTC is docketed as "CADASTRAL CASE NO. N-17 LRC CAD. REC. NO.

No. N-468 does not only cover the six lots in dispute in this case, but around 1,409 lots, the copies of the issues of the Official Gazette where the Notice of the Order for Initial Hearing was published could have been included in the records of the cadastral proceedings of the other lots included therein. Thus, it was imprudent for the CA to rule that the Decision rendered by the RTC is void<em> ab initio</em> for having been rendered without jurisdiction. The repercussion of such pronouncement by the CA is far-reaching as it would cast doubt on the validity of the cadastral proceedings of the 1,409 lots in the then Municipality of Pagadian. At the very least, the CA should have required the parties to present proof of the publication of the Order for Initial Hearing in the pertinent issues of the Official Gazette. </p><p> In <em>Republic v. CA</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court noted that anent the publication requirement in reconstitution proceedings under Section 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> RA 26, mere submission of the subject Official Gazette issues would evidence only the first element â€” publication in two consecutive issues of the Official Gazette, and what must be proved is not the content of the Order published in the Official Gazette but the fact of two-time publication in successive issues at least 30 days before the hearing date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The Court further stated therein that it has consistently accepted the probative value of certifications of the Director of the National Printing Office in reconstitution cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court even quoted therein the lower court's observation that the Official Gazette is an official publication of the government and consequently, the Court can take judicial notice of its contents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> In this case, no certification from the Director of the National Printing Office was presented. The certification alone without the copy of the Notice of Initial Hearing may not suffice. There is a need to verify the contents of the said Notice to ensure that the subject properties (6 lots) and parties/claimants are covered thereby. The Notice of Initial Hearing was not only for subject properties and parties/claimants, but for 1,409 lots and numerous claimants. If the Notice of Initial Hearing pertained to a specific registered property, as in the case of the reconstitution of a title, then a certification of publication from the Director of the National Printing Office in this wise would suffice: </p><blockquote> <p> Order relative to LRC No. F-5 04-84 In Re: Petition for Judicial Reconstitution of the Burned/Destroyed Original Copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-304198, SPS. FERNANDO DAYAO and REMEDIOS NICODEMUS, xxx was published in the Official Gazette, to wit:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="center">VOLUME</div></td> <td><div align="center">NUMBER</div></td> <td><div align="center">PAGES</div></td> <td><div align="center">DATE OF ISSUE </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">85</div></td> <td><div align="center">24</div></td> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">June 12, 1989 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">25</div></td> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">June 19, 1989 </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p> June 19, 1989 issue was released for publication on June 28, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It will be recalled that the Official Gazette was created by decree of Act 453, "An Act providing for the publication by the Insular Government of an Official Gazette, under the general direction of the Department of Public Instruction," which was enacted by the Philippine Commission on September 2, 1902, by authority of the United States of America. Vol. 1, No. 1 of the Official Gazette came out on September 10, 1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In March 5, 1903, Act 664 amended Act 453 to provide for publication of the Official Gazette weekly in two parts, one part in English and the other in Spanish, with each part issued separately and containing, among others, all legislative Acts and resolutions of a public nature of the Insular Legislature, all executive orders, such as decisions of the Supreme Court, the Court of Customs Appeals, and the Court of Land Registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Subsequently, Commonwealth Act No. 638, "An Act to provide for the uniform publication and distribution of the Official Gazette," was passed by the Third Session of the Second National Assembly on May 22, 1941 and subsequently approved by President Manuel L. Quezon on June 10, 1941.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The Administrative Code of 1987 requires publication of laws in the Official Gazette to take effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> Given that the Official Gazette is the official publication of the government, the Court can take judicial notice thereof pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 129, Rules of Court, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 2.<em> Judicial notice, when discretionary.</em> â€” A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions. </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, the Court takes judicial notice of the publication of the Notice of Initial Hearing for Cadastral Case No. N-17, LRC Cadastral Record No. N-468 in the issues of the Official Gazette on October 24 and 31, 1966, Volume 62, Number 43, pages 8044 to 8047, and Number 44, pages 8312 to 8315. </p><p> As to the alleged failure by the RTC to notify the OSG of the cadastral proceedings and the orders therein which purportedly deprived the State of due process and would render the RTC Decision and Resolution void, the Court finds it hard to reconcile the position taken by the OSG in this case with the nature of cadastral proceedings. </p><p> Sections 1 and 5 of the Cadastral Act (Act 2259) provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 1. When, in the opinion of the Governor-General (now the President), the public interests require that the title to any lands be settled and adjudicated, he may to this end order the Director of Lands to make a survey and plan thereof. </p> <p>The Director of Lands shall, thereupon, give notice to persons claiming an interest in the lands, and to the general public, of the day on which such survey will begin, giving as full and accurate description as possible of the lands to be surveyed. Such notice shall be published in two successive issues of the Official Gazette, and a copy of the notice in the English and Spanish languages shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the chief municipal building of the municipality, township or settlement in which the lands, or any portion thereof, are situated. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to the president of such municipality, township, or settlement, and to the provincial board. </p> <p>x x x x </p> <p>SECTION 5. When the lands have been surveyed and platted, the Director of Lands represented by the Attorney-General (now Solicitor General), shall institute registration proceedings, by petition against the holders, claimants, possessors, or occupants of such lands or any part thereof, stating in substance that the public interests require that the titles to such lands be settled and adjudicated, and praying that such titles be so settled and adjudicated. </p> <p>x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> Evidently, the herein cadastral proceedings were supposed to have been instituted by the then Director of Lands represented by the Solicitor General. For the OSG to now deny that it had no involvement in or that it had not been notified of the proceedings is not in keeping with the nature of cadastral proceedings. The Court is not prepared to nullify the cadastral proceedings involving the then municipality of Pagadian without due process being accorded to all the claimants involved therein and without the OSG going thoroughly over the records of the entire cadastral proceedings to verify whether it participated therein. It must be noted that in these petitions, the RTC Decision was finally rendered on May 30, 2006 after 40 years from June 2, 1966, the date of the Notice of Initial Hearing. To summarily nullify the cadastral proceedings at this juncture would be unjust. Suffice it say that for purposes of these cases, the Court is relying on the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed pursuant to Section 3(m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court. </p><p> Regarding the third and fourth issues, these involve questions of fact and the CA should be given the opportunity to rule on them as the reviewer of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In reviews on <em>certiorari</em>, the Court, not being a trier of facts, addresses only questions of law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and since the CA has not resolved the cases on the merits, remand to the CA is in order. The consolidated cases are being remanded to the CA to enable the CA to rule on the factual issues of the consolidated cases. </p><p> As to the fifth and last issue, both the Padayhags and the OSG are correct that SMC availed of the wrong remedy. A petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>before the Supreme Court under Rule 45 is the proper remedy of a party desiring to appeal by <em>certiorari</em> a judgment, final order or resolution of the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p>Also, SMC is not justified to avail itself of a Rule 65 <em>certiorari</em> petition after its earlier attempt to avail of a Rule 45 <em>certiorari</em> petition had failed. SMC, prior to the filing of the SMC Petition, attempted to comply with a Rule 45 <em>certiorari</em> petition when on February 5, 2013, it filed an "Urgent Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court" in UDK 14834.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> However, in its Resolution dated August 12, 2013, the Court resolved to deny SMC's motion for extension for lack of payment of docket fees pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, Rule 45 in relation to Section 5(c), Rule 56 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thereafter, an Entry of Judgment was issued certifying that the said Resolution had become final and executory on November 8, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p>Given that SMC resorted to successive Rule 45 and Rule 65 <em>certiorari</em> petitions to question the CA Decision and Resolution and that the Rule 45 <em>certiorari</em> petition had already been denied, the denial of the SMC Petition is in order because<em> certiorari </em>is not and cannot be made a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is available but was lost through fault or negligence as in this case where the appeal was lost due to non-payment of docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><p>The denial of the SMC Petition is, however, of no moment since the instant cases are being remanded to the CA and the CA will have to pass upon the respective claims of the Padayhags and SMC on the lots in question in the resolution of the appeals before the CA on the merits. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition in G.R.
