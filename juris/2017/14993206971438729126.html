Under the relevant contract: Compensability of the illness or death of [a] seaman need not depend on whether the illness was total or partial permanent disability. It is sufficient that the illness occurred during the effectivity of the employment contract.<br><br>Even assuming that the ailment was contracted prior to employment, this would not deprive the seaman of compensation benefits. For what matters is that his work had contribute[d], even in a small degree, to the development of the disease and in bringing about his Intra-abdominal organs which requires aid and attendance that will unable [sic] workers to seek gainful employment.<br></blockquote>Due to his medical condition[,] he is permanently unfit for further sea service in any capacity. Such injury/illnesses are work[-]related since exposed to toxic and hazardous materials.

Hence, he could not have been advised to pursue further treatment in the Philippines since his operation was only a minor one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Additionally, there was nothing in Madridejos' Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> or Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that he complained of any pain, complication, or discomfort after his operation, indicating that "everything went well."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Similarly, he never showed any ship record regarding his alleged accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Therefore, the National Labor Relations Commission concluded that Madridejos' claim was only an afterthought and reasoned that:<br><blockquote>Well then, knowing fully [sic] well that he was repatriated on July 6, 2010 because his service contract had already been terminated, why then as he alleged would he go to his local agency for a medical referral to their company doctor? He said that he was denied. But of course; in the first place <b><i>he was not their employee anymore, but more importantly he was not even sick as he had been working quite well the past several months.

It is not really difficult to see, however that Madridejos' claim of being sick is an afterthought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The National Labor Relations Commission ruled further that Madridejos' cyst was not work-related since it was "simply a slow-growing pea-size[d] sac growth under the skin" that grew as a consequence of infection and caused "clogging of sebaceous glands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> "It can develop in any part of the body, and at times it just simply disappears."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The dispositive portion of the National Labor Relations Commission's decision provided:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, complainant Madridejos' appeal is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit, while that of respondents' is granted, the assailed decision is reversed and set aside, and the complaint herein for disability benefits is likewise DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>On April 30, 2012, the National Labor Relations Commission's Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> denied Madridejos' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On July 9, 2012, Madridejos filed a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> before the Court of Appeals claiming that the National Labor Relations Commission committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by disregarding the pertinent provisions of the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency Employment Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Moreover, he argued that the National Labor Relations Commission gave more weight to NYK-FIL's "purely gratuitous and convoluted assertions" rather than the facts already proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Madridejos' petition and ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission had judiciously denied Madridejos' claim for disability benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that sometime in Madridejos' first or second month of employment, he suffered from a severe stomach ache while on board the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> All the doctors involved agreed that his severe stomach ache was due to a "Sebaceous Cyst to the right Umbilicus," which was already removed on April 29, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Hence, his repatriation in July 2010 was not due to his medical condition but due to the expiration of his contract as a probationary employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Similarly, the Court of Appeals also confirmed National Labor Relations Commission's finding that Madridejos' cyst was not work-related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>On November 6, 2012, the Court of Appeals' Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> denied Madridejos' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> was filed before this Court.<br><br>Madridejos seeks compensation for his sebaceous cyst as an occupational disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> He states that he has already presented substantial evidence to prove his claim that there was a "reasonable connection between his work and the cause of his illness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He holds that several medical records and reports have shown that his cyst was aggravated by the conditions of his work as a seaman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>He asserts that his cyst has "impaired his [a]bdomen and upper extremities [causing his] internal organs [to] malfunction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> He insists that he "suffer[ed] [from] a physical injury in his [u]pper [e]xtremities . . .

It is nothing more serious tha[n] excision or extraction of boil or "<i>pigsa</i>" in the vernacular. The only difference of the sebaceous cyst from boil, is that in the former, what is being extracted is sebum/keratin or "<i>sebo</i>" in the vernacular and in the latter is pus or "<i>nana</i>" in the vernacular. This explains why only local anesthesia is necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote>NYK-FIL insists that it has terminated Madridejos' services pursuant to Item 7 of his Employment Agreement and not because of his illness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> "[H]e was repatriated . . . three (3) months after his cyst was removed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> His silence on the events that transpired between his operation and repatriation confirms NYK-FIL's claim that "[Madridejos] was not repatriated for medical reason[s] but rather due to a valid termination of...
