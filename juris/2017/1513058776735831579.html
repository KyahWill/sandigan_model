				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The custody and handling of funds and other assets by Judiciary officers and employees entrusted therewith are both a responsibility and an accountability that must be faithfully discharged. Any act or omission in relation thereto may be condignly sanctioned according to the attendant circumstances. Where the failure to deposit daily collections is committed by a clerk of court previously sanctioned for the same omission, the sanction is dismissal from the service and forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except earned leave credits), with prejudice to re-employment in the Government, including government-owned and government-controlled corporations. <p align="center"> <b>The Case</b> </p><p> This administrative case stemmed from the Cash Examination Report dated June 27, 2005 submitted by Marry Rose D.

She insisted that she had refrained from having cash on hand as early as August 1, 2002; that she had only prepared deposit slips and withdrawal slips per the instruction of Egipto; and that, to the best of her knowledge, her cash reports had accurately and correctly represented the cash position of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the MTCC of Pagadian City.</p> <p> In its June 5, 2006 resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Court referred the comments and explanations of Egipto and Yorpo to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.</p> <p> In its report dated November 6, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the OCA observed that Egipto, being an accountable officer, deserved to be administratively sanctioned for his failure to remit his collections on time; that such failure to remit constituted gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service; and that Yorpo's explanation was satisfactory and warranted her being relieved from administrative sanction. Accordingly, the OCA recommended therein as follows: </p> <ol><li> Respondent Crispin C. Egipto, Jr., Clerk of Court IV, MTCC, Pagadian City <strong>BE DISMISSED</strong> from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits, if any; <br><br></li><li>Respondent Crispin C.

Their personal accountability is always enforceable. Specifically, any shortages in the amounts remitted and any delays incurred in the actual remittance of collections shall constitute gross neglect of duty for which the clerks of court concerned shall be held administratively liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> Egipto admitted his failure to remit his collections on time on account of his personal problems (that is, the killing of his son and the hospitalization of his daughter). Even if he did not categorically state having misappropriated or converted the funds for his personal benefit, he was still worthy of stem reprobation. Personal problems should never justify the incurring of shortages and the delay in remitting cash collections for the Judiciary. In this case, Egipto's administrative sin was aggravated by the fact that this charge was not his first offense. According to the personnel records of the Court, he had been previously reprimanded for his failure to observe SC Circular No. 50-95 by which he was bound to deposit fiduciary collections with the Land Bank of the Philippines within 24 hours from receipt thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> We note that in relation to the previous offense, Egipto and Yorpo had been directed to deposit the amount of P15,290.95 representing the interest that the Court failed to earn because of the delay in depositing their collections. As such, even if he had meanwhile restituted the shortages of P98,652.81 subject of this charge, his belated remittance similarly deprived the Court of earnings in the form of interest that such amount would have earned if deposited in the bank as directed in SC Circular No. 50-95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> Relevant portions of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000, dated June 15, 2000, are quoted as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <p> II.

(bold underscoring supplied for emphasis) </p> <p> xxxx</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 clearly directed Egipto to immediately deposit all fiduciary collections upon receipt thereof in an authorized government depository bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Egipto's failure to promptly remit his fiduciary collections was in flagrant violation of the directive. <br></p><p>For the delay in the remittance of his cash collections, therefore, Egipto was guilty of dishonesty and grave misconduct, and is punished with dismissal pursuant to the <em>Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</em>. </p><p>Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer. The misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence. As distinguished from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in a charge of grave misconduct. Corruption, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his station or character to procure some benefit for himself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others. An act need not be tantamount to a crime for it to be considered as grave misconduct as in fact, crimes involving moral turpitude are treated as a separate ground for dismissal under the <em>Administrative Code</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p>Dishonesty is defined as intentionally making a false statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or promotion. Dishonesty, like bad faith, is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention. In ascertaining the intention of a person accused of dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> Both gross misconduct and dishonesty are grave offenses that are punishable by dismissal even for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p>In addition, Egipto is subject to the following administrative disabilities, namely: (<i>a</i>) cancellation of any civil service eligibility; (<i>b</i>) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; (<i>c</i>) perpetual disqualification from re-employment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and government -controlled corporation or government financial institution; and (d) bar from taking the civil service examinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Court<strong> FINDS</strong> and<strong> DECLARES</strong> respondent<strong> CRISPIN C.
