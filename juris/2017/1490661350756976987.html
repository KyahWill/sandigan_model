The latter incident was seen by Judge Arabani who happened to be behind Rahim, and scolded them. However, Rahim immediately erased the time and punched his bundy card again.

Barraquias (Judge Barraquias), made the following findings and recommendations:<br><br>With respect to <b>A.M. No. SCC-10-14-P,</b> Judge Barraquias found that there was an irregularity in the punching of the bundy card of Rahim by Abduraji, and Rahim's silence and inaction despite his awareness thereof made him equally responsible as he is deemed to have consented to the commission of the improper act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This is bolstered by the fact that Abduraji: <i>(a)</i> admitted having punched the bundy card of Rahim sometime in the first week of June 2009 (first incident) but explained that he did the same by mistake, thinking that it was his own bundy card, and on June 16, 2009 (second incident), thinking that Rahim was already at the door of the office; and <i>(b)</i> averred that he could not recall whether or not he punched the bundy card of Rahim on June 30, 2009 (third incident; subject incidents).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Judge Barraquias then concluded that their collaboration <i>(1)</i> is a clear violation of <i>(a)</i> Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 7-2003 on the accomplishment/submission of Certificates of Service and Daily Time Records, and <i>(b)</i> Section 4, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Civil Service Rules); and <i>(2)</i> is an act of dishonesty. Noting, however, that it is the first offense of Abduraji and Rahim, he recommended that they be suspended for six (6) months without pay with a stem warning that similar acts would be dealt with more severely.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On the charge of insubordination and conduct unbecoming of court employees, however, Judge Barraquias found no deliberate intent on the part of Abduraji and Rahim to defy the authority of Judge Arabani and, thus, deemed it proper to recommend that they be reprimanded and given a stem warning for their non-compliance with the latter's memorandum requiring them to explain the <i>subject incidents </i>in writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Anent <b>A.M.

Consequently, he recommended that Rodrigo be meted a two (2) month forfeiture of salary (February and March 2010; <i> sic) </i> with a stem warning that any similar incident would be dealt with more severely. However, he found to be unsubstantiated the allegations that Rodrigo was constantly not at his assigned table, roams in and out of the office, and is not attending to his work. He further held that Rodrigo's failure to indicate the specific dates of his absence was a mere formal defect which can be remedied by specifying the dates of his leave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>As regards <b>A.M.

Accordingly, Judge Barraquias refused to pass upon the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Judge Barraquias recommended the dropping of the sexual harassment charge filed by Sheldalyn against Judge Arabani for insufficiency of evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> noting that other than her own account and the parties to this case who have declared their ill-feelings against Judge Arabani, Sheldalyn has no other witness to corroborate the said charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> On the contrary, the charge was disputed by the testimony of Mrs. Maldisa which failed to show any single act of sexual harassment committed by Judge Arabani on Sheldalyn.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Nonetheless, Judge Barraquias found it an established fact that Judge Arabani made a drawing of a vagina and a penis in front of his staff, and recommended that the latter <i>(a)</i> be reprimanded therefor with a stem warning that any similar distasteful acts would be dealt with more severely; and <i> (b) </i> undergo mandatory gender sensitivity seminar so that he may be apprised of the value of giving due respect to the opposite sex.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated June 23, 2015, the Court referred Judge Barraquias' Joint Investigation, Report and Recommendation dated April 8, 2013 to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.<br><br><center><b>The OCA's Evaluation, Report and Recommendation</b></center><br><br>In a Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> dated August 25, 2016, the OCA adopted the findings<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> contained in Judge Barraquias' Joint Investigation, Report and Recommendation dated April 8, 2013, and recommended:<br><br>1. in <b>A.M.

In <b>A.M. No. SCC-10-14-P:</b><br><br>a. <u>on the charge of dishonesty against Abduraji and Rahim</u>:<br><br>Dishonesty is defined as the "disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness, lack of integrity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As correctly ruled by the OCA, Abduraji and Rahim are guilty of dishonesty by committing irregularities in the punching of Rahim's bundy card/DTR on three (3) occasions, <i>i.e., </i>on the subject incidents. <b>The punching of a court employee's DTR is a personal act of the holder which cannot and should not be delegated to anyone else.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, every court employee has the duty to truthfully and accurately indicate the time of his arrival at and departure from the office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, case law holds that <b>falsification of DTRs is an act of dishonesty</b> and is reflective of respondent's fitness to continue in office and of the level of discipline and morale in the service,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> rendering him administratively liable in accordance with Section 4,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Rule XVII of the Civil Service Rules.<br><br>Under Section 22, Rule XIV of the Civil Service Rules, falsification of official documents (such as DTRs) and dishonesty are both grave offenses for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even for first time offenders. Nonetheless, while it is the Court's duty to sternly wield a corrective hand to discipline its errant employees and to weed out those who are undesirable, it also has the discretion to temper the harshness of its judgment with mercy, taking in mind that the objective for discipline is not their punishment, but the improvement of the public service, and the preservation of the public's faith and confidence in the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In this relation, Section 48,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service grants the disciplining authority the discretion to consider mitigating circumstances in the imposition of the proper penalty. Among the circumstances jurisprudentially held as mitigating include, among others, the erring individual's admission of guilt, remorse, high performance rating, and the fact that the infraction complained of is his/her first offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Thus, in several cases involving first time offenders,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> as Abduraji and Rahim in this case, the Court has reduced the imposable penalty of dismissal to suspension of six (6) months without pay. Following judicial precedents, the Court adopts the penalty recommended by the OCA, and accordingly suspends Abduraji and Rahim for a period of six (6) months without pay.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">b.</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><u>On the charge of insubordination and conduct unbecoming a court employee against Abduraji and Rahim:</u></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>Insubordination is defined as a refusal to obey some order, which a superior officer is entitled to give and have obeyed, and imports a <b>willful or intentional disregard</b> of the lawful and reasonable instructions of the Judge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court finds to be likewise well-taken the OCA's recommendation for the dropping of the said charges against Abduraji and Rahim considering the perceived absence of intent on their part to deliberately defy Judge Arabani's authority as the head of office. However, they should be reprimanded for their failure to comply with Judge Arabani's memorandum requiring them to explain the subject incidents in writing, which constitutes a violation of reasonable office rules and regulations, a light offense punishable with reprimand for the first offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>2. in <b>A.M. No. SCC-10-15-P:</b><br><br>The OCA correctly found Rodrigo to have violated reasonable office rules and regulations when he refused to leave his bundy card or DTR on the designated rack despite orders from Judge Arabani.

In fact, the substantial evidence on record showed that Sheldalyn became afraid of Judge Arabani<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> and started to avoid him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>The distasteful act by Judge Arabani of making a drawing of a vagina and a penis, and thereafter showing it to an employee of the court of which he is an officer constitutes sexual harassment. It is an act that constitutes a physical behavior of a sexual nature; a gesture with lewd insinuation. To the Court's mind, Judge Arabani deliberately utilized this form of expression, <i>i.e.,</i> drawing, to maliciously convey to Sheldalyn his sexual desires over her; hence, his conduct cannot be classified as a mere display of sexually offensive pictures, materials or graffiti under Section 53 (C) (4), Rule X of CSC Resolution No. 01-0940, such as one who is caught watching or reading pornographic materials. Rather, Judge Arabani's behavior should be classified as an analogous case (Section 53 [B] [5]) of verbal abuse with sexual overtones under Section 53 (B) (4) of the same issuance, which thus, qualifies the same as a less grave offense. Section 56 (B), Rule XI of CSC Resolution No. 01-0940 states the penalties for less grave offenses:<br><br><blockquote><b>B. For less grave offenses:<br>1st offense </b><b>– Fine or suspension of not less than thirty (30) days and not exceeding six (6) months</b><br>2<sup>nd</sup> offense – Dismissal</blockquote><br><br>Accordingly, as it appears that this is Judge Arabani's first infraction of this kind, the Court imposes upon him the penalty of suspension for a period of six (6) months.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>in <b>A.M.
