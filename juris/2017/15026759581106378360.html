CR No. 33588, which affirmed his conviction for violation of Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In an Information filed before the Regional Trial Court of San Pablo City, Laguna,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Veridiano was charged with the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. The Information read:<br><blockquote>That on or about January 15, 2008, in the Municipality of Nagcarlan, Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being permitted or authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody one (1) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 2.72 grams of dried marijuana leaves, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 9, 2008, Veridiano was arraigned. He pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. Trial on the merits ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>During trial, the prosecution presented PO1 Guillermo Cabello (PO1 Cabello) and PO1 Daniel Solano (PO1 Solano) to testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>According to the prosecution, at about 7:20 a.m. of January 15, 2008, a concerned citizen called a certain PO3 Esteves, police radio operator of the Nagcarlan Police Station, informing him that a certain alias "Baho," who was later identified as Veridiano, was on the way to San Pablo City to obtain illegal drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>PO3 Esteves immediately relayed the information to PO1 Cabello and PO2 Alvin Vergara (PO2 Vergara) who were both on duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Chief of Police June Urquia instructed PO1 Cabello and PO2 Vergara to set up a checkpoint at Barangay Taytay, Nagcarlan, Laguna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The police officers at the checkpoint personally knew Veridiano.

He did not act in any manner that would give the police officers reasonable ground to believe that he had just committed a crime or that he was committing a crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Petitioner also asserts that reliable information is insufficient to constitute probable cause that would support a valid warrantless arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Since his arrest was illegal, petitioner argues that "the accompanying [warrantless] search was likewise illegal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Hence, under Article III, Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> in relation to Article III, Section 3(2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the Constitution, the seized tea bag containing marijuana is "inadmissible in evidence [for] being the fruit of a poisonous tree."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, assuming that the seized tea bag containing marijuana is admissible in evidence, petitioner contends that the prosecution failed to preserve its integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The apprehending team did not strictly comply with the rule on chain of custody under Section 21 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated June 13, 2012, this Court required respondent to file a comment on the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In the Manifestation and Motion dated August 1, 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> respondent stated that it would no longer file a comment.<br><br>The following issues are for this Court's resolution:<br><br>First, whether there was a valid warrantless arrest;<br><br>Second, whether there was a valid warrantless search against petitioner; and<br><br>Lastly, whether there is enough evidence to sustain petitioner's conviction for illegal possession of dangerous drugs.<br><br>The Petition is granted.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The invalidity of an arrest leads to several consequences among which are: (a) the failure to acquire jurisdiction over the person of an accused; (b) criminal liability of law enforcers for illegal arrest; and (c) any search incident to the arrest becomes invalid thus rendering the evidence acquired as constitutionally inadmissible.<br><br>Lack of jurisdiction over the person of an accused as a result of an invalid arrest must be raised through a motion to quash before an accused enters his or her plea. Otherwise, the objection is deemed waived and an accused is "estopped from questioning the legality of his [or her] arrest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The voluntary submission of an accused to the jurisdiction of the court and his or her active participation during trial cures any defect or irregularity that may have attended an arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The reason for this rule is that "the legality of an arrest affects only the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, failure to timely object to the illegality of an arrest does not preclude an accused from questioning the admissibility of evidence seized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The inadmissibility of the evidence is not affected when an accused fails to question the court's jurisdiction over his or her person in a timely manner. Jurisdiction over the person of an accused and the constitutional inadmissibility of evidence are separate and mutually exclusive consequences of an illegal arrest.<br><br>As a component of the right to privacy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the fundamental right against unlawful searches and seizures is guaranteed by no less than the Constitution. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>To underscore the importance of an individual's right against unlawful searches and seizures, Article III, Section 3(2) of the Constitution considers any evidence obtained in violation of this right as inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The Constitutional guarantee does not prohibit all forms of searches and seizures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It is only directed against those that are unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Conversely, reasonable searches and seizures fall outside the scope of the prohibition and are not forbidden.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Aruta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this Court explained that the language of the Constitution implies that "searches and seizures are normally unreasonable unless authorized by a validly issued search warrant or warrant of arrest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The requirements of a valid search warrant are laid down in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and reiterated in Rule 126, Section 4 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>However, <i>People v. Cogaed</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> clarified that there are exceptional circumstances "when searches are reasonable even when warrantless."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The following are recognized instances of permissible warrantless searches laid down in jurisprudence: (1) a "warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (2) search of "evidence in 'plain view,'" (3) "search of a moving vehicle," (4) "consented warrantless search[es]," (5) "customs search," (6) "stop and frisk," and (7) "exigent and emergency circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>There is no hard and fast rule in determining when a search and seizure is reasonable. In any given situation, "[w]hat constitutes a reasonable . . . search . . . is purely a judicial question," the resolution of which depends upon the unique and distinct factual circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This may involve an inquiry into "the purpose of the search or seizure, the presence or absence of probable cause, the manner in which the search and seizure was made, the place or thing searched, and the character of the articles procured."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Pertinent to the resolution of this case is the determination of whether the warrantless search was incidental to a lawful arrest. The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> of having marijuana in his possession making the warrantless search lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>This Court disagrees. Petitioner's warrantless arrest was unlawful.<br><br>A search incidental to a lawful arrest requires that there must first be a lawful arrest before a search is made. Otherwise stated, a lawful arrest must precede the search; "the process cannot be reversed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> For there to be a lawful arrest, law enforcers must be armed with a valid warrant. Nevertheless, an arrest may also be effected without a warrant.<br><br>There are three (3) grounds that will justify a warrantless arrest. Rule 113, Section 5 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Arrest Without Warrant; When Lawful</i>. — A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><blockquote>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.<br></blockquote></blockquote>The first kind of warrantless arrest is known as an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest. The validity of this warrantless arrest requires compliance with the overt act test<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> as explained in <i>Cogaed</i>:<br><blockquote>[F]or a warrantless arrest of <i>in flagrante delicto</i> to be affected, "two elements must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he [or she] has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Failure to comply with the overt act test renders an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest constitutionally infirm. In <i>Cogaed</i>, the warrantless arrest was invalidated as an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest because the accused did not exhibit an overt act within the view of the police officers suggesting that he was in possession of illegal drugs at the time he was apprehended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The warrantless search in <i>People v. Racho</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> was also considered unlawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The police officers received information that a man was in possession of illegal drugs and was on board a Genesis bus bound for Baler, Aurora. The informant added that the man was "wearing a red and white striped [t]-shirt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The police officers waited for the bus along the national highway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> When the bus arrived, Jack Racho (Racho) disembarked and waited along the highway for a tricycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Suddenly, the police officers approached him and invited him to the police station since he was suspected of having shabu in his possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> As Racho pulled out his hands from his pocket, a white envelope fell yielding a sachet of shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In holding that the warrantless search was invalid, this Court observed that Racho was not "committing a crime in the presence of the police officers" at the time he was apprehended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Moreover, Racho's arrest was solely based on a tip.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Although there are cases stating that reliable information is sufficient to justify a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest, they were covered under the other exceptions to the rule on warrantless searches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Rules of Court pertains to a hot pursuit arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The rule requires that an offense has just been committed. It connotes "immediacy in point of time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> That a crime was in fact committed does not automatically bring the case under this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> An arrest under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Rules of Court entails a time element from the moment the crime is committed up to the point of arrest.<br><br>Law enforcers need not personally witness the commission of a crime. However, they must have personal knowledge of facts and circumstances indicating that the person sought to be arrested committed it.<br><br><i>People v. Gerente</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> illustrates a valid arrest under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Rules of Court. In <i>Gerente</i>, the accused was convicted for murder and for violation of Republic Act No. 6425.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> He assailed the admissibility of dried marijuana leaves as evidence on the ground that they were allegedly seized from him pursuant to a warrantless arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> On appeal, the accused's conviction was affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> This Court ruled that the warrantless arrest was justified under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Rules of Court. The police officers had personal knowledge of facts and circumstances indicating that the accused killed the victim:<br><blockquote><i>The policemen arrested Gerente only some three (3) hours after Gerente and his companions had killed Blace.</i> They saw Blace dead in the hospital and when they inspected the scene of the crime, they found the instruments of death: a piece of wood and a concrete hollow block which the killers had used to bludgeon him to death. The eye-witness, Edna Edwina Reyes, reported the happening to the policemen and pinpointed her neighbor, Gerente, as one of the killers. <i>Under those circumstances, since the policemen had personal knowledge of the violent death of Blace and of facts indicating that Gerente and two others had killed him, they could lawfully arrest Gerente without a warrant.</i> If they had postponed his arrest until they could obtain a warrant, he would have fled the law as his two companions did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The requirement that law enforcers must have personal knowledge of facts surrounding the commission of an offense was underscored in <i>In Re Salibo v. Warden</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br><i>In Re Salibo</i> involved a petition for habeas corpus. The police officers suspected Datukan Salibo (Salibo) as one (1) of the accused in the Maguindano Massacre.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Salibo presented himself before the authorities to clear his name. Despite his explanation, Salibo was apprehended and detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> In granting the petition, this Court pointed out that Salibo was not restrained under a lawful court process or order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Furthermore, he was not arrested pursuant to a valid warrantless arrest:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><blockquote>It is undisputed that petitioner Salibo presented himself before the Datu Hofer Police Station to clear his name and to prove that he is not the accused Butukan S. Malang. When petitioner Salibo was in the presence of the police officers of Datu Hofer Police Station, he was neither committing nor attempting to commit an offense. <i>The police officers had no personal knowledge of any offense that he might have committed.</i> Petitioner Salibo was also not an escapee prisoner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, petitioner's arrest could not be justified as an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest under Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court. He was not committing a crime at the checkpoint. Petitioner was merely a passenger who did not exhibit any unusual conduct in the presence of the law enforcers that would incite suspicion. In effecting the warrantless arrest, the police officers relied solely on the tip they received. Reliable information alone is insufficient to support a warrantless arrest absent any overt act from the person to be arrested indicating that a crime has just been committed, was being committed, or is about to be committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>The warrantless arrest cannot likewise be justified under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. The law enforcers had no personal knowledge of any fact or circumstance indicating that petitioner had just committed an offense.<br><br>A hearsay tip by itself does not justify a warrantless arrest. Law enforcers must have personal knowledge of facts, based on their observation, that the person sought to be arrested has just committed a crime. This is what gives rise to probable cause that would justify a warrantless search under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The warrantless search cannot be justified under the reasonable suspicion requirement in "stop and frisk" searches.<br><br>A "stop and frisk" search is defined in <i>People v. Chua</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> as "the act of a police officer to stop a citizen on the street, interrogate him, and pat him for weapon(s) or contraband."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Thus, the allowable scope of a "stop and frisk" search is limited to a "protective search of outer clothing for weapons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Although a "stop and frisk" search is a necessary law enforcement measure specifically directed towards crime prevention, there is a need to safeguard the right of individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Law enforcers do not have unbridled discretion in conducting "stop and frisk" searches.

In all cases, such waivers are not to be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br></blockquote>The presence of a coercive environment negates the claim that petitioner consented to the warrantless search.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Another instance of a valid warrantless search is a search of a moving vehicle.

This holds especially true when the object of the search is a public vehicle where individuals have a reasonably reduced expectation of privacy. On the other hand, extensive searches are permissible only when they are founded upon probable cause. Any evidence obtained will be subject to the exclusionary principle under the Constitution.<br><br>That the object of a warrantless search is allegedly inside a moving vehicle does not justify an extensive search absent probable cause. Moreover, law enforcers cannot act solely on the basis of confidential or tipped information. A tip is still hearsay no matter how reliable it may be. It is not sufficient to constitute probable cause in the absence of any other circumstance that will arouse suspicion.<br><br>Although this Court has upheld warrantless searches of moving vehicles based on tipped information, there have been other circumstances that justified warrantless searches conducted by the authorities.<br><br>In <i>People v.

The checkpoint was set up to target the arrest of the accused.<br><br>There are different hybrids of reasonable warrantless searches. There are searches based on reasonable suspicion as in <i>Posadas v.
