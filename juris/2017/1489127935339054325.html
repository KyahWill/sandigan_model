				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For this Court's resolution is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioner Wesleyan University-Philippines <i>(WUP)</i> assailing the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 20, 2014 of the Court of Appeals <i>(CA)</i> which denied its petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>WUP is a non-stock, non-profit, non-sectarian educational corporation duly organized and existing under the Philippine laws on April 28, 1948.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent Atty. Guillenno T. Maglaya, Sr. <i>(Maglaya) </i>was appointed as a corporate member on January 1, 2004, and was elected as a member of the Board of Trustees <i>(Board) </i>on January 9, 2004 both for a period of five (5) years.

In the said notice, it was indicated that the new Board met, organized, and elected the new set of officers on April 20, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Manuel Palomo <i>(Palomo), </i>the new Chairman of the Board, informed Maglaya of the termination of his services and authority as the President of the University on April 27, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Maglaya and other fonner members of the Board <i>(Plaintiffs)</i> filed a Complaint for Injunction and Damages before the Regional Trial Court <i>(RTC)</i> of Cabanatuan City, Branch 28.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 19, 2009, the RTC dismissed the case declaring the same as a nuisance or harassment suit prohibited under Section 1(b),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rule 1 of the Interim Rules for Intra-Corporate Controversies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The RTC observed that it is clear from the by-laws of WUP that insofar as membership in the corporation is concerned, which can only be given by the College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church, it is a precondition to a seat in the WUP Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Consequently, the expiration of the terms of the plaintiffs, including Maglaya, as corporate members carried with it their termination as members of the Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Moreover, their continued stay in their office beyond their terms was only in hold-over capacities, which ceased when the Bishops appointed new members of the corporation and the Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The CA, in a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 15, 2011, affirmed the decision of the RTC, and dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by the plaintiffs for being the improper remedy. The CA held that their status as corporate members of WUP which expired on December 31, 2008 was undisputed. The CA agreed with the RTC that the plaintiffs had no legal standing to question the Bishops' alleged irregular appointment of the new members in their Complaint on May 18, 2009 as the termination of their membership in the corporation necessarily resulted in the conclusion of their positions as members of the Board pursuant to the WUP by-laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Maglaya filed on March 22, 2011 the present illegal dismissal case against WUP, Palomo, Bishop Lito C.

He was also entitled to other benefits such as: the use of university vehicles; the use of a post paid mobile cellular phone in his official transactions; the residence in the University Executive House located at Inday Street, Magsaysay Sur, Cabanatuan City, with free water, electricity, and services of a household helper; and receipt of 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, vacation leave pay, retirement pay, and shares in related learning experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On May 31, 2006, his basic salary was increased to P95,000.00 due to his additional duty in overseeing the operations of the WUP Cardiovascular and Medical Center.<br><br>Maglaya presented the following pieces of evidence: copies of his appointment as President, his Identification Card, the WUP Administration and Personnel Policy Manual which specified the retirement of the university president, and the check disbursement in his favor evidencing his salary, to substantiate his claim that he was a mere employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>WUP, on the other hand, asseverated that the dismissal or removal of Maglaya, being a corporate officer and not a regular employee, is a corporate act or intra-corporate controversy under the jurisdiction of the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> WUP also maintained that since Maglaya's appointment was not renewed, he ceased to be a member of the corporation and of the Board; thus, his term for presidency has also been terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, this Court, in a Resolution dated June 13, 2011, denied the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by Maglaya and the other former members of the Board for failure to show any reversible error in the decision of the CA. The same became final and executory on August 24, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated September 20, 2011, the Labor Arbiter <i>(LA)</i> ruled in favor of WUP. The LA held that the action between employers and employees where the employer-employee relationship is merely incidental is within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the regular courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Since he was appointed as President of the University by the Board, Maglaya was a corporate officer and not a mere employee. The instant case involves intra-corporate dispute which was definitely beyond the jurisdiction of the labor tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant complaint is hereby dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated April 25, 2012, the National Labor Relations Commission <i> (NLRC) </i> in NLRC-LAC No. 01-000470-12, reversed and set aside the Decision of the LA ruling that the illegal dismissal case falls within the jurisdiction of the labor tribunals. Since the reasons for his termination cited by WUP were not among the just causes provided under Article 282<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (now Article 297) of the Labor Code, Maglaya was illegally dismissed. The NLRC observed that the Board did not elect Maglaya, but merely appointed him. Maglaya was appointed for a fixed period of five (5) years from May 7, 2005 to May 6, 2010, while the period of his appointment as member of the corporation was five (5) years from January 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, declaring:<br><br><table  ="" width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="JUSTIFY">jurisdiction over this case by virtue of the employer-employee relation of the parties</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="JUSTIFY">the illegality of the dismissal of [respondent] by [petitioner]</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="JUSTIFY">[Petitioner] therefore [is] hereby ordered to pay [respondent]:</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td width="45%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">1. separation pay</div> </td> <td width="16%"> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td width="34%"> <div align="RIGHT">[P] 375,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">2. full backwages</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">1,252,462.50</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">3. retirement pay</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">500,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">4. moral damages</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">100,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">5. exemplary damages</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">50,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">6. 10% of the above as attorney's fees</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 227,746.25</u></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>TOTAL AWARDS</td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">-</div> </td> <td> <div align="RIGHT"><u>[P]2,505,208.75</u></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>based on the attached computation of this Commission's Computation Unit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Ruling in favor of Maglaya, the NLRC explicated that although the position of the President of the University is a corporate office, the manner of Maglaya's appointment, and his duties, salaries, and allowances point to his being an employee and subordinate.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[36]</sup></font> The control test is the most important indicator of the presence of employer-employee relationship. Such was present in the instant case as Maglaya had the duty to report to the Board, and it was the Board which terminated or dismissed him even before his term ends.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the NLRC denied the motion for reconsideration filed by WUP in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated February 11, 2013.<br><br>In a Resolution, the CA dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari </i>filed by WUP. The CA noted that the decision and resolution of the NLRC became final and executory on March 16, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> WUP's attempt to resurrect its lost remedy through filing the petition would not prosper since final and executory judgment becomes unalterable and may no longer be modified in any respect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Upon denial of his Motion for Reconsideration, WUP elevated the case before this Court raising the issue:<br><br><blockquote>The Court of Appeals committed an error of law when it summarily dismissed the special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>raising lack of jurisdiction of the NLRC filed by [WUP] where it was very clear that the NLRC had no jurisdiction over the case involving a corporate officer and where the nature of the controversy is an intra-corporate dispute.</blockquote><br><br>We find the instant petition impressed with merit.<br><br>WUP alleges that while the NLRC decision became final and executory on March 16, 2013, it did not mean that the said decision had become immutable and unalterable as the CA ruled. WUP maintains that the remedy of the aggrieved party against a final and executory decision of the NLRC is the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. As such, it was able to meet the conditions set forth in filing the said remedy before the CA.<br><br>Settled is the rule that while the decision of the NLRC becomes final and executory after the lapse of ten calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties under Article 223<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (now Article 229) of the Labor Code, the adverse party is not precluded from assailing it <i>via </i>Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>under Rule 65 before the CA and then to this Court <i>via </i>a Petition for Review under Rule 45.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This Court has explained and clarified the power of the CA to review NLRC decisions, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>The power of the Court of Appeals to review NLRC decisions <i>via</i> Rule 65 or Petition for <i>Certiorari </i> has been settled as early as in our decision in <i>St. Martin Funeral Home v. National Labor Relations Commission. </i> This Court held that the proper vehicle for such review was a Special Civil Action for <i>Certiorari </i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, and that this action should be filed in the Court of Appeals in strict observance of the doctrine of the hierarchy of courts. Moreover, it is already settled that under Section 9 of <i>Batas Pambansa </i><i> Blg. </i> 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7902[10] (An Act Expanding the Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, amending for the purpose of Section Nine of <i>Batas Pambansa Blg. </i> 129 as amended, known as the <i>Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), </i> the Court of Appeals — pursuant to the exercise of its original jurisdiction over Petitions for <i> Certiorari </i> - is specifically given the power to pass upon the evidence, if and when necessary, to resolve factual issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Consequently, the remedy of the aggrieved party is to <b>timely file a motion for reconsideration as a precondition for any further or subsequent remedy,</b> and then seasonably avail of the special civil action of <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65, for a period of sixty (60) days from notice of the decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Records reveal that WOP received the decision of the NLRC on May 12, 2012, and filed its motion for reconsideration on May 24, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> WUP received the Resolution dated February 11, 2013 denying its motion on March 12, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Thereafter, it filed its petition for <i>certiorari </i>before the CA on March 26, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We find that the application of the doctrine of immutability of judgment in the case at bar is misplaced. To reiterate, although the 10-day period for finality of the decision of the NLRC may already have lapsed as contemplated in the Labor Code, this Court may still take cognizance of the petition for <i>certiorari </i>on jurisdictional and due process considerations if filed within the reglementary period under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> From the abovementioned, WUP was able to discharge the necessary conditions in availing its remedy against the final and executory decision of the NLRC.<br><br>There is an underlying power of the courts to scrutinize the acts of such agencies on questions of law and jurisdiction even though no right of review is given by statute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Furthermore, the purpose of judicial review is to keep the administrative agency within its jurisdiction and protect the substantial rights of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Now on the issue of whether or not the NLRC has jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case filed by Maglaya.<br><br>The said issue revolves around the question on whether Maglaya is a corporate officer or a mere employee. For purposes of identifying an intra-corporate controversy, We have defined corporate officers, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Corporate officers" in the context of Presidential Decree No. 902-A are those officers of the corporation who are <b>given that character by the Corporation Code or by the corporation's by-laws.</b> There are three specific officers whom a corporation must have under Section 25 of the Corporation Code. These are the president, secretary and the treasurer. The number of officers is not limited to these three. A corporation may have such other officers as may be provided for by its by-laws like, but not limited to, the vice-president, cashier, auditor or general manager. The number of corporate officers is thus limited by law and by the corporation's by-laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer are commonly regarded as the principal or executive officers of a corporation, and they are usually designated as the officers of the corporation. However, <b>other officers are sometimes created by the charter or by-laws of a corporation,</b> or the board of directors may be empowered under the by-laws of a corporation to create additional offices as may be necessary. This Court expounded that an <i> "office" </i> is created by the charter of the corporation and the officer is elected by the directors or stockholders, while an <i> "employee" </i> usually occupies no office and generally is employed not by action of the directors or stockholders but by the managing officer of the corporation who also determines the compensation to be paid to such employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, that the <i>creation</i> of the position is under the corporation's charter or by-laws, and that the <i> election </i> of the officer is by the directors or stockholders must concur in order for an individual to be considered a corporate officer, as against an ordinary employee or officer. It is only when the officer claiming to have been illegally dismissed is classified as such corporate officer that the issue is deemed an intra-corporate dispute which falls within the jurisdiction of the trial courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In its position paper before the LA, WUP presented its amended By-Laws<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated November 28, 1988 submitted to the SEC to prove that Maglaya, as the University President, was a corporate officer whose rights do not fall within the jurisdiction of the labor tribunal. It also presented the Resolution dated August 19, 2009 of the RTC, and the Decision dated March 15, 20 11 of the CA to show that the earlier case was filed by Maglaya and others, as members of the Board, questioning the Bishops' appointment of the new members without their recommendation.<br><br>The relevant portions of the amended By-Laws provide:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VI.
