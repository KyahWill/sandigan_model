Lindawan <i>(Lindawan), </i>Clerk of Court II, MCTC, for the years 2009 and 2010. Allegedly, Lindawan failed to present four (4) booklets of official receipts with series numbers 7654801-7654850, 7654851-7654900, 7654901-7654950, and 7654951-7655000 despite several requests to submit the same.<br><br>Acting thereon, an audit was conducted covering the financial transactions of Pio M. Valdez <i>(Valdez), </i>Court Interpreter and Officer-in-Charge of MCTC from January 1, 2007 to January 31, 2008, and Lindawan from February 1, 2008 to August 21, 2013.<br><br>The Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the audit team disclosed the following:<br><br><blockquote>I.

Further, the Court required them to explain the charges against them. It also ordered the indefinite suspension of Lindawan, pending the outcome of the administrative matter, and required him to restitute the amounts of P859,000.00 and P789.60 representing the shortages in the Fiduciary Fund and the Judiciary Development Fund, respectively; to withdraw the amount of P22,868.41 from the Fiduciary Fund representing the unwithdrawn net interest earned; to issue an official receipt to the General Fund and remit it to the Land Bank of the Philippines; and to transmit to the Court thru the FMD-CMO all documents pertaining to his collections and remittances. In the same resolution, the Court cleared Valdez from financial accountabilities as the former officer-in-charge of the MCTC and directed Jonalson William Bumohya <i>(Bumohya), </i>Process Server of the MCTC, to strictly adhere to the rules and circulars issued by the Court, particularly the procedure in the claim of cash advance and its liquidation in relation to the service of summons, subpoena, and other court processes.<br><br>In his Compliance and Explanation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Judge Buyucan offered his humble apologies to the audit team and begged for the understanding and forgiveness of its members. He explained that his outburst and rise in temper were not directed at any member of the audit team. He was merely taken aback by the results of the audit and felt betrayed and humiliated by Lindawan's actions. Judge Buyucan denied liability over the shortages incurred by Lindawan. He claimed that as the Presiding Judge, his main function was adjudicative. He further averred that although he had administrative supervision over the court employees and he was a signatory to the documents involving the fiduciary funds, he should not be faulted for affixing his signature on these documents as it was the clerk of court who prepared and signed the same. Thus, he presumed that everything was in order before he affixed his signature. Judge Buyucan further asserted that he came to know of the anomalous transactions of Lindawan only after the audit team had examined the financial transactions of the court and showed him the report. According to him, he was not remiss in reminding his clerk of court to properly record, account and deposit all monetary transactions of the court and that he always gave his assurance that the reports were submitted on time.<br><br>On October 26, 2015, Lindawan filed his Motion to Admit Written Explanation and Compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He informed the Court that he had restituted the amount of P443,000.00 of the cash bonds to the bondsmen leaving a balance of P416,000.00; that he had paid and deposited to the Fiduciary Fund the amount of P416,000.00 representing the remaining balance of his accountability; that he had withdrawn P22,868.41 from the Fiduciary Fund and deposited it to the Bureau of Treasury; that he had deposited the amount of P789.60 to the Judiciary Development Fund; and that he had submitted the acknowledgment receipt signed by the bondsmen, as well as all the respective machine validated deposit slips and withdrawal slips, to the FMD-CMO.<br><br>With respect to Official Receipt <i>(OR)</i> No. 6661877, Lindawan alleged that one of the employees of the court mistakenly used it for the collection of court clearance. In order to correct the mistake, he used the same for the collection of cash bonds, but he failed to correct the duplicate copy.<br><br>As to the missing ORs with serial numbers 7654801-7654850, 7654851-7654900, 7654901-7654950, and 7654951-7655500, Lindawan explained that the COA took them for auditing and returned it to Estrella Soriano <i>(Soriano),</i> a court employee; that he requested a copy of the transmittal receipt which would prove that Soriano indeed received the ORs, but COA failed to produce it; that sometime in April2015, he was informed by Valdez that Soriano burned several blank receipts in her backyard which was witnessed by Kagawad Celia Ocumen <i>(Ocumen);</i> and that he and Bumohya immediately went to the house of Soriano and talked to Ocumen who confirmed that Soriano indeed burned several blank receipts.<br><br>As to the 42 booklets of ORs, Lindawan averred that the COA took them for audit, but failed to return them to the court; and that on July 20, 2015, a certain COA personnel, named Rose Mae L. Saquing, returned the missing ORs to the court. Lindawan submitted a copy of the COA's transmittal regarding the said ORs.<br><br>Furthermore, Lindawan admitted that he failed to deposit the judiciary collections because the court personnel borrowed the money and failed to return the same; that some of the bail bonds could not have been signed due to oversight; that the forms for legal fees were not attached to the case folders as it was not the practice of the former clerk of court, but, nonetheless, he wrote the ORs in front of the case folder; and that except for the Fiduciary Fund and Mediation Fund, he submitted his monthly reports of collection for JDF and SAJF.<br><br>Lastly, Lindawan accepted his mistakes and transgressions and asked compassion from the Court to give him another chance to reform and be a productive member of the community.<br><br>In the meantime, the Court received a Letter,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font> dated June 10, 2016, from Lindawan informing the Court of his resignation due to medical reasons.<br><br><i>Report and Recommendation of the OCA</i><br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated October 6, 2016, the OCA found Lindawan guilty of gross dishonesty, grave misconduct, and gross neglect of duty. Consequently, it recommended his dismissal from the service.<br><br>With respect to Judge Buyucan, the OCA found him guilty of simple neglect of duty and recommended that he be fined in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos <i>(P5,000.00) </i>for his failure to give attention to a task expected of him and for disregarding a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference. It stated that Judge Buyucan, as the Presiding Judge of MCTC, is mandated to organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of court business, and, as the person charged with the proper and efficient management of the court, he is ultimately responsible for the mistakes of his court personnel.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br><i>Liability of Lindawan</i><br><br>The Court agrees with the recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>The Court, in Circular No. 13-92 and Circular No. 5-93, mandates all clerks of courts to immediately deposit all fiduciary collections, upon receipt thereof, with the Land Bank, as an authorized depository bank. Further, the Court has always reminded clerks of courts, cash clerks and all court personnel entrusted with the collections of court funds to deposit immediately with authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Also, the failure to deposit these judiciary collections on time deprives the court of the interest that may be earned if the amounts were deposited in a bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>OCA v. Fortaleza,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court stressed the role of clerk of courts and their responsibilities in the collection of court funds. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Clerks of court are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts; with regard to the collection of legal fees, they perform a delicate function as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective implementation of regulations thereon. Even the undue delay in the remittances of amounts collected by them at the very least constitutes misfeasance. On the other hand, a vital administrative function of a judge is the effective management of his court and this includes control of the conduct of the courts ministerial officers. It should be brought home to both that the safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In the present case, Lindawan committed several irregularities in the administration of court funds. Not only did he incur unexplained cash shortages in the Fiduciary Fund and in the Judiciary Development Fund, he also failed to deposit court collections on time and neglected to submit his monthly financial reports to the OCA. Worst, he collected cash bonds without issuing official receipts, falsified official receipts and lost several booklets of official receipts. Undeniably, Lindawan abused the trust and confidence reposed in him and failed to perform his duty with utmost loyalty and honesty.<br><br>The Court has said time and again that those who work in the judiciary, from the highest official to the lowest clerk, must adhere to high ethical standards to preserve the court's good name and standing. As officers of the court and agents of the law, they should be examples of responsibility, competence and efficiency, and they must discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> For the Court will never tolerate any conduct which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the MTC of Bani Alaminos and Lingayen in Pangasinan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court held that the failure of a clerk of court to turn over money deposited with him and adequately explain and present evidence thereon constituted gross dishonesty, grave misconduct, and even malversation of public funds, and even the restitution of the whole amount would not exculpate him from liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Further, in <i>Re: Final Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court of Midsayap, North Cotabato,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court ruled that failure to remit the funds in due time constitutes gross dishonesty and gross misconduct and even malversation of funds, which are considered grave offenses punished by dismissal even if committed for the first time.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the ultimate penalty of dismissal would have been imposed upon Lindawan had he not resigned from his post. Thus, in lieu of the dismissal, the Court shall forfeit the retirement benefits that may be due him.<br><br><i>Liability of Judge Buyucan</i><br><br>The Court agrees with the OCA that Judge Buyucan should be held administratively liable for simple neglect of duty. Although the custody, submission, and monitoring of monthly reports of collections and deposits were mainly the responsibility of the clerk of court, he is, however, subject to the control and supervision of the Presiding Judge. As the administrative officer who has authority over the office of the clerk of court, Judge Buyucan should be familiar with the different circulars of the Court as his duty is not confined to adjudicatory functions, but includes the administrative responsibility of organizing and supervising the court personnel to secure a prompt and efficient dispatch of business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is his responsibility to see to it that the clerk of court performs his duties and observes the circulars issued by the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, he should have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the correct procedure in the collections and deposits of court funds were dutifully carried out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In addition, Judge Buyucan should likewise be held administratively liable for conduct unbecoming of a judge for his inappropriate actions and use of intemperate language. The incident narrated by the audit team was never denied by Judge Buyucan who offered his apologies to the audit team and begged for their understanding and forgiveness for his outburst and rise in temper.<br><br>The New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary requires judges to exemplify propriety at all times<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in order to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. Judge Buyucan must comport himself irreproachably, not only while in the discharge of official duties but also in his personal behavior every day. He should exercise judicial temperament in all his dealings and must maintain composure and equanimity at all times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The OCA recommends that Judge Buyucan be fined in the amount of P5,000.00. The Court, however, considers this to be too light considering his violation of the rules. Judge Buyucan is not only guilty of simple neglect of duty but is also liable for conduct unbecoming of a judge for his inappropriate actions and for using intemperate language. Thus, the fine should be increased to Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00), with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> finding respondent Gerard N. Lindawan, former Clerk of Court II, Bagabag-Diadi, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, <b>GUILTY</b> of Gross Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct, the Court hereby orders the <b>FORFEITURE</b> of his retirement benefits. The respondent is further <b>BARRED</b> from reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations.<br><br>On the other hand, finding Judge Bill D. Buyucan, Presiding Judge of the same court, <b>GUILTY</b> of Simple Neglect of Duty and Conduct Unbecoming of a Judge, the Court hereby imposes upon him a <b>FINE</b> in the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00), with a <b>WARNING</b> that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Mendoza, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Caguioa, Martires,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Tijam, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Del Castillo,</i> and <i>Jardeleza, JJ.,</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><br><br><b><center>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <u>July 11, 2017</u> a <u>Decision</u>/Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled administrative matters, the original of which was received by this Office on August 9, 2017 at 11:15 a.m.<br><br></b><div align="right"><b>Very truly yours,</b><br><br><b>(SGD.)
