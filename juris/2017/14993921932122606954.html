In its Resolution dated 25 November 2014, the Court resolved to treat the petition as one for mandamus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></center><br>On 1 September 2011, DMCI Project Developers, Inc. (DMCI-PDI)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> acquired a 7,716.60-square meter lot in the City of Manila, located near Taft Avenue, Ermita, beside the former Manila Jai-Alai Building and Adamson University.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The lot was earmarked for the construction of DMCI-PDI's Torre de Manila condominium project.<br><br>On 2 April 2012, DMCI-PDI secured its Barangay Clearance to start the construction of its project. It then obtained a Zoning Permit from the City of Manila's City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) on 19 June 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Then, on 5 July 2012, the City of Manila's Office of the Building Official granted DMCI-PDI a Building Permit, allowing it to build a "Forty­-Nine (49) Storey w/ Basement &amp; 2 penthouse Level Res'l./Condominium" on the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 24 July 2012, the City Council of Manila issued Resolution No. 121 enjoining the Office of the Building Official to temporarily suspend the Building Permit of DMCI-PDI, citing among others, that "the Torre de Manila Condominium, based on their development plans, upon completion, will rise up high above the back of the national monument, to clearly dwarf the statue of our hero, and with such towering heights, would certainly ruin the line of sight of the Rizal Shrine from the frontal Roxas Boulevard vantage point[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Building Official Melvin Q. Balagot then sought the opinion of the City of Manila's City Legal Officer on whether he is bound to comply with Resolution No. 121.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In his letter dated 12 September 2012, City Legal Officer Renato G. Dela Cruz stated that there is "no legal justification for the temporary suspension of the Building Permit issued in favor of [DMCI-PDI]" since the construction "lies outside the Luneta Park" and is "simply too far to be a repulsive distraction or have an objectionable effect on the artistic and historical significance" of the Rizal Monument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He also pointed out that "there is no showing that the [area of] subject property has been officially declared as an anthropological or archeological area. Neither has it been categorically designated by the National Historical Institute as a heritage zone, a cultural property, a historical landmark or even a national treasure."<br><br>Subsequently, both the City of Manila and DMCI-PDI sought the opinion of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) on the matter. In the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 6 November 2012 from NHCP Chairperson Dr. Maria Serena I. Diokno addressed to DMCI-PDI and the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated 7 November 2012 from NHCP Executive Director III Ludovico D. Badoy addressed to then Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim, the NHCP maintained that the Torre de Manila project site is outside the boundaries of the Rizal Park and well to the rear of the Rizal Monument, and thus, cannot possibly obstruct the frontal view of the National Monument.<br><br>On 26 November 2013, following an online petition against the Torre de Manila project that garnered about 7,800 signatures, the City Council of Manila issued Resolution No. 146, reiterating its directive in Resolution No. 121 enjoining the City of Manila's building officials to temporarily suspend DMCI-PDI's Building Permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a letter to Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada dated 18 December 2013, DMCI-PDI President Alfredo R. Austria sought clarification on the controversy surrounding its Zoning Permit. He stated that since the CPDO granted its Zoning Permit, DMCI-PDI continued with the application for the Building Permit, which was granted, and did not deem it necessary to go through the process of appealing to the local zoning board. He then expressed DMCI-PDI's willingness to comply with the process if the City of Manila deemed it necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 23 December 2013, the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals (MZBAA) issued Zoning Board Resolution No. 06, Series of 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> recommending the approval of DMCI-PDI's application for variance. The MZBAA noted that the Torre de Manila project "exceeds the prescribed maximum Percentage of Land Occupancy (PLO) and exceeds the prescribed Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as stipulated in Article V, Section 17 of City Ordinance No. 8119[.]" However, the MZBAA still recommended the approval of the variance subject to the five conditions set under the same resolution.<br><br>After some clarification sought by DMCI-PDI, the MZBAA issued Zoning Board Resolution No. 06-A, Series of 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on 8 January 2014, amending condition (c) in the earlier resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 16 January 2014, the City Council of Manila issued Resolution No. 5, Series of 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> adopting Zoning Board Resolution Nos. 06 and 06-A. The City Council resolution states that "the City Council of Manila find[s] no cogent reason to deny and/or reverse the aforesaid recommendation of the [MZBAA] and hereby ratif1ies] and confirm[s] all previously issued permits, licenses and approvals issued by the City [Council] of Manila for Torre de Manila[.]"<br><br><center><b>Arguments of the KOR</b><br></center><br>On 12 September 2014, the KOR, a "civic, patriotic, cultural, non­partisan, non-sectarian and non-profit organization"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> created under Republic Act No. 646,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> filed a Petition for Injunction seeking a temporary restraining order, and later a permanent injunction, against the construction of DMCI-PDI's Torre de Manila condominium project. The KOR argues that the subject matter of the present suit is one of "transcendental importance, paramount public interest, of overarching significance to society, or with far-­reaching implication" involving the desecration of the Rizal Monument.<br><br>The KOR asserts that the completed Torre de Manila structure will "[stick] out like a sore thumb, [dwarf] all surrounding buildings within a radius of two kilometer/s" and "forever ruin the sightline of the Rizal Monument in Luneta Park: Torre de Manila building would loom at the back and overshadow the entire monument, whether up close or viewed from a distance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Further, the KOR argues that the Rizal Monument, as a National Treasure, is entitled to "full protection of the law"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and the national government must abate the act or activity that endangers the nation's cultural heritage "even against the wishes of the local government hosting it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Next, the KOR contends that the project is a nuisance <i>per se</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> because "[t]he despoliation of the sight view of the Rizal Monument is a situation that 'annoys or offends the senses' of every Filipino who honors the memory of the National Hero Jose Rizal. It is a present, continuing, worsening and aggravating status or condition. Hence, the PROJECT is a nuisance <i>per se</i>. It deserves to be abated summarily, even without need of judicial proceeding."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The KOR also claims that the Torre de Manila project violates the NHCP's <i>Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages</i>, which state that historic monuments should assert a visual "dominance" over its surroundings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as well as the country's commitment under the <i>International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites</i>, otherwise known as the Venice Charter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the KOR claims that the DMCI-PDI's construction was commenced and continues in bad faith, and is in violation of the City of Manila's zoning ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b>Arguments of DMCI-PDI</b><br></center><br>In ts Comment, MCI-PDI argues that the KOR's petition should be dismissed, on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THIS HONORABLE COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THIS ACTION.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>KOR HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT OR INTEREST TO FILE OR PROSECUTE THIS ACTION.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>TORRE DE MANILA IS NOT A NUISANCE PER SE.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>DMCI-PDI ACTED IN GOOD FAITH IN CONSTRUCTING TORRE DE MANILA; AND<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>KOR IS NOT ENTITLED TO A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND/OR A WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><i>First</i>, DMCI-PDI asserts that the Court has no original jurisdiction over actions for injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Even assuming that the Court has concurrent jurisdiction, DMCI-PDI maintains that the petition should still have been filed with the Regional Trial Court under the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and because the petition involves questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>DMCI-PDI also contends that the KOR's petition is in actuality an opposition or appeal from the exemption granted by the City of Manila's MZBAA, a matter which is also not within the jurisdiction of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> DMCI-PDI claims that the proper forum should be the MZBAA, and should the KOR fail there, it should appeal the same to the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>DMCI-PDI further argues that since the Rizal Monument has been declared a National Treasure, the power to issue a cease and desist order is lodged with the "appropriate cultural agency" under Section 25 of Republic Act No. 10066 or the <i>National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Moreover, DMCI-PDI asserts that the KOR availed of the wrong remedy since an action for injunction is not the proper remedy for abatement of a nuisance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, DMCI-PDI maintains that the KOR has no standing to institute this proceeding because it is not a real party in interest in this case. The purposes of the KOR as a public corporation do not include the preservation of the Rizal Monument as a cultural or historical heritage site.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The KOR has also not shown that it suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the alleged illegal conduct of the City of Manila. If there is any injury to the KOR at all, the same was caused by the private conduct of a private entity and not the City of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, DMCI-PDI argues that the Torre de Manila is not a nuisance <i>per se</i>. DMCI-PDI reiterates that it obtained all the necessary permits, licenses, clearances, and certificates for its construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It also refutes the KOR's claim that the Torre de Manila would dwarf all other structures around it, considering that there are other tall buildings even closer to the Rizal Monument itself, namely, the Eton Baypark Tower at the corner of Roxas Boulevard and T.M. Kalaw Street (29 storeys; 235 meters from the Rizal Monument) and Sunview Palace at the corner of M.H. Del Pilar and T.M. Kalaw Streets (42 storeys; 250 meters from the Rizal Monument).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, DMCI-PDI next argues that it did not act in bad faith when it started construction of its Torre de Manila project. Bad faith cannot be attributed to it since it was within the "lawful exercise of [its] rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The KOR failed to present any proof that DMCI-PDI did not follow the proper procedure and zoning restrictions of the City of Manila. Aside from obtaining all the necessary permits from the appropriate government agencies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> DMCI-PDI also sought clarification on its right to build on its site from the Office of the City Legal Officer of Manila, the Manila CPDO, and the NHCP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, even if the KOR proffered such proof, the Court would be in no position to declare DMCI-PDI's acts as illegal since the Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, DMCI-PDI opposes the KOR's application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and writ of preliminary injunction. DMCI-PDI asserts that the KOR has failed to establish "a clear and unmistakable right to enjoin the construction of Torre de Manila, much less request its demolition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> DMCI-PDI further argues that it "has complied with all the legal requirements for the construction of Torre de Manila x x x [and] has violated no right of KOR that must be protected. Further, KOR stands to suffer no damage because of its lack of direct pecuniary interest in this petition. To grant the KOR's application for injunctive relief would constitute an unjust taking of property without due process of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><center><b>Arguments of the City of Manila</b><br></center><br>In its Comment, the City of Manila argues that the writ of mandamus cannot issue "considering that no property or substantive rights whatsoever in favor of [the KOR] is being affected or x x x entitled to judicial protection[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The City of Manila also asserts that the "issuance and revocation of a Building Permit undoubtedly fall under the category of a discretionary act or duty performed by the proper officer in light of his meticulous appraisal and evaluation of the pertinent supporting documents of the application in accordance with the rules laid out under the National Building Code [and] Presidential Decree No. 1096,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> while the remedy of mandamus is available only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Further, the City of Manila maintains that the construction of the Torre de Manila did not violate any existing law, since the "edifice [is] well behind (some 789 meters away) the line of sight of the Rizal Monument."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It adds that the City of Manila's "prevailing Land Use and Zoning Ordinance [Ordinance No. 8119] x x x allows an adjustment in Floor Area Ratios thru the [MZBAA] subject to further final approval of the City Council."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The City Council adopted the MZBAA's favorable recommendation in its Resolution No. 5, ratifying all the licenses and permits issued to DMCI-PDI for its Torre de Manila project.<br><br>In its Position Paper dated 15 July 2015, the City of Manila admitted that the Zoning Permit issued to DMCI-PDI was "in breach of certain provisions of City Ordinance No. 8119."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It maintained, however, that the deficiency is "procedural in nature and pertains mostly to the failure of [DMCI-PDI] to comply with the stipulations that allow an excess in the [FAR] provisions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Further, the City of Manila argued that the MZBAA, when it recommended the allowance of the project's variance, imposed certain conditions upon the Torre de Manila project in order to mitigate the possible adverse effects of an excess FAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></center><br>The issues raised by the parties can be summed up into one main point: Can the Court issue a writ of mandamus against the officials of the City of Manila to stop the construction of DMCI-PDI's Torre de Manila project?<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The petition for mandamus lacks merit and must be dismissed.<br><br><b>There is no law prohibiting the construction of the Torre de Manila.</b><br><br>In <i>Manila Electric Company v. Public Service Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court held that "<b>what is not expressly or impliedly prohibited by law may be done, except when the act is contrary to morals, customs and public order</b>." This principle is fundamental in a democratic society, to protect the weak against the strong, the minority against the majority, and the individual citizen against the government. In essence, this principle, which is the foundation of a civilized society under the rule of law, prescribes that the freedom to act can be curtailed only through law. Without this principle, the rights, freedoms, and civil liberties of citizens can be arbitrarily and whimsically trampled upon by the shifting passions of those who can shout the loudest, or those who can gather the biggest crowd or the most number of Internet trolls. In other instances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court has allowed or upheld actions that were not expressly prohibited by statutes when it determined that these acts were not contrary to morals, customs, and public order, or that upholding the same would lead to a more equitable solution to the controversy. However, it is the law itself - Articles 1306<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and 1409(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the Civil Code - which prescribes that acts not contrary to morals, good customs, public order, or public policy are allowed if also not contrary to law.<br><br>In this case, there is no allegation or proof that the Torre de Manila project is "contrary to morals, customs, and public order" or that it brings harm, danger, or hazard to the community. On the contrary, the City of Manila has determined that DMCI-PDI complied with the standards set under the pertinent laws and local ordinances to construct its Torre de Manila project.<br><br>There is one fact that is crystal clear in this case. There is no law prohibiting the construction of the Torre de Manila due to its effect on the <b>background</b> "view, vista, sightline, or setting" of the Rizal Monument.<br><br>Zoning, as well as land use, in the City of Manila is governed by Ordinance No. 8119. The ordinance provides for standards and guidelines to regulate development projects of historic sites and facilities within the City of Manila.<br><br>Specifically, Section 47 reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 47. Historical Preservation and Conservation Standards. - Historic sites and facilities shall be conserved and preserved. These shall, to the extent possible, be made accessible for the educational and cultural enrichment of the general public.<br><br>The following shall <b>guide the development of historic sites and facilities</b>:<br><br>1. Sites with historic buildings or places shall be developed to conserve and enhance their heritage values.<br><br>2. Historic sites and facilities shall be adaptively re-used.<br><br>3. Any person who proposes to add, to alter, or partially demolish a designated heritage property will require the approval of the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) and shall be required to prepare a heritage impact statement that will demonstrate to the satisfaction of CPDO that the proposal will not adversely impact the heritage significance of the property and shall submit plans for review by the CPDO in coordination with the National Historical Institute (NHI).<br><br>4. Any proposed alteration and/or re-use of designated heritage properties shall be evaluated based on criteria established by the heritage significance of the particular property or site.<br><br>5. Where an owner of a heritage property applies for approval to demolish a designated heritage property or properties, the owner shall be required to provide evidence to satisfaction that demonstrates that rehabilitation and re-use of the property is not viable.<br><br>6. Any designated heritage property which is to be demolished or significantly altered shall be thoroughly documented for archival purposes with a history, photographic records, and measured drawings, in accordance with accepted heritage recording guidelines, prior to demolition or alteration.<br><br>7. Residential and commercial infill in heritage areas will be sensitive to the existing scale and pattern of those areas, which maintains the existing landscape and streetscape qualities of those areas, and which does not result in the loss of any heritage resources.<br><br>8. Development plans shall ensure that parking facilities (surface lots, residential garages, stand-alone parking garages and parking components as parts of larger developments) are compatibly integrated into heritage areas, and/or are compatible with adjacent heritage resources.<br><br>9. Local utility companies (hydro, gas, telephone, cable) shall be required to place metering equipment, transformer boxes, power lines, conduit, equipment boxes, piping, wireless telecommunication towers and other utility equipment and devices in locations which do not detract from the visual character of heritage resources, and which do not have a negative impact on its architectural integrity.<br><br>10. Design review approval shall be secured from the CPDO for any alteration of the heritage property to ensure that design guidelines and standards are met and shall promote preservation and conservation of the heritage property. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is clear that the standards laid down in Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119 only serve as guides, as it expressly states that "the following shall <b>guide</b> the development of historic sites and facilities." A guide simply sets a direction or gives an instruction to be followed by property owners and developers in order to conserve and enhance a property's heritage values.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 48 states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 48. Site Performance Standards. - The City considers it in the public interest that all projects are designed and developed in a safe, efficient and aesthetically pleasing manner. Site development shall consider the environmental character and limitations of the site and its adjacent properties. All project elements shall be in complete harmony according to good design principles and the subsequent development must be visually pleasing as well as efficiently functioning especially in relation to the adjacent properties and bordering streets.<br><br>1 The design, construction, operation and maintenance of every facility shall be in harmony with the existing and intended character of its neighborhood. It shall not change the essential character of the said area but will be a substantial improvement to the value of the properties in the neighborhood in particular and the community in general.<br><br>Furthermore, designs should consider the following:<br><br>1. Sites, buildings and facilities shall be designed and developed with regard to safety, efficiency and high standards of design. The natural environmental character of the site and its adjacent properties shall be considered in the site development of each building and facility.<br><br>2. The height and bulk of buildings and structures shall be so designed that it does not impair the entry of light and ventilation, cause the loss of privacy and/or create nuisances, hazards or inconveniences to adjacent developments.<br><br>3. Abutments to adjacent properties shall not be allowed without the neighbor's prior written consent which shall be required by the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) prior to the granting of a Zoning Permit (Locational Clearance).<br><br>4. The capacity of parking areas/lots shall be per the minimum requirements of the National Building Code. These shall be located, developed and landscaped in order to enhance the aesthetic quality of the facility. In no case, shall parking areas/lots encroach into street rights-of­-way and shall follow the Traffic Code as set by the City.<br><br>5. Developments that attract a significant volume of public modes of transportation, such as tricycles, jeepneys, buses, etc., shall provide on-site parking for the same. These shall also provide vehicular loading and unloading bays so as street traffic flow will not be impeded.<br><br>6. Buffers, silencers, mufflers, enclosures and other noise-absorbing materials shall be provided to all noise and vibration-producing machinery. Noise levels shall be maintained according to levels specified in DENR DAO No. 30 - Abatement of Noise and Other Forms of Nuisance as Defined by Law.<br><br>7. Glare and heat from any operation or activity shall not be radiated, seen or felt from any point beyond the limits of the property.<br><br>8. <b>No large commercial signage and/or pylon, which will be detrimental to the skyline, shall be allowed.</b><br><br>9. Design guidelines, deeds of restriction, property management plans and other regulatory tools that will ensure high quality developments shall be required from developers of commercial subdivisions and condominiums. These shall be submitted to the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) for review and approval. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119 specifically regulates the "<b>development of historic sites and facilities</b>." Section 48 regulates "<b>large commercial signage and/or pylon</b>." There is nothing in Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 that disallows the construction of a <b>building outside the boundaries of a historic site or facility</b>, where such building may affect the background of a historic site. In this case, the Torre de Manila stands 870 meters outside and to the rear of the Rizal Monument and "cannot possibly obstruct the front view of the [Rizal] Monument."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Likewise, the Torre de Manila is not in an area that has been declared as an "anthropological or archeological area" or in an area designated as a heritage zone, cultural property, historical landmark, or a national treasure by the NHCP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Section 15, Article XIV of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of arts and culture, provides that "[t]he State shall conserve, promote and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources x x x." Since this provision is not self-executory, Congress passed laws dealing with the preservation and conservation of our cultural heritage.<br><br>One such law is Republic Act No. 10066,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> or the <i>National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009</i>, which empowers the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and other cultural agencies to issue a cease and desist order "when the <b>physical integrity</b> of the national cultural treasures or important cultural properties [is] found to be <b>in danger of destruction or significant alteration from its original state</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> This law declares that the State should protect the "<b>physical integrity</b>" of the heritage property or building if there is "danger of destruction or significant alteration from its original state." <b>Physical integrity refers to the structure itself - how strong and sound the structure is.</b> The same law does not mention that <b>another</b> project, building, or property, not itself a heritage property or building, may be the subject of a cease and desist order when it adversely affects the background view, vista, or sightline of a heritage property or building. Thus, Republic Act No. 10066 cannot apply to the Torre de Manila condominium project.<br><br><center><b>Mandamus does not lie against the City of Manila.</b><br></center><br>The Constitution states that "[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is a fundamental principle that no property shall be taken away from an individual without due process, whether substantive or procedural. The dispossession of property, or in this case the stoppage of the construction of a building in one's own property, would violate substantive due process.<br><br>The Rules on Civil Procedure are clear that mandamus only issues when there is a clear legal duty imposed upon the office or the officer sought to be compelled to perform an act, and when the party seeking mandamus has a clear legal right to the performance of such act.<br><br>In the present case, nowhere is it found in Ordinance No. 8119 or in any law, ordinance, or rule for that matter, that the construction of a building <b>outside</b> the Rizal Park is prohibited if the building is within the background sightline or view of the Rizal Monument. Thus, there is no legal duty on the part of the City of Manila "<b>to consider</b>," in the words of the Dissenting Opinion, "<b>the standards set under Ordinance No. 8119</b>" in relation to the applications of DMCI-PDI for the Torre de Manila since under the ordinance <b>these standards can never be applied outside the boundaries of Rizal Park</b>. While the Rizal Park has been declared a National Historical Site, the area where Torre de Manila is being built is a privately-owned property that is "not part of the Rizal Park that has been declared as a National Heritage Site in 1995," and the Torre de Manila area is in fact "well-beyond" the Rizal Park, according to NHCP Chairperson Dr. Maria Serena I. Diokno.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Neither has the area of the Torre de Manila been designated as a "heritage zone, a cultural property, a historical landmark or even a national treasure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Also, to declare that the City of Manila failed to consider the standards under Ordinance No. 8119 would involve making a finding of fact. A finding of fact requires notice, hearing, and the submission of evidence to ascertain compliance with the law or regulation. In such a case, it is the Regional Trial Court which has the jurisdiction to hear the case, receive evidence, make a proper finding of fact, and determine whether the Torre de Manila project properly complied with the standards set by the ordinance. In <i>Meralco Public Service Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> we held that it is the cardinal right of a party in trials and administrative proceedings to be heard, which includes the right of the party interested or affected to present his own case and submit evidence in support thereof and to have such evidence presented considered by the proper court or tribunal.<br><br>To compel the City of Manila to consider the standards under Ordinance No. 8119 to the Torre de Manila project will be an empty exercise since these standards cannot apply outside of the Rizal Park - and the Torre de Manila is outside the Rizal Park. Mandamus will lie only if the officials of the City of Manila have a ministerial duty to consider these standards to buildings outside of the Rizal Park. There can be no such ministerial duty because these standards are not applicable to buildings outside of the Rizal Park.<br><br>The KOR also invokes this Court's exercise of its extraordinary <i>certiorari</i> power of review under Section 1, Article VIII<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the Constitution. However, this Court can only exercise its extraordinary <i>certiorari</i> power if the City of Manila, in issuing the required permits and licenses, <b>gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</b>. Tellingly, neither the majority nor minority opinion in this case has found that the City of Manila committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the permits and licenses to DMCI-PDI. Thus, there is no justification at all for this Court to exercise its extraordinary <i>certiorari</i> power.<br><br>Moteover, the exercise of this Court's extraordinary <i>certiorari</i> power is limited to actual cases and controversies that necessarily involve a violation of the Constitution or the determination of the constitutionality or validity of a governmental act or issuance. Specific violation of a statute that does inot raise the issue of constitutionality or validity of the statute cannot, as a rule, be the subject of the Court's direct exercise of its expanded <i>certiorari</i> power. Thus, the KOR's recourse lies with other judicial remedies or proceedings allowed under the Rules of Court.<br><br>In <i>Association of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v. GCC Approved Medical Centers Association, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> we held that in cases where the question of constitutionality of a governmental action is raised, the judicial power that the courts exercise is likewise identified as the <i>power of judicial review</i> - the power to review the constitutionality of the actions of other branches of government. As a rule, as required by the <i>hierarchy of courts principle</i>, these cases are filed with the lowest court with jurisdiction over the subject matter.

There is, however, no clear legal duty on the City of Manila to consider the provisions of Ordinance No. 8119 for applications for permits to build <b>outside</b> the protected areas of the Rizal Park. Even if there were such legal duty, the determination of whether the City of Manila failed to abide by this legal duty would involve factual matters which have not been admitted or established in this case. Establishing factual matters is not within the realm of this Court. Findings of fact are the province of the trial courts.<br><br>There is no standard in Ordinance No. 8119 for defining or determining the background sightline that is supposed to be protected or that is part of the "physical integrity" of the Rizal Monument. How far should a building like the Torre de Manila be from the Rizal Monument - one, two, three, four, or five kilometers? Even the Solicitor General, during the Oral Arguments, conceded that the ordinance does not prescribe how sightline is determined, neither is there any way to measure by metes and bounds whether construction that is <b>not part of the historic monument itself or is outside the protected area</b> can be said to violate the Rizal Monument's <b>physical integrity</b>, except only to say "when you stand in front of the Rizal Monument, there can be no doubt that your view is marred and impaired." This kind of a standard has no parameters and can include a sightline or a construction as far as the human eyes can see when standing in front of the Rizal Monument. Obviously, this Court cannot apply such a subjective and non-uniform standard that adversely affects property rights several kilometers away from a historical sight or facility.<br><br>The Dissenting Opinion claims that "the City, by reason of a mistaken or erroneous construction of its own Ordinance, had failed to consider its duties under [Ordinance No. 8119] when it issued permits in DMCI-PDI's favor." However, MZBAA Zoning Board Resolution Nos. 06 and 06-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> easily dispel this claim. According to the resolutions, the City of Manila, through the MZBAA, acted on DMCI-PDI's application for variance under the powers and standards set forth in Ordinance No. 8119.<br><br>Without further proof that the MZBAA acted whimsically, capriciously, or arbitrarily in issuing said resolution, the Court should respect MZBAA's exercise of discretion. The Court cannot "substitute its judgment for that of said officials who are in a better position to consider and weigh the same in the light of the authority specifically vested in them by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Since the Court has "no supervisory power over the proceedings and actions of the administrative departments of the government," it "should not generally interfere with purely administrative and discretionary functions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The power of the Court in mandamus petitions does not extend "<b>to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way or the retraction or reversal of an action already taken in the exercise of either</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Still, the Dissenting Opinion insists on directing the re-evaluation by the City of Manila, through the CPDO, of the permits previously issued in favor of the Torre de Manila project to determine compliance with the standards under Ordinance No. 8119. It also declares that the circumstances in this case warrant the <i>pro hac vice</i> conversion of the proceedings in the issuance of the permits into a "contested case" necessitating notice and hearing with all the parties involved.<br><br><i>Pro hac vice</i> means a specific decision does not constitute a precedent because the decision is for the specific case only, not to be followed in other cases. A <i>pro hac vice</i> decision violates statutory law - Article 8 of the Civil Code - which states that "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines." The decision of the Court in this case cannot be <i>pro hac vice</i> because by mandate of the law <b>every decision</b> of the Court forms part of the legal system of the Philippines. If another case comes up with the same facts as the present case, that case must be decided in the same way as this case to comply with the constitutional mandate of equal protection of the law. Thus, a <i>pro hac vice</i> decision also violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<br><br>It is the policy of the courts not to interfere with the discretionary executive acts of the executive branch unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Mandamus does not lie against the legislative and executive branches or their members acting in the exercise of their official discretionary functions. This emanates from the respect accorded by the judiciary to said branches as co-equal entities under the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>In <i>De Castro v. Salas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we held that no rule of law is better established than the one that provides that mandamus will not issue to control the discretion of an officer or a court when honestly exercised and when such power and authority is not abused.<br><br>In exceptional cases, the Court has granted a prayer for mandamus to compel action in matters involving judgment and discretion, only "to act, but not to act one way or the other,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and <b>only in cases where there has been a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, manifest injustice, or palpable excess of authority</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In this case, there can be no determination by this Court that the City of Manila had been negligent or remiss in its duty under Ordinance No. 8119 considering that this determination will involve questions of fact. DMCI-PDI had been issued the proper permits and had secured all approvals and licenses months before the actual construction began. Even the KOR could not point to any law that respondent City of Manila had violated and could only point to declarations of policies by the NHCP and the Venice Charter which do not constitute clear legal bases for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.<br><br>The Venice Charter is merely a codification of guiding principles for the preservation and restoration of ancient monuments, sites, and buildings. It brings together principles in the field of historical conservation and restoration that have been developed, agreed upon, and and laid down by experts over the years. Each country, however, remains "responsible for applying the plan within the framework of its own culture and traditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The Venice Charter is not a treaty and therefore does not become enforceable as law. The Philippines is not legally bound to follow its directive, as in fact, these are not directives but mere guidelines a set of the best practices and techniques that have been proven over the years to be the most effective in preserving and restoring historical monuments, sites and buildings.<br><br>The City of Manila concedes that DMCI-PDI's Zoning Permit was granted without going through the process under Ordinance No. 8119. However,the same was properly rectified when, faced with mounting opposition, DMCI-PDI itself sought clarification from the City of Manila and immediately began complying with the procedure for applying for a variance. The MZBAA did subsequently recommend the approval of the variance and the City Council of Manila approved the same, ratifying the licenses and permits already given to DMCI-PDI. Such ratification was well within the right of the City Council of Manila. The City Council of Manila could have denied the application had it seen any reason to do so. Again, the ratification is a function of the City Council of Manila, an exercise of its discretion and well within the authority granted it by law and the City's own Ordinance No. 8119.<br><br>The main purpose of zoning is the protection of public safety, health, convenience, and welfare. There is no indication that the Torre de Manila project brings any harm, danger, or hazard to the people in the surrounding areas except that the building allegedly poses an unsightly view on the taking of photos or the visual appreciation of the Rizal Monument by locals and tourists. In fact, the Court must take the approval of the MZBAA, and its subsequent ratification by the City Council of Manila, as the duly authorized exercise of discretion by the city officials. Great care must be taken that the Court does not unduly tread upon the local government's performance of its duties. It is not for this Court to dictate upon the other branches of the government how their discretion must be exercised so long as these branches do not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>Likewise, any violation of Ordinance No. 8119 must be determined in the propel case and before the proper forum. It is not within the power of this Court in this case to make such determination. Without such determination, this Court cannot simply declare that the City of Manila had failed to consider its duties under Ordinance No. 8119 when it issued the permits in DMCI-PDI's favor without making a finding of fact how the City of Manila failed "to consider" its duties with respect to areas outside the boundaries of the Rizal Park. In the first place, this Court has no jurisdiction to make findings of fact in an original action like this before this Court. Moreover, the City of Manila could not legally apply standards to sites outside the area covered by the ordinance that prescribed the standards. With this, taken in light of the lack of finding that there was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the City of Manila, there is no basis to issue the writ of mandamus against the City of Manila.<br><br>During the Oral Arguments, it was established that the granting of a variance s neither uncommon nor irregular. On the contrary, current practice has made granting of a variance the rule rather than the exception:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE CARPIO: Let's go to Ordinance 8119.

The Torre de Manila project cannot be considered as a "direct menace to public health or safety." Not only is a condominium project commonplace in the City of Manila, DMCI-PDI has, according to the proper government agencies, complied with health and safety standards set by law.

He asked to face his executioners, facing the East where the sun would be rising since it was early morning, but the Spanish captain did not allow it. As he was shot and a single bullet struck his frail body, Rizal forced himself, with his last remaining strength, to turn around to face the East and thus he fell on his back with his face to the sky and the rising sun. Then, the Spanish captain approached Rizal and finished him off with one pistol shot to his head.<br><br>Before his death, Rizal wrote a letter to his family. He asked for a simple tomb, marked with a cross and a stone with only his name and the date of his birth and death; no anniversary celebrations; and interment at <i>Paang Bundok</i> (now, the Manila North Cemetery). Rizal never wanted his grave to be a burden to future generations.<br><br>The letter never made it to his family and his wishes were not carried out. The etter was discovered many years later, in 1953. By then, his remains had been entombed at the Rizal Monument, countless anniversaries had been celebrated, with memorials and monuments built throughout the world.<br><br>Rizal's wish was unmistakable: to be buried without pomp or pageantry, to the point of reaching oblivion or obscurity in the future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> For Rizal's life was never about fame or vainglory, but for the country he loved dearly and for which he gave up his life.<br><br>The Rizal Monument is expressly against Rizal's own wishes. That Rizal's statue now stands facing West towards Manila Bay, with Rizal's back to the East, adds salt to the wound. If we continue the present orientation of Rizal's statue, with Rizal facing West, we would be like the Spanish captain who refused Rizal's request to die facing the rising sun in the East. On the other hand, if Rizal 's statue is made to face East, as Rizal had desired when he was about to be shot, the background - the blue sky above Manila Bay would forever be clear of obstruction, and we would be faithful to Rizal's dying wish.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for mandamus is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.

People are becoming more and more conscious of the unity of human values and regard ancient monuments as a common heritage. The common responsibility to safeguard them for future generations is recognized. It is our duty to hand them on in the full richness of their authenticity. It is essential that the principles guiding the preservation and restoration of ancient buildings should be agreed and be laid down on an international basis, with each country being responsible for applying the plan within the framework of its own culture and traditions.<br><br>By defining these basic principles for the first time, the Athens Charter of 1931 contributed towards the development of an extensive international movement which has assumed concrete form in national documents, in the work of ICOM and UNESCO and in the establishment by the latter of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural Property. Increasing awareness and critical study have been brought to bear on problems which have continually become more complex and varied; now the time has come to examine the Charter afresh in order to make a thorough study of the principles involved and to enlarge its scope in a new document.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> TSN, 25 August 2015, pp. 18-22, 24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> <i>An Act Appropriating Funds to Carry Out the Purposes of Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission Created by Executive Order No. Fifty-two, dated August Ten, Nineteen Hundred and Fifty-four.

(DMCI-PDI).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In it, petitioner primarily prayed for the following reliefs:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><ol><li>The issuance of an order <b>enjoining the DMCI-PDI from continuing with the construction</b> of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building; <i>and</i><br><br></li><li>The issuance of an order directing the <b>demolition of so much of the said building already erected</b> by the DMCI-PDI.<br></li></ol>Subsequently, however, we issued a resolution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (a) treating the instant case as a <i>mandamus</i> petition and (b) impleading-as public respondents herein-the City of Manila, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the National Museum (NM) and the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP).<br><br>The conversion of the instant case to a <i>mandamus</i> petition and the addition of public respondents, to my mind, made clear what ought to be the central issue of the case, <b>whether any or all of the respondents may be compelled to perform one or both acts sought to be enjoined in the original petition for injunction</b>. The main iuquiry, in other words. is whether any or all of the respondents may be compelled (1) to stop or prohibit the continued construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building and/or (2) to demolish so much of the said building that already stands.<br><br>In order to answer the foregoing query, it is necessary to make a parallel determination on whether any of the respondents has the <b><i>legal duty</i></b> to perform one or both of the mentioned acts. It is rudimentary, after all, that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> will only lie to compel the performance of an act if such act is one "<i>which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on the part of the respondent/s.<br><br>During the course of this case, various arguments were proffered in favor of the view that the respondents have the legal duties to stop or prohibit the continued construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building and/or to demolish it in its present state. I find that these arguments may generally be subdivided into three (3) kinds.<br><br>The <i>first</i> argument is premised on the claim that the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building-visible as it is in the backdrop of the Rizal Monument to anyone facing such monument at or from a certain distance-had impaired the <b>view of dominance of the Rizal Monument in relation to its background</b> (view of dominance), which view is supposedly protected by the following laws and guidelines:<br><ol><li>Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution,<br><br></li><li>Republic Act (RA) Nos. 4846, 7356 and 10066,<br><br></li><li>the Venice Charter, <i>and</i><br><br></li><li>the 2012 NHCP Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages (NHCP Guidelines).<br></li></ol>The theory of the first argument is that the illegal impairment of the view of dominance of the Rizal Monument gives rise to the duty of the respondents-particularly the DMCI-PDI (as the builder of the offending structure), as well as the NCCA, NM and NHCP (as the cultural agencies tasked by RA No. 10066 to protect the nation's cultural properties)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>-to perform the subject acts.<br><br>The <i>second</i> argument, on the other hand, rests on the notion that the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> was carried out by DMCI-PDI in bad faith with the use of void permits, <i>viz</i>:<br><ol><li>The zoning permit issued to DMCI-PDI for the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> is void for exceeding the maximum number of floors allowed for buildings within the Institutional University Cluster per Section 17 of Ordinance No. 8119 of the City of Manila.<br><br></li><li>The building permit for the Torre de Manila is also void as a necessary consequence of the nullity of the zoning permit, pursuant to Section 69 of Ordinance No. 8119.<br><br></li><li>The variance granted to DMCI-PDI by the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i> of the City of Manila, which exempted the Torre de Manila from the floor and height limits of Ordinance No. 8119, is also void due to it not being obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 61 of the same ordinance.<br><br></li><li>All of the foregoing irregularities in its permits were known to DMCI-PDI yet it still pushed through with the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i>.<br></li></ol>The theory of the second argument is that the nullity of the permits coupled by the bad faith of DMCI-PDI gives rise to the duty of the DMCI­-PDI and of the City of Manila to perform the subject acts.<br><br>Lastly, the <i>third</i> argument is premised on the assumption that the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building constitutes as a nuisance for it apparently annoys or offends the senses of anyone viewing the Rizal Monument.<br><br>The theory of the third argument is that the character of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building as a nuisance gives rise to the duty of DMCI-PDI and the City of Manila to cause the summary abatement of the said building.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The minority, through the dissent of Justice Jardeleza, confined themselves in addressing only the first argument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>As to the first argument, the minority essentially held that the view of dominance of the Rizal Monument is not afforded any legal protection under: (a) Sections 15 and 16 of Article XIV of the Constitution, (b) RA Nos. 4846, 7356 and 10066, (c) the Venice Charter or (d) the NHCP Guidelines. The minority elucidated thusly:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><ol type="a"><li>Sections 15 and 16 of Article XIV of the Constitution are <i>not</i> self-executing provisions; both are mere expressions of general state policies and so, by themselves and without the aid of any enabling law, they cannot be the source of any enforceable right or claim of protection.<br><br></li><li>Though RA Nos. 4846, 7356 and 10066 all implement to some extent the broad policies of Sections 15 and 16 of Article XIV of the Constitution, none of the said statutes provides any clear and definite protection to a view of dominance for any of the country's historical and cultural sites, let alone one for the Rizal Monument.<br><br></li><li>The Venice Charter does not rise to the level of enforceable law. There is no showing that the Philippines has legally committed to observe such charter. Neither was it established that the principles contained therein are norms of general or customary international law. At any rate, the Venice Charter, by its own words, only seems to be hortatory.<br><br></li><li>The NHCP Guidelines is neither law nor an enforceable regulation. It appears that it has never been published nor filed with the Law Center of the University of the Philippines. Moreover, like the Venice Charter, the NHCP Guidelines appears to be merely hortatory.<br></li></ol>The inquiry of the majority, however, did not stop there.<br><br>According to the minority, even though no national law categorically guarantees a view of dominance to any of the nation's cultural properties, there exists a local Manila legislation that actually extends such a guarantee to at least the city's historical sites and facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> To this end, they cited Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 of the City of Manila. As the minority explained:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><ol><li>Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119 provides standards that aim to protect Manila's historical sites and facilities from impairment that may be caused by development projects. The protection afforded by Section 47 extends even to the <i>view</i> of the city's historical sites and facilities, as two of the standards therein make explicit reference to: (a) the maintenance of the "<i>landscape and streetscape</i>" qualities of such sites and facilities as well as (b) the preservation of the "<i>visual character</i>" of the same.<br><br></li><li>Section 48 of Ordinance No. 8119, on the other hand, prescribes standards that aim to protect properties and neighborhoods that are adjacent to a proposed development project. Two standards therein make explicit reference to: (a) an obligation of property developers to consider, in the design of their projects, the "<i>natural environmental character</i>" of adjacent properties as well as (b) a prohibition against certain projects that could be detrimental to the "<i>skyline</i>."<br></li></ol>Be that as it may, the minority withheld themselves from determining: (a) whether the Rizal Monument and Park is a historical site or facility in contemplation of Ordinance No. 8119, (b) whether the abovementioned standards in Sections 47 and 48 apply to the DMCI-PDI and the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building and, if so, (c) whether DMCI-PDI, in erecting the said building, had breached or impaired any of such standards. They implicitly considered the City of Manila as the entity in the best position to make such determinations; pointing out that it was supposedly the latter's duty do so, as, in fact, it should have already done so, prior to issuing permits to DMCI­-PDI.<br><br>In this case, however, the majority found that the City of Manila had failed to consider the abovementioned standards in Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 when it issued the permits for the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> to DMCI-PDI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>And so, the minority posited that to a writ of mandamus compelling the City of Manila to re-evaluate the permits it issued to DMCI-PDI ought to be issued in the present case.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>I share the minority's disregard of the second and third arguments. The second and third arguments actually pose factual questions that are more properly settled in the first instance, not by the Court, but by an appropriate office, administrative agency or trial court.<br><br>I even agree with their position that the Rizal Monument's view of dominance is neither protected nor guaranteed by: (a) Sections 15 and 16 of Article XIV of the Constitution, (b) RA Nos. 4846, 7356 and 10066, (c) the Venice Charter or (d) the NHCP Guidelines.<br><br>I disagree, however, with the majority's interpretation that the <i>view </i>­that is, the view of dominance-of Manila's historical sites and facilities are protected by Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119. A careful reading of both sections, in their proper contexts, easily disproves such interpretation.<br><br>Hence, I cannot but disagree with the minority's proposition compelling the City of Manila, through a writ of <i>mandamus</i>, to re-evaluate the permits of DMCI-PDI. Such a re-evaluation will serve no useful purpose given that none of the standards enumerated under Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 can have any application to the present dispute.<br><br>I remain convinced that there is no law, whether national or local, that protects the view of dominance of the Rizal Monument. Verily, I am constrained to follow the only logical conclusion of that finding, <i>i.e.</i>, there is <b>no compellable duty on the part of any of the respondents to stop or prohibit the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building or to otherwise destroy so much of the said building already constructed</b>.<br><br>I, therefore, join the majority and vote to dismiss the <i>mandamus</i> petition.<br><br><center><u><b>A. Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 Do Not Protect View of Dominance of Rizal Monument</b></u><br></center><br>Contrary to the minority's finding, Sections 47 and 48 <i>do not</i> protect the view-particularly, the view of dominance-of Manila's historical sites and facilities.<br><br><b><i>View of Dominance</i></b><br><br>The view of dominance of a property, at least for purposes of the dispute at hand, refers to a characteristic of a property that permits it to be viewed as the <i>sole</i> or <i>most prominent</i> element <i>vis-a-vis</i> its background. This is the attribute of the Rizal Monument that was supposedly impaired by the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i>, per the proponents of the first argument.<br><br>An inviolable view of dominance is not an inherent attribute of any kind of property-not even of our monuments and national shrines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> To merit inviolability, there must he a law that guarantees and protects it.<br><br>A law that purports to protect the view of dominance of a particular property, such as a historical site or facility, must necessarily be a law that either <b><i>prohibits</i></b> the construction of buildings and other structures within a certain area <i>outside</i> of the premises of the site or facility or <b><i>prescribes specific limitations</i></b> on any such construction. Without such express prohibition or limitation, there can be no effective assurance that the view of dominance of a historical site or facility would not be impaired.<br><br>The nature of a law protecting a view of dominance, therefore, is similar to one that establishes an easement; it imposes a burden (in this case, a building prohibition or restriction) upon certain properties so as to ensure that the prominent view of another property in relation to its background remains unimpaired.<br><br>Section 47 Does Not Prohibit or Regulate the Construction of Buildings and Other Structures Outside of the Premises of Manila's Historical Sites and Facilities; Its Standards Do Not Apply to DMCI-PDI and the Torre de Manila<br><br>Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119, true enough, enumerates standards that aim to protect Manila's historical sites and facilities from impairment. Those standards, however, do not extend protection to the view of dominance of such sites and facilities.<br><br>A reading of Section 47 reveals that the standards enumerated thereunder only apply to construction projects involving the "<i>development of historic sites and facilities</i>" themselves, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 47. <i>Historical Preservation and Conservation Standards</i>. - Historic sites and facilities shall be conserved and preserved. These shall, to the extent possible, be made accessible for the educational and cultural enrichment of the general public.<br><br>The following shall guide the <b>development of historic sites and facilities</b>:<br><br>x x x x (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The clear import of the foregoing is that Section 47 only applies to development projects that are implemented <i>within</i> the historical sites or facilities. The section, in other words, has absolutely no application to projects that are constructed outside of such site or facility.<br><br>Since Section 47 does not regulate, much less prohibit, construction projects that surrounds the city's historical sites and facilities, it cannot be said that the said section provides any protection or guarantee to the view of dominance of such sites and facilities. The standards under Section 47 could not be invoked so as to prohibit a building-standing on private land and without the premises of a historical site or facility-from rising and becoming visible in the background of such site or facility.<br><br>Hence, even assuming that the Rizal Monument is a historical site or facility in contemplation of Ordinance No. 8119, it is manifest that none of the standards under Section 47-much less those pointed out by the minority-can conceivably apply to the case of the DMCI-PDI and the <i>Torre de Manila</i>. Indeed, a thorough look at some of those standards will quickly expose their inaptness:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>. Section 47(3) of the ordinance, which requires the submission of a heritage impact statement and of construction plans to the City Planning and Development Office and the NHCP for review, only applies to property developers who propose to "<i>to add, to alter or partially demolish</i>" a heritage property. This cannot apply to the DMCI-PDI because the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building is built on private property well outside the premises of the Rizal Monument and even of the Rizal Park, and does not add to, alter or partially demolish the said monument and park.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>. Section 47(7) of the ordinance, which requires residential and commercial infill <i>in heritage areas</i> to maintain the existing "<i>landscape and streetscape</i>" qualities of such area, cannot apply to DMCI-PDI simply because the <i>Torre de Manila</i> does not stand on any such "<i>heritage area</i>."<br><br>Apropos to this point is the uncontroverted fact that the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building stands on an area that has not been declared as an "<i>anthropological or archeological area</i>," nor designated as a "<i>heritage zone, cultural property, historical landmark or a national treasure</i>" by the NHCP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>. Section 47(9) of the ordinance, which requires power and communication equipment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to be placed in locations that do not detract from the "<i>visual character</i>" of the heritage resources and which do not have negative impact on its architectural integrity, can never apply to DMCI-PDI because it is not a "<i>local utility company</i>" and its <i>Torre de Manila</i> project is not involved with the installation of any power and communication equipment in or within the Rizal Monument and Park.<br><br>Verily, none of the standards under Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119 may be considered as protective of the view of dominance of any of Manila's historical sites and facilities. Such standards are clearly meant to apply only to development projects <i>within</i> the historical sites or facilities themselves. None of them, consequently, can have any possible application to DMCI-PDI and the <i>Torre de Manila</i>.<br><br><b><i>Standards Under Section 48 Cited By the Majority Are Mere General Norms on Construction Projects That Do Not Guarantee the View of Dominance of Adjacent Properties</i></b><br><br>Section 48 of Ordinance No. 8119, on the other hand, enumerates standards that aim to protect the character, environmental limitation, convenience and safety of properties and neighborhoods that are adjacent to a construction project. The section, by its terms, is meant to have universal application, <i>i.e.</i>, its standards apply to all construction projects within the city (such as the <i>Torre de Manila</i>) and are intended to protect any kind of properties or neighborhoods adjacent thereto (such as the Rizal Monument).<br><br>Be that as it may, Section 48 does not prescribe any concrete building prohibition or restriction on construction projects that are specially geared towards the preservation of the view of dominance of properties or neighborhoods adjacent thereto. The standards under Section 48 that were invoked by the majority are mere <b><i>general</i></b> norms that, <i>per se</i>, are insufficient to guarantee such view. The said standards do not establish operable norms by themselves and so, to gain substance, should be read with other provisions of the ordinance or of other laws:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>. The second paragraph of Section 48, which requires every construction project to be "<i>in harmony with the existing and intended character of its neighborhoods</i>," obviously has reference to the provisions of Ordinance No. 8119 that demarcates the different zoning areas of the City of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This does not guarantee the view of dominance of neighborhoods adjacent to a construction project, but only requires the latter to adhere to the "<i>character</i>" of such neighborhoods as "<i>intended</i>" by the zoning regulations.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>. Section 48(1), which requires construction projects to consider the "<i>natural environmental character</i>" of adjacent properties, has perceptible reference to the provisions of the National Building Code on sanitation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as well as to our different environmental laws and regulations. This provision actually has no connection whatsoever with protecting the view of dominance of a property adjacent to a construction project.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>. Section 48(7), which prohibits large commercial signages that are detrimental to the "<i>skyline</i>," is an adjunct of Section 36 of Ordinance No. 8119 that, in turn, states that all "<i>advertising, business signs and billboards</i>" must comply with "<i>existing laws, rules and regulations</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This is not a direct guarantee of the view of dominance of any property, but a general prohibition against certain kinds of signages. Moreover, for obvious reasons, this provision cannot apply to the <i>Torre de Manila</i>.<br><br>Verily, none of the standards under Section 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 may be considered as protective of the view of dominance of any of property within the city, much less of the Rizal Monument.<br><br><center><b><u>B. Mandamus to Compel Re-evaluation Does Not Lie</u></b><br></center><br>The minority's proposition compelling the City of Manila to re­evaluate the permits it issued to DMCI-PDI is premised on the claim that the former, in so issuing the said permits, overlooked certain standards under Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 that supposedly protects the view of dominance of Manila's historical sites and facilities. The underlying purpose of the re-evaluation was to allow the City of Manila to determine, in essence, the following: (a) whether the Rizal Monument and Park is a historical site or facility in contemplation of Ordinance No. 8119, (b) whether the abovementioned standards in Sections 47 and 48 apply to the DMCI-PDI and the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building and, if so, (c) whether DMCI­-PDI, in erecting the said building, had breached or impaired any of such standards.<br><br>My discussion in the immediately preceding segment, however, established that none of the standards under Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 actually extends protection to the view of dominance of any property within Manila. It cannot be said, therefore, that the City of Manila had overlooked, misinterpreted or misapplied any pertinent standards when it issued the permits to DMCI-PDI. The need for a re-evaluation is thereby also negated as the possibility that the same would yield an outcome different from the original evaluation is but reduced to nil.<br><br>Hence, the directive compelling the City of Manila to re-evaluate the permits of DMCI-PDI must fail. A re-evaluation will only waste resources, further delay the final resolution of the case and defeat the very purpose why we took cognizance of the petition in the first place. The compulsion of such an act is certainly not the office of the writ of <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>This case has been pending with us for more than two (2) years. In that time I certainly had ample opporttmity to scour our statute books for any pertinent law or regulation that could be considered as protective of the Rizal Monument's view of dominance. And scour I did. Yet, I found none.<br><br>The absence of law protecting the view of dominance of the Rizal Monument strips the first argument of any semblance it might have first had as a <i>bona fide</i> legal dispute. Without the backing of law, the only query the argument actually brings to the fore is whether the Rizal Monument is still pleasing to look at or to take picture of in light of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> looming in its background. To my mind, that is not a question that the Court may dabble into, much less settle in the exercise of its judicial power.<br><br>For whatever it is worth, however, may I just add that not all viewing and photographic opportunities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Rizal Monument have been lost as a consequence of the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i>. From my own personal observation, the visibility <i>Torre de Manila</i> building in the backdrop of the Rizal Monument is highly dependent on the distance and angle from which the monument is viewed.<br><br>Thus, while one vantage point does expose the <i>Torre de Manila</i> in the background of the Rizal Monument:<br><br>(see image)<br><br>Other vantage points permit a view of the Rizal Monument with only a minimum of, if not totally without, the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building in sight:<br><br>(see image)<br><br>Hence, even from a lay perspective, it cannot be gainsaid that the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building had deprived anyone of the chance to view or photograph the Rizal Monument without the said building looming in the background.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Now, I vote.<br><br>It has been said that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> only lies in the enforcement of a clear legal right on the part of the petitioner and in the compulsion of a clear legal duty on the part of the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Here, it has been established that there is no law, whether national or local, that protects the view of dominance of the Rizal Monument or prohibits DMCI-PDI from constructing in its land a building such as the <i>Torre de Manila</i>. The conclusion, to my mind, is inevitable-petitioner is not entitled to the writ inasmuch as there is no compellable duty on the part of any of the respondents to stop or prohibit the construction of the <i>Torre de Manila</i> building or to otherwise destroy so much of the said building already constructed.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the instant petition for <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The petition was actually originally filed against respondent DMCI Homes, Inc.

Petition for <i>mandamus</i>. - When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Based on jurisprudence, the peremptory writ of <i>mandamus</i> is characterized as "<u>an extraordinary remedy that is issued only in extreme necessity, and [because] the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford an adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the performance of the act to be compelled</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Thus, it is a basic principle that "<b><u>[a] writ of <i>mandamus</i> can be issued only when petitioner's legal right to the performance of a particular act which is sought to be compelled is clear and complete</u></b>. <b>A clear legal right is a right which is indubitably granted by law or is inferable as a matter of law.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Stated otherwise, "<u><b><i><i>mandamus</i> will issue only when the petitioner has a clear legal right to the performance o(the act sought to be compelled and the respondent has an imperative duty to perform the same</i></b></u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>As a corollary, it is fundamental that "<b><u>[t]he remedy of <i>mandamus</i> lies [only] to compel the performance of a ministerial duty</u></b>. A purely ministerial act or duty is one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, <b><u>without regard to or the exercise of its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer, and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In this case, the clarity and completeness of petitioner's legal right to the compulsion prayed for - <i>i.e.</i>, to stop the construction of the Torre de Manila - remains suspect in view of <b><u>the present lack of established and binding legal standards on the protection of sightlines and vistas of historical monuments, as well as heritage sites and/or areas</u></b>.<br><br>Primarily, petitioner cites Sections 15<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and 16,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution as basis for the relief prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, it is quite apparent that these are not self-executing provisions; thus, Congress must first enact a law that would provide guidelines for the regulation of heritage conservation, as well as the penalties for violations thereof. Otherwise stated, there is a need for supplementary statutory implementation to give effect to these provisions.<br><br>In this light, I join the <i>ponencia</i> in finding that there is currently no such law which specifically prohibits the construction of any structure that may obstruct the sightline, setting, or backdrop of a historical or cultural heritage or resource.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This prohibition is neither explicit nor deducible from any of the statutory laws discussed in the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> There are several laws which consistently reiterate the State's policy to protect and conserve the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources. However, none of them adequately map out the boundaries of protection and/or conservation, at least to the extent of providing this Court with a reasonable impression that sightlines, vistas, and the like of historical monuments are indeed covered by compulsive limitations.<br><br>The closest to a statutory regulation of this kind would appear to be Section 25 of Republic Act No. (RA) 10066, which provides that:<br><blockquote>SEC. 25.<i> Power to Issue a Cease and Desist Order</i>. - <b>When <u>the physical integrity of the national cultural treasures or important cultural properties</u> are found to be in danger of destruction or significant alteration from its original state, the appropriate cultural agency shall immediately issue a Cease and Desist Order <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> suspending all activities that will affect the cultural property.</b> The local government unit which has the jurisdiction over the site where the immovable cultural property is located shall report the same to the appropriate cultural agency immediately upon discovery and shall promptly adopt measures to secure the integrity of such immovable cultural property. Thereafter, the appropriate cultural agency shall give notice to the owner or occupant of the cultural property and conduct a hearing on the propriety of the issuance of the Cease and Desist Order. The suspension of the activities shall be lifted only upon the written authority of the appropriate cultural agency after due notice and hearing involving the interested parties and stakeholders. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>However, it is unclear whether "physical integrity," as used in this provision, covers sightlines, vistas, settings, and backdrops. The concept of "physical integrity" is glaringly undefined in the law, and in fact, as the <i>ponencia</i> aptly points out, the reasonable inference is that "physical integrity [equates] to the structure itself - how strong and sound it is."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For another, petitioner claims that the Torre de Manila project violates the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages, as well as the International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, otherwise known as the Venice Charter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, the NHCP Guidelines is neither a law nor an enforceable rule or regulation, considering the lack of showing that the requirements of publication and filing with the Law Center of the University of the Philippines were complied with. Meanwhile, as the <i>ponencia</i> aptly points out, the Venice Charter is not a treaty but "merely a codification of guiding principles for preservation and restoration of ancient monuments, sites[,] and buildings[,]" which, however, defers to each country the "responsib[ility] for applying the plan within the framework of its own culture and traditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Hence, the guidelines stated therein have no binding effect in this jurisdiction.<br><br>Neither can <b><u>Manila Ordinance No. 8119</u></b> be considered as an existing local legislation that provides a clear and specific duty on the part of respondent City of Manila (the City of Manila) to regulate development projects insofar as these may adversely affect the view, vista, sightline or setting of a cultural property within the city. While I find this ordinance to be a binding regulation which not merely sets forth a tentative direction or instruction for property development within the city,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it is my view that none of its provisions justify the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i> in favor of petitioner.<br><br>The minority proposes that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> be issued to re­evaluate with dispatch the permits and variance issued in favor of DMCI Project Developers, Inc. (DMCI-PDI)'s Torre de Manila project, and thereby determine the applicability and/or compliance with the standards under <b><u>Sections 45, 53, 47, 48, and 60 (in relation to the grant of a variance) of Ordinance No. 8119</u></b>, and eventually, grant the appropriate reliefs and sanctions under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>However, <b><u>Sections 45 and 53 of Ordinance No. 8119</u></b> respectively pertain to environmental conservation and protection standards, and the requirement of Environmental Compliance Certificates, and thus, are only relevant when there is an alleged violation of an environmental law affecting the natural resources within the City's premises:<br><blockquote>SEC. 45. <u>Environmental Conservation and Protection Standards.</u> ­ It is the intent of the City to protect its natural resources. In order to achieve this objective, all development shall comply with the following regulations:<br><ol><li>Views shall be preserved for public enjoyment especially in sites with high scenic quality by closely considering building orientation, height, bulk, fencing and landscaping.<br></li></ol>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 53. <u>Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC).</u> - Notwithstanding the issuance of zoning permit (locational clearance) Section 63 of this Ordinance, no environmentally critical projects nor projects located in environmentally critical areas shall be commenced, developed or operated unless the requirements of ECC have been complied with.<br></blockquote>In this case, the Rizal Monument is not claimed to be a natural resource whose view should be preserved in accordance with Section 45 (1) above. Neither was it claimed that the Torre de Manila project is covered by and/or has breached the ECC requirement under Section 53. Therefore, none of these provisions should apply to this case.<br><br>In the same vein, <b><u>Section 48</u></b> of Ordinance No. 8119 provides for site performance standards, which, among others, only require that developments within the City be designed in a safe, efficient, and <b>aesthetically pleasing manner</b>:<br><blockquote>SEC. 48. <u>Site Performance Standards.</u> - <u>The City considers it in the <b>public interest</b> that all projects are designed and developed in a safe, efficient and <b>aesthetically pleasing manner</b>.</u> Site development shall consider the environmental character and limitations of the site and its adjacent properties. All project elements shall be in complete harmony according to good design principles and the subsequent development must be visually pleasing as well as efficiently functioning especially in relation to the adjacent properties and bordering streets.<br><br>The design, construction, operation and maintenance of every facility shall be <u>in harmony with the existing and intended character of its neighborhood</u>. It shall not change the essential character of the said area but will be a substantial improvement to the value of the properties in the neighborhood in particular and the community in general.<br><br>Furthermore, designs should consider the following:<br><ol><li>Sites, buildings and facilities shall be designed and developed with regard to safety, efficiency and high standards of design. <b>The natural environmental character of the site and its adjacent properties shall be considered in the site development of each building and facility.</b><br><br></li><li>The height and bulk of buildings and structures shall be so designed that it does not impair the entry of light and ventilation, cause the loss of privacy and/or create nuisances, hazards or inconveniences to adjacent developments.<br><br>x x x x</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>No large commercial signage and/or pylon, <b>which will be detrimental to the skyline</b>, shall be allowed.<br><br></li><li>Design guidelines, deeds of restriction, property management plans and other regulatory tools that will ensure high quality developments shall be required from developers of commercial subdivisions and condominiums. These shall be submitted to the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) for review and approval. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>It is not inferable whether the "aesthetics" requirement under this provision precludes any form of obstruction on the sightline and vista of any historical monument within the City. It also does not account for a situation where the assailed development and historical monument are located in different cluster zones.<br><br>It has not also been claimed that the natural environmental character of the adjacent properties within the Torre de Manila's cluster zone, per Section 48, paragraph 3 (1) above, has been negatively impacted by the latter's construction. As worded, this provision regulates only environmental and not historical considerations; thus, it is premised with the requirement that "[s]ites, buildings and facilities [be] designed and developed with regard to safety, efficiency and high standards of design."<br><br>Likewise, Section 48, paragraph 3 (8) is inapplicable, considering that the Torre de Manila project is not a large commercial signage and/or pylon (or claimed to be an equivalent thereof) that would prove to be detrimental to the City's skyline.<br><br>Meanwhile, <b><u>Section 60</u></b> of Ordinance No. 8119 governs the grant of variances from the prescribed Land Use Intensity Control (LUIC) standards (among others, the Floor Area Ratio [FAR]) on buildings within a specific zone:<br><blockquote>SEC. 60. <u>Deviations.</u> - Variances and exceptions from the provisions of this Ordinance may be allowed by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> as per recommendation from the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals (MZBAA) through the Committee on Housing, Urban Development and Resettlements only when all the following terms and conditions are obtained/ existing:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Variance - all proposed projects which do not conformed [sic] with the prescribed allowable Land Use Intensity Control (LUIC) in the zone.<br><ol type="a"><br><li>The property is unique and different from other properties in the adjacent locality and, because of its uniqueness, the owner/s cannot obtain a reasonable return on the property.<br></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>This condition shall include at least three (3) of the following provisions:<br><blockquote>- Conforming to the provisions of the Ordinance will cause undue hardship on the part of the owner or occupant of the property due to physical conditions of the property (topography, shape, etc.), which is not self­-created.<br><br>- The proposed variance is the mm1mum deviation necessary to permit reasonable use of the property.<br><br>- The variance will not alter the physical character of the district/zone where the property for which the variance sought is located, and will not substantially or permanently injure the use of the other properties in the same district or zone.<br><br>- That the variance will not weaken the general purpose of the Ordinance and will not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare.<br><br>- The variance will be in harmony with the spirit of this Ordinance.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote></blockquote>In this case, the City of Manila had already exercised its discretion to grant a variance in favor of DMCI-PDI's Torre de Manila project. The factors taken into account by the City of Manila in the exercise of such discretion are beyond the ambit of a <i>mandamus</i> petition. As above­mentioned, "<b><u>[t]he remedy of <i>mandamus</i> lies [only] to compel the performance of a ministerial duty</u></b>" which is "one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, <b><u>without regard to or the exercise of its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It is settled that "[<i>m</i>]<i>andamus</i> is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its chief use and not a discretionary duty. It is nonetheless likewise available to compel action, when refused, in matters involving judgment and discretion, <b><u>but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way or the retraction or reversal of an action already taken in the exercise of either</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Further, while it has not been shown whether the conditions stated in Section 60 were complied with, it remains unclear whether or not these provisions can be - as it has been previously been - suspended due to justifiable reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>What remains undisputed is the fact that DMCI-PDI applied for a variance, which application, upon due deliberation of the City's MZBAA, has been granted. Again, whether proper or not, the fact remains that discretion has already been exercised by the City of Manila. Thus, <i>mandamus</i> is not the appropriate remedy to enjoin compliance with the provisions on variance. Needless to state, erring public officials who are found to have irregularly exercised their functions may, however, be subjected to administrative/criminal sanctions in the proper proceeding therefor.<br><br>Finally, <b><u>Section 47</u></b> of Ordinance No. 8119, which enumerates several historical preservation and conservation standards, was supposedly not considered by the City of Manila when it allowed the construction of the Torre de Manila:<br><blockquote>SEC. 47. <u>Historical Preservation and Conservation Standards.</u> - Historic sites and facilities shall be conserved and preserved. These shall, to the extent possible, be made accessible for the educational and cultural enrichment of the general public.<br><br>The following shall guide the development of historic sites and facilities:<br><ol><li>Sites with historic buildings or places shall be developed to conserve and enhance their heritage values.<br><br></li><li><b>Historic sites and facilities shall be adaptively re-used.</b><br><br></li><li>Any person who proposes to <b>add, to alter, or partially demolish</b> a <b>designated heritage property</b> will require the approval of the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) and shall be required to prepare a heritage impact statement that will <b>demonstrate to the satisfaction of CPDO that the proposal will not adversely impact the heritage significance of the property and shall submit plans for review by the CPDO in coordination with the National Historical Institute (NHI)</b>.<br><br></li><li>Any proposed alteration and/or re-use of designated heritage properties shall be evaluated based on criteria established by the heritage significance of the particular property or site.<br><br></li><li>Where an owner of a heritage property applies for approval to demolish a designated heritage property or properties, the owner shall be required to provide evidence to satisfaction [sic] that demonstrates that rehabilitation and re-use of the property is not viable.<br><br></li><li>Any designated heritage property which is to be demolished or significantly altered, shall be thoroughly documented for archival purposes with a history, photographic records, and measured drawings, in accordance with accepted heritage recording guidelines, prior to demolition or alteration.<br><br></li><li>Residential and commercial infill in heritage areas will be sensitive to the existing scale and pattern of those areas, which <b><u>maintains the existing landscape and streetscape qualities of those areas</u></b>, and which does not result in the loss of any heritage resources.<br><br></li><li>Development plans shall ensure that parking facilities (surface lots, residential garages, stand-alone parking garages and parking components as parts of larger developments) are compatibly integrated into heritage areas, and/or are compatible with adjacent heritage resources.<br><br></li><li>Local utility companies (hydro, gas, telephone, cable) shall be required to place metering equipment, transformer boxes, power lines, conduit, equipment boxes, piping, wireless telecommunication towers and other utility equipment and devices in locations <b><u>which do not detract from the visual character of heritage resources, and which do not have a negative impact on its architectural integrity</u></b>.<br><br></li><li>Design review approval shall be secured from the CPDO for any alteration of the heritage property to ensure that design guidelines and standards are met and shall promote preservation and conservation of the heritage property. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>However, the fact that Section 47 speaks of the preservation of existing landscape and streetscape qualities (Section 47, paragraph 2 [7]), or conveys a mandate to local utility companies not to detract from the visual character of heritage resources (Section 47, paragraph 2 [9]) should not be enough for this Court to conclude that Ordinance No. 8119 imposes a prohibition against the obstruction of sightlines and vistas of a claimed heritage property via the construction of buildings at a particular distance therefrom. The operable norms and standards of protecting vistas and sightlines are not only undefined; it is also doubtful whether or not the phrases "landscape or streetscape qualities" and "visual character of heritage resources" as used in the provision even include the aspects of vistas and sightlines, which connote regulation <b>beyond the boundaries of a heritage site, building or place</b>, as in this case.<br><br>In the same light, it is also unclear whether or not a purported obstruction of a heritage property's vista and sightline would mean an "addition", "alteration", and/or "demolition" of the said property so as to trigger the application of Section 47, paragraph 2 (3) (which requires the prior submission of a heritage impact statement and the approval of the CPDO) and Section 47, paragraph 2 (4) (requiring evaluation based on the criteria of heritage significance) of Ordinance No. 8119. In fact, it would be sensible to conclude that these concepts of "addition", "alteration", and/or "demolition" relate to the concept of "physical integrity" in Section 25 of RA 10066, which as above-discussed pertains only to the architectural stability of the structure.<br><br>Plainly speaking, there is no discernible reference from our existing body of laws from which we can gather any legal regulation on a heritage property's vista and sightline. After a careful study of this case, it is my conclusion that the realm of setting preservation is a new frontier of law that is yet to be charted by our lawmakers. It is therefore a political question left for Congress and not for this Court to presently decide. Verily, our function as judges is to interpret the law; it is not for us to conjure legal niceties from general policies yet undefined by legislature. Until such time that our legal system evolves on this subject, I believe that this Court is unprepared to grant a <i>mandamus</i> petition to compel the stoppage of the Torre De Manila project simply on the premise that the Torre de Manila "visually obstructs the vista and adds an unattractive sight to what was once a lovely public image."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In fact, this bare claim even appears to be in serious dispute, considering that the NHCP itself confirmed that the Torre de Manila was "outside the boundaries of the Rizal Park and well to the rear x x x of the Rizal National Monument; hence, <b><u>it cannot possibly obstruct the front view of the said National Monument</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Likewise, the City Legal Officer of Manila City confirmed that the area on which the Torre de Manila is situated "lies outside the Luneta Park" and that it was "<b><u>simply too far from the Rizal Monument to be a repulsive distraction or have an objectionable effect on the artistic and historical significance of the hallowed resting place of the national hero</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> And finally, DMCI-PDI had demonstrated that the Rizal Monument can be viewed/photographed at certain angles to avoid or at least minimize the Torre de Manila's presence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thus, the obstructive effects of the building on the monument's sightline are not only questionable but at most, insubstantial.<br><br>To reiterate, case law exhorts that for <i>mandamus</i> to issue, it must be shown that the petitioner has <b><u><i>a clear legal right to the performance of the act sought to be compelled and the respondent has an imperative duty to perform the same</i></u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The jurisprudential attribution is, in fact, exacting: "<b><u>[a] clear legal right is a right which is indubitably granted by law or is inferable as a matter of law</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> No such right of petitioner exists in this case. Neither do any of the respondents have the imperative duty to stop the Torre de Manila's construction.<br><br>Accordingly, for the reasons discussed herein, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the <i>mandamus</i> petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See <i>rollo</i>, Vol. I, pp. 3-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Original respondent, DMCI Homes, Inc., was subsequently substituted by respondent DMCI Project Developers, Inc., as the owner and developer of the Torre de Manila project (see Manifestation and Motion of DMCI-PDI dated October 14, 2014; <i>rollo</i>, Vol. I, pp. 240-242).

Adjoining properties owned by others have not been declared as national shrines.<br><br>Together with the Solicitor General, the petitioners argue that a specific view of the Rizal Monument is a legally protected right. They insist that even if the Rizal Monument is clearly in the foreground, the existence of the building of private respondents in the background violates that legally protected right. They insist that that background amounts to an alteration of the monument. They, however, fail to point to any clear text found in the Constitution, a statute, or an ordinance which contains this prestation. They have not succeeded in convincing this Court that there is precedent supporting their aesthetic propositions.<br><br>The dissent also acknowledges this. They agree that the temporary restraining order should be lifted. The dissent, however, insists that the matter be remanded to the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Manila to allow them, again, to deliberate as to whether to allow the construction or to cause its demolition.<br><br>I concur with the ponencia of Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio. There is no such law which mandates that the Rizal Monument, at a specific angle, should have only a specific background.<br><br>The Solicitor General and the petitioners are motivated by their passion, which can be summed up in a statement and which they want this Court to believe as a truism: a view of the monument with a tall building as background destroys the "soul of our nation." They claim that this gaze with a "photobomber" so undermines every conceivable narrative we can have of Rizal that there will be no way that our collective history as a people can be redeemed if we do not order the building to be tom down. They wish this Court of 15 unelected public servants to read this specific version of history into the Constitution of this Republic. They want us to declare that the monument of Rizal is so sacred that it should dwarf any other human structure without any other judicially discernible standard.<br><br>I do not agree.<br><br>There is no law which inscribes such narrative. There is no law that empowers any majority of the 15 members of this Supreme Court to impose our own narrative of our country's own history.<br><br>History, like every other cultural understanding of who we are, is the dynamic product of constant democratic deliberation. To impose only a single version is akin to installing a dictatorship or disempowering present and future generations. Our history as a people is always in flux: always being written and always being reread in the light of contemporary challenges.<br><br>The Petition for Injunction, amended by this Court into a Petition for Mandamus, should fail.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>This Petition should have been dismissed outright. The petitioners did not have standing and this Court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case that the Petition, originally for injunction, had to be converted to <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br>Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.<br></blockquote>For this Court to exercise its power of judicial review, four (4) requisites must be satisfied.

The retrieval and conservation of artifacts of Filipino culture and history shall be vigorously pursued.<br></blockquote>However, like any other corporation, petitioner Knights of Rizal may only exercise its corporate powers, specifically, its power to sue,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> through its Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> There must be a duly issued Secretary's Certificate attached to the petition stating that the corporation's board allowed the filing of the suit in behalf of the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Here, the Secretary's Certificate was not duly accomplished.

"[Losing] its moral authority and capacity 'to inculcate and propagate...

Further, Knights of Rizal is not a <i>citizen</i> with the duty to preserve and conserve historical and cultural heritage.<br><br>In <i>Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> this Court denied legal standing to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for the organization's lack of direct and personal injury in the deployment of the Marines in select areas in Metro Manila. "[The IBP's] alleged responsibility to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court said, was not sufficient an interest considering the lack of allegation that the civil liberties of any of its individual members were violated. Explained the Court:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the IBP primarily anchors its standing on its alleged responsibility to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. Apart from this declaration, however, the IBP asserts no other basis in support of its <i>locus standi</i>. The mere invocation by the IBP of its duty to preserve the rule of law and nothing more, while undoubtedly true, is not sufficient to clothe it with standing in this case. This is too general an interest which is shared by other groups and the whole citizenry. Based on the standards above-stated, the IBP has failed to present a specific and substantial interest in the resolution of the case. Its fundamental purpose which, under Section 2, Rule 139-A of the Rules of Court, is to elevate the standards of the law profession and to improve the administration of justice is alien to, and cannot be affected by the deployment of the Marines. It should also be noted that the interest of the National President of the IBP who signed the petition, is his alone, absent a formal board resolution authorizing him to file the present action. To be sure, members of the BAR, those in the judiciary included, have varying opinions on the issue. Moreover, the IBP, assuming that it has duly authorized the National President to file the petition, has not shown any specific injury which it has suffered or may suffer by virtue of the questioned governmental act. Indeed, none of its members, whom the IBP purportedly represents, has sustained any form of injury as a result of the operation of the joint visibility patrols. Neither is it alleged that any of its members has been arrested or that their civil liberties have been violated by the deployment of the Marines. What the IBP projects as injurious is the supposed "militarization" of law enforcement which might threaten Philippine democratic institutions and may cause more harm than good in the long run. Not only is the presumed "injury" not personal in character, it is likewise too vague, highly speculative and uncertain to satisfy the requirement of standing. Since petitioner has not successfully established a direct and personal injury as a consequence of the questioned act, it does not possess the personality to assail the validity of the deployment of the Marines. This Court, however, does not categorically rule that the IBP has absolutely no standing to raise constitutional issues now or in the future. The IBP must, by way of allegations and proof, satisfy this Court that it has sufficient stake to obtain judicial resolution of the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>With petitioner Knights of Rizal having no direct and personal interest in this case, it has no legal standing. On this ground alone, this Petition should have been dismissed outright.<br><br>The liberality in granting legal standing to those who have none should be tempered especially when the party suing is a corporation, the composition and nature of which inherently make the determination of direct and <i>personal</i> interest difficult. This is especially true in cases involving alleged violations of provisions under the Bill of Rights, which primarily involves "fundamental <i>individual</i> rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The constitutional issue raised here is indeed novel. This Court has yet to decide on the extent of protection the State has to afford to our nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, specifically, whether a declared national cultural treasure's sightlines and settings are part of its physical integrity.<br><br>Nevertheless, novelty, in it itself, does not equate to the transcendental importance of the issues involved. Constitutional issues, however novel, may likewise be resolved by regional trial courts at the first instance. Regional trial courts and this Court share concurrent original jurisdiction over issues involving constitutional questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As pointed out in the majority opinion, factual issues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> were raised in this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This Court, not being a trier of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Petition should have been filed before the regional trial court. This is also consistent with the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Recourse must first be obtained from lower courts sharing concurrent jurisdiction with a higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Clarifying this concept in <i>Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>The doctrine that requires respect for the hierarchy of courts was created by this court to ensure that every level of the judiciary performs its designated roles in an effective and efficient manner. Trial courts do not only determine the facts from the evaluation of the evidence presented before them. They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is primarily designed as an appellate court that reviews the determination of facts and law made by the trial courts. It is collegiate in nature. This nature ensures more standpoints in the review of the actions of the trial court. But the Court of Appeals also has original jurisdiction over most special civil actions. Unlike the trial courts, its writs can have a nationwide scope. It is competent to determine facts and, ideally, should act on constitutional issues that may not necessarily be novel unless there are factual questions to determine.<br><br>This court, on the other hand, leads the judiciary by breaking new ground or further reiterating - in the light of new circumstances or in the light of some confusions of bench or bar existing precedents. Rather than a court of first instance or as a repetition of the actions of the Court of Appeals, this court promulgates these doctrinal devices in order that it truly performs that role.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>This Court also has no subject matter jurisdiction over this case.<br><br>Jurisdiction over the subject matter is the "power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> For this Court, its subject matter jurisdiction is provided in the first paragraph of Section 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5.

Petitioner Knights of Rizal has no clear legal right to an injunction against the construction of Torre de Manila. Petitioners failed to point to a law that specifically prohibits the construction of any structure that may obstruct the sightline, setting, or backdrop of a historical or cultural heritage or resource.<br><br>Petitioner Knights of Rizal mainly argues that the sightlines and setting of the Rizal Monument are protected under Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>SECTION 15.

The dissenting opinion considers that Sections 15 and 16 "do not create any judicially enforceable right and obligation for the preservation, protection or conservation of the prominence, dominance, vista points, vista corridors, sightlines and setting of the Rizal Park and the Rizal Monument."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It adds that Sections 15 and 16 are "mere statements of principles and policy"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and that "[t]he constitutional exhortation to 'conserve, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources' lacks 'specific, operable norms and standards' by which to guide its enforcement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As examples of other non-self-executing provisions in the Constitution, the dissent enumerates Sections 11,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> 12,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Article II; Sections 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Article XIII; and Sections 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Article XIV.

Textually, nothing in Sections 15 and 16 indicates that the sightlines and setting surrounding a historical and cultural heritage or resource is subject to protection. Sections 15 and 16 contain substantive standards too general to serve as basis <i>for courts</i> to grant any relief to petitioner Knights of Rizal.

The key is to examine if the provision contains a prestation and to which branch of the government it is directed. If addressed either to the legislature or the executive, the obligation is not for this Court to fulfill.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>There are no second-order provisions in the Constitution. We create this category when we classify the provisions as "self-executing" and "non­-self executing." Rather, the value of each provision is implicit in their normative content.<br><br>For instance, Sections 14, 15, 16, and 17, Article XIV of the Constitution must be read as provisions that contribute to each other's coherence. That is, we must interpret them holistically to understand the concepts labeled as culture and history. None of these provisions deserve to be read in isolation.<br><br>Section 14 reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 14. The State shall foster the preservation, enrichment, and dynamic evolution of a Filipino national culture based on the principle of unity in diversity in a climate of free artistic and intellectual expression.<br></blockquote>The object of the provision is a "Filipino national culture." In relation to this object, it is the State's duty to foster its "preservation, enrichment," and development. Our Filipino national culture should be based on the "principle of unity in diversity." It grows "in a climate of free artistic and intellectual expression."<br><br>Clearly, the Constitution acknowledges that culture exists at various levels and with many dimensions. In terms of social space, there is a "national" culture and local ones. There is diversity also among cultures. Ours is a multi-ethnic, multi-vocal, and multi-lingual state.<br><br>The Constitutional provision further implies that there can be unity both in the diversity of our culture as well as in their commonalities. Thus, the cultures that vary in terms of their spatial, ethnic, or linguistic applications are not mutually exclusive of each other. They interact and reflect each other.<br><br>Significantly, culture evolves. It is not only to be preserved; it should also be enriched. It is not to archaically retard; it must develop. Intrinsic in the very concept of culture is that it is dynamic. "Free artistic and intellectual expression" ensures its malleability so that it becomes appropriate to the contemporary world while at the same time maintaining the values embedded in a common framework that defines the implicit ways of life that we transmit through generations.<br><br>Section 15 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 15. Arts and letters shall enjoy the patronage of the State. The State shall conserve, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations.<br></blockquote>Section 16 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 16. All the country's artistic and historic wealth constitutes the cultural treasure of the nation and shall be under the protection of the State which may regulate its disposition.<br></blockquote>These provisions recognize the importance of arts and letters as cultural artifact. This provision, thus, acknowledges the State's duty to "conserve, promote, and popularize" five (5) artifacts: (a) historical heritage, (b) historical resources, (c) cultural heritage, (d) cultural resources, and (e) artistic creations.<br><br>Section 15 distinguishes between history and culture. History is a narrative of our past. Culture, on the other hand, encompasses the implicit social understanding of the ways of life that we transmit from generation to generation. While history is a contemporary narration of our past, culture is always contemporary with inspiration from both our past and our ambitions towards a common future.<br><br>History can explain or reflect on our culture. Culture, on the other hand, provides the frame for understanding our history. They both relate to each other. Being aspects of social consciousness, they also both evolve.<br><br>History and culture produce material things which can be preserved because they serve the purpose of symbolism. Historical heritage may consist of the monuments that will cause collective reflection. Historical resources are the materials which can be used to understand and perhaps clarify narratives of our past.<br><br>Of course, Section 16 also acknowledges artistic creations, which may not be the product of historical narrative or of culture. It thus provides an opening for the introduction of present understandings of culture. Artists are not necessarily bound by a view of the past. Art can also be an insight to our future.<br><br>Section 17 provides for acknowledgement of indigenous culture, thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 17. The State shall recognize, respect, and protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions, and institutions. It shall consider these rights in the formulation of national plans and policies.<br></blockquote>This provision implies that culture may be indigenous, but not entirely so. By giving protection to the culture of indigenous communities in terms of their traditions and institutions, it impliedly also acknowledges that there are portions of our culture borrowed from our interaction with the outside world. In this view, culture is assumed to be dynamic. It is not unchanging.<br><br>In a democracy, dominant social, historical, and even cultural understanding is and will always be contested. Present generations are imbued with intrinsic rights to give their own reading of past events. They are not passive receptacles of cultural transmissions of their ancestors. It is they who live through the challenges of their generation and it is they, who armed with their variations on culture and their reading of history, contribute to our sense of nationhood.<br><br>Thus, our Constitution acknowledges the importance of freedom of expression. Nuance and dissent provide a rich but continuous stream of contestation. Dominant understanding is always challenged by newer ones. It is through these challenges to understanding of the past that history and culture undergo constant enrichment and development. There is the constant problem of the real significance of events as well as personalities that animate our history. History becomes more contemporarily legible to the present generation.<br><br>Historians constantly discover more evidence and factual detail in past events which produce better insights of ourselves.<br><br>In this context, no hero can be venerated as unchanging nor as eternal god. No narrative of a hero should be accepted as more impervious than religious truth. No hero should be venerated exclusively as the "soul of the nation."<br><br>Similarly, no monument is so sacred that the way that it is seen and the meaning of such gaze should be kept unchanging.<br><br>The argument that the background of the Rizal Monument should be unchanging would be to attempt to impose several layers of inference that cumulate into an unreasonable view of how we should understand Jose Rizal, the extent that he was a protagonist during his historical period, and the significance of the events for us at present.<br><br>For instance, Jose Rizal's humility can be inferred through a letter he wrote and which was discovered posthumously. In a letter to his brother, he expressed his desire to be buried in an unmarked grave in a cemetery in Paco, Manila. This humility in public service may be lost when we insist that a monument, which Jose Rizal never imagined, commissioned to a Swiss artist, depicting him as dominant over all others who bled for our freedom, is profusely venerated.<br><br>This veneration amounts to a dominant narrative that petitioner wishes to impose. More troubling is that the petitioner wants to do so undemocratically: through a judicial writ.<br><br>Symbols mark a consensus which can change through time. By itself, it has no intrinsic value. It is not the material that should be protected. Rather, it is the values implicit in the symbolism which take part in a narrative.<br><br>Jose Rizal fought for a democratic society where every citizen could be educated and therefore critical of the dominant understandings imposed by the powerful. We deny him that vision when we impose on others a view of the aesthetic by judicial fiat.<br><br><center><b>VI</b><br></center><br>Before Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, he wrote his family expressing his wishes for his burial. The letter reads, in part:<br><blockquote>Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries.

Act No. 243 authorized the use of Luneta for the building of a monument in honor of Rizal. The cost would be from publicly-raised funds am supervised by a committee composed of Paciano Rizal, Pascual Poblete, Juan Tuason, Teodoro Yangco, Mariano Limjap, Maximino Paterno, Ramon Genato, Tomas del Rosario, and Ariston Bautista. The Philippine Commission then passed Act No. 893<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in 1903, appropriating US$15,000.00 to augment the fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The committee was also tasked to oversee the international design competition from 1905 to 1907.

On January 8, 1908, another committee composed of Governor-General James F. Smith, John T. Macleod, and Maximino M.

The suspension of the activities shall be lifted only upon the written authority of the appropriate cultural agency after due notice and hearing involving the interested parties and stakeholders.<br></blockquote>Petitioner Knights of Rizal argues that a national cultural treasure's "physical integrity" includes its "vista points" and "visual corridors" as well as its "site" or its "surrounding areas." As basis for its argument, petitioner Knights of Rizal cites the National Historical Commission of the Philippines' Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages:<br><blockquote>1. <b>DOMINANCE</b><br><br>Monuments are landmarks of our cities, towns and provinces. They must be honored, preserved and protected. Monuments should be given due prominence since they symbolize national significance. For the purposes of these guidelines, the Rizal National Monument in Luneta (Rizal Park, Manila) and the Bonifacio National Monument (Caloocan City) are established as objects of reference ...<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Facade of buildings around a monument, particularly on a rotunda or circle can be retrofitted with a uniform design to enhance the urban renewal of the site and the prominence and dominance of the monument. Likewise, building heights, volume and design should be regulated.<br><br><b>Measures by which dominance could be achieved are the following:</b><br><ol type="a"><li>Maintain a clean and neat environment;<br></li><li>Keep vista points and visual corridors to monuments clear for unobstructed viewing appreciation and photographic opportunities;<br></li><li>Maintain a simple and environmental-friendly landscape. Provide plants and trees wherever appropriate, to enhance and soften the built areas;<br></li><li>Commercial billboards should not proliferate in a town center where a dominant monument is situated; Limit building signage throughout the second level of buildings around the monument; Cities, municipalities and provinces shall adopt these billboard and building signage regulations by passing local ordinances;<br></li><li>Introduce creative design devices such as paved walkways, attractive ground cover and rows of tall trees to make the monument the main attraction of the site;<br></li><li>The monument may be elevated on a mound or a platform to emphasize its importance;<br></li><li>Use strong contrast between the monument .and its background. This will enhance the monument as a focal point of site; and,<br></li><li>Enclosing structures may be used to emphasize and protect the monument.<br></li></ol>The scale of the figure of an outdoor monument should be kept to an ideal standard, which may be governed by the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="25%">Minimum</td><td width="75%">: Life-size</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum</td><td>: Twice the life-size</td></tr><tr><td>Landmark/Monumental structures</td><td>: More than the life-size</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The scale would depend on the size of the open space where the monument shall be placed in relation to human perception. The larger the open space, the taller the monument. As a rule of thumb, no full-bodied monument must be smaller than life-size. The scales used by sculptors are usually one-and-a-half times the life-size or twice the life-size. These sizes, when placed on corresponding proportional pedestals, would appear life-size at an appropriate viewing distance. The over-all effect of the site should be an overwhelming experience. This feeling, thus, contributes to the effectiveness of the learning message the monument conveys.<br><br>2. <b>SITE AND ORIENTATION</b><br><ol type="A"><li>SITE/SETTING the area or territory where a monument is found or located. The setting is not only limited with the exact area that is directly occupied by the monument, but it extends to the surrounding areas whether open space or occupied by other structures as may be defined by the traditional or juridical expanse of the property.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Articles 1 and 6 of the International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites or the Venice Charter, petitioner argues, also require the conservation of a monument's setting:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1. The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>ARTICLE 6. The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and colour must be allowed.<br></blockquote>Again, textually, nothing in Republic Act Nos. 4846, 7356, and 10066 provides that the "physical integrity" of a historical or cultural property includes its sightlines and settings. As for the National Historical Commission of the Philippines' Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages, they do not have any legal effect. It has not been shown that these Guidelines were published<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> or that a copy was deposited in the University of the Philippines Law Center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Assuming that these Guidelines have the force of law, they allow for "urban renewal" of the site surrounding a monument. In this case, there is resistance against this "urban renewal" considering that Torre de Manila is the first high-rise building visible at the Rizal Monument's backdrop. However, as submitted by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines during the hearing on August 27, 2014 conducted by the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and Culture, there is no law prohibiting the construction of Torre de Manila.<br><br>Further, the Venice Charter has not been concurred in by at least two­thirds of all the members of the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Hence, its provisions have no legal effect in this jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>IX</b><br></center><br>Curiously, however, in spite of an acknowledgement that neither the National Historical Commission of the Philippines' Guidelines nor the Venice Charter has legal effect, the dissent of Justice Jardeleza suggests that the Venice Charter should be given weight in legal interpretation. Thus:<br><blockquote>Similarly, neither can the Venice Charter be invoked to prohibit the construction of the Torre de Manila project. The Venice Charter provides, in general terms, the steps that must be taken by State Parties for the conservation and restoration of monuments and sites, including these properties' setting. It does not, however, rise to a level of enforceable law. There is no allegation that the Philippines has legally committed to observe the Venice Charter. Neither are we prepared to declare that its principles are norms of general or customary international law which are binding on all states. We further note that the terms of both the NHCP Guidelines and the Venice Charter appear hortatory and do not claim to be sources of legally enforceable rights. These documents only urge (not require) governments to adopt the principles they espouse through implementing laws.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Venice Charter and the NHCP Guidelines, along with various conservation conventions, recommendations and resolutions contained in multilateral cooperation and agreements by State and non­ state entities, do establish a significant fact: <b>At the time of the enactment of our Constitution in 1987, there has already been a <i>consistent</i> understanding of the term "conservation" in the culture, history and heritage context as to cover not only a heritage property's physical/tangible attributes, but also its <u>settings</u> (e.g., its surrounding neighborhood, landscapes, sites, sight lines, skylines, visual corridors and vista points)</b>.<br><br>The setting of a heritage culture, site or area is defined as "the immediate and extended environment that is part of, or contributes to, its significance and distinctive character." It is also referred to as "the surroundings in which a place is experienced, its local context, embracing present and past relationships to the adjacent landscape." It is further acknowledged as one of the sources from which heritage structures, sites and areas "derive their significance and distinctive character." Thus, any change to the same can "substantially and irretrievably affect" the significance of the heritage property.<br><br>The concept of settings was first formalized with the Xi'an Declaration on the Conservation of the Settings of Heritage Structures, Sites and Areas adopted by the 15<sup>th</sup> General Assembly of ICOMOS on October 21, 2005. The concept itself, however, has been acknowledged decades before, with references to settings, landscapes, and surroundings <b>appearing as early as 1962</b>.<br><br>To reiterate, our examination of the various multilateral and international documents on the matter shows a generally-accepted and oft­repeated understanding of "heritage conservation" as covering <i>more</i> than a cultural property's physical attributes to include its surroundings and settings. This "understanding" had, unarguably, already acquired "term of art" status even before the enactment of our Constitution in 1987. Verba <i>artis ex arte</i>. Terms of art should be explained from their usage in the art to which they belong.<br><br>We hold, absent proof of a clear constitutional expression to the contrary, that the foregoing understanding of heritage conservation provide more than sufficient justification against a <i>priori</i> limiting the plenary power of Congress to determine, through the enactment of laws, the scope and extent of heritage conservation in our jurisdiction. Otherwise put, the Congress can choose to legislate that protection of a cultural property extends beyond its physical attributes to include its surroundings, settings, view, landscape, dominance and scale. This flows from the fundamental principle that the Constitution's grant of legislative power to Congress is plenary, subject only to certain defined limitations, such as those found in the Bill of Rights and the due process clause of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Unless we are ready to supplant the Congress or the National Historical Commission of the Philippines' efforts to discharge their legal process, we cannot impose an interpretation which precisely has not ripened into a legal obligation. Neither can we create international norm of a binding character. We are not the part of the State that participates in the articulation of <i>opinio juris</i> for purposes of international customary law. Neither do we, as a Court, participate in the crafting or concurrence of treaties. To do all these in the guise of the Latin principle <i>verba artis in arte</i> is to misplace the use of that canon. Terms of art will apply only when there is an art or profession to which it belongs. "Terms of art" is jargon to a profession or art mediums. It does not apply for a normative interpretation that is still contested.<br><br><center><b>X</b><br></center><br>The core of the dissent is built on the interpretation that the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance, or Ordinance No. 8119, "provides for a clear specific duty on the part of the City of Manila to regulate development projects insofar as these may adversely affect the view, vista, sightline or setting of a cultural property within the city."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Specifically cited were Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119, which allegedly require that the sightlines and settings of a "heritage resource" be free from visual obstruction, as well as Sections 45 and 53 dealing with environmental conservation and protection standards.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>Section 47 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 47. <u>Historical Preservation and Conservation Standards.</u> - Historic sites and facilities shall be conserved and preserved.

Torre de Manila and the Rizal Monument are not adjacent or contiguous properties, nor do they belong to the same cluster zone.

There is no act, whether ministerial or discretionary, that can be required of them.<br><br>For respondent City of Manila, the act sought to be performed is discretionary, not ministerial. Under Ordinance No. 8119, the City of Manila is empowered to decide whether or not to grant project developers, such as DMCI Project Developers, Inc., a variance allowing the construction of a structure beyond the prescribed floor-to-area ratio for a specific cluster zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Here, the City of Manila, through its Sangguniang Panlungsod, decided to grant DMCI Homes, Inc. a variance that allowed the developer to construct a building beyond the floor-to-area ratio of four (4) for structures within a university cluster zone.<br><br>Therefore, I disagree with the proposed disposition of this case by the dissent. Justice Jardeleza proposed to dispose of the case with this fallo:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, let a writ of <i>mandamus</i> be issued in this case. Public respondent City of Manila, through its representatives, is directed to <b>RE-EVALUATE WITH DISPATCH</b> the permits and variance issued in favor of DMCI-PDI's Torre de Manila project, <b>DETERMINE APPLICABILITY AND/OR COMPLIANCE WITH</b> the standards under Sections 45, 53, 47 and 48, and the provisions under Section 60 (in relation to the grant of a variance), of Ordinance No. 8119 and <b>GRANT THE APPROPRIATE RELIEFS/SANCTIONS</b> under the law. The TRO issued by this Court shall <b>REMAIN EFFECTIVE</b> until the issuance of the final decision in the re-evaluation proceeding to be conducted by the appropriate officials of the City of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote>First, ordering the City of Manila to "re-evaluate with dispatch the permits issued in favor of [DMCI Project Developers, Inc.]" is a futile exercise. It does not solve the constitutional issue presented in this case: whether the sightlines and settings of historical or cultural heritage or resources are protected under Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution.<br><br>Second, the grant of a building permit or variance is a discretionary act and, in this case, the discretion has already been exercised.<br><br>Third, in awaiting the final decision on the re-evaluation process, we are leaving to the City of Manila the effectivity of the temporary restraining order we issued. We are effectively delegating our power to a local government unit, in avoidance of our duty to finally decide this case.<br><br><center><b>XIII</b><br></center><br>There were other plain, speedy, and adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law available to petitioner Knights of Rizal. As earlier discussed, the Petition should have been filed before the regional trial court to resolve the factual issues involved and for a more adequate and exhaustive resolution of this case.<br><br>For instance, questions that can be raised regarding the approval of the variance of the construction from the standard Floor Area Ratio were contained in existing ordinances. These questions were revealed during the oral arguments in this case. Thus:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>You are not aware. Okay, now, in the zoning permit if you look at the floor area, it says, "97,549 square meters," do you confirm this Counsel?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>I confirm that, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>And the land area is 7,475 square meters. I understand that this includes right of way?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor, until an additional lot was added that made the total project area to be 7,556.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Okay. So, the floor area divided by the land area is 13.05, is that correct? You can get a calculator and compute it, it's 13.05 correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>That is called the FAR?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Yes, and therefore, when the zoning permit was issued, there was already a variance that was acknowledged by the City Planning Development Office of the City of Manila, is that correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's right, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>So, in other words, Mr. Resty Rebong approved the application because it fell within four and the variance, is this correct?<br><br><b>ATTY.LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's our impression, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>May I know what the Ordinance No. or resolution was that authorized Resty Rebong to approve the variance?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>My recollection, Your Honor, it is Section 77 of the ...<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>No, I'm sorry, June 19, 2012, is there a Sangguniang Panlungsod Resolution as of June 19, 2012 because Resty Rebong already said that the variance is okay. Is there a resolution from the City Council on June 19, 2012 approving the variance?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>There was none, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Again, here, I'm confused. The City Planning and Development Officer approved 97,549 which already includes a variance, but [o]n June 19 when he approved it in 2012, there was no resolution, nor ordinance from the City Council allowing the variance.<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>There was none yet at that time, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>As a matter of fact the variance was not there the following month, correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>No, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>In November 2012, there was no variance approval, correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>None ...<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>When DMCI was building the building there was no variance, was that not correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>And the only time that there was a variance that was granted, was in 2013, I am sorry 20... ?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>2014, Your Honor ...<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>2014?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>So, two years after this Resty Rebong approved the zoning permit with the variance but the approval of the variance came later?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor. Ifl may be allowed to explain ...<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Can we go to Section 62 of the Ordinance, I am sorry Section 63, you mentioned 62 awhile ago but I think you meant Section 63 of the Manila Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance of 2006. There it is, it's projected counsel, because I was confused based upon the questioning of Justice Dado Peralta and I am always confused when he asked questions, that's why I am asking. Now in Section 63 of the Ordinance, it clearly says there, "City Planning Development Officer provides a clearance for all conforming uses and, in cases of variances and exception from the Sangguniang Panlungsod as per recommendation from the MZBAA through the committee on Housing Urban Development and Resettlement prior to conducting any business activity or construction on their property/land." So, in other words, the Ordinance, said that it will not only be forthcoming from the Sangguniang Panlungsod, there has to be a recommendation from the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustment Appeals who in turn will get a recommendation through the Committee on Housing Urban Development and Resettlement, is this not correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>And prior to means "prior to," "before," "antecedent to," conducting any business activity or construction on their property or lot, correct, Counsel?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Yes, Your, Honor, may I be?<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Did you sell your property before the action of the Sangguniang Panlungsod?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, there is a difference between the approval of the ... (interrupted)<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Did you build prior to the approval of the Sangguniang Panlungsod as per recommendation of the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustment Appeals?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, if I may be allowed to ... ?<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>No, I have a pending question, did you build prior to the issuance of that resolution or ordinance allowing the variance?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>We build, Your Honor, in accordance with what was permitted, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>I am again a bit curious. Section 3(J) of Republic Act 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corruption Practices Law, it says, "knowingly approving or granting any license, permit, privilege or benefit in favor of any person not qualified for or not legally entitled to such license, permit, privilege or advantage," that's a crime, correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, may I be allowed to explain?<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>No, I'm just confirming if there is such a Section 3, paragraph (J)?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, right now I cannot confirm that, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Okay.<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>May I just be allowed to explain, Your Honor ...<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Just to clarify the way it went, there was a zoning clearance, on June 2012, the zoning clearance granted a variance, that variance had not yet been approved by the MZBAA, nor the Sangguniang Panlungsod, and DMCI sold property, mobilized in October, pre-sold. And you built starting November, but the Ordinance approving the variance only came in 2013, is that correct?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>That's correct, Your Honor, but may Ibe allowed to explain, Your Honor, please?<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Yes.<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, one, you only go to the MZBAA, Your Honor, when your permit request for zoning permit or locational clearance is denied. In this case, it was granted so, there was no opportunity for us to go to the MZBAA ... (interrupted)<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Counsel ... (interrupted)<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Secondly, allow me to complete, Your Honor, allow me to complete, please, very important, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br><br>Allow me to ask questions because I am the one that is going to vote on this case. Now, the second part of Section 63 it says there, "prior to conducting any business activity," can you [c]ite to me an ordinance or a section in an Ordinance which says, "the only time that you go to the MZBAA, is when the zoning permit is denied" because I am showing you Section 63?<br><br><b>ATTY. LAZATIN:</b><br><br>Your Honor, you appeal to the MZBAA, Your Honor, for a variance. So if it is granted, what will you appeal? And here, in addition, Your Honor, if I may be allowed to complete my answer, Your Honor, also the records that we have submitted it was the position of the City Planning Development Officer that the executive branch of Manila suspended the Ordinance and they were implementing the Building Code and in fact, Your Honor, they submitted and gave us a copy, Your Honor, of the opinion of the City Legal Officer that it was not necessary and at that time, Your Honor, all the objections to the project were based on heritage, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote>However, due process requires that these matters be properly pleaded, alleged, and traversed in the proper action.<br><br>Petitioner Knights of Rizal could not effectively assail the issuance of a variance to DMCI Project Developers, Inc. in an action in the Supreme Court. Under Section 77 of Ordinance No. 8119, the remedy of filing an opposition to the application for variance before the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals was available to petitioner Knights of Rizal. Section 77 of the Manila Zoning Ordinance provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 77. <u>Action on Complaints and Opposition.</u> - A verified complaint for any violations of any provision of the Zoning Ordinance or of any clearance or permits issued pursuant thereto shall be filed with the [Manila Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals].<br><br>However, oppositions to application for clearance, variance or exception shall be treated as a complaint and dealt with in accordance with the provision of this section.<br></blockquote>Given the foregoing, a writ of <i>mandamus</i> against the construction of Torre de Manila does not lie.<br><br>With petitioner having no clear legal right to the relief sought, there can be no great or irreparable injury<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> to petitioners and the temporary restraining order issued by this Court has no solid ground. Thus, the temporary restraining order must be lifted.<br><br><center><b>XIV</b><br></center><br>Even with the consciousness of his impending death, Jose Rizal did not want to be aggrandized. He did not want to be buried and remembered in the way that the petitioner wants him remembered. He wanted a simple grave in Paang Bundok marked with his name, a simple cross and possibly a fence. He did not give instructions for foreign artists to erect his likeness. He probably did not want that likeness to be clothed in an overcoat so that we remember him in the bosom of our colonial masters. He did not leave instructions that his name be used for a national shrine.<br><br>Jose Rizal did not even want his death anniversary celebrated.<br><br>Like Elias in El Filibusterismo, Rizal wanted to be remembered as an ordinary person, whose death was meaningful because it was the result of his courage to do what was right no matter how fatal the consequences.<br><br>Rizal should be valorized because of his humility. He should not be venerated like a saint or a god whose shrines erected in his honor is so sacred that it is protected by putative knights in a country that prohibits titles of royalty or nobility.<br><br>I suspect that Jose Rizal would have been uncomfortable being in a pantheon of heroes and with a stature that, in the submissions of the petitioner and the Solicitor General, approaches that of a divinity.<br><br>The memory of our heroes symbolized by shrines erected in their honor should not be granted so imperial a status so as to arbitrarily waste the material and physical spaces and natural resources of adjoining properties. This is inconsistent with the egalitarian society they may have imagined. It does not square with a more egalitarian view of social justice.<br><br>We cannot immortalize our heroes by privileging an angle for a photograph of our shrines while sacrificing the value of the rule of law for the society at present. Good citizenship requires that we never venerate our heroes without any understanding of their context. Rizal was a Filipino, whose principles and convictions gave them the courage to speak truth to power no matter how fatal the consequences. He will still only be one among many.<br><br>It is this courage and this humility that we should remember from Rizal's life. These values should be lived. They should persist and survive beyond the frame of a bad photograph.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>LIFT</b> the Temporary Restraining Order and <b>DISMISS</b> the Petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The penultimate paragraph was cited in <i>rollo</i>, p. 2491, National Historical Commission of the Philippines Historical Notes on the Rizal Monument and Park, NHCP Memorandum, Annex C, <i>citing</i> Jose Rizal's letter to his family, "<i>A mi familia</i>," undated, believed to have been written in Fort Santiago in December 1896, National Library of the Philippines.

KOR's petition appears to make a case for <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br>Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <i>Petition for mandamus</i>. - When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br></blockquote>A writ of <i>mandamus</i> is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdiction, directed to some inferior court, tribunal, or board, requiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty results from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed or from operation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> For a petition for <i>mandamus</i> to prosper, petitioner must establish the existence of a clear legal right to the thing demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In <i>University of San Agustin, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> we stated:<br><blockquote><b>While it may not be necessary that the duty be absolutely expressed, it must however, be clear.</b> The writ will not issue to compel an official to do anything which is not his duty to do or which is his duty not to do, or give to the applicant anything to which he is not entitled by law. <u>The writ neither confers powers nor imposes duties.</u> It is simply a command to exercise a power already possessed and to perform a duty already imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>Here, KOR's case is essentially founded on Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution giving rise to an alleged duty on the part of respondent DMCI-PDI to protect (or, at the very least, refrain from despoiling) the nation's heritage. In <i>Uy Kiao Eng v. Lee</i>, we held that <i>mandamus</i> is a "proper recourse for citizens who seek to enforce a public right and to compel the performance of a public duty, most especially when the public right involved is mandated by the Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>More importantly, a relaxation of procedural rules is warranted considering the significance of the threshold and purely legal question involved in this case. As identified in the Court's Advisory, this threshold and purely legal question is: "<b>whether the definition of the Constitutional mandate to conserve, promote and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, includes, in the case of the Rizal Monument, the preservation of its prominence, dominance, vista points, vista corridors, sightlines and setting</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Apropos to this, I proposed that the Court also decide: (2) whether there are laws, statutes, ordinances, and international covenants that implement this mandate and which were breached as a result of the construction of the Torre de Manila; and (3) whether <i>mandamus</i> lies against public respondents.<br><br>In <i>Gamboa v. Teves</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> an original petition for prohibition, injunction, declaratory relief, and declaration of nullity was filed to stop the sale of shares of Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC) stock to Metro Pacific Assets Holdings, Inc. (MPAH), a foreign owned corporation. The sale, if allowed, would increase to 81% the common shareholdings of foreigners in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), beyond the allowed constitutional limit on foreign ownership of a public utility. In <i>Gamboa</i>, this Court acknowledged that it had no original jurisdiction over the petition for declaratory relief, injunction, and annulment of sale filed by petitioners therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Nevertheless, in view of the threshold and purely legal issue on the definition of the term "capital" in Section 11, Article XII of the Constitution which had <b>far-­reaching implications to the national economy</b>, this Court treated the petition as one for <i>mandamus</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Gamboa</i> cited two other precedents where we had relaxed procedural rules and assumed jurisdiction over a petition for declaratory relief­<i> Salvacion v. Central Bank of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and <i>Alliance of Government Workers v. Minister of Labor and Employment</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><i>Salvacion</i> presented the issue of whether the protection afforded to foreign currency deposits can be made applicable to a foreign transient. <i>Alliance of Government Workers</i>, on the other hand, involved the issue of whether government agencies are considered "employers" under a law requiring payment of 13<sup>th</sup> month pay to certain employees. As in <i>Gamboa</i>, in both cases, we ruled that while we had no original jurisdiction over the petitions <i>as filed</i>, "exceptions to this rule have been recognized." In <i>Salvacion</i>, we declared: "where the petition has far-reaching implications and raises questions that should be resolved, it may be treated as one for <i>mandamus</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> More, as in <i>Alliance of Government Workers</i>, "considering the important issues propounded and the fact that constitutional principles are involved," we decided "to give due course to the petition, to consider the various comments as answers and to resolve the questions raised through a full length decision in the exercise of this Court's symbolic function as an aspect of the power of judicial review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Alliance of Government Workers</i>, in turn, cited as precedent the earlier cases <i>Nacionalista Party v. Bautista</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <i>Aquino, Jr. v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> There we also relaxed the application of procedural rules and treated the petition for prohibition filed as one for <i>quo warranto</i> in view of "peculiar and extraordinary circumstances" and "far-reaching implications" attendant in both cases.<br><br>Here, the Court's judicial power has been invoked to determine the extent of protection afforded by the Constitution and our laws, if any, over cultural heritage properties. Our resolution of this issue will settle whether the Constitution's heritage conservation provisions are self-executing, and if not, whether the State has translated them into judicially enforceable norms through enabling legislation.

The constitutional exhortation to "conserve, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources," lacks "specific, operable norms and standards" by which to guide its enforcement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Enabling legislation is still necessary to define, for example, the scope, permissible measures, and possible limitations of the State's heritage conservation mandate. Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power, is alone empowered to decide whether and how to conserve and preserve historical and cultural property. As in the situation posed by Justice Feliciano, Sections 15 and 16, by themselves, will be of no help to a defendant in an actual case for purposes of preparing an intelligent and effective defense. These sections also lack any comprehensible standards by which to guide a court in resolving an alleged violation of a right arising from the same.<br><br>The view that Sections 15 and 16 are not self-executing provisions is, in fact, supported by the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, insofar as they reveal an intent to direct Congress to enact a law that would provide guidelines for the regulation as well as penalties for violations thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In particular, during the interpellation of Commissioner Felicitas Aquino, one of the proponents of the provision on heritage conservation, she conceded that there is a need for supplementary statutory implementation of these provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Petitioner KOR also claimed that the Torre de Manila project (1) "violates" the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) "Guidelines on Monuments Honoring National Heroes, Illustrious Filipinos and Other Personages" which "guidelines have the force of law" and (2) "runs afoul" an "international commitment" of the Philippines under the International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, otherwise known as the Venice Charter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>I disagree.<br><br>The NHCP Guidelines is neither law nor an enforceable rule or regulation.

The Venice Charter provides, in general terms, the steps that must be taken by State Parties for the conservation and restoration of monuments and sites, including these properties' setting. It does not, however, rise to a level of an enforceable law. There is no allegation that the Philippines has legally committed to observe the Venice Charter. Neither am I prepared to declare that its principles are norms of general or customary international law which are binding on all states.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> I further note that the terms of both the NHCP Guidelines and the Venice Charter appear hortatory and do not claim to be sources of legally enforceable rights.

It is true that the concept of police power (in general) and zoning (in particular) traditionally developed alongside the regulation of nuisance and dangers to public health or safety. The law on land development and control, however, has since dramatically broadened the reach of the police power in relation to zoning.<br><br>The protection of cultural, historical, aesthetic, and architectural assets as an aspect of the public welfare that a State is empowered to protect <i>pursuant to the police power</i> would find its strongest support in <i>Berman v.

A distinction however must be made between a case where the writ of mandamus is sought to control the decision of a court upon the merits of the cause, and cases where the court has refused to go into the merits of the action, upon an erroneous view of the law or practice. If the court has erroneously dismissed an action upon a preliminary objection and upon an erroneous construction of the law, then <i>mandamus</i> is the proper remedy to compel it .to reinstate the action and to proceed to hear it upon its merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Association of Beverage Employees v.

Article VII (Performance Standards) of Ordinance No. 8119 provides the standards under which "[a]ll land uses, developments or constructions <i>shall</i> conform to x x x." The Ordinance itself provides that in the construction or interpretation of its provisions, "the term 'shall' is always mandatory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> These standards, placed in the Ordinance for specific, if not already expressed, reasons must be seriously considered for purposes of issuance of building permits by the City of Manila.<br><br>Sections 43 in relation to 53, and 47 and 48, however, were not considered by the City of Manila when it decided to grant the different permits applied for by DMCI-PDI. The City has, in fact, adamantly maintained that there is no law which regulates, much less prohibits, such construction projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> While I hesitate to find grave abuse of discretion on the part of the City of Manila in its actuations relating to its issuance of the permits and the variance, this is due to the disputed facts respecting these issues. There is, for example, a serious allegation of non-compliance with FAR and variance requirements under the Ordinance; this issue was, in fact, discussed and debated at great length during oral arguments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> While I believe that the Court should refrain from making a determination of this particular issue, involving as it does findings of fact and technical matters, I do not hesitate to find that the City was <b>mistaken in its view</b> that there was no law which regulates development projects in relation to views, vista points, landscape, and settings of certain properties.<br><br>This law, as I have earlier sought to demonstrate, is Ordinance No. 8119, whose purposes include the protection of the "character" of areas within the locality and the promotion of the general welfare of its inhabitants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> The standards and requirements under Ordinance No. 8119 were included in the law to ensure that any proposed development to be approved be mindful of the numerous public welfare considerations involved. <b>Ordinance No. 8119 being the primary and dominant basis for all uses of land resources within the locality, the City of Manila, through the CPDO, knows or ought to know the existence of these standards and ought to have considered the same in relation to the application of DMCI-PDI to construct the Torre de Manila project.</b><br><br>Worse, the City has apparently been "suspending" the application of several provisions of the Ordinance purportedly to follow the more desirable standards under the National Building Code. In a letter dated October 10, 2012, the Manila CPDO wrote DMCI-PDI stating that while Torre de Manila exceeded the FAR allowed under the Manila Zoning Ordinance, it granted DMCI-PDI a zoning permit "because the FAR restriction was <b>suspended</b> by the executive branch, for the City Planning Office opted to follow the National Building Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Neither does it appear that compliance was made pursuant to the requirements of Section 47(b) of Ordinance No. 8119 on the submission of a heritage impact statement (<i>i.e.</i>, that the project will not adversely impact the heritage significance of the cultural property) for review by the CPDO in coordination with the NHCP.<br><br><b>Ordinance No. 8119's inclusion of standards respecting historic preservation, environmental protection, and aesthetics puts the City of Manila at the forefront of local governments that have embraced the expanded application of the public welfare. It is thus a major source of bafflement for me as to how the City of Manila could have missed these distinctive features of Ordinance No. 8119 when it processed DMCI­PDI's applications, up to and including its grant of the variance.</b> The City of Manila's selective attitude towards the application of its <i>own</i> rules reminds of Justice Brion's statement in <i>Jardeleza v. Sereno</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br><blockquote>The JBC, however, has formulated its own rules, which even commanded that a higher standard for procedural process be applied to Jardeleza.

Still, the Court, without offending its bounden duty to interpret the law and administer justice, should not permit a disregard of an Ordinance by diminishing the duty imposed by Congress, through the local legislature, to effectuate the general welfare of the citizens of the City of Manila. The protection of general welfare for all citizens through the protection of culture, health and safety, among others, is "an ambitious goal but over time, x x x something that is attainable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> To me, such mandate is as much addressed to this Court, as it is to the other branches of Government.

It may well be that the City of Manila, <i>after exercising its discretion</i>, finds that the Torre de Manila meets any or all of the standards under the Ordinance. The Court will not presume to preempt the action of the City of Manila, through the CPDO, when it re-evaluates DMCI-PDI's application with particular consideration to the guidelines provided under the standards.<br><br>The majority makes much of the grant of a variance in respondent DMCI-PDI's favor and views the same as <i>the exercise of discretion by the City of Manila</i> which can only be corrected where there is a showing of grave abuse of discretion. This is inaccurate on two counts.<br><br><b>First</b>, the rule that <i>mandamus</i> only lies to compel the performance of a ministerial duty has several exceptions; it is not limited to a case of grave abuse of discretion.

One involves the prescription of maximum building heights in terms of feet or stories or both:<br><blockquote>Height regulations state maximum heights either in terms of feet or number of stories or both. Their general validity was accepted by <i>Welch v. Swasey</i>, and most litigation questions their validity as applied. The regulations are imposed to effectuate some of the purposes, as stated in the Standard Act, namely "to secure safety frqm fire," "to provide adequate light and air" and "to prevent the overcrowding of land." They also are adopted for aesthetic reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Building height can also be regulated through a combination of bulk and floor limits. The PLO, for example, sets the maximum bulk of the building, or how much of the land a proposed building can occupy. The FAR, on the other hand, provides the maximum number of floors a building can have relative to its area. The zoning control devices for bulk (PLO) and floor (FAR) limits jointly determine height. These concepts are explained as follows:<br><blockquote>Bulk zone regulations are those which provide a zoning envelope for buildings by horizontal measurement. They include such regulations as minimum lot size, minimum frontage of lots, the area of a lot that may be covered, yard requirements and setbacks. FAR, meaning floor-area ratio, is a device that combines height and bulk provisions.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Under the FAR, the ordinance designates a floor-area ratio for a particular zone. If the ratio is 1:1, for example, a one-story building can cover the entire buildable area of the lot, a two-story building can cover one-half of the buildable area, a four-story building can cover one-fourth of the buildable area and so on. In commercial office building areas in large cities the ratios may be 10:1, which would permit a twenty[-]story building on half of the buildable area of the lot.<br><br>FAR may be used in conjunction with maximum height limits and other bulk controls, so that in a 10:1 area, it may not be possible to build a 200-story building on 1/20<sup>th</sup> of the buildable area of a lot or to eliminate yards entirely and build a 10-story building up to all lot lines. Nevertheless, FAR does give the builder some flexibility. In effect[,] it provides an inducement to the builder to leave more of his lot open by permitting him to build higher.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup><br></blockquote>Following this, a zoning ordinance can prescribe a maximum height for buildings: (1) directly, that is, by expressly providing for height limits in terms of feet or number of stories or both; or (2) indirectly, by employing a combination of bulk and floor limits.<br><br>Ordinance No. 8119 does not provide for an express BHL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> Neither, for that matter, does the Building Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> Instead, Ordinance No. 8119 sets up a system whereby building height is controlled by the <b><u>combined</u></b> use of a prescribed maximum FAR and a prescribed maximum PLO. Theoretically, a property owner can maximize the allowed height of his building by reducing the area of the land which the building will occupy (PLO). This process, however, can only achieve an allowed height up to a certain point as the allowable number of floors is, at the same time, limited by the FAR. Beyond the allowable maximum PLO or FAR, the property owner must avail of a mitigating device known in zoning parlance as a variance.<br><br>Variances are provided under zoning ordinances to meet challenges posed by so-called "nonconforming uses," a generic term covering both nonconforming buildings and nonconforming activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> A nonconforming building, in the context of Ordinance No. 8119, is one that exceeds the LUIC rating, <i>i.e.</i>, PLO and FAR limits, assigned to its zone. The Ordinance allows the City of Manila to grant a variance, provided the project proponent complies with the stringent conditions and the procedure prescribed by Sections 60 to 62.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> Section 60 provides in pertinent part:<br><blockquote>Sec. 60. <u>Deviations</u>. - Variances and exceptions from the provisions of this Ordinance may be allowed by the Sangguniang Panlungsod as per recommendation from the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals (MZBAA) through the Committee on Housing, Urban Development and Resettlements only when all the following terms and conditions are obtained/existing:<br><ol><li>Variance - all proposed projects which do riot conformed (<i>sic</i>) with the prescribed allowable Land Use Intensity Control (LUIC) in the zone.<br><ol type="a"><br><li>The property is unique and different from other properties in the adjacent locality and because of its uniqueness, the owner/s cannot obtain a reasonable return on the property.<br></li></ol></li></ol>This condition shall include at least three (3) of the following provisions:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="center">-</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Conforming to the provisions of the Ordinance will cause undue hardship on the part of the owner or occupant of the property due to physical conditions of the property (topography, shape, etc.), which is not self created.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td><div align="justify">The proposed variance is the minimum deviation necessary to permit reasonable use of the property.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td><div align="justify">The variance will not alter the physical character of the district/zone where the property for which the variance sought is located, and will not substantially or permanently injure the use of the other properties in the same district or zone.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td><div align="justify">That the variance will not weaken the general purpose of the Ordinance and will not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">-</div></td><td><div align="justify">The variance will be in harmony with the spirit of this Ordinance.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Thus, "deviations," "variances and exceptions" from the standard LUICs of the Ordinance may be allowed by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> as per "recommendation" from the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals (MZBAA) through the Committee on Housing, Urban Development and Resettlements only when specified conditions are obtained.<br><br>As earlier explained, LUICs specifically relate and pertain to PLOs, FARs, and BHLs. Variances, on the other hand, are essentially exemptions from the prescribed LUICs within a specific zone. By their terms, these standards and the considerations for the grant of a variance from the same are starkly different from the heritage, environmental, and aesthetic factors for consideration under Section 45 in relation to Sections 53, 47, and 48.<br><br>The first set of considerations governs the determination of the question of whether a property, in the first instance, is so physically "unique" in terms of its topography and shape that a strict enforcement of the standard LUICs in the area will deprive its owner from obtaining a "reasonable return" on the property. The second set of considerations, on the other hand, pertains to the standards of heritage conservation, environmental protection, and aesthetics required from a developer as conditions to the issuance of a zoning and building permit. Compliance with one does not necessarily presuppose compliance with the other. For these reasons, I cannot accept the majority's view that the grant of a variance in this case should be treated as the City's exercise of discretion <i>insofar as the standards under Section 45 in relation to Section 53, and Sections 47 and 48 are concerned</i>.<br><br>Nevertheless, I wish to emphasize that while different, these two sets of considerations work to further general welfare concerns as seen fit by the local legislature. To my mind, these standards are inextricably intertwined and mutually reinforcing zoning concepts that operate as enforcement mechanisms of Ordinance No. 8119. Where the standards contained under these Sections represent the rule, a variance defines the exception. In the context of an actual case, such as the litigation before us, where a deviation (<i>i.e.</i>, variance) from prescribed standards is invoked, its legality as based on the facts must be established. Variances exist to mitigate the harsh application of the rule, but they were not invented to operate as ruses to render the rule inutile. The determination of how the balance is struck between law and equity will require a judicious appreciation of the attendant facts.<br><br>The record, however, is absolutely bereft of evidence supporting the City of Manila's approval of the variance. By its terms, Section 60 of Ordinance No. 8119 allows for only a single instance when a variance from the prescribed LUICs can be allowed: the property must be "unique and different from other properties in the adjacent locality and because of its uniqueness, the owners cannot obtain a reasonable return on the property." To hurdle this, an applicant for the variance must show at least three of the express qualifications under Section 60. These qualifications, we reiterate, are as follows: (1) conforming to the provisions of the Ordinance will cause undue hardship on the part of the property owner or occupant due to physical conditions of the property (<i>i.e.</i>, topography, shape, <i>etc.</i>) which are not self­-created; (2) the proposed variance is the minimum deviation necessary to permit reasonable use of the property; (3) the variance will not alter the physical character of the district/zone where the property for which the variance sought is located, and will not substantially or permanently injure the use of the other properties in the same district or zone; (4) that the variance will not weaken the general purpose of the Ordinance and will not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare; and (5) the variance will be in harmony with the spirit of this Ordinance.<br><br>Significantly, none of the documents submitted by DMCI-PDI show compliance with any of the foregoing qualifications. The record does not refer to any piece of evidence to show how: (1) the DMCI-PDI's property is physically "different" in topography and shape from the other properties in its zone; and (2) the DMCI-PDI cannot obtain a "reasonable return" on its property if it was compelled to comply with the prescribed LUICs in the area.<br><br>While I hesitate, at this time, to find the City of Manila's grant of the zoning and building permits and the variance to be unlawful or made in grave abuse of discretion, I do <b>not</b> endorse a finding that the City of Manila, under the facts of the case, acted in compliance with the requirements of Ordinance No. 8119. On the contrary, I would like to note a concern raised by Justice Peralta, during the oral arguments, that the grant of the permits for the Torre de Manila development <i>may</i> have violated the LUIC requirements of Ordinance No. 8119 from the very beginning.

On the contrary, the circumstances thus far shown appear to support a view that the general presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties should <b>not</b> be applied here:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>You include that in the memorandum. It should be able to convince me that your computation is accurate and correct.

All the plans submitted to all the regulatory agencies show that it was for a 49-storey building, Your Honor.<br><br><b>JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>But using the computation in the building code, I mean, in the city ordinance, it could seem that the application should not have been approved from the very beginning because it violates the zoning law of the [C]ity of Manila?<br><br><b>ATTY.

For example, respondent DMCI-PDI, during the oral arguments, claimed that it is allowed to build up to 66 storeys under the National Building Code and 18 storeys under the Ordinance <i>even without a variance</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> <i>Amicus curiae</i> Architect Emmanuel Cuntapay posits that with the maximum FAR of 4, respondent DMCI-PDI "is allowed to construct 18.24 habitable stories or floors for Torre de Manila" or up to 25 actual floors if we add the seven floors allotted as parking areas, even without a variance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> The OSG, on the other hand, would argue that DMCI-PDI is entitled to build only up to seven floors without a variance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup> Meanwhile, Acting Executive Director Johnson V. Domingo of the Department of Public Works and Highways computes the BHL at 7, 19, or 56 storeys, depending on the factors to be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> All told, the issue as to the correct application of the FAR provisions and the resulting maximum allowable building height of the Torre de Manila <i>sans variance</i> is a technical issue which this Court is not equipped to answer at this time. This issue is separate and distinct (albeit, admittedly related) to the issue regarding the propriety of the grant of the variance, which as earlier explained also involves the resolution of certain factual issues attending its grant. Thus, I find that a remand to the City of Manila is all the more appropriate and necessary in view of the critical questions of fact and technical issues still to be resolved.<br><br>In any case, the City of Manila would be well advised to note that many of the textual prescriptions of Sections 45, 53, 47, ahd 48 are also textually imbedded in the terms of Section 60.<br><br>The first condition requires a showing that conforming to the provisions of the Ordinance will cause "undue hardship" on the part of the owner due to the physical conditions of the property, <i>e.g.</i>, topography, shape, <i>etc.</i>, which are not "self-created." Petitioner KOR has alleged that the Torre de Manila, because of its height, will have an "adverse impact" on the Rizal Park and the Rizal Monument by "diminishing its value," "scale and importance." Section 47 of Ordinance No. 8119, on the other hand, prohibits any development that will "adversely impact" the heritage significance of a property. Correlating the foregoing to this first condition of Section 60, the City of Manila should <i>consider</i> what is it in the physical (and not self­-created) conditions of the lot on which the Torre de Manila stands will cause undue hardship to DMCI-PDI unless a variance is granted. The City of Manila should also <i>consider</i> whether granting the variance will be consistent with the heritage, environmental and aesthetic standards of the Ordinance, including Section 47.<br><br>The second condition requires a showing that the proposed variance is the "minimum deviation necessary to permit reasonable use of the property." Petitioner KOR alleges that the Torre de Manila, at 19 floors, obstructs the view of the Rizal Monument, among its other allegations relating to the height of the Torre de Manila. The City of Manila should thus <i>consider</i> what the minimum deviation from the prescribed FAR 4 may be allowed the project, again <i>consistent</i> with the heritage, environmental, and aesthetic standards of Ordinance No. 8119. This includes a determination of the maximum number of storeys Torre de Manila may be allowed to have that would cause: (1) minimum deviation from the prescribed FAR; and (2) minimal to no adverse effect on the heritage significance of nearby cultural properties.<br><br>The third condition requires a showing that the variance will not "alter the physical character of the zone, or substantially or permanently injure the use of the other properties in the zone." Petitioner KOR has alleged that the Torre de Manila has diminished the scale and importance of the Rizal Park and the Rizal Monument. Section 48, on aesthetic considerations, requires that all projects be designed in an "aesthetically pleasing manner" and that their "natural environmental character" be considered especially in relation to "adjacent properties." In these lights, the City of Manila should <i>consider</i> the FAR variance that may be allowed the Torre of Manila, if any, which will not injure or alter the physical character of the zone and its adjacent properties, pursuant to the standards both laid down by Section 48.<br><br>The fourth condition requires a showing that the variance will not "weaken the general purpose of the Ordinance" or "adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare." The fifth condition requires that the variance will be in "harmony with the spirit of the Ordinance." These two conditions encapsulate my view that the City of Manila has purposively embraced the modem, expanded concept of police power in the context of zoning ordinances. To my mind, they stand as shorthand instructions to the City of Manila in deciding the balance between enforcing the standards set forth in Sections 45, 53, 47 and 48; and Sections 60 to 62, to <i>consider</i> the Ordinance's overriding heritage, environmental, and aesthetic objectives.<br><br>Further, I would like to emphasize that my view and proposed disposition of the case do <b>not</b> entail a finding that Section 45, in relation to Section 53, and Sections 47 and 48, are already applicable for purposes of prohibiting the Torre de Manila construction project. On the contrary, the proposed ruling is limited to this: that Section 45 in relation to Sections 53, 47, and 48, <i>by their terms and express intent</i>, must be <b>considered</b> by the City of Manila in making its decisions respecting the challenged development. I propose that the City of Manila must <i>consider</i> DMCI-PDI's proposal against the standards clearly set by the provisions before it makes its decisions. The standard under Section 47 is clear: that the proposed development will <b>not adversely impact</b> the heritage significance of the heritage property. Section 48 is also clear when it states that it is "in the public interest that all projects are designed and developed in a safe, efficient and <b>aesthetically pleasing manner</b>." Section 53 also clearly characterizes the protection of view enjoyed by the public as a "regulation." These are standards textually operating as regulations and not mere guidelines.<br><br>To clarify, I do not propose that the Court rule on the legality or propriety of the variance granted to DMCI-PDI under Section 60. Rather, I propose that the ruling be limited thus: the City of Manila must <i>consider</i> whether DMCI-PDI's proposed project meets the definition and conditions of a "unique" property under Section 60, standing alone by the terms of Section 60, but also <i>in relation</i> to the heritage, environmental, and aesthetic standards of Sections 45, 53, 47 and 48. Without controlling <i>how</i> its discretion will thereafter be exercised, I vote that the Court direct the <b>re­evaluation</b> by the City of Manila, through the CPDO, of the permits previously issued in favor of the Torre de Manila project, including conducting a hearing, receiving evidence, and deciding compliance with the foregoing standards/requirements under Ordinance No. 8119.<br><br>I also do not propose a <i>pro hac vice</i> conversion of the proceedings into a "contested case" under the terms of the Administrative Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> I do, however, believe that notice and hearing requirements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> must be observed, with all concerned parties given the opportunity to present evidence and argument on all issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> Section 77 of Ordinance No. 8119 allows for the filing of a verified complaint before the MZBAA for any violation of any provision of the Ordinance or of any clearance or permits issued pursuant thereto, including oppositions to applications for clearances, variance, or exception. Otherwise put, I believe that the requirements of <i>Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> and <i>Alliance for the Family Foundation, Philippines, Inc. v. Garin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> are deemed written into Section 77.<br><br>With these clarifications, I vote that the City, through the Mayor and his representatives, be compelled by <i>mandamus</i> to consider its own conservation standards and LUIC requirements.<br><br>I find the concern about estoppel irrelevant inasmuch as petitioner KOR's alleged development proposals appear to have been made more than five decades ago, and long before either the 1987 Constitution or Ordinance No. 8119 were ever conceived.<br><br>Finally, it may well have been Rizal's wish to be buried a certain place and in a certain way. If we were to pursue this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, this argument would forbid the establishment of a Rizal Monument, a Rizal Park, and celebration of Rizal Day. In any case, and while not blind to history, we must be reminded that this Court, in the words of Justice Tinga, is a judge not of history but of the Constitution and the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, I do not propose to resolve the factual issues raised by the parties regarding DMCI-PDI's alleged violation of existing regulations under Ordinance No. 8119 (including compliance with the FAR and variance requirements), whether the Torre de Manila is a nuisance, and whether DMCI-PDI acted in good faith in the construction of the project. The constitutional guarantee of due process requires that such matters first be heard and resolved by the City of Manila, the appropriate administrative agency, or the courts.<br><br>I realize that, for all the debates during the oral arguments, it was only <i>after</i> the case has been submitted for resolution that the Court was first made aware, through the writer of this Dissenting Opinion, of the existence of Section 45 in relation to 53, and Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119, and their relevance in the resolution of this case. <b>No party to the case or member of this Court had previously raised the applicability of these Sections of Ordinance No. 8119.</b> I argued to remand the case to the City of Manila precisely for it to re-evaluate the grant of the permits to DMCI-PDI in light of the cited Sections and to hear the parties thereon.<br><br>A careful reading of the <i>Decision</i> would show that the majority concedes that there <i>is</i> a law that "provides for standards and guidelines to regulate development projects x x x within the City of Manila."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> However, instead of a remand, they went on to find that the standards and guidelines do not apply to "the construction of a building outside the boundaries of a historic site or facility, where such building may affect the background of a historic site."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> With respect, I disagree with the majority's <b>peremptory dismissal</b> of the case on the basis of such finding, considering that none of the parties were ever heard on this specific issue, <i>i.e.</i>, the application of Section 45 in relation to 53, and Sections 47 and 48 of Ordinance No. 8119 based on the facts of the case.<br><br>The constitutional guarantee of due process dictates that parties be given an opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered. Here, the parties were not heard on the specific subject of the performance standards prescribed by Ordinance No. 8119, insofar as they appear relevant to this case. A remand would have been the just course of action. The absence of such a hearing, I would like to emphasize, is precisely the reason why I hesitate to attribute bad faith or grave abuse of discretion, at this point, on the part of any one party. A remand would have allowed for the building of a factual foundation of record with respect to underlying questions of fact (and even policy) not appropriate to be decided, in the first instance, by the Court. I imagine that a remand would provide the opportune venue to hear and receive evidence over alternate/moderate views, including, as I said, the maximum number of storeys the Torre de Manila may be allowed that would pose minimal deviation from the prescribed LUICs and still be considered consistent with the other performance standards under the Ordinance.<br><br>Furthermore, while the majority insists on according respect to the City of Manila's exercise of discretion, it seems to me that <b><u>their finding <i>at this point</i> that the standards provided under Ordinance No. 8119 are not applicable does more to preempt the City of Manila in the exercise of its discretion than an order requiring it to <i>merely consider</i> their application</u></b>. This, despite clear indications that they have not been considered at all during the processing of DMCI-PDI's application. That the City of Manila has not considered these standards is a finding of fact that the Court can make because this was <b>admitted</b> as much by the local government itself when, based on its erroneous reading of its own zoning ordinance, it claimed that there is no law which regulates constructions alleged to have impaired the sightlines of a historical site/facility. At the risk of sounding repetitive, I believe a remand would, at the very least, allow the City of Manila to consider and settle, at the first instance, the matter of whether the Sections in question are applicable or not.<br><br>To end, I am reminded of the view, first expressed in <i>Tañada v. Angara</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> that even non-self-executing provisions of the Constitution may be "used by the judiciary as aids or as guides in the exercise of its power of judicial review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> More than anything, this case presented an opportunity for the Court to recognize that aspirational provisions contained in Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies) and many. more similar provisions spread in the Constitution, such as Sections 14 and 15, Article XIV, are <b>not</b>, in the words of Chief Justice Reynato Puno, "meaningless constitutional patter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> These provisions have constitutional worth. They define our values and embody our ideals and aspirations as a people. The command under Section 15, Article XIV of the Constitution for the State to conserve the nation's historical and cultural heritage is as much addressed to this Court, as it is to Congress and to the Executive. We should heed this command by ordering a remand, more so where there is an obvious intent on the part of the City of Manila, in the exercise of its delegated police power from Congress, to incorporate heritage conservation, aesthetics, and environment protection of views into its zoning ordinance.<br><br>In this modem world, heritage conservation has to constantly compete with other equally important values such as property and property development. In litigations involving such clash of values, this Court sets the tone on the judicial solicitude it is duty-bound to display towards aspirational constitutional values, especially when implemented by specific and operable legislation. Here, we had the unique opportunity to give the value of heritage conservation, involving as it does the preservation of fragile and vulnerable resources, all the breathing space<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> to make its case.

The IEE Checklist Report, which the DENR uses for projects to be located within Environmentally Critical Areas (ECA), is not itself part of the record.

Dukeminier, Jr., <i>Zoning For Aesthetic Objectives: a Reappraisal</i>, 20 LAW &amp; CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS 218 (1955), which confronts squarely the problem raised by the subjective quality of the central element of aesthetics: what is beauty?:<br><blockquote>Now it seems fairly clear that among the basic values of our communities, and of any society aboriginal or civilized, is beauty. Men are continuously engaged in its creation, pursuit, and possession; beauty, like wealth, is an object of strong human desire. Men may use a beautiful object which they possess or control as a basis for increasing their power or wealth or for effecting a desired distribution of any one or all of the other basic values of the community, and, conversely, men may use power and wealth in an attempt to produce a beautiful object or a use of land which is aesthetically satisfying. It is solely because of man's irrepressible aesthetic demands, for instance, that land witb a view has always been more valuable for residential purposes than land without, even though a house with a view intruding everywhere is said to be terribly hard to live in. Zoning regulations may, and often do, integrate aesthetics with a number of other community objectives, but it needs to be repeatedly emphasized that a healthful, safe and efficient community environment is not enough. More thought must be given to appearances if communities are to be really desirable places in which to live. Edmund Burke-no wild-eyed radical-said many years ago, "To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely." It is still so today.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Furthermore, in specifying and evaluating indices of attractive environments, it is important that community decision-makers-judges and planning officials-realize that they must promote land use which in time will succeed in appealing to people in general. In public planning that environment is beautiful which deeply satisfies the public; practical success is of the greatest significance. In the long run, what the people like and acclaim <i>as</i> beautiful provides the operational indices of what is beautiful so far as the community is concerned. All popular preferences will never be acceptable to connoisseurs who urge their own competence to prescribe what is <i>truly</i> beautiful, yet it seems inescapable that an individual's judgment of beauty cannot be normative for the community until it is backed with the force of community opinion. History may be of some comfort to the connoisseurs: widely acknowledged <i>great</i> artists and <i>beautiful</i> architectural styles produced popular movements and not cults. A great age of architecture has not existed without the popular acceptance of a basic norm of design.

It denied acting in bad faith and that the Torre de Manila is a nuisance <i>per se</i>.<br><br>On 25 November 2014, the Supreme Court resolved to treat the petition as one for <i>mandamus</i>, and to implead the City of Manila, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the National Museum and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts as public respondents.<br><br><b>For the reasons hereinafter set forth, I concur in the result reached by my distinguished colleague, J.

All the country's artistic and historic wealth constitutes the cultural treasure of the nation and shall be under the protection of the State which may regulate its disposition.<br></blockquote>The foregoing constitutional provisions mandate the conservation, promotion and protection of historical and cultural heritage and resources, but do not specify a clear legal right to the protection of the vista, sightline and setting thereof.<br><br>Broadly written, the provisions use the words "conserve," "promote," "popularize" and "protect" which are open to different interpretations, as demonstrated no less by the parties' conflicting positions on their breadth and scope when applied to the construction of the Torre de Manila. The provisions further refer to but do not define what constitutes the nation's "historical and cultural heritage and resources," "artistic creations," and "artistic and historic wealth." The authority given to the State to regulate the disposition of the country's artistic and historic wealth also indicates that further government action is intended to enforce the constitutional policy of conserving and protecting our heritage resources.<br><br>Legislation is, thus, necessary to supply the norms and standards and define the parameters for the implementation of the constitutional protection of historical and cultural heritage and resources.<br><br>In this regard, J.

Factoran, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> is illuminating:<br><blockquote>It seems to me important that the legal right which is an essential component of a cause of action be a <b>specific, operable legal right</b>, rather than a constitutional or statutory <i>policy</i>, for at least two (2) reasons. One is that unless the legal right claimed to have been violated or disregarded is given specification in operational terms, defendants may well be unable to defend themselves intelligently and effectively; in other words, there are <b>due process</b> dimensions to this matter.<br><br>The second is a broader-gauge consideration - where a specific violation of law or applicable regulation is not alleged or proved, petitioners can be expected to fall back on the expanded conception of judicial power in the second paragraph of Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 1....<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a <i>grave abuse of discretion</i> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction <i>on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>When substantive standards as general as "the right to a balanced and healthy ecology" and "the right to health" are combined with remedial standards as broad ranging as "a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction," the result will be, it is respectfully submitted, to <b>propel courts into the uncharted ocean of social and economic policy making</b>. At least in respect of the vast area of environmental protection and management, our courts have no claim to special technical competence and experience and professional qualification. <b>Where no specific, operable norms and standards are shown to exist, then the policy making departments - the legislative and executive departments - must be given a real and effective opportunity to fashion and promulgate those norms and standards, and to implement them before the courts should intervene.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Similarly, in his Separate Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> in <i>Agabon v.

The espousal of such view presents the <b>dangerous tendency of being overbroad and exaggerated</b>. The guarantees of "full protection to labor" and "security of tenure", when examined in isolation, are facially unqualified, and the broadest interpretation possible suggests a blanket shield in favor of labor against any form of removal regardless of circumstance. This interpretation implies an unimpeachable right to continued employment - a utopian notion, doubtless - but still hardly within the contemplation of the framers. <b>Subsequent legislation is still needed to define the parameters of these guaranteed rights</b> to ensure the protection and promotion, not only the rights of the labor sector, but of the employers' as well. Without specific and pertinent legislation, <b>judicial bodies will be at a loss, formulating their own conclusion to approximate at least the aims of the Constitution</b>.<br></blockquote>Thus, the constitutional mandate expressed in Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution cannot, on its own, be the source of the avowed right to the preservation of the vista, sightline and setting of the Rizal Park and Rizal Monument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The ensuing question, therefore, is whether legislation enacted pursuant to said mandate provide for specific and operable norms and standards that extend the constitutional protection to the vista, sightline and setting of historical and cultural heritage and resources.

Thus, Section 47 speaks of the conservation and enhancement of the heritage value of the historical site; it also refers to the alteration demolition and re-use of designated heritage properties, and development plans within the heritage area.

While we have concurrent jurisdiction with the Regional Trial Courts and the Court of Appeals to issue the extraordinary writs, this concurrence is not to be taken as an unrestrained freedom of choice as to which court the application for the writ will be directed. There is after all a hierarchy of courts. That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals and should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for petitions for the extraordinary writs. This Court is a court of last resort and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the Constitution and immemorial tradition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><b><i>Mandamus cannot compel the performance of a discretionary act.</i></b><br><br>A key principle to be observed in dealing with petitions for <i>mandamus</i> is that such extraordinary remedy lies to compel the performance of duties that are purely ministerial in nature, not those that are discretionary. A <b>purely ministerial</b> act or duty is one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. The duty is ministerial only when its discharge requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In issuing permits to developers and in granting variances from height restrictions, the City of Manila exercises discretion and judgment upon a given set of facts. Such acts are not purely ministerial functions that can be compelled by <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner failed to comply with requisites for judicial review.</i></b><br><br>Like almost all powers conferred by the Constitution, the power of judicial review is subject to limitations. The following requisites must be complied with before this Court can take cognizance of the case: (1) there must be an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; (2) the person challenging the act must have the standing to question the validity of the subject act or issuance; otherwise stated, he must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement; (3) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must be the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Petitioner failed to show its legal standing to file the case.<br><br>This Court, in determining <i>locus standi</i>, has applied the "direct injury" test which requires that for a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of an executive or legislative action, <b>he must show that he has sustained a direct injury as a result of that action. It is not sufficient that he has a general interest common to all members of the public</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, <i>locus standi</i> or legal standing has been defined as a <b>personal and substantial interest</b> in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence defines interest as "material interest, an interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest By real interest is meant a <b>present substantial interest</b>, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>By the foregoing standards, petitioner cannot be considered to have satisfied the "direct injury" test<br><br>Petitioner alleged that it is a public, non-profit organization created under RA 646, and pursuant to its mandate, it conducts activities at the Rizal Park to commemorate Jose Rizal's birth and martyrdom at least twice a year. Petitioner asserted that its legal mandate to celebrate Rizal 's life was violated on account of private respondent's Torre de Manila project which continue to mar the previously unobstructed view of the Rizal Park. Such interest, however, cannot be said to be personal and substantial enough to infuse petitioner with the requisite <i>locus standi</i>. It certainly is not a present or immediate interest, as petitioner's commemorative activities are not constantly conducted in the Rizal Park.<br><br>The experience of looking at the vista of the Rizal Park and the Rizal Monument and finding it marred by the subject structure does not give rise to a substantial and personal injury that will give <i>locus standi</i> to petitioner to file this case. It is what can be considered as an incidental, if not a generalized, interest. Generalized interests, albeit accompanied by the assertion of a public right, do not establish <i>locus standi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Evidence of a direct and personal interest is key.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The rule on <i>locus standi</i> is not a plain procedural rule but a constitutional requirement derived from Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution, which mandates courts of justice to settle <i>only</i> "actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This Court, in <i>Lozano v. Nograles</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> explained:<br><blockquote>x x x [C]ourts are neither free to decide <i>all</i> kinds of cases dumped into their laps nor are they free to open their doors to <i>all</i> parties or entities claiming a grievance. The rationale for this constitutional requirement of <i>locus standi</i> is by no means trifle. It is intended "to assure a vigorous adversary presentation of the case, and, perhaps more importantly to warrant the judiciary's overruling the determination of a coordinate, democratically elected organ of government." It thus goes to the very essence of representative democracies.<br><br><center>xxx &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>A lesser but not insignificant reason for screening the standing of persons who desire to litigate constitutional issues is economic in character. Given the sparseness of our resources, the capacity of courts to render efficient judicial service to our people is severely limited. For courts to indiscriminately open their doors to all types of suits and suitors is for them to unduly overburden their dockets, and ultimately render themselves ineffective dispensers of justice. To be sure, this is an evil that clearly confronts our judiciary today.<br></blockquote>Petitioner has likewise failed to justify an exemption from the <i>locus standi</i> rule on grounds of "transcendental importance."<br><br>In <i>Galicto v. Aquino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> this Court held that "even if (it) could have exempted the case from the stringent <i>locus standi</i> requirement, such heroic effort would be futile because the transcendental issue could not be resolved any way, <b>due to procedural infirmities and shortcomings</b>." The Court explained that giving due course to a petition saddled with such formal and procedural infirmities would be "an exercise in futility that does not merit the Court's liberality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>As hereinbefore discussed, it was error for petitioner to have filed this case directly before the Supreme Court, as other plain, speedy and adequate remedies were still available and the case indubitably involves questions of fact. Thus, the resolution of any transcendental issue in this case will be rendered futile by reason of these procedural infirmities. Furthermore, it could not escape this Court's attention that what petitioner filed before this Court was, in fact, a petition for injunction over which the Court does not exercise original jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>While the Court has taken an increasingly liberal approach to the rule of <i>locus standi</i>, evolving from the stringent requirements of personal injury to the broader transcendental importance doctrine, such liberality is not to be abused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the "transcendental importance" doctrine cannot be loosely invoked or broadly applied, for as this Court previously explained:<br><blockquote><b>In the final scheme, judicial review is effective largely because it is not available simply at the behest of a partisan faction, but is exercised only to remedy a particular, concrete injury.</b> When warranted by the presence of indispensable minimums for judicial review, this Court shall not shun the duty to resolve the constitutional challenge that may confront it. (<i>Emphasis supplied.</i>)<br></blockquote>Thus, this Court, in the recent case of <i>Roy v. Herbosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> held that an indiscriminate disregard of the requisites for this Court's judicial review, every time "transcendental or paramount importance or significance" is invoked would result in unacceptable corruption of the settled doctrine of <i>locus standi</i> as every worthy cause is an interest shared by the general public.<br><br>Petitioner has also failed to present a justiciable controversy.<br><br>An actual case or controversy involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute. <b>There must be a contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and <u>enforced</u> on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence.</b> The Court can decide the constitutionality of an act or treaty only when a proper case between opposing parties is submitted for judicial determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The existence of an actual case or controversy, thus, presupposes the presence of legally enforceable rights. In this case, petitioner asserts that it has the right to stop the construction of the Torre de Manila on the strength of Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution, which requires the State to conserve and protect the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources. Petitioner argues that heritage preservation includes the sightline and setting of the Rizal Park and Rizal Monument.<br><br>However, as hereinbefore shown, neither the Constitution nor existing legislation, including Manila's Ordinance No. 8119, provides for specific and operable norms and standards that give rise to a judicially enforceable right to the protection of the vista, sightline and setting of the Rizal Park and Rizal Monument.<br><br>Furthermore, related to the requirement of an actual case or controversy is the requirement of ripeness. A question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it. For a case to be considered ripe for adjudication, it is a prerequisite that something had then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture, and the <b>petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to itself as a result of the challenged action. It must show that it has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of the act complained of</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>As previously discussed, petitioner has failed to show that it has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the construction of the Torre de Manila.<br><br>In sum, absent a clear legal right to the protection of the vista, sightline and setting of the Rizal Park and Rizal Monument, and for petitioner's failure to establish its legal standing and the existence of an actual controversy ripe for judicial adjudication, <i>mandamus</i> will not lie.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Star Special Watchman and Detective Agency, Inc., et al. v.
