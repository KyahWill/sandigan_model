Atienza's (petitioner) complaint for disability benefits. <p align="center"><b>The Facts</b> </p><p> Petitioner was employed as an Able Seaman by respondent Orophil Shipping International Co., Inc. (Orophil) on behalf of its principal, respondent Hakuho Kisen Co., Ltd. (Hakuho), and was assigned at the M/V Cape Apricot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In the course of his employment contract, petitioner complained of severe headaches, nausea, and double vision which the foreign port doctors diagnosed to be right cavernous sinus inflammation or Tolosa Hunt Syndrome (THS).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As a result, petitioner was repatriated on February 4, 2005 and referred to a company-designated physician, Doctor Nicomedes G. Cruz (Dr. Cruz), who confirmed the findings and advised him to continue the medication prescribed by the foreign doctors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On June 28, 2005, Dr. Cruz issued a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> declaring petitioner fit to resume work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dissatisfied, petitioner consulted an independent physician, Dr. Paul Matthew D. Pasco (Dr. Pasco), who, on the other hand, assessed his illness as a Grade IV disability and declared him unfit for sea duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Consequently, petitioner filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> against Orophil, Engineer Tomas N. Orola, and Hakuho (respondents) before the NLRC for payment of disability benefits, reimbursement of medical expenses, damages, and attorney's fees, docketed as NLRC NCR OFW M-06-03-01004-00. </p><p> For their part, respondents opposed the claim for disability benefits, asserting that petitioner was declared fit to work by the company-designated physician and that his illness is not work-related, adding too that he maliciously concealed the fact that he had previously suffered from THS that effectively barred him from claiming disability benefits under the 2000 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> They likewise contended that petitioner had been paid his sickness allowance, while the claims for damages and benefits are without basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Labor Arbiter's Ruling</b> </p><p>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated April 30, 2007, the Labor Arbiter (LA) ordered respondents to pay petitioner the amount equivalent to US$34,330.00 for his Grade IV disability and ten percent (10%) attorney's fees, while the rest of the claims were denied for lack of basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The LA found petitioner's illness to be work-related and that he cannot be faulted for not declaring his previous treatment for the same illness given that it had occurred way back in 1996 and has not recurred despite several contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The LA did not give merit to the company-designated physician's finding of fitness to work, noting that petitioner was subsequently declared unfit for sea duty in a medical certificate dated March 14, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Dissatisfied, both parties appealed the case to the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b>The NLRC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated April 22, 2008, the NLRC set aside the LA's Decision and dismissed the complaint for petitioner's failure to establish that his illness is work-related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In so ruling, it did not give credence to the certificate issued by Dr. Pasco as the finding of petitioner's unfitness to resume work was not supported by any explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p>His motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> having been denied by the NLRC in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated August 26, 2008, petitioner elevated his case to the CA via a petition for <em>certiorari</em>, docketed as CA-G.R.

It held that petitioner failed to prove that his illness was caused or aggravated by his employment conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Further, the CA pointed out that petitioner was also declared fit to work by the company-designated physician and that while his independent physician found otherwise, the said assessment was made after the lapse of a considerable period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p>Aggrieved, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated January 22, 2010; hence, this petition. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The main issue in this case is whether or not petitioner is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits pursuant to the 2000 POEA-SEC. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition has merit. </p><p> To justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of <em>certiorari</em>, the petitioner must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon it. </p><p> In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when,<em> inter alia</em>, its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, or that amount of relevance evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Likewise, grave abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA committed reversible error in dismissing petitioner's <em>certiorari </em>petition since the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in holding that petitioner is not entitled to total and permanent disability benefits. </p><p> Under the 2000 POEA-SEC, "any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the conditions set therein satisfied" is deemed to be a "work-related illness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> On the other hand, Section 20 (B) (4) of the 2000 POEA-SEC declares that "[t]hose illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work related." The legal presumption of work-relatedness was borne out from the fact that the said list cannot account for all known and unknown illnesses/diseases that may be associated with, caused or aggravated by such working conditions, and that <strong>the presumption is made in the law to signify that the non-inclusion in the list of occupational diseases does not translate to an absolute exclusion from disability benefits</strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Given the legal presumption in favor of the seafarer, he<em> may rely on and invoke such legal presumption to establish a fact in issue</em>. "The effect of a presumption upon the burden of proof is to create the need of presenting evidence to overcome the <em>prima facie</em> case created, thereby which, if no contrary proof is offered, will prevail."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> Thus, in <em>Racelis v. United Philippine Lines, Inc.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and <em>David v. OSG Shipmanagement Manila, Inc.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court held that <u><strong>the legal presumption of work-relatedness of a non-listed illness should be overturned only when the employer's refutation is found to be supported by substantial evidence</strong></u>, which, as traditionally defined, is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Nonetheless, the presumption provided under Section 20 (B) (4) is only limited to the "work-relatedness" of an illness. It <u><strong>does not cover and extend to <em>compensability</em></strong></u><strong>.</strong> <u><strong>In this sense, there exists a fine line between the work-relatedness of an illness and the matter of compensability</strong></u><strong>.</strong> The former concept merely relates to the assumption that the seafarer's illness, albeit not listed as an occupational disease, may have been contracted during and in connection with one's work, whereas compensability pertains to the entitlement to receive compensation and benefits upon a showing that his work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease. This can be gathered from Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC which already qualifies the listed disease as an "occupational disease" (in other words, a "work-related disease"), but nevertheless, mentions certain conditions for said disease to be compensable: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 32-A OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES</p> <p> For an <u><em><strong>occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied</strong></em></u>:</p> <ol><li> The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; </li><li> The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;</li><li> The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it;</li><li>There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</li></ol> </blockquote> <p> As differentiated from the matter of work-relatedness, no legal presumption of compensability is accorded in favor of the seafarer. As such, he bears the burden of proving that these conditions are met. </p><p> Thus, in <em>Tagle v. Anglo-Eastern Crew Management, Phils., Inc</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court ruled that while work-relatedness is indeed presumed, "<u><strong>the legal presumption in Section 20 (B) (4) of the [2000] POEA-SEC should be read together with the requirements specified by Section 32-A of the same contract</strong></u>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p> Similarly, in <em>Licayan v. Seacrest Maritime Management, Inc.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> it was explicated that the disputable presumption does not signify an automatic grant of compensation and/or benefits claim, and that while the law disputably presumes an illness not found in Section 32-A to be also work-related, <u>the seafarer/claimant nonetheless is burdened to present substantial evidence that his <em>work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease</em> and only a reasonable proof of work-connection, not direct causal relation is required <strong>to establish its compensability</strong></u>. The proof of work conditions referred thereto effectively equates with the conditions for compensability imposed under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC.</p><p> In <em>Jebsen Maritime, Inc. v. Ravena</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> it was likewise elucidated that there is a need to satisfactorily show the four (4) conditions under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC in order for the disputably presumed disease resulting in disability to be compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>To note, while Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC refers to conditions for compensability of an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death, it should be pointed out that the conditions stated therein <u><strong>should also apply to non-listed illnesses</strong></u> given that: (<em><strong>a</strong></em>) the legal presumption under Section 20 (B) (4) accorded to the latter is limited only to "work-relatedness"; and (<em><strong>b</strong></em>) for its compensability, a reasonable connection between the nature of work on board the vessel and the illness contracted or aggravated must be shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> The absurdity of not requiring the seafarer to prove compliance with compensability for non-listed illnesses, when proof of compliance is required for listed illnesses, was pointed out by the Court in <em>Casomo v. Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> A quick perusal of Section 32 of the [2000 POEA-SEC], in particular the Schedule of Disability or Impediment for Injuries Suffered and Diseases including Occupational Diseases or Illnesses Contracted, and the List of Occupational Diseases, easily reveals the serious and grave nature of the injuries, diseases and/or illnesses contemplated therein, which are clearly specified and identified.</p> <p><strong> We are hard pressed to adhere to Casomo's position as it would result in a preposterous situation where a seafarer, claiming an illness not listed under Section 32 of the [2000 POEA-SEC] which is then disputably presumed as work-related and is ostensibly not of a serious or grave nature, need not satisfy the conditions mentioned in Section 32-A of the [2000 POEA-SEC]. In stark contrast, a seafarer suffering from an occupational disease would still have to satisfy four (4) conditions before his or her disease may be compensable.</strong></p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> <em>Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) v. Cuntapay</em> [576 Phil. 482, 492 (2008)] iterates that the burden of proving the causal link between a claimant's work and the ailment suffered rests on a claimant's shoulder:</p> <blockquote> <p> The claimant must show, at least, by substantial evidence that the development of the disease was brought about largely by the conditions present in the nature of the job. What the law requires is a reasonable work connection and not a direct causal relation. It is enough that the hypothesis on which the workmen's claim is based is probable. Probability, not the ultimate degree of certainty, is the test of proof in compensation proceedings. And probability must be reasonable; hence it should, at least, be anchored on credible information. Moreover, a mere possibility will not suffice; a claim will fail if there is only a possibility that the employment caused the disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Therefore, it is apparent that for both listed occupational disease and a non-listed illness and their resulting injury to be compensable, the seafarer must sufficiently show by substantial evidence compliance with the conditions for compensability.</p><p> At this juncture, it is significant to point out that the delineation between work-relatedness and compensability in relation to the legal presumption under Section 20 (B) (4) has been often overlooked in our jurisprudence. <u><strong>This gave rise to the confusion that despite the presumption of work-relatedness already accorded by law, certain cases confound that the seafarer still has the burden of proof to show that his illness, as well as the resulting disability is work-related</strong></u><strong>.</strong> </p><p> Among these cases is <i>Quizora v. Denholm Crew Management (Phils.), Inc</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> wherein this Court failed to discern that the presumption of work-relatedness <u><em>did not extend or equate to presumption of compensability</em></u>, and concomitantly, that the burden of proof required from the seafarer was to establish its compensability <u>not</u> the work-relatedness of the illness: </p><blockquote> <p> At any rate, granting that the provision of the 2000 POEA-SEC apply, the disputable presumption provision in Section 20 (B) does not allow him to just sit down and wait for respondent company to present evidence to overcome the disputable presumption of work-relatedness of the illness. Contrary to his position, he still has to substantiate his claim in order to be entitled to disability compensation. <u><strong>He has to prove that the illness he suffered was work-related and that it must have existed during the term of his contract</strong></u><strong>.</strong> He cannot simply argue that the burden of proof belongs to the respondent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Later, in <em>Magsaysay Maritime Services v. Laurel</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Section 20 (B) (4) (which pertains to a presumption of work-relatedness) was mischaracterized as a <u><em>presumption of compensability</em></u> which stands absent contrary proof: </p><blockquote> <p> Anent the issue as to who has the burden to prove entitlement to disability benefits, the petitioners argue that the burden is placed upon Laurel to prove his claim that his illness was work-related and compensable. Their posture does not persuade the Court.</p> <p> True, hyperthyroidism is not listed as an occupational disease under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC. Nonetheless, Section 20(B), paragraph (4) of the said POEA-SEC states that "those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this contract are disputably presumed work-related." <u>The said provision explicitly establishes a <strong>presumption of compensability</strong> although disputable by substantial evidence</u>. The presumption operates in favor of Laurel as the burden rests upon the employer to overcome the statutory presumption. <u>Hence, unless contrary evidence is presented by the seafarer's employer/s, this disputable presumption stands</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in <em>DOHLE-Philman Manning Agency, Inc. v. Gazzingan,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> a "presumption of compensability" was declared for illnesses not listed as an occupational disease: </p><blockquote> <p> More importantly, the 2000 POEA-SEC has created a <em><strong>presumption of compensability</strong></em> for those illnesses which are not listed as an occupational disease. Section 20 (B), paragraph (4) states that "those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related." Concomitant with this presumption is the burden placed upon the claimant to present substantial evidence that his work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease and only a reasonable proof of work-connection, not direct causal relation is required to establish compensability of illnesses not included in the list of occupational diseases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> To address this apparent confusion, the Court thus clarifies that there lies a technical demarcation between work-relatedness and compensability relative to how these concepts operate in the realm of disability compensation. As discussed, work-relatedness of an illness is presumed; hence, the seafarer does not bear the initial burden of proving the same. Rather, it is the employer who bears the burden of disputing this presumption. If the employer successfully proves that the illness suffered by the seafarer was contracted outside of his work (meaning, the illness is pre-existing), or that although the illness is pre-existing, none of the conditions of his work affected the risk of contracting or aggravating such illness, then there is no need to go into the matter of whether or not said illness is compensable. As the name itself implies, work-relatedness means that the seafarer's illness has a <em>possible</em> connection to one's work, and thus, allows the seafarer to claim disability benefits therefor, albeit the same is not listed as an occupational disease.</p><p> The established work-relatedness of an illness does not, however, mean that the resulting disability is automatically compensable. As also discussed, the seafarer, while not needing to prove the work-relatedness of his illness, bears the burden of proving compliance with the conditions of compensability under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC. Failure to do so will result in the dismissal of his claim.</p><p><strong> <u>Notably, it must be pointed out that the seafarer will, in all instances, have to prove compliance with the conditions for compensability, whether or not the work-relatedness of his illness is disputed by the employer</u>:</strong> </p><p> <u><em>On the one hand</em></u>, when an employer attempts to discharge the burden of disputing the presumption of work-relatedness (<em>i.e</em>., by either claiming that the illness is pre-existing or, even if pre-existing, that the risk of contracting or aggravating the same has nothing do with his work), the burden of evidence now shifts to the seafarer to prove otherwise (<em>i.e</em>., that the illness was not pre-existing, or even if pre-existing, that his work affected the risk of contracting or aggravating the illness.) In so doing, the seafarer <u><em>effectively</em></u> discharges his own burden of proving compliance with the first three conditions of compensability under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC,<em> i.e</em>., that (1) the seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; (2) the disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; and (3) the disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it. Thus, when the presumption of work-relatedness is contested by the employer, the factors which the seafarer needs to prove to rebut the employer's contestation would <strong>necessarily overlap</strong> with some of the conditions which the seafarer needs to prove to establish the compensability of his illness and the resulting disability. <strong>In this regard, the seafarer, therefore, addresses the refutation of the employer against the work-relatedness of his illness and, <u>at the same time</u>, discharges his burden of proving compliance with certain conditions of compensability.</strong></p> <p> <u><em>On the other hand</em></u>, when an employer does not attempt to discharge the burden of disputing the presumption of work-relatedness, the seafarer must still discharge his own burden of proving compliance with the conditions of compensability, which does not only include the three (3) conditions above-mentioned, but also, the distinct fourth condition, i.e., that there was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. Thereafter, the burden of evidence shifts to the employer to now disprove the veracity of the information presented by the seafarer. The employer may also raise any other affirmative defense which may preclude compensation, such as concealment under Section 20 (E)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the 2000 POEA-SEC or failure to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under Section 20 (B) (3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of the same Contract.</p><p> Subsequently, if the work-relatedness of the seafarer's illness is not successfully disputed by the employer, and the seafarer is then able to establish compliance with the conditions of compensability, the matter now shifts to a determination of the nature (<em>i.e</em>., permanent and total or temporary and total) and in turn, the amount of disability benefits to be paid to the seafarer.</p><p> In this case, petitioner claims entitlement to total and permanent disability benefits. Under Article 198 (c) (1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the Labor Code, as amended, in relation to Rule VII, Section 2 (b) and Rule X, Section 2 (a) of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (AREC), the following disabilities shall be deemed as total and permanent: </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 198.

However, a temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than 120 days, <u><strong>except</strong></u> as otherwise provided in the Rules, is considered as a <em><strong>total and permanent disability</strong></em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This exception pertains to a situation when the sickness "<em><strong>still requires medical attendance beyond the 120 days but not to exceed 240 days</strong></em>" <u>in which case, the temporary total disability period is extended up to a maximum of 240 days</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> It should be pointed out that these provisions are to be read hand in hand with the 2000 POEA-SEC, whose Section 20 (3) reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. (Vergara)</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Court explained how the provisions of the Labor Code/AREC and the 2000 POEA-SEC harmoniously operate: </p><blockquote> <p> As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on temporary total disability as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine laws. If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. The seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at any time such declaration is justified by his medical condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Note, however, that prior to the promulgation of<em> Vergara </em>on October 6, 2008, the rule which was followed was the doctrine laid down in <em>Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad (Crystal Shipping)</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Essentially, <em>Crystal Shipping</em> holds that "<strong>[p]ermanent disability is the inability of a worker to perform his job for more than 120 days, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body</strong>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and "[w]hat is important is that [the seafarer] was unable to perform his customary work for more than 120 days which constitutes permanent total disability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p><p> The apparent conflict between <em>Crystal Shipping</em> (120-day rule) and <em>Vergara</em> (120/240-day rule) was later clarified in the case of <em>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar (Kestrel)</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> wherein the Court held that if the seafarer's complaint was filed prior to the promulgation of <em>Vergara</em> on October 6, 2008, the <em>Crystal Shipping</em> doctrine should be applied, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court's pronouncements in <em>Vergara</em> presented a restraint against the indiscriminate reliance on <em>Crystal Shipping</em> such that a seafarer is immediately catapulted into filing a complaint for total and permanent disability benefits after the expiration of 120 days from the time he signed-off from the vessel to which he was assigned. Particularly, a seafarer's inability to work and the failure of the company-designated physician to determine fitness or unfitness to work despite the lapse of 120 days will not automatically bring about a shift in the seafarer's state from total and temporary to total and permanent, considering that the condition of total and temporary disability may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days.</p> <p> Nonetheless, <em>Vergara</em> was promulgated on October 6, 2008, or more than two (2) years from the time Munar filed his complaint and observance of the principle of prospectivity dictates that Vergara should not operate to strip Munar of his cause of action for total and permanent disability that had already accrued as a result of his continued inability to perform his customary work and the failure of the company-designated physician to issue a final assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the case at bar, petitioner was found by both the company-designated and independent physicians to have THS during the term of his employment contract that caused his eventual repatriation on February 4, 2005. THS is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by severe headache and pain often preceding weakness and painful paralysis of certain <u><strong>eye muscles</strong></u>. Its exact cause was unknown but the disease was thought to be associated <u><strong>with inflammation of the area behind the eyes</strong></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> A possible risk factor for THS is a recent viral infection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p> Records show that petitioner, as an Able Seaman, was <u><strong>called to keep watch at sea during navigation, and to observe and record weather and sea conditions, among others</strong></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>. It was also not disputed that in the performance of his duties, <u><strong>petitioner was constantly exposed to cold, heat, and other elements of nature</strong></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> <strong><u>It was likewise in the exercise of his functions that he experienced major symptoms of THS, namely, severe headache, nausea, and double vision</u></strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Clearly, while the exact cause of THS is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that petitioner's illness was most probably aggravated due to the peculiar nature of his work that required him to be on-call twenty-four (24) hours a day to<strong> observe</strong> and keep track of weather conditions and <strong>keep watch</strong> at sea during navigation. These activities necessarily entail <u><strong>the use of eye muscles that can cause an eye strain as in fact, he experienced headache, nausea, and double vision that worsened when he looked at his right side</strong></u>. Considering further his constant exposure to different temperature and unpredictable weather conditions that accompanied his work on board an ocean-going vessel, the likelihood to suffer a viral infection - a possible risk factor - is not far from impossible, more so when no less than petitioner's independent physician, Dr. Pasco, diagnosed him to be suffering from <em>cavernous sinus inflammation</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> Accordingly, it is apparent that while petitioner's illness appears to have been pre-existing, his work exposed him to the risk of aggravating the same. Further, it is also shown that the disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it. As the LA aptly observed: </p><blockquote> <p> Respondents further argued that [petitioner] failed to disclose that he suffered from frequent headaches, stiffness, and eye trouble before he boarded the vessel.</p> <p> [Petitioner] cannot be faulted in answering so when called to answer whether he suffered those conditions because it is possible that indeed he did not suffer from said conditions before boarding the [vessel, because] the history of his illness was way back in 1996 and <u><strong>has not recurred despite his several contracts with the respondents. It is only during his last contract that he experienced the said illness and it is unavoidable that his illness called "Right cavernous Sinus Inflammation" was aggravated by his working conditions on board including the lifestyle on board the vessel</strong></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, there was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. These findings square with the conditions of compensability under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC, and hence, all appear to attend to this case. By and large, the tasks performed by petitioner and his constant exposure to the varying elements of nature have contributed to the development or aggravation of his illness while on board the <em>M/V Cape Apricot</em> and therefore, rendered his illness and resulting disability compensable. In <em>Canuel v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> it was held that the pre-existing nature of the seafarer's illness does not bar compensation if the same was aggravated due to his working conditions: </p><blockquote> <p><u><strong>Compensability x x x does not depend on whether the injury or disease was pre-existing at the time of the employment but rather if the disease or injury is work-related or aggravated his condition. It is indeed safe to presume that, at the very least, the arduous nature of [the seafarer's] employment had contributed to the aggravation of his injury, if indeed it was pre-existing at the time of his employment</strong></u><strong>. </strong>Therefore, it is but just that he be duly compensated for it. It is not necessary, in order for an employee to recover compensation, that he must have been in perfect condition or health at the time he received the injury, or that he be free from disease. Every workman brings with him to his employment certain infirmities, and while the employer is not the insurer of the health of his employees, he takes them as he finds them, and assumes the risk of having a weakened condition aggravated by some injury which might not hurt or bother a perfectly normal, healthy person. If the injury is the proximate cause of his death or disability for which compensation is sought, the previous physical condition of the employee is unimportant and recovery may be had for injury independent of any pre-existing weakness or disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied). </p> </blockquote> <p> At any rate, records show that it was only on June 28, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> that the company-designated physician issued a Medical Certificate declaring petitioner fit to work, which was 144 days after petitioner's repatriation on February 4, 2005. Considering that petitioner's complaint was filed on March 29, 2006, during which time the 120-day rule pronounced in <em>Crystal Shipping</em> was the prevailing doctrine, the failure of the company-designated physician to issue a final assessment within the 120-day period gave rise to a <u><strong>conclusive presumption that petitioner's disability is total and permanent</strong></u><strong>.</strong> </p><p> In this case, the NLRC failed to account for the foregoing rules on seafarers' compensation and instead, cavalierly dismissed petitioner's claim on the supposition that petitioner failed to show a reasonable connection between his illness and his work as an Able Seaman, even if the records show otherwise. <u><strong>More significantly, the NLRC did not account for the employer's failure to comply with the 120 day-rule, by virtue of which the law conclusively presumes the seafarer's disability to be total and permanent</strong></u><strong>. </strong>Thus, for these reasons, the Court finds that the NLRC's ruling is tainted with grave abuse of discretion and hence, should have been corrected by the CA through <em>certiorari</em>. Accordingly, the CA's ruling must be reversed and set aside.</p><p> In fine, petitioner should be paid by respondent Orophil Shipping International Co., Inc. (his employer) the maximum disability amount of US$60,000.00 under the 2000 POEA-SEC, or its peso equivalent at the time of payment, as prayed for in his Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and pursuant to existing jurisprudence: </p><blockquote> <p> Pursuant to the ruling in <em>Crystal Shipping</em>, the fact that the assessment was made beyond the 120-day period prescribed in the Labor Code is sufficient basis to declare that respondent suffered permanent total disability. <u><strong>This condition entities him to the maximum disability benefit of USD 60,000 under the POEA-SEC</strong></u><strong>.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The Court likewise grants petitioner attorney's fees of US$6,000.00, or its peso equivalent at the time of payment, since he was forced to litigate to protect his valid claim. Case law states that "[w]here an employee is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his right and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney's fees equivalent to [ten percent] (10%) of the award."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, as the LA ruled, all other claims in petitioner's Position Paper are dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>PARTLY GRANTED</strong>.

As explained in <em>Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corp</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this issue is, at its core, a question of fact: </p><blockquote> <p> 2. As framed by Montoya, the petition before us involves mixed questions of fact and law, with the core issue being one of fact. This issue — from which the other issues spring — is whether the tuberculosis afflicting the petitioner is work-related. Stated otherwise, can this illness be reasonably linked to, or reasonably be said to be caused by, Montoya's work as a seaman, his working environment, or incidents at work; or, is it an illness that Montoya contracted outside of his work, or because of genetic predisposition, or from another illness contracted out of work but which led to the tuberculosis? <strong>As a question of fact, this question of linkage or causation is an issue we cannot touch under Rule 45, except in the course of determining whether the CA correctly ruled in determining whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in considering and appreciating this factual issue.</strong></p> <p> Whether Montoya is entitled to disability [compensation] or to attorney's fees are issues that require the consideration and application of provisions of law and are essentially questions of law. In the context of this case, however, these are legal questions that spring from and cannot be resolved without the definitive resolution of the factual issue mentioned above.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied and italics omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> On this particular question of fact, the tribunals in this case reached different conclusions.</p><p> LA Savari did not expressly resolve the question of whether or not the illness was related to the activities of petitioner while on board the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Nevertheless, she reached a conclusion in his favor based on her finding that he had "incurred an illness while on board and during the effectivity of his contract and was repatriated for medical reasons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> On appeal, the NLRC reviewed the record and reached the opposite result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It noted the absence of (a) substantial evidence showing at least a reasonable connection between the illness of petitioner and his work as an Able Seaman; and (b) a credible reason why he was considered unfit for sea duty. The NLRC declared: </p><blockquote> <p> In the present case, <strong>We find no credible evidence presented by the complainant to show the existence, at least, a reasonable connection between his illness and his work as an Able Seaman. While his employment as a sea man entails the exertion of some physical and mental calisthenics, complainant has omitted to show how or in what manner has his work (sic) contributed to the development of Tolosa Hunt Syndrome. Apparently, complainant relies solely on his bare allegations which, unfortunately, cannot be given the same evidentiary weight of evidence.</strong></p> <p> It is also noted that the record is bereft of any showing of how or in what manner is the complainant incapacitated or unfit for sea duty. While complainant may have been certified by Dr. Paul Matthew D. Pasco of the UP-PGH Medical Center to be unfit for sea duty, there is no accompanying explanation or memorandum which enlightens Us of the conditions which makes complainant unfit for sea duty. All that there is, is a one line phrase that declares complainant unfit for sea duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In the assailed Decision and Resolution, the CA also observed the dearth of evidence that the illness of petitioner was reasonably connected with his work. This scarcity of proof prompted the appellate court to affirm the findings of the NLRC: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>Except for his allegation, petitioner did not present proof that his illness was caused or aggravated by his employment.</strong> The underlying circumstances of the case show that petitioner has first incurred his illness way back in 1996 and it has not recurred during his previous contracts with private respondents. It was only during his last contract that his illness has manifested or has recurred.</p> <p> <strong>The evidence available before the Labor Arbiter and public respondent are totally bare of essential facts on how petitioner contracted or developed such disease for the second time and on how and why his working conditions increased the risk of contracting the same. The Court found no substantiation that the progression of petitioner's ailment was brought about largely by the conditions of his job as an able seaman. His medical history and/or records prior to his deployment as able seaman with M/V Cape Apricot were neither presented nor alluded to in order to demonstrate that the working conditions on board said vessel increased the risk of contracting the same. </strong>Whilst the Court agrees with the petitioner that the exact cause of Tolosa Hunt Syndrome is not known, such fact does not abandon the primordial duty of petitioner to prove the reasonable connection between his illness and his employment. Having failed to do so, the element that the injury or illness must be work-related cannot exist in this case. Hence, the fact that petitioner's illness recurred during his contract with the private respondents cannot alone entitle him for (sic) his claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51] </sup>(Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In my opinion, there is no reason to deviate from the factual determinations of the CA and the NLRC.</p> <p> As earlier explained, whether the illness suffered by the seafarer is related to his work on board the vessel is a question of fact. The findings of the NLRC on this point, as affirmed by the CA, are therefore beyond the scope of our review in a Rule 45 proceeding. In general, we only review its findings when these are relevant to our determination of whether or not the CA was correct in finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.</p><p> To emphasize, both the CA and the NLRC found no substantial evidence to prove that the illness suffered by petitioner had a reasonable connection with his work as an Able Seaman. The LA, on the other hand, did not have any specific finding on the issue of work-relatedness. Given these premises, I find it proper to accord great weight and deference to the factual conclusions of the CA and the NLRC; in particular, their observation that no sufficient evidence was presented by petitioner. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><em><strong>Considering the failure of petitioner to prove that his illness was work-related, his disability is not compensable.</strong></em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Pursuant to Section 20(B) of the 2000 Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Oceangoing Vessels<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Standard Terms and Conditions), a seafarer is entitled to disability benefits if he suffers "work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract."

My own examination of the records reveals that he only presented general allegations about his "strenuous job assignments," "heavy workload," and "exposure to cold, heat and other elements of nature." However, he failed to make an effort to explain how his working conditions as an Able Seaman actually caused or aggravated his illness. The nature and causes of the disease were never established; in fact, the only evidence on record describing it is a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>attesting to the fact that the exact cause of Tolosa Hunt Syndrome is unknown, and that its symptoms recur without distinct pattern. The physician thus concluded that the ''illness is of inflammatory nature and considered not work-related."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> More important, the general statements made by petitioner remain uncorroborated by evidence. In fact, the Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> issued by his own physician, Dr. Pasco, does not state that the sickness suffered by the former was caused or aggravated by, or was even merely related to, his work. The doctor only provided his diagnosis of petitioner's illness and a disability rating. For obvious reasons, the Medical Certificate cannot be considered evidence that the illness was contracted as a result of the exposure of the seafarer to certain risks in the course of his work.</p><p> While only probability and not absolute and direct connection is required, it must be emphasized that "[probability of work-connection must at least be anchored on credible information and not on self-serving allegations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Here, petitioner has failed to provide the required credible information upon which the Court could have based its assessment of the probability of his claim. He alleges that he underwent physical exertion while on duty, and that he was on call 24 hours a day to keep track of weather conditions. His allegations are insufficient, since the records are bereft of any proof that these risks caused or aggravated his specific illness.</p><p> I also note that petitioner has not denied the allegation that he suffered from the same illness in 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> prior to his employment as a seafarer on board the vessels operated by respondents in 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> There is likewise medical evidence that Tolosa Hunt Syndrome recurs randomly or without any distinct pattern.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This fact further militates against his claim that his disease had a reasonable connection with his work.</p><p> Given the failure of petitioner to discharge his evidentiary burden under Section 32-A, it is evident that his disability cannot be considered compensable. The NLRC therefore acted in accordance with law and jurisprudence when it denied his claim for disability benefits. In so ruling, it cannot be said to have acted with grave abuse of discretion. Consequently, it was only proper for the CA to dismiss the Petition for Certiorari.</p><p> My conclusion that petitioner has failed to prove that his illness is compensable renders it unnecessary to resolve his assertion regarding the failure of the company physician to issue a disability rating within 120 days from the date of his repatriation.
