It also correctly held that with the shortage in petitioner's payment, what applies is Section 4, instead of Section 3. This means that respondent could cancel the contract since petitioner failed to pay within the 60-day grace period.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, however, failed to realize that the notice of cancellation made by respondent was an invalid notarial act.

Ernesto Maceda, was adopted with the purpose of "protect[ing] buyers of real estate on installment payments against onerous and oppressive conditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It "delineat[es] the rights and remedies of . . . buyers and protect[s] them from one-sided and pernicious contract stipulations":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>Its declared public policy is to protect buyers of real estate on installment basis against onerous and oppressive conditions. The law seeks to address the acute housing shortage problem in our country that has prompted thousands of middle and lower class buyers of houses, lots and condominium units to enter into all sorts of contracts with private housing developers involving installment schemes. Lot buyers, mostly low income earners eager to acquire a lot upon which to build their homes, readily affix their signatures on these contracts, without an opportunity to question the onerous provisions therein as the contract is offered to them on a "take it or leave it" basis. Most of these contracts of adhesion, drawn exclusively by the developers, entrap innocent buyers by requiring cash deposits for reservation agreements which often times include, in fine print, onerous default clauses where all the installment payments made will be forfeited upon failure to pay any installment due even if the buyers had made payments for several years. Real estate developers thus enjoy an unnecessary advantage over lot buyers who[m] they often exploit with iniquitous results. They get to forfeit all the installment payments of defaulting buyers and resell the same lot to another buyer with the same exigent conditions. To help especially the low income lot buyers, the legislature enacted R.A. No. 6552 delineating the rights and remedies of lot buyers and protect[ing] them from one-sided and pernicious contract stipulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Having been adopted with the explicit objective of protecting buyers against what it recognizes to be disadvantageous and onerous conditions, the Maceda Law's provisions must be liberally construed in favor of buyers. Within the bounds of reason, fairness, and justice, doubts in its interpretation must be resolved in a manner that will afford buyers the fullest extent of its benefits.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Sections 3 and 4 of the Maceda Law spell out the rights of defaulting buyers on installment payments, depending on the extent of payments made.<br><br>Section 3 governs situations in which a buyer "has paid at least two years of installments":<br><blockquote>Section 3. In all transactions or contracts involving the sale or financing of real estate on installment payments, including residential condominium apartments but excluding industrial lots, commercial buildings and sales to tenants under Republic Act Numbered Thirty eight hundred forty-four, as amended by Republic Act Numbered Sixty-three hundred eighty-nine, where the buyer has paid at least two years of installments, the buyer is entitled to the following rights in case he defaults in the payment of succeeding installments:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">To pay, without additional interest, the unpaid installments due within the total grace period earned by him, which is hereby fixed at the rate of one month grace period for every one year of installment payments made: <em>Provided</em>, That this right shall be exercised by the buyer only once in every five years of the life of the contract and its extensions, if any.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">If the contract is cancelled, the seller shall refund to the buyer the cash surrender value of the payments on the property equivalent to fifty per cent of the total payments made and, after five years of installments, an additional five per cent every year but not to exceed ninety per cent of the total payments made: <i>Provided</i>, That the actual cancellation of the contract shall take place after thirty days from receipt by the buyer of the notice of cancellation or the demand for rescission of the contract by a notarial act and upon full payment of the cash surrender value to the buyer.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Down payments, deposits or options on the contract shall be included in the computation of the total number of installment payments made.<br></blockquote>Section 4 governs situations "where less than two years of installments were paid":<br><blockquote>Section 4, In case where less than two years of installments were paid, the seller shall give the buyer a grace period of not less than sixty days from the date the installment became due. If the buyer fails to pay the installments due at the expiration of the grace period, the seller may cancel the contract after thirty days from receipt by the buyer of the notice of cancellation or the demand for rescission of the contract by a notarial act.<br></blockquote>In both Sections 3 and 4, defaulting buyers are afforded grace periods in which they may pay the installments due. Should they fail to make payment within the applicable period, cancellation of their agreement with the seller may ensue.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Contrary to petitioner's allegations, she did not pay "at least two years of installments" as to fall within the protection of Section 3.<br><br>In a sale by installment, a buyer defers full payment of the purchase price and ratably apportions payment across a period. It is typified by regular, fractional payments. It is these regular, fractional payments that are referred to as "installments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Thus, when Section 3 speaks of paying "at least two years of <i>installments</i>," it refers to the equivalent of the totality of payments diligently or consistently made throughout a period of two (2) years. Accordingly, where installments are to be paid on a monthly basis, paying "at least two years of installments" pertains to the aggregate value of 24 monthly installments. As explained in <i>Gatchalian Realty v. Angeles</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>It should be noted that Section 3 of R.A. 6552 and paragraph six of Contract Nos. 2271 and 2272, speak of "two years of installments." <i>The basis for computation of the term refers to the installments that correspond to the number of months of payments</i>, and not to the number of months that the contract is in effect as well as any grace period that has been given. Both the law and the contracts thus <i>prevent any buyer who has not been diligent in paying his monthly installments tom unduly claiming the rights provided in Section 3</i> of R.A. 6552.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The phrase "at least two years of installments" refers to value and time. It does not only refer to the period when the buyer has been making payments, with total disregard for the value that the buyer has actually conveyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It refers to the proportionate value of the installments made, as well as payments having been made for at least two (2) years.<br><br>Laws should never be so interpreted as to produce results that are absurd or unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Sustaining petitioner's contention that spe falls within Section 3's protection just because she has been paying for more than two (2) years goes beyond a justified, liberal construction of the Maceda Law. It facilitates arbitrariness, as intermittent payments of fluctuating amounts would become permissible, so long as they stretch for two (2) years. Worse, it condones an absurdity. It sets a precedent that would endorse minimal, token payments that extend for two (2) years. A buyer could, then, literally pay loose change for two (2) years and still come under Section 3's protection.<br><br>Reckoning payment of "at least two years of installments" on the basis of the regular, factional payments due from the buyer was demonstrated in <i>Marina Properties Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> There, the monthly amortization of P67,024.22 was considered in determining the validity of the cancellation of the contract by the seller:<br><blockquote>We likewise uphold the finding that MARINA's cancellation of the Contract To Buy and To Sell was clearly illegal. Prior to MARINA's unilateral act of rescission, H.L. CARLOS had already paid P1,810,330.70, or more than 50% of the contract price of P3,614,000.00. Moreover, the sum H.L. CARLOS had disbursed amounted to more than the total of 24 installments, <i>i.e.</i>, two years' worth of installments computed at a monthly installment rate of P67,024.22, inclusive of the downpayment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Jestra Development and Management Corporation v. Pacifico</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> where down payment was itself payable in portions, this Court reckoned the monthly installment payment for the down payment amounting to P121,666.66, rather than the monthly amortization. This Court justified this by referencing Section 3's injunction that "[d]own payments, deposits or options on the contract shall be included in the computation of the total number of installment payments made":<br><blockquote>The total purchase price of the property is P2,500,000. As provided in the Reservation Application, the 30% down payment on the purchase price or P750,000 was to be paid in six monthly installments of P121,666.66. Under the Contract to Sell, the 70% balance of P1,750,000.00 on the purchase price was to be paid in 10 years through monthly installments of P34,983, which was later increased to P39,468 in accordance with the agreement to restructure the same.<br><br>While, under the above-quoted Section 3 of R.A. No. 6552, the down payment is included in computing the total number of installment payments made, the proper divisor is neither P34,983 nor P39,468, but P121,666.66, the monthly installment on the down payment.<br><br>The P750,000 down payment was to be paid in six monthly installments. If the down payment of P750,000 is to be deducted from the total payment of P846,600, the remainder is only P96,600. Since respondent was able to pay the down payment in full eleven (11) months after the last monthly installment was due, and the sum of P76,600 representing penalty for delay of payment is deducted from the remaining P96,600, only a balance of P20,000 remains.<br><br>As respondent failed to pay at least two years of installments, he is not, under above-quoted Section 3 of R.A. No. 6552, entitled to a refund of the cash surrender value of his payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Jestra</i> was wrong to use the installment payments on the down payment as divisor. It is an error to reckon the payment of two (2) years' worth of installments on the apportionment of the down payment because, even in cases where the down payment is broken down into smaller, more affordable portions, payments for it still do not embody the ratable apportionment of the contract price throughout the <i>entire</i> duration of the contract term. Rather than the partial payments for the down payment, it is the partition of the contract price into monthly amortizations that manifests the ratable apportionment across a complete contract term that is the essence of sales on installment. The correct standard is that which was used in <i>Marina</i>, not in <i>Jestra</i>.<br><br><i>Marina</i> also correctly demonstrated how Section 3's injunction that "[d]own payments, deposits or options on the contract shall be included in the computation of the total number of installment payments made" should operate. In <i>Marina</i>, the total amount of P1,810,330.70 paid by the buyer was inclusive of payments for down payment worth P1,034,200.00 and cash deposit worth P50,000.00. In concluding that the buyer in <i>Marina</i> had paid more than two (2) years' or 24 months' worth of installments, what this Court considered was the total amount of P1,810,330.70 and not merely the payments on amortizations.<br><br>Following <i>Marina</i>, this Court reckons petitioner's satisfaction of the requisite two (2) years' or 24 months' worth of installments using as divisor the monthly amortizations due from petitioner. However, this Court notes that the mon1hly amortizations due from petitioner were stipulated to escalate on a yearly basis. In keeping with the need to construe the Maceda Law in a manner favorable to the buyer, this Court uses as basis the monthly amortizations set for the first year, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, P27,936.84. With this as the divisor, it shall appear that petitioner has only paid 21.786 months' worth of installments. This falls short of the requisite two (2) years' or 24 months' worth of installments.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Failing to satisfy Section 3's threshold, petitioner's case is governed by Section 4 of the Maceda Law.<br><br>Thus, she was "entitled to a grace period of not less than sixty (60) days from the due date within which to make [her] installment payment.

Under Sections 3 and 4, notarization enables the exercise of the statutory right of unilateral cancellation by the seller of a perfected contract. If an acknowledgement is necessary in the customary rendition of public documents, with greater reason should an acknowledgement be imperative in notices of cancellation or demands for rescission made under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maceda Law.<br><br>Through an acknowledgement, individuals acting as representatives declare that they are authorized to act as such representatives. This is particularly crucial with respect to signatories to notices of cancellation or demands for rescission under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maceda Law. In a great number of cases, the sellers of real property shall be juridical persons acting through representatives. In these cases, it is imperative that the officer signing for the seller indicate that he or she is duly authorized to effect the cancellation of an otherwise perfected contract. Not all personnel are capacitated to effect these cancellations; individuals purporting to do so must demonstrate their specific authority. In the case of corporations, this authority is vested through board resolutions, or by stipulations in the articles of incorporation or by-laws.<br><br>Respondent's notice of cancellation here was executed by an individual identified only as belonging to respondent's Collection Department. It was also accompanied not by an acknowledgement, but by a jurat.<br><br>A jurat is a distinct notarial act, which makes no averment concerning the authority of a representative.
