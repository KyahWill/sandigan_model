In its November 15, 2006 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the CA ruled that although the transfers from Agnes to Priscilla were identified as absolute sales, the contracts are deemed equitable mortgages pursuant to Article 1602<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thus, the CA disposed of the case in this wise:<br><blockquote>In view of these, We resolve [petitioner spouses'] prayers in the following manner:<br><br>Anent their prayer for the issuance of new certificates of titles, We hold the cancellation of [petitioner Agnes'] title over the 2 lots was void. Titles to the subject lots, which had supposedly been transferred to [Evangeline] and later to [Priscilla], actually remained with [petitioner Agnes], as owner-mortgagor, conformably with the well-established doctrine that the mortgagee does not automatically become the owner of the mortgaged property as the ownership thereof remains with the mortgagor. Hence, it is not necessary for Us to order the issuance of new titles under the name of [petitioner Agnes]. Accordingly, TCT No. 167438 and TCT No. 167439 issued under the name of [petitioner Agnes] must be reinstated, while TCT No. 188920 and TCT No. 188995 issued in the name of [Priscilla] must be nullified.<br><br>Anent their prayer for the nullification of the Deeds of Absolute Sale and the Mortgage, We resolve to deny the same. Although the subject deeds of sale in favor of [Evangeline] were actually for mortgage, said type of simulation of contracts does not result in the nullification of the deeds but requires the reformation of the instrument, pursuant to Article 1365 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Moreover, as [petitioner spouses Rosario] admitted they mortgaged the 2 lots to [Priscilla] as security for the payment of their loans. Absent any proof that [petitioner spouses Rosario] had fully paid their loans to [Priscilla], [Priscilla] may seek the foreclosure of the 2 lots if [petitioner spouses Rosario] failed to pay their loans of P1.8 Million, the amounts appearing in the Deeds of Absolute Sale.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated April 4, 2003 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 150, in Civil Cases Nos. 94-1797 &amp; 96-135, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<br><br>A new one is hereby entered ordering the reinstatement of TCT No. 167438 and TCT No. 167439 issued under the name of [petitioner] Agnes Dean-Rosario aid ordering the cancellation of TCT No. 188920 and TCT No. 188995 issued under the name of [Priscilla].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Since the parties did not file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal, the CA Decision became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 2007, Priscilla sent a letter to Agnes demanding the payment of her outstanding obligation amounting to P1.8 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Due to the failure or refusal of petitioner spouses Rosario to heed the demand, Priscilla filed before the RTC of Makati, Branch 148, a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage, docketed as Civil Case No. 07-997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner spouses Rosario moved for the dismissal of the Complaint, but the RTC denied the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>They then filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R.

CV No. 81350, from which this case arose, has attained finality due to the failure of the parties to file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal. As such, the factual findings and conclusions in the November 15, 2006 Decision may no longer be disputed by petitioner spouses Rosario as <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment, which bars them from challenging the same issues.<br><br>Unlike <i>res judicata</i> by prior judgment, where there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action, there is only identity of parties and subject matter in <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Since there is no identity of cause of action, the judgment in the first case is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, there is <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment when all the following elements are present:<br><blockquote>(1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final;<br><br>(2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;<br><br>(3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and<br><br>(4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, but not identity of causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, all the elements are present: first, the November 15, 2006 Decision has attained finality; second, the said decision was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; third, the said decision disposed of the case on the merits; and fourth, there is, as between the previous case and the instant case, an identity of parties.<br><br>Since there is conclusiveness of judgment in this case, petitioner spouses Rosario are estopped from raising issues that were already adjudged in the November 15, 2006 Decision as "the dictum laid down in the earlier final judgment is conclusive and continues to be binding between the parties, their privies and successors-in-interest, as long as the facts on which that judgment was predicated continue to be the facts of the case or incident before the court in a later case x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In short, "the binding effect and enforceability of that earlier dictum can no longer be re-litigated in a later case since the issue has already been resolved and finally laid to rest in the earlier case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Consequently, there is no need for Us to delve into the issues raised by petitioner spouses Rosario pertaining to the existence of the loan and the legal personality of Priscilla to file a case for judicial foreclosure as the November 15, 2006 Decision already established the existence of the loan in the amount of P1.8 million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and recognized the legal personality of Priscilla to foreclose the subject property, as she was the one who loaned spouses Rosario the amount of P1.8 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>The pronouncement in the November 15, 2006 Decision that the parties' intention was to execute an equitable mortgage is sufficient reformation of such instrument.</i></b><br><br>The only issue left for us to determine is whether a reformation of the contract is required before the subject lots may be foreclosed.<br><br>We rule in the negative.<br><br>Reformation of an instrument is a remedy in equity where a written instrument already executed is allowed by law to be reformed or construed to express or conform to the real intention of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The <i>rationale</i> of the doctrine is that it would be unjust and inequitable to allow the enforcement of a written instrument that does not express or reflect the real intention of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the November 15, 2006 Decision, the CA denied petitioner spouses' Complaint for declaration of nullity of contract of sale on the ground that what was required was the reformation of the instruments, pursuant to Article 1365<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In ruling that the Deeds of Absolute Sale were actually mortgages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the CA, in effect, had reformed the instruments based on the true intention of the parties.
