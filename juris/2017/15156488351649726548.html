SP No. 129806. </p><p> Camarines Sur Provincial Hospital (Provincial Hospital) was established in 1933 as a 25-bed provincial hospital located along Mabini Street, now Peñafrancia Avenue, Naga City. The Camarines Sur Provincial Government eventually subsidized the operations of a private hospital located at Concepcion Pequeña, Naga City and transferred the Provincial Hospital there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> Road Lot No. 3, which stretched from Panganiban Road to J.

The Court of Appeals also gave due weight to the 1970s Revised Assessor's Tax Mapping Control Roll and its Identification Map, which support the Intervenors' assertion of the public nature of Road Lot No. 3.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals concluded that Naga City and the Intervenors were able to present<em> prima facie</em> evidence of their right to the writ.

However, the Court of Appeals emphasized that the injunction was not directed against the construction of the Cancer Center Building but against the relocation of the service road and gate closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p>On September 29, 2014, petitioners BMC and the Department of Health filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> before this Court. Petitioners claim that although Road Lot No. 3 has been open to vehicles and pedestrians as BMC's service road, it was never intended for use by the general public and was not owned by Naga City, as evidenced by the certification issued by the Office of the City Engineer of Naga City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners assert that they have set up a gate on Road Lot No. 3, which is closed at night, on weekends, and during holidays for security reasons and for the welfare of patients and hospital staff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>Petitioners maintain that Dr. Nerva's closure of the road and relocation of the gate was in preparation for the construction of the Cancer Center Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, the preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the Court of Appeals had the effect of halting construction of a government project, a violation of Presidential Decree No. 1818<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and this Court's Administrative Circular No. 11-2000, which reiterated the prohibition on the issuance of injunctions in cases involving government infrastructure projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners claim that the P51,999,475.26 contract for the Cancer Center Building has been awarded to OCM Steel Corporation, the winning contractor, and the Notice to Proceed dated February 3, 2014 has been issued, signalling the mobilization stage of the construction of the Cancer Center Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p>Petitioners emphasize that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the injunction over the relocation of the service road and closure of the gate did not violate Presidential Decree No. 1818 because the Cancer Center Building, a government project, will be constructed right where the gate stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners point out that the Cancer Center Building will be constructed along Road Lot No. 3; hence, there is a need to close this road due to the excavation and construction, which will make it dangerous for pedestrians and vehicles alike to pass through.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners likewise underscore that the intervenors, now respondents, failed to support their claim that Road Lot No. 3 was a public road<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> or that they had a clear right to the injunctive relief prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Furthermore, respondents also allegedly "failed to prove that the invasion of the[ir] right sought to be protected [was] material and substantial" and that there was an urgent necessity for the issuance of the writ to prevent serious damage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Finally, petitioners applied for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to prevent the reopening of the gate since doing so would affect the construction of the Cancer Center Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> On October 8, 2014, this Court issued two (2) Resolutions. The first Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> granted petitioners' motion for extension to file their petition. The second Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the implementation of the Court of Appeals February 28, 2014 Decision and August 26, 2014 Resolution, which directed the Regional Trial Court to issue a writ of mandatory preliminary injunction on the closure of Road Lot No. 3. The second Resolution also required respondents to comment on the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p>On January 13, 2015, respondents filed their Comment on the Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> where they disputed petitioners' claim that Road Lot No. 3 was always a component or service road of BMC. Respondents contend that Road Lot No. 3 existed as a public road long before any hospital was constructed on it and assert that it remains to be a public road to this day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> Respondents also dispute petitioners' claim that the road closure was for the construction of the Cancer Center Building since Dr. Nerva's memorandum was for no other purpose than to reroute traffic within the hospital complex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p> Respondents likewise point out that when they filed their intervention before the Regional Trial Court and their petition before the Court of Appeals, there were still no plans to construct the Cancer Center Building. Furthermore, BMC allegedly failed to support its claim that there were indeed plans to build the Cancer Center Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Nonetheless, respondents explain that they are not against its construction but are merely asking that it not be illegally built on a public road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p> Finally, respondents ask that this Court lift its issued temporary restraining order against the assailed Court of Appeals Decision and Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> In its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> dated February 25, 2015, this Court noted respondents' comment and denied their prayer to lift the temporary restraining order.

City Advertising Ventures Corp</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> defined a writ of preliminary injunction as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> [A] writ of preliminary injunction is an ancillary and interlocutory order issued as a result of an impartial determination of the context of both parties. It entails a procedure for the judge to assess whether the reliefs prayed for by the complainant will be rendered moot simply as a result of the parties' having to go through the full requirements of a case being fully heard on its merits. Although a trial court judge is given a latitude of discretion, he or she cannot grant a writ of injunction if there is no clear legal right materially and substantially breached from a<em> prima facie</em> evaluation of the evidence of the complainant. Even if this is present, the trial court must satisfy itself that the injury to be suffered is irreparable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A writ of preliminary injunction is issued to: </p><blockquote> <p> [P]reserve the<em> status quo ante</em>, upon the applicant's showing of two important requisite conditions, namely: (1) the right to be protected exists <em>prima facie</em>, and (2) the acts sought to be enjoined are violative of that right.

Hosana</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> defines <em>prima facie</em> evidence as evidence that is "good and sufficient on its face. Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact, or the group or chain of facts constituting the party's claim or defense and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><p> <em>Spouses Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> then discussed the requisites and the proof required for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction: </p><blockquote> <p> The plaintiff praying for a writ of preliminary injunction must further establish that he or she has a present and unmistakable right to be protected; that the facts against which injunction is directed violate such right; and there is a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages. In the absence of proof of a legal right and the injury sustained by the plaintiff, an order for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction will be nullified. Thus, <em>where the plaintiff's right is doubtful or disputed, a preliminary injunction is not proper. </em>The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of an actual existing right is not a ground for a preliminary injunction. </p> <p> However, to establish the essential requisites for a preliminary injunction, the evidence to be submitted by the plaintiff need not be conclusive and complete. The plaintiffs are only required to show that they have an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in their complaint. A writ of preliminary injunction is generally based solely on initial or incomplete evidence. Such evidence need only be a sampling intended merely to give the court an evidence of justification for a preliminary injunction pending the decision on the merits of the case, and is not conclusive of the principal action which has yet to be decided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> To prove its clear legal right over the remedy being sought, Naga City presented before the trial court the 1970s Revised Assessor's Tax Mapping Control Roll and its Identification Map which both identified Road Lot No. 3 as being in the name of the Province of Camarines Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Witnesses' testimonies were also presented to corroborate Naga City's claims of the public nature of Road Lot No. 3.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p><p> Respondents claimed that as members of the general public, they had every right to use Road Lot No. 3, a public road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, BMC presented TCT No. 13693,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> which covered a total land area of 53,890m<sup>2</sup> within Barrio Concepcion, Naga City with the Ministry of Health, now Department of Health, as the registered owner.

Whatever right they sought to establish by proving the public nature of Road Lot No. 3 was rebutted by the Department of Health's certificate of title and the City Engineer's categorical statement that "the road from Panganiban Drive up to the entrance and exit gate of [BMC] was not included in the list'' of city roads under Naga City's control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> Instead of merely relying on a tax map and claims of customary use, Naga City or respondents should have presented a clear legal right to support their claim over Road Lot No. 3. </p><p> <em>Executive Secretary v.

Department of Health's ownership over Road Lot No. 3, with the concomitant right to use and enjoy this property, must be respected. </p><p> Respondents likewise cannot rely on the supposed customary use of Road Lot No. 3 by the public to support their claimed right of unfettered access to the road because customary use is not one (1) of the sources of legal obligation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> hence, it does not ripen into a right. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> This Court finds that the Court of Appeals erred in limiting<em> prima facie</em> evidence merely to the evidence presented by Naga City and respondents and in disregarding altogether petitioners' evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> which had the effect of squarely rebutting Naga City and respondents' assertions. The Court of Appeals failed to appreciate the nature of the ancillary remedy of a writ of preliminary injunction as against the<em> ex parte </em>nature of a temporary restraining order. </p><p> During the hearing for the application for writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court correctly weighed the evidence presented by both parties before dismissing Naga City's application: </p><blockquote> <p> On 21 December 2012, the court<em> a quo</em> handed down the first assailed Order denying the application for injunctive relief. According to said court, Naga City failed to comply with the jurisprudential requirements for the issuance of said injunction, to wit: 1) the right of the complainant is clear and unmistakeable; 2) the invasion of the right is material and substantial; and 3) urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage. </p> <p> Anent the first requirement, the court <em>a quo</em> noted that even on the assumption that the 1970's Revised Assessor's Tax Mapping Control Roll and its Identification Map were both authentic documents, <em>the same would not overcome BMC's ownership of the property as evidenced by its title. BMC 's title covers all property within its bounds, which naturally included Road Lot No. 3. </em></p> <p> The court <em>a quo</em> thereafter proceeded to conclude that since Naga City failed to clearly establish its right over the said road, then logically, it would not also be able to show compliance with the second requisite, which necessitates a material and substantial invasion of such right. </p> <p> On the third requirement, the court <em>a quo</em> took into consideration the testimonies of two of the herein petitioners, Eliza M. Quilon (hereinafter Quilon) and Josefina F. Esplana (hereinafter Esplana), who both have businesses in the area and who said that their respective enterprises started suffering from losses after the closure of Road Lot No. 3. However, according to the court<em> a quo</em>, the losses of Quilon and Esplana hardly qualify as irreparable injury required by jurisprudence in granting the writ of preliminary injunction. This is so, as the court declared, because the alleged business losses that had been purportedly caused by the closure of Road Lot No. 3 were easily subject to mathematical computation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Writs of preliminary injunction are granted only upon prior notice to the party sought to be enjoined and upon their due hearing. Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. Preliminary injunction not granted without notice; exception. - No preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined. If it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice, the court to which the application for preliminary injunction was made, may issue <em>ex parte</em> a temporary restraining order to be effective only for a period of twenty (20) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined, except as herein provided. Within the said twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order. </p> <p> However, and subject to the provisions of the preceding sections, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge of a multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a single sala court may issue <em>ex parte</em> a temporary restraining order effective for only seventy-two (72) hours from issuance but he shall immediately comply with the provisions of the next preceding section as to service of summons and the documents to be served therewith. Thereafter, within the aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the Judge before whom the case is pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for preliminary injunction can be heard. In no case shall the total period of effectivity of the temporary restraining order exceed twenty (20) days, including the original seventy-two hours (72) hours provided herein. </p> <p> In the event that the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining order is deemed, automatically vacated. The effectivity of a temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of any judicial declaration to that effect and no court shall have authority to extend or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued. </p> <p> However, if issued by the Court of Appeals or a member thereof, the temporary restraining order shall be effective for sixty (60) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined. A restraining order issued by the Supreme Court or a member thereof shall be effective until further orders. </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, Rule 58 requires "a full and comprehensive hearing for the determination of the propriety of the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> giving the applicant an opportunity to prove that great or irreparable injury will result if no writ is issued and allowing the opposing party to comment on the application. </p><p> On the other hand, a temporary restraining order that is heard only with the evidence presented by its applicant is <em>ex parte</em>, but it is issued to preserve the status quo until the hearing for preliminary injunction can be conducted, <em>Miriam College Foundation, Inc v. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> explained the difference between preliminary injunction and a restraining order as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to perform to refrain from performing a particular act or acts. As an extraordinary remedy, injunction is calculated to preserve or maintain the status quo of things and is generally availed of to prevent actual or threatened acts, until the merits of the case can be heard. A preliminary injunction persists until it is dissolved or until the termination of the action without the court issuing a final injunction.</p> <p> The basic purpose of restraining order, on the other hand, is to preserve the status quo until the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction. Under the former Â§5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Â§5, Batas Pambansa Blg. 224, a judge (or justice) may issue a temporary restraining order with a limited life of twenty days from date of issue. If before the expiration of the 20-day period the application for preliminary injunction is denied, the temporary order would thereby be deemed automatically vacated. If no action is taken by the judge on the application for preliminary injunction within the said 20 days, the temporary restraining order would automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force of law, no judicial declaration to that effect being necessary. In the instant case, no such preliminary injunction was issued; hence, the TRO earlier issued automatically expired under the aforesaid provision of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> It is true that some issues are better threshed out before the trial court, such as if the donation to the Department of Health by the Camarines Sur Provincial Government contained an encumbrance for the public to continue using Road Lot No. 3, or the validity of this donation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The Court of Appeals, however, erred when it completely disregarded the evidence presented by petitioners, reasoning out that the question of whether or not Naga City's evidence should prevail over BMC's title over the property was supposedly a factual matter that should be threshed out in the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> </p><p> By focusing solely on Naga City and respondents' evidence to determine if there was<em> prima facie</em> evidence to issue the writ of preliminary injunction while the case was being heard in the lower court, the Court of Appeals misappreciated the nature of a writ of preliminary injunction. To reiterate, a preliminary injunction is an ancillary remedy issued after due hearing where both parties are given the opportunity to present their respective evidence. Thus, both their evidence should be considered. </p><p> As it is, absent a finding of grave abuse of discretion, there was no reason for the Court of Appeals to reverse the trial court's denial of respondents' application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Respondents were unable to present<em> prima facie</em> evidence of their clear and unmistakable right to use Road Lot No. 3. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, this Court resolves to <strong>GRANT</strong> the Petition.
