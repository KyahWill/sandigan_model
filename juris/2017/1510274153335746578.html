				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">No amount, especially not the P50.00 paid by the accused for sexually abusing his 11-year-old victim, will ever compensate for her trauma. The depravity of a grown man in taking advantage of a child's trust and innocence and her family's poverty to repeatedly rape her rightfully deserves condemnation and the most severe punishment that can be meted out under the law.<br><br>This Court is asked to review the February 22, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03929. This Decision affirmed the conviction of accused-appellant Ramon Francica (Francica) for three (3) counts of statutory rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, and imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>This Court restates the facts as found by the lower courts.<br><br>On February 3, 2005, in Criminal Case No. 05-1287-FC-H, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> was filed against Francica before Branch 209, Regional Trial Court, Mandaluyong City.

MCOS-1483-FC-H and MC05-1484-FC-H, two (2) additional Informations were also filed against Francica before Branch 209, Regional Trial Court, Mandaluyong City. The second Information read:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 19<sup>th</sup> day of January 2005, in the city of Mandaluyong, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of [this Honorable Court,] the above-named accused, motivated by carnal lust and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with [AAA], a girl eleven (11) years of age, a child within the meaning of R.A. 7610, by then and there inserting his private part into the latter's vagina, all against the latter's will, which acts [sic] debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of the victim (a child) as a human being.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The third Information read:<br><blockquote>That sometime in the month of March 2004, in the City of Mandaluyong, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction [of this Honorable Court,] the above-named accused, motivated by carnal lust and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with [AAA], a girl eleven (11) years of age, a child within the meaning of R.A. 7610, by then and there inserting his private part into the latter's vagina, all against the latter's will, which acts [sic] debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of the victim (a child) as a human being.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 26, 2005, the trial court ordered the consolidation of the three (3) charges of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Francica also pleaded not guilty to the two (2) other charges of rape against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented the child victim, AAA, who was then 11 years old and a Grade 6 student at a public school in Nueve de Pebrero in Mandaluyong City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>AAA testified that she lived with her parents and five (5) siblings in Mandaluyong City near Cardinal Sin. AAA claimed that she knew Francica because he was their neighbor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>AAA testified that Francica was a good person because he would sometimes give her money whenever he touched her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When asked how Francica touched her, AAA answered that he licked her breasts and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>She claimed that Francica started touching her sometime in March 2004 and that this went on many times. He would sometimes even give her P50.00 after touching her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The next prosecution witness was BBB, AAA's grandmother. BBB testified that AAA lived on the ground floor of her house in Nueve de Pebrero while she lived on the second floor. BBB claimed to know Francica because he had been her neighbor for many years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>BBB testified that she had two (2) bathrooms at the back of her house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the afternoon ofFebruary 2, 2005, she was using one (1) of them when she heard a voice say, "<i>May tao. Si Mamang yata yun</i>" from inside the other lavatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> When she went out, she saw someone run out of the other bathroom. She quickly looked inside the washroom and saw AAA. She ran after the other person and when he looked backed, she recognized him as Francica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>She was unable to catch Francica and when she returned to her house, she saw her other grandchild, CCC, talking with AAA. CCC was outside the bathrooms when the commotion happened and CCC told BBB that she saw AAA pulling up her underwear inside the lavatory after Francica ran out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>BBB claimed that she had heard rumors that Francica and AAA regularly had sexual intercourse and that she had confronted AAA about this before, but AAA never confirmed these rumors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After she saw AAA and Francica inside the bathroom, BBB told Josephine, AAA's aunt, about what happened. AAA and Josephine then went to the barangay hall to report the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>BBB testified that she was summoned to the barangay hall later that afternoon to confront Francica. She claimed that Francica admitted the accusation against him, for which he was mauled inside the barangay hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>After the barangay investigation, BBB and AAA went to the police station to execute their respective affidavits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>BBB testified that AAA's family was very poor and that AAA's mother could not look after her children because she had a gambling problem. BBB admitted that she would prefer that AAA be placed under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development because she was already overtaxed with looking after and providing for several other grandchildren and could no longer take care of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The third prosecution witness was Carlos C. Gojo (Gojo), a member of Task Force Anti-Vice. He testified that after BBB reported AAA's rape, Task Force Anti-Vice teamed up with Bantay Bayan of Addition Hills that same day to arrest Francica. The two (2) groups went to Francica's house where they found and arrested him. Gojo attested that Francica was informed of his constitutional rights to be silent and be represented by a lawyer during his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Gojo admitted that they had no warrant of arrest when they arrested Francica since they relied on the complaint lodged against Francica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Both parties agreed to stipulate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on the testimony of PO1 Jocelyn Samson, who investigated the case and endorsed the complaint against Francica to the Office of the City Prosecutor.<br><br>The trial court then ruled that the prosecution waived its right to present as its witness medico-legal PSI Pierre Paul Carpio, M.D. (PSI Carpio), who examined AAA, because of his repeated failure to attend the hearings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The last prosecution witness was Court Social Worker Leonor Laureles (Laureles), who conducted the Social Case Study Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on AAA upon the trial court's directive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Laureles testified that she interviewed AAA, who opened up about the abuse she underwent because of Francica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Laureles also averred that she had recommended that AAA be referred to an institution as she was neglected by her parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Francica was the only witness for the defense and he denied that he ever had sexual intercourse with AAA. He claimed that he was only set up by AAA's family after he found out from Nora, AAA's other aunt, that AAA had a relationship with her uncle. Francica stated that he told AAA's parents about her relationship with her uncle, but they ignored him. Francica further claimed that he was made a scapegoat after he revealed AAA's relationship with her uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Francica did not deny being inside the bathroom with AAA, but he claimed that it was a common facility and that he was urinating when AAA went inside to wait for her turn to use the toilet. It was at this point when AAA's cousin and BBB saw them inside the lavatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On March 3, 2009, the trial court rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> finding Francica guilty of three (3) counts of statutory rape and meting out the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled that all the elements of statutory rape were established with AAA's credible and candid testimony, corroborated by BBB's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The trial court also held that it was immaterial that the prosecution failed to present the testimony of medico-legal PSI Carpio, since "a medical examination is not indispensable to the prosecution of rape as long as the evidence on hand convinces the court that conviction for rape is proper."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused RAMON FRANCICA y NAVALTA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of Statutory Rape and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of three (3) <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to be served successively. The accused is further ordered to pay the victim, for each count of rape, the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>COSTS against the accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>Francica filed a Notice of Appea1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In his appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> he claimed that the prosecution's failure to present medico-legal PSI Carpio was fatal to the prosecution's case because there were matters that should be clarified by the examining physician.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On February 22, 2013, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> affirming Francica's conviction.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that AAA's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> and her testimony in court were consistent in showing that she repeatedly had sexual intercourse with Francica, sometimes in exchange for P50.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In upholding the trial court's assessment on the credibility of the witnesses, the Court of Appeals stated that "the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing firsthand the deportment of witnesses while testifying, and is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals emphasized that a conviction for rape based on the sole testimony of the victim is possible, as long as the victim's testimony is competent and credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court of Appeals asserted that a medical examination of a rape victim is not indispensable to the prosecution of a rape case, as it is merely corroborative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the Court of Appeals Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

Hence, this appeal was instituted.<br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated October 23, 2013, this Court notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired. However, both parties manifested<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> that they were dispensing with the filing of their supplemental briefs.<br><br>In his appellant's brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Francica denies the accusations of rape against him and insists that he was merely made a fall guy to cover up AAA's sexual relationship with her uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Francica also claims that the lower courts erred in declaring that the prosecution's failure to present the medico-legal officer was not fatal to the case since it affects the reliability of AAA's allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Francica points out that the alleged rape on February 2, 2005 happened at 1:30 p.m. and AAA was examined that same day at 5:53 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> However, the initial medico-legal report submitted by PSI Carpio showed shallow healed lacerations at 3:00 and 9:00 positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Francica maintains that if AAA was indeed raped that afternoon, the lacerations should either be fresh bleeding laceration or "fresh healing with fibrin formation and with edema of the surrounding tissue"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and not healed lacerations as stated in the medico-legal report.<br><br>Francica likewise asserts that not all lacerations in the vagina are caused by sexual acts because normal activities like jumping and running can also lead to lacerations or injury. He opines that the initial medico-legal report failed to describe the degree and location of the laceration, thereby creating doubt that the laceration was indeed caused by a sexual act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the prosecution emphasizes that given the nature of rape cases, conviction usually rests on the sole testimony of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The prosecution contends that AAA's credibility as a witness survived strict scrutiny since she was credible and straightforward during her testimony. She positively identified Francica and testified with specificity what transpired between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The prosecution underscores that jurisprudence is consistent that when a child victim says that she has been raped, her testimony should be given full weight and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Finally, the prosecution contends that the finding of a healed laceration instead of a fresh bleeding or fresh healing laceration is irrelevant, as this Court ruled in <i>People v. Espino</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> that full penile penetration of the vagina is not an element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The only issue to be resolved by this Court is whether the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant was guilty of statutory rape as defined under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> in relation to Republic Act No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>This Court affirms Francica's conviction.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>This Court notes that in the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated February 3, 2005, Francica was charged with rape under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, while he was charged with rape under Article 266-A(1) under the two (2) other Informations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Rape is defined in Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code as:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape; When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed:<br><ol><li>By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br><br></li><li>When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br><br></li><li>By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br></li><li>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.<br></li></ol></blockquote>For a charge of rape under Article 266-A(1) to prosper, it must be proven that "(1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman, and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation, or when she was deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when she was under 12 years of age or was demented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, rape under Article 266 A(2) is described in <i>Ricalde v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> as "'instrument or object rape,' 'gender-free rape,' or 'homosexual rape.' The gravamen of rape through sexual assault is 'the insertion of the penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into another person's genital or anal orifice.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Francica was charged with rape under Article 266-A(2) in the Information dated February 3, 2005, yet even a cursory reading of this Information shows that the allegations and the acts or omissions complained of pertain to rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) or carnal knowledge of a girl below 12 years of age:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of February 2005, in the city of Mandaluyong, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction. of [this Honorable Court,] the above-named accused, being the neighbor of the victim, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have <i>carnal knowledge with [AAA], a girl eleven (11) years of age, by then and there inserting his private part into [the] latter s vagina</i>, all against the latter's will, which acts [sic] debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of the victim (a child) as a human being.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is well-established that the nature of a criminal charge is determined "by the recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances in the complaint or information"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and not by the caption of the information or the provision of the law claimed to have been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Thus, the lower courts did not err in treating and trying all charges against Francica as rape through carnal knowledge under Article 266-A(1)(d).<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) is also called statutory rape as "it departs from the usual modes of committing rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The child victim's consent in statutory rape is immaterial because the law presumes that her young age makes her incapable of discerning good from evil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> <i>People v. Gutierez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> explained the elements of statutory rape:<br><blockquote>Statutory rape is committed when (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age and (2) the accused has carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation; whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness; or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. It is enough that the age of the victim is proven and that there was sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>The defense did not dispute the fact that AAA was 11 years old at the time of the incidents.

Thus, it is sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals likewise found that "AAA made sensible, straightforward and categorical answers to the substantial, relevant and material questions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The rule is settled that the trial court's factual findings and evaluation of witnesses' credibility and testimony should be entitled to great respect unless it is shown that the trial court may have "overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Francica's argument that the presence of healed hymenal lacerations belies AAA's accusation that he sexually abused her on February 2, 2005 must fail in light of the fact that hymenal laceration is not an element of rape. <i>People v. Araojo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> expounds on the evidentiary weight of a hymenal laceration in a charge of rape:<br><blockquote>The absence of external signs or physical injuries on the complainant's body does not necessarily negate the commission of rape, hymenal laceration not being, to repeat, an element of the crime of rape. A healed or fresh laceration would of course be a compelling proof of defloration. What is more, the foremost consideration in the prosecution of rape is the victim's testimony and not the findings of the medico-legal officer. In fact, a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape; the victim's testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Despite the absence of the medico-legal officer as a witness, the presence of healed lacerations corroborates AAA's testimony as it "is the best physical evidence of forcible defloration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>It is well-established that "[p]hysical evidence is evidence of the highest order.

This corresponds with Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, which also provides for the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> if the rape victim is below 12 years old:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. -<br><br>....<br><br>(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; Provided, <i>That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape</i> or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The lower courts correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of statutory rape.
