				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, v. SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These consolidated cases consider whether "San Mig Light" is a <em>new brand</em> or a<em> variant</em> of one of San Miguel Corporation's existing beer brands, and whether the Bureau of Internal Revenue may issue notices of discrepancy that effectively changes "San Mig Light" 's classification from<em> new brand</em> to <em>variant</em>. The issues involve an application of Section 143 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code), as amended, on the definition of a <em>variant</em>, which is subject to a higher excise tax rate than a <em>new brand</em>. This case also applies the requirement in Rep. Act No. 9334 that reclassification of certain fermented liquor products introduced between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2003 can only be done by an act of Congress. <p> The Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> docketed as G.R.

"San Mig Light" would also be classified under "Medium Priced Brand" to be taxed at P9.15 per liter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> On January 28, 2002, Alfredo R. Villacorte (Villacorte), San Miguel Corporation's Vice President and Manager of the Group Tax Services, wrote the Bureau of Internal Revenue Chief of the Large Taxpayers Assistance Division II (LTAD II) to request information on the tax rate and classification of "San Mig Light" and another beer product named "Gold Eagle King."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On February 7, 2002, LTAD II Acting Chief Conrado P.

Abella (Assistant Commissioner Abella), Bureau of Internal Revenue Large Taxpayers Service Assistant Commissioner, issued a Notice of Discrepancy against San Miguel Corporation. The Notice stated that "San Mig Light" was a <em>variant</em> of its existing beer products and must, therefore, be subjected to the higher excise tax rate for <em>variants</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Specifically, for the year 1999, "San Mig Light" should be taxed at the rate of P19.91 per liter instead of P9.15 per liter; and for the year 2000, the 12% increase should be based on the rate of P19.91 per liter under Section 143(C)(2) of the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Hence, the Notice demanded payments of deficiency excise tax in the amount of P824,750,204.97, exclusive of increments for years 1999 to April 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> The Finance Manager of San Miguel Corporation's Beer Division wrote a letter-reply dated July 9, 2002 requesting the withdrawal of the Notice of Discrepancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> San Miguel Corporation stated, among other things, that "San Mig Light" was not a <em>variant</em> of any of its existing beer brands because of "the distinctive shape, color scheme[,] and general appearance"; and the "different alcohol content and innovative low calorie formulation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It also emphasized that the Escudo logo was not a beer brand logo but a corporate logo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> On October 14, 2002, Assistant Commissioner Abella wrote a letter-rejoinder reiterating its finding that "San Mig Light Pale Pilsen" was truly a<em> variant </em>of "San Miguel Pale Pilsen."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The letter-rejoinder cited certain statements in San Miguel Corporation's publication, "Kaunlaran," and the corporation's Annual Report as support for its finding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> On November 20, 2002, Villacorte replied by requesting that "San Mig Light be reconfirmed as a new brand . . . the deficiency assessment be set aside and the demand for payment be withdrawn."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p> Subsequently, three (3) conferences were held on the "San Mig Light" tax classification issue. At the conference held on December 16, 2003, Commissioner Guillermo Parayno, Jr. (Commissioner Parayno) informed San Miguel Corporation that five (5) members of the Bureau of Internal Revenue Management Committee voted that "San Mig Light" was a <em>variant</em> of "Pale Pilsen in can," while two (2) members voted that it was a <em>variant</em> of "Premium," a high-priced beer product of San Miguel Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> On January 6, 2004, Commissioner Parayno wrote San Miguel Corporation and validated the findings that "San Mig Light" was a <em>variant</em> of "San Miguel Pale Pilsen in can," subject to the same excise tax rate of the latter—that is, P13.61 per liter—and that an assessment for deficiency excise tax against San Miguel Corporation was forthcoming.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> On January 28, 2004, a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) was issued against San Miguel Corporation for deficiency excise tax in the amount of P852,039,418.15, inclusive of increments, purportedly for the removals of "San Mig Pale Pilsen Light," from 1999 to January 7, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> On February 4, 2004, a Notice of Discrepancy was issued against San Miguel Corporation on an alleged deficiency excise tax in the amount of P28,876,108.84, from January 8, 2004 to January 29, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> Accordingly, on March 24, 2004, Bureau of Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner Estelita C.

No. 03-1-09-SC, otherwise known as the Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-Trial and Use of Deposition - Discovery Measures. Among other things, these rules direct trial courts to require parties to submit, at least three (3) days before pre-trial, pre-trial briefs containing "[a] manifestation of the parties of their having availed or their intention to avail themselves of discovery procedures or referral to commissioners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> <i> Republic v.

Indeed, <em><strong>it is the purpose and policy of the law that the parties — before the trial if not indeed even before the pre-trial — should discover or inform themselves of all the facts relevant to the action</strong></em>, not only those known to them individually, but also those known to their adversaries; in other words, the desideratum is that civil trials should not be carried on in the dark; and the Rules of Court make this ideal possible through the deposition-discovery mechanism set forth in Rules 24 to 29. The experience in other jurisdictions has been that ample discovery before trial, under proper regulation, accomplished one of the most necessary ends of modern procedure:<em><strong> it not only eliminates unessential issues from trials thereby shortening them considerably, but also requires parties to play the game with the cards on the table so that the possibility of fair settlement before trial is measurably increased...</strong></em> </p> <p> As just intimated, the deposition-discovery procedure was designed to remedy the conceded inadequacy and cumbersomeness of the pre-trial functions of notice-giving, issue-formulation and fact revelation theretofore performed primarily by the pleadings. </p> <p> The various modes or instruments of discovery are meant to serve (1) as a device, along with the pre-trial hearing under Rule 20, to narrow and clarify the basic issues between the parties, and (2) as a device for ascertaining the facts relative to those issues. The evident purpose is, to repeat, to enable the parties, consistent with recognized privileges,<em><strong> to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before civil trials and thus prevent that said trials are carried on in the dark.</strong></em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Specifically, this Court discussed the importance of a motion for production of documents under Rule 27 of the Rules of Court in expediting time-consuming trials: </p><blockquote> <p> This remedial measure is intended to assist in the administration of justice by<em><strong> facilitating and expediting the preparation of cases for trial and guarding against undesirable surprise and delay</strong></em>; and it is designed to simplify procedure and obtain admissions of facts and evidence, thereby<em><strong> shortening costly and time-consuming trials</strong></em>. It is based on ancient principles of equity. More specifically, the purpose of the statute is to enable a party-litigant to discover material information which, by reason of an opponent's control, would otherwise be unavailable for judicial scrutiny, and to provide a convenient and summary method of obtaining material and competent documentary evidence in the custody or under the control of an adversary. It is a further extension of the concept of pretrial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Consistent with litigation's quest for truth, parties should welcome every opportunity in attaining this objective, such as acting in good faith to reveal material documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p><p> The scope of discovery must be liberally construed, as a general rule, to serve its purpose of providing the parties with essential information to reach an amicable settlement or to expedite trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> "Courts, as arbiters and guardians of truth and justice, must not countenance any technical ploy to the detriment of an expeditious settlement of the case or to a fair, full and complete determination on its merits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p><p> Rule 27, Section 1 of the Rules of Court does not provide when the motion may be used.

Instead, what were listed, as existing brands of petitioner, as of the effectivity of RA No. 8240, were as follows: "Pale Pilsen 320 ml.", "Super Dry 355 ml." and "Premium Can 330 ml." Even in Section 4 of RR No. 2-97, which provides for the classification and manner of taxation of existing brands, new brands and variants of existing brands, the list of existing brands of fermented liquors of petitioner does not include the brand "San Mig Light", but merely "RPT in cans 330 ml", "Premium Bottles 355 ml.", "Premium Bottles 355 ml." and "Premium Bottle Can 330 ml." for high priced brands; and "Super Dry 355 ml.", "Pale Pilsen 320 ml.", and "Grande" for medium-priced brands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></p> <p> Thus, it is clear that when the product "San Mig Light" was introduced in 1999, it was considered as an entirely new product and a new brand of petitioner's fermented liquor, <em><strong>there being no root name of "San Miguel" or "San Mig” in its existing brand names. The existing registered and classified brand name of petitioner at that time was "Pale Pilsen." Therefore, the word "Light" cannot be considered as a mere suffix to the word "San Miguel," but it is part and parcel of an entirely new brand name, "San Mig Light."</strong></em> Evidently, as correctly pointed out by petitioner, "San Mig Light" is not merely a variant of an existing brand, but an entirely <em>new brand</em>:</p> <p> Anent the second type of "variant of brand," i.e., when a different brand carries the same logo or design of an existing brand,<em><strong> records show that there are marked differences in the designs of the existing brand "Pale Pilsen " and the new brand "San Mig Light"</strong></em>:</p> <p> a) as to "Pale Pilsen" and "San Mig Light" in bottles:</p> <p> 1. the size, shape and color of the respective bottles are different. Each brand has a distinct design in its packaging. "Pale Pilsen" is in a steiny bottle, while "San Mig Light" is packed in a tall and slim transparent bottle; </p> <p> 2. the design and color of the inscription on the bottles are different from each other. "Pale Pilsen" has its label encrypted or embossed on the bottle itself, while "San Mig Light" has a silver and blue label of distinctive design that is printed on paper pasted on the bottle; and</p> <p> 3. the color of the letters in the "Pale Pilsen" brand is white against the color of the bottle, while that of the words "San Mig" is white against a blue background and the word "Light" is blue against a silver background. </p> <p> b) As to "Pale Pilsen" and "San Mig Light" in cans: </p> <p> 1. the words "Pale Pilsen" are in ordinary font printed horizontally in black on the can against a diagonally striped light yellow gold background, while the words "San Mig" are in Gothic font printed diagonally on the can against a blue background and the word "Light" in ordinary font printed diagonally against a diagonally striped silver background; and</p> <p> 2. the general color scheme of "Pale Pilsen" is light yellow gold, while that of "San Mig Light" is silver. </p> <p> Though the "escudo" logo appears on both "Pale Pilsen" bottle and "San Mig Light" bottle and can, the same cannot be considered as an indication that "San Mig Light" is merely a variant of the brand "Pale Pilsen", since the said "escudo" insignia is the corporate logo of petitioner. It merely identifies the products, as having been manufactured by petitioner, but does not form part of its brand. In fact, it appears not only in petitioner's beer products, but even in its non-beer products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><strong>VI</strong> </p><p> A <em>variant</em> under the Tax Code has a technical meaning. It is determined by the brand (name) or logo of the beer product. </p><p> To be sure, all beers are composed of four (4) raw materials: barley, hops, yeast, and water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Barley grain has always been used and associated with brewing beer, while hops act as the bittering substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Yeast plays a role in alcoholic fermentation, with bottom-fermenting yeasts resulting in light lager and top-fermenting ones producing the heavy and rich ale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> With only four (4) ingredients combined and processed in varying quantities, all beer are essentially related variants of these mixtures.</p><p> A manufacturer of beer may produce different versions of its products, distinguished by features such as flavor, quality, or calorie content, to suit the tastes and needs of specific segments of the domestic market. It can also leverage on the popularity of its existing brand and sell a lower priced version to make it affordable for the low-income consumers. These strategies are employed to gain a higher overall level of share or profit from the market.</p><p> In intellectual property law, a registered trademark owner has the right to prevent others from the use of the same mark (brand) for identical goods or services. The use of an identical or colorable imitation of a registered trademark by a person for the same goods or services or closely related goods or services of another party constitutes infringement. It is a form of unfair competition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> because there is an attempt to get a free ride on the reputation and selling power of another manufacturer by passing of one's goods as identical or produced by the same manufacturer as those carrying the other mark (brand).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup></p><p> The <em>variant </em>contemplated under the tax Code has a technical meaning. A<em> variant</em> is determined by the brand (name) of the beer product, whether it was formed by prefixing or suffixing a modifier to the root name of the alleged parent brand, or whether it carries the same logo or design. The purpose behind the definition was to properly tax brands that were presumed to be riding on the popularity of previously registered brands by being marketed under an almost identical name with a prefix, suffix, or a variant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> It seeks to address price differentials employed by a manufacturer on similar products differentiated only in brand or design. Specifically, the provision was meant to obviate any tax avoidance by manufacturing firms from the sale of lower priced variants of its existing beer brands, thus, falling in the lower tax bracket with lower excise tax rates. To favor government, a <i>variant </i>of a brand is taxed according to the highest rate of tax for that particular brand.</p><p> "San Mig Light" and "Pale Pilsen" do not share a root word. Neither is there an existing brand in the list (Annexes C-1 and C-2 of the Tax Code) called "San Mig" to conclude that "Light" is a suffix rendering "San Mig Light" as its "variant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> As discussed in the Court of Tax Appeals Decision, "San Mig Light" should be considered as one brand name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup></p><p> Respondent's statements describing San Mig Light as a low-calorie variant is not conclusive of its classification as a<em> variant </em>for excise tax purposes. Burdens are not to be imposed nor presumed to be imposed beyond the plain and express terms of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> "The general rule of requiring adherence to the letter in construing statutes applies with peculiar strictness to tax laws and the provisions of a taxing act are not to be extended by implication."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup></p><p> Furthermore, respondent's payment of the higher taxes starting January 30, 2004 after deficiency assessments were made cannot be considered as an admission that its San Mig Light is a variant. Section 130(A)(2) of the Tax Code requires payment of excise tax "before removal of domestic products from place of production."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> These payments were made in protest as respondent subsequently filed refund claims.</p><p align="center"><strong> VII</strong> </p><p> Petitioner argues that although the Bureau of Internal Revenue erroneously allowed San Miguel Corporation to manufacture and sell "San Mig Light" in 1999 as a "new brand" with the lower excise tax rate for "new brands," government is not estopped from correcting previous errors by its agents. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup></p><p> Petitioner submits that the Notice of Discrepancy was to remedy the "misrepresentation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> of "San Mig Light" as new brand. It submits that respondent's self-assessment of excise taxes as a new brand was without approval: </p><blockquote> <p> San Mig Light was never registered with BIR as a new brand but always as a variant. Thus, petitioner's payment of excise taxes on San Mig Light as a new brand is based on its own classification of San Mig Light as a new brand without approval of the BIR. Under existing procedures in the payment of excise taxes, taxpayers are required to pay their taxes based on self-assessment system with the government relying heavily on the honesty of taxpayers. Such being the case, any payments made, even those allegedly made as a condition for the withdrawal of the product from the place of production, cannot be considered as a confirmation by the BIR of the correctness of such payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Section 143 of the Tax Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 9334, provides for the Bureau of Internal Revenue's role in validating and revalidating the suggested net retail price of a new brand of fermented liquor for purposes of determining its tax bracket: </p><blockquote> <p> 'Suggested net retail price' shall mean the net retail price at which new brands, as defined above, of locally manufactured or imported fermented liquor are intended by the manufacturer or importer to be sold on retail in major supermarkets or retail outlets in Metro Manila for those marketed nationwide, and in other regions, for those with regional markets. <strong><em>At the end of three (3) months from the product launch, the Bureau of Internal Revenue shall validate the suggested net retail price of the new brand against the net retail price as defined herein and determine the correct tax bracket to which a particular new brand of fermented liquor, as defined above, shall be classified. After the end of eighteen (18) months from such validation, the Bureau of Internal Revenue shall revalidate the initially validated net retail price against the net retail price as of the time of revalidation in order to finally determine the correct tax bracket which a particular new brand of fermented liquors shall be classified: </em></strong><em>Provided, however,</em> That brands of fermented liquors introduced in the domestic market between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2003 shall remain in the classification under which the Bureau of Internal Revenue has determined them to belong as of December 31, 2003. Such classification of new brands and brands introduced between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2003 shall not be revised except by an act of Congress.</p> </blockquote> <p> When respondent launched "San Mig Light" in 1999, it wrote the Bureau of Internal Revenue on October 19, 1999 requesting registration and authority to manufacture "San Mig Light" to be taxed as P12.15.</p><p> The Bureau of Internal Revenue granted this request in its October 27, 1999 letter. Contrary to petitioner's contention, the registration granted was not merely for intellectual property protection<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> but "for internal revenue purposes only": </p><blockquote> <p> Your request dated October 19, 1999, for the registration of San Miguel Corporation commercial label for beer bearing the trade mark "San Mig Light" Pale Pilsen, for domestic sale or export, 24 bottles in a case, each flint bottle with contents of 330 ml., is hereby granted.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Please follow strictly the requirements of internal revenue laws, rules and regulations relative to the marks to be placed on each case, cartons or box used as secondary containers. <em><strong>It is understood that the said brand be brewed and bottled in the breweries at Polo, Valenzuela (A-2-21).</strong></em></p> <p> <em><strong>You are hereby informed that the registration of commercial labels in this Office is for internal revenue purposes only</strong></em> and does not give you protection against any person or entity whose rights may be prejudiced by infringement or unfair competition resulting from your use of the above indicated trademark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Because the Bureau of Internal Revenue granted respondent's request in its October 27, 1999 letter and confirmed this grant in its subsequent letters, respondent cannot be faulted for relying on these actions by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</p><p> While estoppel generally does not apply against government, especially when the case involves the collection of taxes, an exception can be made when the application of the rule will cause injustice against an innocent party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup></p><p> Respondent had already acquired a vested right on the tax classification of its San Mig Light as a <em>new brand</em>. To allow petitioner to change its position will result in deficiency assessments in substantial amounts against respondent to the latter's prejudice. </p><p> The authority of the Bureau of Internal Revenue to overrule, correct, or reverse the mistakes or errors of its agents is conceded. However, this authority must be exercised reasonably,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> i.e., only when the action or ruling is patently erroneous<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> or patently contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> For the presumption lies in the regularity of performance of official duty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> and reasonable care has been exercised by the revenue officer or agent in evaluating the facts before him or her prior to rendering his or her decision or ruling—in this case, prior to the approval of the registration of San Mig Light as a<em> new brand </em>for excise tax purposes. A contrary view will create disorder and confusion in the operations of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and open the administrative agency to inconsistencies in the administration and enforcement of tax laws. </p><p> In <em>Commissioner v. Algue</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> It is said that taxes are what we pay for civilized society. Without taxes, the government would be paralyzed for lack of the motive power to activate and operate it. Hence, despite the natural reluctance to surrender part of one's hard-earned income to the taxing authorities, every person who is able to must contribute his share in the running of the government. The government for its part, is expected to respond in the form of tangible and intangible benefits intended to improve the lives of the people and enhance their moral and material values. This symbiotic relationship is the rationale of taxation and should dispel the erroneous notion that it is an arbitrary method of exaction by those in the seat of power.</p> <p> But even as we concede the inevitability and indispensability of taxation, it is a requirement in all democratic regimes that it be exercised reasonably and in accordance with the prescribed procedure. If it is not, then the taxpayer has a right to complain and the courts will then come to his succor. For all the awesome power of the tax collector, he may still be stopped in his tracks if the taxpayer can demonstrate, as it has here, that the law has not been observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></p> <p align="center"><strong>VIII</strong></p> </blockquote> <p> The Tax Code includes remedies for erroneous collection and overpayment of taxes.

[I] still need to raise certain questions even only for clarification of those who will later be tasked with the implementation of this law.<br> ... I am talking about variants of existing brands.<br> I would like to lay the basis for my question. I find it confusing that the taxation of variants is defined in this manner. The definition of a variant "is made to depend on the prefix or the suffix. It is based on the name although referring to the same product. The bill provides that the tax shall be based on the highest value. Tax wise, it would be unfair for manufacturer who would wish to introduce cheaper and more affordable versions of their products. It defeats the purpose of coming out with lower-priced products.<br> For example, let us assume that a beer product is well-known in the market. In order to make it available to more consumers, the manufacturer, let us assume, comes out with the cheaper version of the original <em><strong>and attaches the name of the original to this new product in order to assure consumers that the new one is backed by the same quality guarantee as the original one.</strong></em> It seems to be absurd for the new product to be taxed as much as the original product in this light. <br> My question then is: Should the variant not be that, which is nearest in value and not which is highest in value? </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Senator Enrile:<br> Mr. President, to answer the question briefly, I would like to state here that from a purely business viewpoint, probably I will concede that there is some merit to the argument just stated by the distinguished Senator from Iloilo. But on the other hand, from a purely fiscal taxation position, to discard the provision that we have suggested would open a very wide door for tax avoidance, if not tax evasion because a beer is beer. It is just a question of brands. <br> What is the composition of beer? Water and some fermenting elements - malt and some other fermenting elements. <em><strong>But if we not put this, those brands that are already well-known in the market could be marketed under almost an identical name with a prefix, suffix or a variant and put in a lower category in order to enjoy a lower tax level, in which case, the government will be losing.</strong></em> That is the purpose of this measure.
