Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> was the first case that attempted to lay down the standards for determining psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. <i>Santos</i> declared that "psychological incapacity must be characterized by (a) gravity, (b) juridical antecedence, and (c) incurability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Furthermore, the incapacity "should refer to no less than a mental (not physical) incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Two (2) years later, <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> provided the guidelines to be followed when interpreting and applying Article 36 of the Family Code:<br><blockquote>(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. This is rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and unity of the family. Thus, our Constitution devotes an entire Article on the Family, recognizing it "as the foundation of the nation." It decrees marriage as legally "inviolable," thereby protecting it from dissolution at the whim of the parties. Both the family and marriage are to be "protected" by the state.<br><br>The Family Code echoes this constitutional edict on marriage and the family and emphasizes their <i>permanence, inviolability and solidarity</i>.<br><br>(2) The <i>root cause</i> of the psychological incapacity must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological — not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.<br><br>(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at "the time of the celebration" of the marriage. The evidence must show that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their "I do's." The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at such moment, or prior thereto.<br><br>(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or <i>incurable</i>. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex. Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a job. Hence, a pediatrician may be effective in diagnosing illnesses of children and prescribing medicine to cure them but may not be psychologically capacitated to procreate, bear and raise his/her own children as an essential obligation of marriage.<br><br>(5) Such illness must be <i>grave</i> enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, "mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts" cannot be accepted as <i>root</i> causes. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.<br><br>(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.<br><br>(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts. It is clear that Article 36 was taken by the Family Code Revision Committee from Canon 1095 of the New Code of Canon Law, which became effective in 1983 and which provides:<br><blockquote>"The following are incapable of contracting marriage: Those who are unable to assume the essential obligations of marriage due to causes of psychological nature."<br></blockquote>Since the purpose of including such provision in our Family Code is to harmonize our civil laws with the religious faith of our people, it stands to reason that to achieve such harmonization, great persuasive weight should be given to decisions of such appellate tribunal. Ideally - subject to our law on evidence - what is decreed as canonically invalid should also be decreed civilly void.<br><br>This is one instance where, in view of the evident source and purpose of the Family Code provision, contemporaneous religious interpretation is to be given persuasive effect. Here, the State and the Church - while remaining independent, separate and apart from each other - shall walk together in synodal cadence towards the same goal of protecting and cherishing marriage and the family as the inviolable base of the nation.<br><br>(8) The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state. No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition. The Solicitor General, along with the prosecuting attorney, shall submit to the court such certification within fifteen (15) days from the date the case is deemed submitted for resolution of the court. The Solicitor General shall discharge the equivalent function of the <i>defensor vinculi</i> contemplated under Canon 1095.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, we find that there was sufficient compliance with <i>Molina</i> to warrant the nullity of petitioner's marriage with respondent. Petitioner was able to discharge the burden of proof that respondent suffered from psychological incapacity.<br><br>The Court of Appeals chided the lower court for giving undue weight to the testimony of Dr. Lopez since he had no chance to personally conduct a thorough study and analysis of respondent's mental and psychological condition. The Court of Appeals cited <i>Republic v. Dagdag</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> where this Court held that "the root cause of psychological incapacity must be medically or clinically identified and sufficiently proven by experts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The Court of Appeals then ruled that "[o]bviously, this requirement is not deemed complied with where no psychiatrist or medical doctor testifies on the alleged psychological incapacity of one party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals is mistaken.<br><br><i>Camacho-Reyes v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> states that the non-examination of one of the parties will not automatically render as hearsay or invalidate the findings of the examining psychiatrist or psychologist, since "marriage, by its very definition, necessarily involves only two persons. The totality of the behavior of one spouse during the cohabitation and marriage is generally and genuinely witnessed mainly by the other."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><i>Marcos v. Marcos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> emphasizes that Molina does not require a physician to examine a person and declare him/her to be psychologically incapacitated. What matters is that the totality of evidence presented establishes the party's psychological condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Dr. Lopez's testimony, as corroborated by petitioner, sufficiently proved that respondent suffered from psychological incapacity. Respondent's paranoid personality disorder made him distrustful and prone to extreme jealousy and acts of depravity, incapacitating him to fully comprehend and assume the essential obligations of marriage. As the trial court found:<br><blockquote>Dr. Lopez testified that he arrived at his conclusion of respondent'[s] personality by taking into consideration the psychological impression and conclusion he gathered from the analysis of the different behaviors he manifested during the time that he and petitioner were living together. According to him, under the Diagnostic Statistical Manual, he found the respondent to be suffering from a paranoid personality disorder manifested by the respondent's damaging behavior like reckless driving and extreme jealousy; his being distrustful and suspicious; his severe doubts and distrust of friends and relatives of the petitioner; his being irresponsible and lack of remorse; his resistance to treatment; and his emotional coldness and severe immaturity. He also testified that this kind of disorder is actually one of the severe forms of personality disorder even more severe than the other personality disorders like the borderline and narcissistic personality disorders.<br><br>As to the <i>root cause</i>, [h]e explained that this must have been caused by a pathogenic parental model. As he investigated the family background of the respondent, Dr. Lopez discovered that his father was a psychiatric patient such that the respondent developed a similar symptom or psychic contamination which is called double insanity. This, according to Dr. Lopez is usually developed among close family members, bestfriends (sic), sweethearts and even couples who are close to one another; that people close to one another get psychically contaminated; that surprisingly, the symptom that the father manifested is the same as those of the respondent. The said disorder started during respondent's late childhood years and developed in his early adolescent years.<br><br>He further testified that this disorder is very severe, serious and incurable because of the severe paranoia of the patient; that patients with this kind of personality disorder could never accept that there is something wrong with them and if ever forced to seek treatment, they would rather engage in an intellectual battle with the therapist rather than cooperate with them.<br><br>Dr. Lopez concluded that because of respondent's personality disorder, he is incapacitated to perform his marital obligations of giving love, respect, and support to the petitioner. He recommends that the marriage be annulled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>By the very nature of Article 36, courts, despite having the ultimate task of decision-making, must give due regard to expert opinion on the psychological and mental disposition of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The root cause of respondent's paranoid personality disorder was hereditary in nature as his own father suffered from a similar disorder. Dr. Lopez stated that respondent's own psychological disorder probably started during his late childhood years and developed in his early adolescent years. Dr. Lopez explained that respondent's psychological incapacity to perform his marital obligations was likely caused by growing up with a pathogenic parental model.<br><br>The juridical antecedence of respondent's psychological incapacity was also sufficiently proven during trial. Petitioner attested that she noticed respondent's jealousy even before their marriage, and that he would often follow her to make sure that she did not talk to anyone or cheat on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> She believed that he would change after they got married;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> however, this did not happen. Respondent's jealousy and paranoia were so extreme and severe that these caused him to poke a gun at petitioner's head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>The incurability and severity of respondent's psychological incapacity were likewise discussed by Dr. Lopez. He vouched that a person with paranoid personality disorder would refuse to admit that there was something wrong and that there was a need for treatment. This was corroborated by petitioner when she stated that respondent repeatedly refused treatment. Petitioner consulted a lawyer, a priest, and a doctor, and suggested couples counselling to respondent; however, respondent refused all of her attempts at seeking professional help. Respondent also refused to be examined by Dr. Lopez.<br><br>Article 68 of the Family Code obligates the husband and wife "to live together, observe mutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support." In this case, petitioner and respondent may have lived together, but the facts narrated by petitioner show that respondent failed to, or could not, comply with the obligations expected of him as a husband. He was even apathetic that petitioner filed a petition for declaration of nullity of their marriage.<br><br>This Court also noticed respondent's repeated acts of harassment towards petitioner, which show his need to intimidate and dominate her, a classic case of coercive control. At first, respondent only inflicted non-physical forms of mistreatment on petitioner by alienating her from her family and friends due to his jealousy, and stalking her due to his paranoia. However, his jealousy soon escalated into physical violence when, on separate instances, he poked a gun at his teenage cousin, and at petitioner.<br><br>Coercive control is a form of psychological abuse, which refers to a pattern of behavior meant to dominate a partner through different tactics such as physical and sexual violence, threats, emotional insults, and economic deprivation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Although not specifically named, coercive control as a form of psychological abuse or harm has been recognized in Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act of 2004:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. - As used in this Act,<br><br>(a) "Violence against women and their children" refers to any act or a series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife, former wife, or against a woman with whom the person has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or with whom he has a common child, or against her child whether legitimate or illegitimate, within or without the family abode, which result in or is likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological harm or suffering, or economic abuse including threats of such acts, battery, assault, coercion, harassment or arbitrary deprivation of liberty. It includes, but is not limited to, the following acts:<br><br>....<br><blockquote>C. "Psychological violence" refers to acts or omissions causing or likely to cause mental or emotional suffering of the victim such as but not limited to intimidation, harassment, stalking, damage to property, public ridicule or humiliation, repeated verbal abuse and mental infidelity. It includes causing or allowing the victim to witness the physical, sexual or psychological abuse of a member of the family to which the victim belongs, or to witness pornography in any form or to witness abusive injury to pets or to unlawful or unwanted deprivation of the right to custody and/or visitation of common children.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Respondent's repeated behavior of psychological abuse by intimidating, stalking, and isolating his wife from her family and friends, as well as his increasing acts of physical violence, are proof of his depravity, and utter lack of comprehension of what marriage and partnership entail. It would be of utmost cruelty for this Court to decree that petitioner should remain married to respondent. After she had exerted efforts to save their marriage and their family, respondent simply refused to believe that there was anything wrong in their marriage. This shows that respondent truly could not comprehend and perform his marital obligations. This fact is persuasive enough for this Court to believe that respondent's mental illness is incurable.<br><br>In granting the petition and declaring void the marriage of Maria Teresa and Rodolfo, this Court reiterates the pronouncement we made in an opinion in <i>Mallilin v. Jamesolamin</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><blockquote>Our choices of intimate partners define us - inherent ironically in our individuality. Consequently, when the law speaks of the nature, consequences, and incidents of marriage governed by law, this refers to responsibility to children, property relations, disqualifications, privileges, and other matters limited to ensuring the stability of society. The state's interest should not amount to unwarranted intrusions into individual liberties.<br><br>Since the State's interest must be toward the stability of society, the notion of psychological incapacity should not only be based on a medical or psychological disorder, but should consist of the inability to comply with essential marital obligations such that public interest is imperiled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br></blockquote>Lastly, this Court takes note of <i>Ngo Te v. Gutierrez Yu Te</i>'s observation that a straitjacket application of the Molina guidelines "has taken its toll on people who have to live with deviant behavior, moral insanity and sociopathic personality anomaly, which, like termites, consume little by little the very foundation of their families, our basic social institutions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Ironically, the ultimate effect of such stringent application of the Molina guidelines is the perversion of the family unit, the very institution that our laws are meant to protect.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
