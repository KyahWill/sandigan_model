No. 6657, it provides that in determining the just compensation, the initial determination thereof may be agreed upon by the [LBP], the official entity made responsible under Executive Order No. 405, series of 1990 to determine the valuation and compensation of agricultural landholdings made under the coverage of the CARP and the [l]andowner. In the event of disagreement, the matter is referred to the DAR Adjudication Board for further determination. If no agreement is reached, the landowner may elevate the matter for judicial determination.<br><br>Initially, the [DAR] Adjudicat[ion] Board x x x valued the property in question adopting the [LBP's] valuation in the amount of P6,112,598.86 for the 72.2268 [has] and the amount of P2,949,313.14 for the 36.3196 [ha] but these valuation was rejected by [the Mateos].<br><br>After due consideration of [Engr. Dino's] Report submitted to the Court[,] as well as the [Report of Empleo] and the Pass Book evidencing the Lease Rentals presented by the defendant DAR, as well as the testimon[ies] of [the Mateos] and their witnesses and also considering the applicable law, the Sanggunian Panlalawigan Resolution No. [0]3-99 providing for an updated schedule of fair market value of real properties in the Province of Sorsogon and the jurisprudence on the matter, the Court hereby adopts the commissioner's report submitted by Engr. [Dino] as part of this decision. The Court also took into consideration the evidence submitted on comparable sales transaction of the nearby landholdings executed by Jose Maria Simo, Jr. in favor of the National Housing Authority selling the property at Two Million[,] Three Hundred Thirty-three Thousand[,] One Hundred Seventy Pesos (P2,335,170.00) Philippine currency, for the 159,968 square meters land x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The report of [Engr. Dino] x x x represents only the fair market value of the land but does not include the value of the coconut trees and the actual production of the coconut trees. Although it valued the improvements in the property for acquisition, it did not include the value of the trees/hectare and the actual production of the coconut trees as well as the potentials of the land in term[s] of productivity and proximity to the center of commerce, the City of Sorsogon.<br><br>Commissioner's Report of [Engr.] Dino:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ACCESSIBILITY AND LOCATION<br><br>The subject property is located in Barangay San Isidro, Sorsogon. It is barely one kilometer away from the Bacon Airport and the Sorsogon-Bacon Highway. It could be reached through the San Vicente-Buhatan Road – a dormant overland artery linking the district of Bacon to the City of Sorsogon.<br><br>PROPERTY APPRAISAL<br><br>Provincial Ordinance No. 03-99, also known as "An Ordinance Providing for an Updated Schedule of Fair Market Values of Real Properties in the Province of Sorsogon" was used as the basis for determining the unit values of lands and other improvements found in the subject real property. However, with respect to the appraisal of timber producing tree species, the approximate extractable lumber was multiplied by the prevailing market price per board foot.<br><br>[Engr. Dino made a detailed assessment computing the subject property's Fair Market Value to be P4,764,323.00, and the fruit-bearing and timber-producing trees found thereon amounting to P806,870.00 and P445,110.00, respectively. Engr. Dino, thus, concluded that just compensation for the subject property should amount to P6,016,303.00.]<br><br>On the matter of the land valuation submitted by [Engr. Dino] for the (Mateos], the Court considers said land valuation too low considering that the land subject for acquisition is within the city limit of the City of Sorsogon and as shown by the evidence of the [Mateos], the land was a subject of a housing subdivision and can command a price of not less than P350,000.00 per [ha]. The area for acquisition is ideal not only for housing subdivision but as expansion for commercial district of the City of Sorsogon. It has all the potentials of a city within the city. It has abundant water supply and aacessible to the center of commerce. The [Mateos] also submitted evidence of comparable sales transactions of the nearby landholdings executed by Jose Maria Simo, Jr. in favor of the National Housing Authority selling the property with an area of 159,968 sq. m. for the amount of P2,335,170.00 x x x. As the property is within the city of Sorsogon, the selling price of land is P1,000.00 per square meter. The land subject of acquisition is an agricultural land but it cannot be denied that [in] the present time[,] the land commands [a] higher price especially that the exchange rate of peso to dollar is 1 dollar to 50 pesos. Evidence also show that the [parents of the Mateos] acquired the property for P1,000.00 per [ha] and it took them three (3) years to clear the property and after another three years, they planted coconuts which are now fruit bearing trees. x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[The SAC then adopted Engr. Dino's valuation of the improvements found in the subject property and made estimates of the total amount the coconuts, copra and rice harvested therefrom could have fetched from 1994-2002. The SAC also assessed the price of the subject property to be P500,000.00 per ha.]<br><br>RECAPITULATION:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="29%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">P54,000,000.00</div> </td> <td width="71%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Fair Market Value of 108 hectares coconut land at P500,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">13,057,397.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Net produce of copra from 1994 to 2002</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">806,820.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Value of the improvements inside the 108.0000 hectares</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">445,110.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Value of the coconut trunk[s]</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P68,309,327.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Total value of the 108 [has] coconut land</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1,750,000.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Fair Market Value of3.7649 [has] of Riceland at P500,000.00</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1,686,085.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Net Produce of the Riceland from year 1994 to 2002</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P71 ,745,412.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Grand Total Value of the Coconut land and Riceland with an area of 112.3112 [has]</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">601,789.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– less the amount previously received by [the Mateos] as lease rentals</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P71,143,623.00</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">– Total amount of Just Compensation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br><center><b>Proceedings Before the CA</b></center><br><br>The <b>LBP</b> and the DAR both filed notices of appeal, but no brief was filed by the latter before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On the LBP's part, it mainly argued that the complaint of the Mateos was premature as the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) had not yet made an administrative valuation of the subject property and that the SAC, in determining just compensation, failed to consider the guidelines provided for in Section 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  of R.A.

Further, while Section 50<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of R.A. No. 6657 grants the DAR the primary jurisdiction to adjudicate agrarian reform matters, Section 57<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the same statute confers original and exclusive jurisdiction over the RTCs as SACs to take cognizance of petitions for determination of just compensation of landowners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On August 4, 2008, the CA rendered the herein assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> setting aside the SAC's judgment and dismissing without prejudice the complaint of the Mateos. The CA explained that:<br><br><blockquote>Since the DARAB is clothed with quasi-judicial authority to make a preliminary determination of just compensation of lands acquired under R.A. No. 6657, x x x and it appearing from the records and [the Mateos'] own admission that [the] said administrative agency had not yet taken cognizance of, and passed upon the issue of just compensation when [the Mateos] prematurely filed with the court <i>a quo </i>the complaint for determination of just compensation, thus failing to exhaust the prescribed administrative remedy and, in the process, preventing the DARAB from complying with [the] said administrative process which is mandatory, We resolve to grant the appeal.<br><br>Jurisprudence teems with pronouncements that before a party is allowed to seek the intervention of the court, it is a pre-condition that he should have availed of all the means of administrative processes afforded him. x x x The premature invocation of [the] court's intervention is fatal to one's cause of action[.] x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Anent the issue on just compensation, Section 17 of [R.A.] No. 6657 provides the guideposts for its determination[.] x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As defined, just compensation is the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. While We agree with the trial court's submission that "the measure is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss", and that the word "just" is used to intensify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea that the equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample, We likewise subscribe to appellant LBP's contention that "just compensation", in contemplation of agrarian reform, is quite different from just compensation involving an ordinary exercise of the power of eminent domain. Thus, as correctly pointed out by LBP, just compensation must be viewed in the context of social justice enshrined in the fundamental law to make it easier for the disadvantaged to be able to obtain land.<br><br>Moreover, it is clear from the decision of the trial com1 that aside from the court <i>a quo's </i> lack of jurisdiction to take cognizance of the present case, its computation totally disregarded Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657, which, as earlier reproduced, prescribes the factors for determining just compensation of lands acquired thereunder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated January 28, 2009, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> filed by the Mateos.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br><br>Aggrieved, the Mateos are before this Court essentially raising the following issues:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether or not the CA erred in negating the jurisdiction of the RTC, as a SAC, to determine in the first instance and in the absence of the conduct of prior administrative proceedings, questions of just compensation to be paid to landowners.<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the CA erroneously held that the SAC disregarded the provisions of Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 in determning the amount of just compensation to be paid for the subject property.</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>In support of the instant petition, the Mateos, citing <i>LBP v. Wycoco,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> reiterate that even without the DAR's final valuation of the agricultural land for expropriation, the RTC, as a SAC, can validly take cognizance of a case for determination of just compensation in accordance with Section 57 of R.A. No. 6657. Otherwise, if the DAR would vest in administrative officials' original jurisdiction in compensation cases, the&nbsp; jurisdiction conferred upon the RTC, as a SAC, by the said Section 57 is undermined.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the Mateos argue that the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies admits of exceptions, one of which is when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention, like in the case at bar. The Mateos were prematurely deprived of the subject property in 1994, and as compensation therefor, a trust account was belatedly created for them in 1997 or three years after the illegal entry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Mateos likewise assert that the SAC had conscientiously made a fair determination of the subject property's value on the basis of the factors enumerated in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. The SAC considered the following: (a) nature and actual use of the subject property; (b) current value of similar property; (c) annual income derived from the subject property at the time of taking by the DAR; (d) cost of acquisition of the land and sworn valuation by the Mateos, both in relation to currency inflations; (e) Provincial Schedule of Fair Market Value (FMV) of Real Property in the Province of Sorsogon; and (f) just compensation for the damages incurred by the Mateos as a consequence of the DAR and the LBP's concerted acts of taking the subject property without compliance with due process. It was, thus, error for the CA to haphazardly conclude, without substantiation, that the SAC disregarded the legal requisites in determining just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In their comments,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the DAR and the LBP seek the dismissal of the instant petition.<br><br>On its part, the DAR, citing <i> Republic of the Philippines v.

The LBP likewise reviews the application and the supporting documents and determines the valuation of the land. Thereafter, the DAR issues the Notice of Land Valuation to the landowner. In both voluntary and compulsory acquisition, where the landowner rejects the offer, the DAR opens an account in the name of the landowner and conducts a summary administrative proceeding.

Justice Velasco is also correct when he stated that the Court, in <i>Heirs of Vidad, </i>summarized and affirmed rulings which "invariably upheld the [SAC's] original and exclusive jurisdiction x x x notwithstanding the seeming failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the DAR." Later on, he would point out, again correctly, the seemingly conflicting rulings issued by this Court regarding the imposition upon the courts of <i>a </i>formula to determine just compensation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Justice Velasco reads both <b><i>Belista </i>and <i>Heirs of Vidad </i>as bases to show that SACs possess original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine just compensation, regardless of prior exercise by the DAR of its primary jurisdiction.<br><br>We do not disagree with the rulings in <i>Belista </i>and <i>Heirs of Vidad, </i>both of which acknowledge the grant of primary jurisdiction to the DAR, subject to judicial review. <u>We are, however, of the view that the better rule would be to read these seemingly conflicting cases without having to disturb established doctrine</u>.<br><br><u><i>Belista,</i> for example, should be read in conjunction with<i> Association, </i> the landmark case directly resolving the constitutionality of RA 6657</u>. </b>In<i> Association,</i><b><i> </i> <u>this Court unanimously upheld the grant of iurisdiction accorded to the DAR under Section 16</u></b><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[43]</sup></font><b><u> to preliminarily determine just compensation. This grant of primary jurisdiction is specific, compared to the general grant of quasi-judicial power to the DAR under Section 50. <i>Belista, </i>which speaks of exceptions to the general grant of quasi-judicial power under Section 50, cannot be read to extend to the specific grant of primary jurisdiction under Section 16</u>.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Considering the validity of the grant of primary jurisdiction, our ruling in <i>Heirs of Vidad </i>should also be reconciled with the rationale behind the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. <u>In this sense, neither landowner nor agency can disregard the administrative process provided under the law without offending the already established doctrine of primary jurisdiction</u>:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 18, on the other hand, merely recognizes the possibility that the landowner will disagree with the DAR/LBP's offer. In such case, and where the landowner elevates the issue to the court, the court needs to rule on the offer of the DAR and the LBP. Since the government's offer is required by law to be founded on Section 17, the court, in exercising judicial review, will necessarily rule on the DAR determination based on the factors enumerated in Section 17.<br><br>Now, whether the court accepts the determination of the DAR will depend on its exercise of discretion. This is the essence of judicial review. That the court <i>can </i> reverse, affirm or modify the DAR/LBP's determination cannot, however, be used to argue that Section 18 excuses observance from Section 17 in cases of disagreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis ours and italics in the original)</blockquote><br><br><i>Alfonso</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> is unequivocal that <i>administrative remedies cannot be dispensed with and direct resort to the SAC is proscribed. </i>However, the foregoing rule cannot be applied in the case at bar for reasons discussed below.<br><br>While the Court recognizes the primacy of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies in our judicial system, it bears emphasizing that the principle admits of exceptions, among which is when there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that irretrievably prejudices a complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This <i>exception </i>is attendant herein where the LBP and the DAR <i>entered </i>the property of the Mateos sometime in 1994,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> but deposited cash and Agrarian Reform Bonds as payment therefor only on December 13, 1996 and February 11, 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The LBP and the DAR were indisputably aware that the Mateos rejected the price offered as just compensation for the subject property.
