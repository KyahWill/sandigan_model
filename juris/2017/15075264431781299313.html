Q: You said that <b>CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANTS CORP.</b> has just merged with Price Richardson Inc., can you elaborate on this?<br>A: Yes, just this September, we have been informed of the [merge]. In fact we have been instructed to use the name of Price Richardson in our calls starting September 2001.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>09. Q: Can you describe the process in, as you said – "qualify clients as possible investors"?<br>A: I make overseas calls to individuals listed in our Client Leads. The "Client Leads" contains a list of the names of the top-level personnel of international companies, it includes their address and telephone numbers. From these leads, we select clients to call and offer them a free subscription of our "Financial News Letter".<br><br>. . . .<br><br>11. Q: What does these "Financial News Letter" contain?<br>A: It contains the current status of the worldwide stock market.<br><br>12: Q: So what happens when a client agrees to subscribe in your news letter?<br>A: We then check from our list if the information we have regarding their address and telephone numbers [is] correct. This is to check their mail preference - where they would like us to send the news letter.<br><br>13. Q: What happens after that?<br>A: Those who agree to receive the subscription are considered as qualified clients. We then fill out a "SALES LEAD" card, which reflects the information of the client. We then forward these cards to the marketing department, consisting of the encoders and other telemarketers. These people are the ones who send the newsletters and transaction receipts to clients. Their office is located at the Price Richardson Office, 31<sup>st</sup> Floor Citibank Tower, Paseo De Roxas, Makati. It is from these cards that our foreigner salesmen could get possible investors. These possible investors would then be sold with non-existent stocks.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>15. Q: So are you saying that CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANTS CORP and/or PRICE RICHARDSON, Inc. is engaged in the illegal trading of stocks to clients?<br><br>A: Yes. When I applied for the job, I was briefed by ANNE BENWICK, the Operations Manager, about the nature of their [b]usiness. She said that the company is engaged in trading stocks, and my job as a Telemarketer would be to "qualify clients" who might become possible investors.

It is imperative for complainant to prove the respondent-corporation's affirmative act of buying and selling securities to constitute the offense charged. It cannot be established on the expedient reason that a corporation is not license[d] or authorize[d] to trade securities. He who alleges a positive statement has the burden of proving the same.<br><br>The various "confirmation of trade" receipts . . . taken singly, does not prove violation of Sections 26.3 and 28 of the Securities Regulation Code. Far from proving the offense charged, those confirmation of trade could very well mean that indeed respondent Price was merely "providing administrative services of furnishing all necessary and incidental clerical, bookkeeping, mailing and billing services" pursuant to its primary purpose as embodied in its articles of incorporation. There is no evidence that indeed anyone transacted business much less purchased or sold securities with any of the respondents acting as broker or dealer in securities. In other words, the burden of proving that respondents made various offers to sell unregistered securities; that the offers were accepted; and, that agreements of sale were reached and consummated, has not been dislodged by the complainant.

It is such a state of facts in the mind of the prosecutor as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe or entertain an honest or strong suspicion that a thing is so. The term does not mean "actual or positive cause;" nor does it import absolute certainty. It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. Thus, a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The definition of probable cause was lifted from Rule 112, Section 1, paragraph 1 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 112<br>Preliminary Investigation</center><br><br>Section 1. Preliminary Investigation Defined; When Required. — Preliminary investigation is an inquiry or proceeding to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial.</blockquote><br><br>Under Rule 112, preliminary investigation must be conducted to determine the existence of probable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> In <i>Andres v.

Telecom, Inc. sometime in April 2001. At such time, and until today, Price Richardson was not authorized to act as traders or brokers o[f] securities in the Philippines.<br><br>Furthermore, there are other complainants against Price Richardson who deserve to have their complaints aired and tried before the proper court. Mr. Johannes Jacob Van Prooyen filed a complaint against Price Richardson with the National Bureau of Investigation . . . In the said complaint, Mr. Van Prooyen clearly pointed to Price Richardson as the ones who contacted him on June 12, 2001 to buy 2000 shares of Hugo Intl. Telecom, Inc. and on July 10, 2001 to buy 2000 shares of GeoAlert. At no time at such relevant dates was Price Richardson licensed to act as traders or brokers of securities in the Philippines.<br><br>Mr. Bjorn L. Nymann of Oslo, Norway wrote about Price Richardson to this very same Department of Justice, which letter was received on July 9, 2002. In his letter Mr. Nymann admitted dealing with Price Richardson. He admitted to having bought 3000 shares of Hugo Intl. Telecom, Inc. . . .

The evidence at hand merely proves that the above-named respondents were not licensed to act as broker, salesman or associated person. No further proof, however, was presented showing that said respondents have indeed acted as such in trading securities.
