THE JUDICIAL AND BAR COUNCIL, CHAIRED BY THE HON. MARIA LOURDES P.A. SERENO, CHIEF JUSTICE AND EX OFFICIO CHAIRPERSON, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>DECISION</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>. This principle of adherence to precedents has not lost its luster and continues to guide the bench in keeping with the need to maintain stability in the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed directly with this Court by herein petitioner Rep. Reynaldo V. Umali, current Chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice, impugns the present-day practice of six-month rotational representation of Congress in the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) for it unfairly deprives both Houses of Congress of their full participation in the said body. The aforementioned practice was adopted by the JBC in light of the ruling in <i>Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>As an overview, in <i>Chavez</i>, the constitutionality of the practice of having two representatives from both houses of Congress with one vote each in the JBC, thus, increasing its membership from seven to eight, was challenged. With that, this Court examined the constitutional provision that states the composition of the JBC, that is, Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8. (1) A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created under the supervision of the Supreme Court composed of the Chief Justice as <i>ex officio</i> Chairman, the Secretary of Justice, and <b>a representative of the Congress</b> as <i>ex officio</i> Members, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired Member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Following a painstaking analysis, this Court, in a Decision dated July 17, 2012, declared the said practice of having two representatives from Congress with one vote each in the JBC unconstitutional. This Court enunciated that the use of the singular letter "<i>a</i>" preceding "<i>representative of the Congress</i>" in the aforequoted provision is unequivocal and leaves no room for any other construction or interpretation. The same is indicative of the Framers' intent that Congress may designate only one representative to the JBC. Had it been otherwise, they could have, in no uncertain terms, so provided. This Court further articulated that in the context of JBC representation, the term "Congress" must be taken to mean the entire legislative department as no liaison between the two houses exists in the workings of the JBC. There is no mechanism required between the Senate and the House of Representatives in the screening and nomination of judicial officers. Moreover, this Court, quoting the keen observation of Retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago, who is also a JBC Consultant, stated that the <i>ex officio</i> members of the JBC consist of representatives from the three main branches of government, to wit: the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court representing the judiciary, the Secretary of Justice representing the executive, and a representative of the Congress representing the legislature. It can be deduced therefrom that the unmistakable tenor of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution was to treat each <i>ex officio</i> member as representing one co-equal branch of government having equal say in the choice of judicial nominees. Now, to allow the legislature to have more than one representative in the JBC would negate the principle of equality among these three branches of the government, which is enshrined in the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The subsequent motion for reconsideration thereof was denied in a Resolution dated April 16, 2013, where this Court reiterated that Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution providing for "<i>a representative of the Congress</i>" in the JBC is clear and unambiguous and does not need any further interpretation. Besides, this Court is not convinced that the Framers simply failed to adjust the aforesaid constitutional provision, by sheer inadvertence, to their decision to shift to a bicameral form of legislature. Even granting that there was, indeed, such omission, this Court cannot supply the same. Following the rule of <i>casus omissus</i>, that is, a case omitted is to be held as intentionally omitted, this Court cannot under its power of interpretation supply the omission even if the same may have resulted from inadvertence or it was not foreseen or contemplated for to do so would amount to judicial legislation. Ergo, this Court has neither power nor authority to add another member in the JBC simply by judicial construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In light of these Decision and Resolution, both Houses of Congress agreed on a six-month rotational representation in the JBC, wherein the House of Representatives will represent Congress from January to June and the Senate from July to December.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This is now the current practice in the JBC. It is by reason of this arrangement that the votes cast by the petitioner for the selection of nominees for the vacancies of then retiring Supreme Court Associate Justices Jose P. Perez (Perez) and Arturo Brion (Brion) were not counted by the JBC during its <i>En Banc</i> deliberations held last December 2 and 9, 2016. Instead, the petitioner's votes were simply placed in an envelope and sealed subject to any further disposition as this Court may direct in a proper proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> This is the root of the present controversy that prompted the petitioner to file the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus based on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE WRIT OF <i>CERTIORARI</i> IS PROPER TO ENJOIN THE JBC TO CORRECT ITS UNWARRANTED DENIAL OF THE VOTES REGISTERED BY [HEREIN PETITIONER] DURING THE EN BANC DELIBERATIONS ON DECEMBER 2 AND 9, 2016 BECAUSE THE DECISION IN THE <i>CHAVEZ</i> CASE IS DEFECTIVE/FLAWED.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE WRIT OF MANDAMUS IS PROPER TO MANDATE THE JBC TO ACCEPT/COUNT SAID VOTES CAST BY [PETITIONER] BECAUSE THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE JBC IS DEFECTIVE/FLAWED AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE PRESENT PRACTICE OF THE JBC IN ALLOWING ONLY ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SENATE OR THE HOUSE OF [REPRESENTATIVES] TO PARTICIPATE AND VOTE ON A [6-MONTH] ROTATION BASIS IS IMPRACTICABLE, ABSURD AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL, CREATES AN [INSTITUTIONAL] IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO INDEPENDENT CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND INSTITUTES AN INHERENT AND CONTINUING CONSTITUTIONAL DEFECT IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE JBC THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS APPOINTMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT, INCLUDING AND PARTICULARLY [THIS COURT].<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>THE 1987 CONSTITUTION CLEARLY REQUIRES PARTICIPATION AND VOTING BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN JBC PROCEEDINGS AND ALL APPOINTMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT, INCLUDING AND PARTICULARLY [THIS COURT].<br><blockquote>A. THE BICAMERAL NATURE OF THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT WAS BELATEDLY DECIDED UNDER THE 1987 CONSTITUTION, BUT MUST BE DEEMED AS INCORPORATED AND MODIFYING THE JBC STRUCTURE UNDER SECTION 8(1)[,] ARTICLE VIII OF THE [1987] CONSTITUTION, TO GIVE FULL MEANING TO THE INTENT OF ITS FRAMERS.<br><br>B. THERE WAS A CLEAR OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL OMISSION INVOLVING SECTIONS 8(1)[,] ARTICLE VIII OF THE [1987] CONSTITUTION THAT SHOULD BE RECTIFIED BY [THIS COURT].<br><br>C. THE FULL REPRESENTATION OF CONGRESS IN THE JBC IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH PARTICIPATING AND VOTING FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE TWO INDEPENDENT CHAMBERS, OTHERWISE THE JBC PROCEEDINGS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.<br><br>D. THE PRESENCE OF THE SENATE AND [THE] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBERS IN THE JBC UPHOLDS THE CO-EQUAL REPRESENTATION IN THE COUNCIL OF THE THREE MAIN BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>As instructed by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> both Houses of Congress, through the Manifestation of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), which acts as the People's Tribune in this case, and the JBC commented on the Petition.<br><br>The OSG wants this Court to revisit <i>Chavez</i> for its alleged unexecutability arising from constitutional constraints. It holds that the current practice of alternate representation was only arrived at because of time constraints and difficulty in securing the agreement of both Houses of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> And, since the Constitution itself did not clearly state who is the Congress' representative in the JBC, the provision, therefore, regarding the latter's composition must be harmonized to give effect to the current bicameral system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> With this in view, the OSG believes that it is only proper for both Houses of Congress to be given equal representation in the JBC as neither House can bind the other for tliere can be no single member of either House who can fully represent the entire legislature for to do so would definitely result in absurdity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Further, the OSG avers that <i>Chavez's</i> strict interpretation of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution violates the very essence of bicameralism and sets aside the inherent dichotomy between the two Houses of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> To note, a JBC member's votes are reflective of the position and the interest such member wants to uphold, such that when the representatives from each House of Congress vote for a certain judicial nominee, they carry the interests and views of the group they represent. Thus, when only one would represent both Houses of Congress in the JBC, the vote would not be representative of the interests embodied by the Congress as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the same way, the OSG contends that the bicameral nature of the legislature strictly adheres to the distinct and separate personality of both Houses of Congress; thus, no member of Congress can represent the entire Congress. Besides, the phrase "<i>a representative of the Congress</i>" in Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution is qualified by the phrase "<i>ex officio members</i>." The <i>ex officio</i> nature of the position derives its authority from the principal office. It, thus, follows that each house of Congress must be represented in the JBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Also, the OSG states that the constitutional intent in creating the JBC is to ensure community representation from the different sectors of society, as well as from the three branches of government, and to eliminate partisan politics in the selection of members of the judiciary. The focus, therefore, is more on proper representation rather than qualitative limitation. It even insists that when the Framers deliberated on Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, they were still thinking of a unicameral legislature, thereby, giving Congress only one representative to the JBC. However, with the shift from unicameralism to bicameralism, "<i>a representative of the Congress</i>" in the JBC should now be understood to mean one representative from each House of Congress. For had it been the intention of the Framers for the JBC to be composed only of seven members, they would have specified the numbers just like in the other constitutional provisions. As such, the membership in the JBC should not be limited to seven members. More so, an eventual deadlock in the voting would not pose any problem since the voting in the JBC is not through a "yes" or a "no" vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As its final argument, the OSG maintains that while Congress' participation in the JBC may be non-legislative, still, the involvement of both Houses of Congress in its every proceeding is indispensable, as each House represents different constituencies and would necessarily bring a unique perspective to the recommendation process of the JBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>For its part, the JBC vehemently pleads that the present Petition be dismissed as its adopted rotational scheme and the necessary consequences thereof are not the proper subjects of a <i><i>certiorari</i></i> and even a mandamus petition for the same do not involve an exercise of judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. Apart from that, it committed no grave abuse of discretion in refusing to recognize, accept and count the petitioner's votes during its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016 for it merely acted in accordance with the Constitution and with the ruling in <i>Chavez</i>. More so, there is no showing that the petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy other than this Petition for nowhere herein did he assert that he exerted all efforts to have his concern addressed by Congress, such as asking the latter to repudiate the rotational arrangement. Thus, for the petitioner's failure to exhaust all remedies available to him in Congress, he deprived the latter of an opportunity to address the matter. Also, the practice and acquiescence of both Houses of Congress to such an arrangement operates as an estoppel against any member thereof to deny its validity. As regards a writ of mandamus, it cannot be issued to compel the JBC to count the petitioner's votes for it will not lie to control the performance of a discretionary act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The JBC further enunciates that the petitioner has no <i>locus standi</i> to institute this Petition in his capacity as Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice and <i>Ex Officio</i> Member of the JBC without the requisite resolution from both Houses of Congress authorizing him to sue as a member thereof, which absence is a fatal defect rendering this Petition dismissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, the JBC asseverates that this Petition should also be dismissed as the allegations herein are mere rehash of the arguments and dissents in <i>Chavez</i>, which have already been exhaustively litigated and settled therein by this Court, more in particular, the interpretation of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, hence, barred by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>. Similarly, there exists no substantial reason or even supervening event or material change of circumstances that warrants Chavez's reversal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The JBC likewise insists that it was the intent of the Framers of the Constitution for the JBC to have only seven members. The reason for that was laid down in <i>Chavez</i>, that is, to provide a solution should there be a stalemate in the voting. As to the alleged oversight and technical omission of the Framers in changing the provision on the JBC to reflect the bicameral nature of Congress, these are flimsy excuses to override the clear provision of the Constitution and to disturb settled jurisprudence. As explained in <i>Chavez</i>, Congress' membership in the JBC was not in the interest of a certain constituency but in reverence to it as a major branch of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Last of all, the JBC holds that should this Petition be granted, there would be an imbalance in favor of Congress with respect to the representation in the JBC of the three main and co-equal branches of the government. For the unmistakable tenor of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution was to treat each <i>ex officio</i> member as representing one co-equal branch of government. And, even assuming that the current six-month rotational scheme in the JBC created an imbalance between the two Houses of Congress, it is not within the power of this Court or the JBC to remedy such imbalance. For the remedy lies in the amendment of this constitutional provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing arguments, the issues ought to be addressed by this Court can be summed up into: (1) whether the petitioner has <i>locus standi</i> to file this Petition even without the requisite resolution from both Houses of Congress permitting him to do so; (2) whether the petitioner's direct resort to this Court <i>via</i> a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus is the plain, speedy and adequate remedy available to him to assail the JBC's adoption of the rotational representation leading to the non-counting of his votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016; (3) whether the JBC acted with grave abuse of discretion in adopting the six-month rotational scheme of both Houses of Congress resulting in the non-counting of the petitioner's votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016; (4) whether the JBC can be compelled through mandamus to count the petitioner's votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016; and (4) whether this Court's ruling in <i>Chavez</i> applies as <i>stare decisis</i> to the present case.<br><br>Before delving into the above-stated issues, this Court would like to note that this Petition was primarily filed because of the non-counting of the petitioner's votes in the JBC En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016 held for the purpose of determining, among others, who will be the possible successors of the then retiring Associate Justices of the Supreme Court Perez and Brion, whose retirements were set on December 14 and 29, 2016, respectively. The list of nominees will then be forwarded to the President as the appointing authority. With the appointments of Associate Justices Samuel R. Martires (Martires) and Noel G. Tijam (Tijam) on March 2 and 8, 2017, respectively, this Petition has now been rendered moot insofar as the petitioner's prayers to (1) reverse and set aside the JBC En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016; and (2) direct the JBC to count his votes therein as its <i>ex officio</i> member,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> are concerned.<br><br>As a rule, courts do not entertain moot questions. An issue becomes moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy so that a declaration on the issue would be of no practical use or value. This notwithstanding, the Court in a number of cases held that the moot and academic principle is not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the courts from resolving a case. Courts will still decide cases otherwise, moot and academic if: (1) there is a grave violation of the Constitution; (2) the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; (3) when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and (4) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Considering that all the arguments herein once again boil down to the proper interpretation of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution on congressional representation in the JBC, this Court deems it proper to proceed on deciding this Petition despite its mootness to settle the matter once and for all.<br><br>Having said that, this Court shall now resolve the issues in seriatim.<br><br><i>On petitioner's locus standi.</i> The petitioner brings this suit in his capacity as the current Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice and <i>Ex Officio</i> Member of the JBC. His legal standing was challenged by the JBC for lack of an enabling resolution for that purpose coming from both Houses of Congress.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> or legal standing is defined as a personal and substantial interest in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the challenged governmental act. It requires a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure the concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> With that definition, therefore, a party will be allowed to litigate only when he can demonstrate that (1) he has personally suffered some actual or threatened injury because of the allegedly illegal conduct of the government; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by the remedy being sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Otherwise, he/she would not be allowed to litigate. Nonetheless, in a long line of cases, concerned citizens, taxpayers and legislators when specific requirements have been met have been given standing by this Court. This was succinctly explained in <i>Francisco, Jr. v. The House of Representatives</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>When suing as a <i>citizen</i>, the interest of the petitioner assailing the constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal. He must be able to show, not only that the law or any government act is invalid, but also that he sustained or is in imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way. It must appear that the person complaining has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute or act complained of. In fine, when the proceeding involves the assertion of a public right, the mere fact that he is a citizen satisfies the requirement of personal interest.<br><br>In the case of a <i>taxpayer</i>, he is allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are illegally disbursed, or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, or that there is a wastage of public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law. Before he can invoke the power of judicial review, however, he must specifically prove that he has sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation and that he would sustain a direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the questioned statute or contract. It is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>As for a <i>legislator</i>, he is allowed to sue to question the validity of any official action which he claims infringes his prerogatives as a legislator. <u>Indeed, a member of the House of Representatives has standing to maintain inviolate the prerogatives, powers and privileges vested by the Constitution in his office.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>The legal standing of each member of Congress was also upheld in <i>Philippine Constitution Association v. Enriquez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where this Court pronounced that:<br><blockquote>The legal standing of the Senate, as an institution, was recognized in <i>Gonzales v. Macaraig, Jr.</i> (citation omitted). In said case, 23 Senators, comprising the entire membership of the Upper House of Congress, filed a petition to nullify the presidential veto of Section 55 of the GAA of 1989. The filing of the suit was authorized by Senate Resolution No. 381, adopted on February 2, 1989, and which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Authorizing and Directing the Committee on Finance to Bring in the Name of the Senate of the Philippines the Proper Suit with the Supreme Court of the Philippines contesting the Constitutionality of the Veto by the President of Special and General Provisions, particularly Section 55, of the General Appropriation Bill of 1989 (H.B. No. 19186) and For Other Purposes.<br></blockquote>In the United States, the legal standing of a House of Congress to sue has been recognized (citation omitted).<br><br><b>While the petition in G.R. No. 113174 was filed by 16 Senators, including the Senate President and the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, <u>the suit was not authorized by the Senate itself</u>. Likewise, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 113766 and 113888 <u>were filed without an enabling resolution for the purpose</u>.</b><br><br>Therefore, the question of the legal standing of petitioners in the three cases becomes a preliminary issue before this Court can inquire into the validity of the presidential veto and the conditions for the implementation of some items in the GAA of 1994.<br><br><b>We rule that a member of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives for that matter, has the legal standing to question the validity of a presidential veto or a condition imposed on an item in an appropriation bill.</b><br><br>Where the veto is claimed to have been made without or in excess of the authority vested on the President by the Constitution, the issue of an impermissible intrusion of the Executive into the domain of the Legislature arises (citation omitted).<br><br><b>To the extent the powers of Congress are impaired, so is the power of each member thereof, since his office confers a right to participate in the exercise of the powers of that institution</b> (citation omitted).<br><br>An act of the Executive which injures the institution of Congress causes a derivative but nonetheless substantial injury, which can be questioned by a member of Congress (citation omitted). In such a case, any member of Congress can have a resort to the courts.<br><br>Former Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, as <i>Amicus Curiae</i>, noted:<br><blockquote>This is, then, the clearest case of the Senate as a whole or individual Senators as such having a substantial interest in the question at issue. It could likewise be said that there was the requisite injury to their rights as Senators. It would then be futile to raise any <i>locus standi</i> issue. Any intrusion into the domain appertaining to the Senate is to be resisted. Similarly, if the situation were reversed, and it is the Executive Branch that could allege a transgression, its officials could likewise file the corresponding action. <u><b>What cannot be denied is that a Senator has standing to maintain inviolate the prerogatives, powers and privileges vested by the Constitution in his office</b></u> (citation omitted).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>It is clear therefrom that each member of Congress has a legal standing to sue even without an enabling resolution for that purpose so long as the questioned acts invade the powers, prerogatives and privileges of Congress. Otherwise stated, whenever the acts affect the powers, prerogatives and privileges of Congress, anyone of its members may validly bring an action to challenge the same to safeguard and maintain the sanctity thereof.<br><br>With the foregoing, this Court sustains the petitioner's legal standing as Member of the House of Representatives and as the Chairman of its Committee on Justice to assail the alternate representation of Congress in the JBC, which arrangement led to the non-counting of his votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016, as it allegedly affects adversely Congress' prerogative to be fully represented before the said body.<br><br><i>On petitioner's direct resort to this Court via <i>certiorari</i> petition.</i> The JBC questions the propriety of the petitioner's direct resort to this Court via the present Petition to assail its adoption of the rotational representation of Congress resulting in the non-counting of his votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016. The JBC insists that the said scheme was a creation of Congress itself; as such, the petitioner's plain, speedy and adequate remedy is to appeal to Congress to repudiate the same. Direct resort to this Court should not be allowed if there is a remedy available to the petitioner before Congress.<br><br>Generally, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> can only be availed of in the absence of an appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In <i>Bordomeo v. Court of Appeals</i>, however, this Court clarified that it is inadequacy that must usually determine the propriety of <i>certiorari</i> and not the mere absence of all other remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ. A remedy is considered plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment, order, or resolution of the lower court or agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the same way, as a matter of policy, direct resort to this Court will not be entertained unless the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate lower courts, and exceptional and compelling circumstances, such as in cases involving national interest and those of serious implications, justify the availment of the extraordinary remedy of the writ of <i>certiorari</i>, calling for the exercise of its primary jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In <i>The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and again in <i>Maza v. Turla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> this Court took pains in enumerating the circumstances that would warrant a direct resort to this Court, to wit: (1) when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time; (2) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; (3) cases of first impression as no jurisprudence yet exists that will guide the lower courts on this matter; (4) the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this court; (5) the time element presented in this case cannot be ignored; (6) the filed petition reviews the act of a constitutional organ; (7) petitioners rightly claim that they had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; and (8) the petition includes questions that are dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Here, while this Court agrees with the JBC that the petitioner's preliminary remedy to question the rotational arrangement of Congress is to ask the latter to repudiate the same, this, however, cannot be considered plain, speedy and adequate. This Court is, thus, inclined to sustain the petitioner's direct resort to this Court not only because it is the plain, speedy and adequate remedy available to him but also by reason of the constitutional issues involved herein and the urgency of the matter. As correctly pointed out by the OSG, the Constitution mandates that any vacancy to the office of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court must be filled up within the 90-day period from its occurrence. Therefore, the JBC must submit the list of nominees prior to the start of that period. As the nominations covered by the questioned December 2016 JBC En Banc deliberations were intended for vacancies created by then Associate Justices Perez and Brion, who respectively retired last December 14 and 29, 2016, hence, any resort to Congress during that time would already be inadequate since the JBC list of nominees would be submitted any moment to the Office of the President for the appointment of the next Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. Since time is of the essence, the petitioner's direct resort to this Court is warranted.<br><br><i>On the alleged grave abuse of discretion of the JBC in adopting the rotational representation of Congress correctable by certiorari</i>. The petitioner ascribed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the JBC in its adoption of the rotational scheme, which led to the non-counting of his votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016, as it deprives Congress of its full representation therein. The JBC, on the other hand, believes otherwise for it merely acted in accordance with the mandate of the Constitution and with the ruling in <i>Chavez</i>. Also, such rotational scheme was a creation of Congress, which it merely adopted.<br><br><i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the present Rules of Court are the two special civil actions used for determining and correcting grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The sole office of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> is the correction of errors of jurisdiction, which necessarily includes the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The burden is on the petitioner to prove that the respondent tribunal committed not merely a reversible error but also a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Showing mere abuse of discretion is not enough, for the abuse must be shown to be grave. Grave abuse of discretion means either that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>But, the remedies of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach before this Court as the writs may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. Thus, they are appropriate remedies to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify the acts of legislative and executive officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Here, it is beyond question that the JBC does not fall within the scope of a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Neither did it act in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity nor did it assume any performance of judicial or quasi-judicial prerogative in adopting the rotational scheme of Congress, which was the reason for not counting the votes of the petitioner in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016. But, despite this, its act is still not beyond this Court's reach as the same is correctible by <i>certiorari</i> if it is tainted with grave abuse of discretion even if it is not exercising judicial and quasi-judicial functions. Now, did the JBC abuse its discretion in adopting the six-month rotational arrangement and in not counting the votes of the petitioner? This Court answers in the negative. As correctly pointed out by the JBC, in adopting the said arrangement, it merely acted pursuant to the Constitution and the <i>Chavez</i> ruling, which both require only one representative from Congress in the JBC. It cannot, therefore, be faulted for simply complying with the Constitution and jurisprudence. Moreover, said arrangement was crafted by both Houses of Congress and the JBC merely adopted the same. By no stretch of imagination can it be regarded as grave abuse of discretion on the part of the JBC.<br><br>With the foregoing, despite this Court's previous declaration that <i>certiorari</i> is the plain, speedy and adequate remedy available to petitioner, still the same cannot prosper for the petitioner's failure to prove that the JBC acted with grave abuse of discretion in adopting the rotational scheme.<br><br><i>On the propriety of mandamus</i>. It is essential to the issuance of a writ of mandamus that the applicant has a clear legal right to the tiling demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required. The burden is on the petitioner to show that there is such a clear legal right to the performance of the act, and a corresponding compelling duty on the part of the respondent to perform the act. <b>As an extraordinary writ, it lies only to compel an officer to perform a ministerial duty, not a discretionary one.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> A clear line demarcates a discretionary act from a ministerial one. A purely ministerial act is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> On the other hand, if the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Clearly, the use of discretion and the performance of a ministerial act are mutually exclusive. Further, the writ of mandamus does not issue to control or review the exercise of discretion or to compel a course of conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the counting of votes in the selection of the nominees to the judiciary may only be considered a ministerial duty of the JBC if such votes were cast by its rightful members and not by someone, like the petitioner, who is not considered a member during the En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016. For during the questioned period, the lawful representative of Congress to the JBC is a member of the Senate and not of the House of Representatives as per their agreed rotational scheme. Considering that a member of the Senate already cast his vote therein, the JBC has the full discretion not to count the votes of the petitioner for it is mandated by both the Constitution and jurisprudence to maintain that Congress will only have one representative in the JBC. As the act of the JBC involves a discretionary one, accordingly, mandamus will not lie.<br><br><i>On the application of Chavez as <i>stare decisis</i> in this case.</i> The petitioner strongly maintains that Chavez must be revisited and reversed due to its unexecutability. But the JBC insists that the arguments herein are mere rehash of those in <i>Chavez</i>, hence, already barred by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>. Also, there is no cogent reason for <i>Chavez's</i> reversal.<br><br>This Court takes another glance at the arguments in <i>Chavez</i> and compares them with the present arguments of the petitioner. A careful perusal, however, reveals that, although the petitioner questioned the JBC's adoption of the six-month rotational representation of Congress leading to the non-counting of his votes in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016, the supporting arguments hereof still boil down to the proper interpretation of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. Hence, being mere rehash of the arguments in <i>Chavez</i>, the application of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> in this case is inevitable. More so, the petitioner failed to present strong and compelling reason not to rule this case in the same way that this Court ruled <i>Chavez</i>.<br><br>As stated in the beginning of this <i>ponencia, <i>stare decisis</i> et non quieta movere</i> is a doctrine which means to adhere to precedents and <b>not to unsettle things which are established</b>. This is embodied in Article 8 of the Civil Code of the Philippines which provides, thus:<br><blockquote>ART. 8. Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines.<br></blockquote>The doctrine enjoins adherence to judicial precedents and requires courts in a country to follow the rule established in a decision of the Supreme Court thereof. That decision becomes a judicial precedent to be followed in subsequent cases by all courts in the land. The doctrine is based on the principle that <b>once a question of law has been examined and decided, it should be deemed settled and closed to further argument</b>. The same is grounded on the necessity for securing certainty and stability of judicial decisions, thus, time and again, the court has held that it is a very desirable and necessary judicial practice that <b>when a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same</b>. It simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue. The doctrine has assumed such value in our judicial system that the Court has ruled that "[a]bandonment thereof must be based only on strong and compelling reasons, otherwise, the becoming virtue of predictability which is expected from this Court would be immeasurably affected and the public's confidence in the stability of the solemn pronouncements diminished." <b>Verily, only upon showing that circumstances attendant in a particular case override the great benefits derived by our judicial system from the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> can the courts be justified in setting aside the same.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Here, the facts are exactly the same as in <i>Chavez</i>, where this Court has already settled the issue of interpretation of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. Truly, such ruling may not be unanimous, but it is undoubtedly a reflection of the wisdom of the majority of members of this Court on that matter. <i>Chavez</i> cannot simply be regarded as an erroneous application of the questioned constitutional provision for it merely applies the clear mandate of the law, that is, Congress is entitled to only one representative in the JBC in the same way that its co-equal branches are.<br><br>As this Court declared in <i>Chavez</i>, Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution is clear, categorical and unambiguous. Thus, it needs no further construction or interpretation. Time and time again, it has been repeatedly declared by this Court that <b>where the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation, only application</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The wordings of Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution are to be considered as indicative of the final intent of its Framers, that is, for Congress as a whole to only have one representative to sit in the JBC. This Court, therefore, cannot simply make an assumption that the Framers merely by oversight failed to take into account the bicameral nature of Congress in drafting the same. As further laid down in Chavez, the Framers were not keen on adjusting the provision on congressional representation in the JBC as it was not in the exercise of its primary function, which is to legislate. Notably, the JBC was created to support the executive power to appoint, and Congress, as one whole body, was merely assigned a contributory non-legislative function. No parallelism can be drawn between the representative of Congress in the JBC and the exercise by Congress of its legislative powers under Article VI and constituent powers under Article XVII of the Constitution. Congress, in relation to the executive and judicial branches of government, is constitutionally treated as another co-equal branch in the matter of its JBC representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This Court cannot succumb to the argument that Congress, being composed of two distinct and separate chambers, cannot represent each other in the JBC. Again, as this Court explained in <i>Chavez</i>, such an argument is misplaced because in the JBC, any member of Congress, whether from the Senate or the House of Representatives, is constitutionally empowered to represent the entire Congress. It may be a constricted constitutional authority, but it is not an absurdity. To broaden the scope of congressional representation in the JBC is tantamount to the inclusion of a subject matter which was not included in the provision as enacted. True to its constitutional mandate, the Court cannot craft and tailor constitutional provisions in order to accommodate all situations no matter how ideal or reasonable the proposed solution may sound. To the exercise of this intrusion, the Court declines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>While it is true that Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution did not explicitly state that the JBC shall be composed of seven members, however, the same is implied in the enumeration of who will be the members thereof. And though it is unnecessary for the JBC composition to be an odd number as no tie-breaker is needed in the preparation of a shortlist since judicial nominees are not decided by a "yes" or "no" vote, still, JBC's membership cannot be increased from seven to eight for it will be a clear violation of the aforesaid constitutional provision. To add another member in the JBC or to increase the representative of Congress to the JBC, the remedy is not judicial but constitutional amendment.<br><br>In sum, this Court will not overthrow <i>Chavez</i> for it is in accord with the constitutional mandate of giving Congress "a representative" in the JBC. In the same manner, the adoption of the rotational scheme will not in any way deprive Congress of its full participation in the JBC for such an arrangement is also in line with that constitutional mandate.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.

In doing so, it weakens Congress itself as a bicameral constitutional department. The subtraction of the critical one (1) vote that determines who gets into the shortlist is achieved by periodically disempowering one (1) chamber. From the time <i>Chavez</i> was promulgated, significant facts have come to light that justifies the abandonment of that precedent.<br><br>We must do so in this case.<br><br>This is a Petition for mandamus and certiorari filed by Representative Reynaldo V. Umali (Representative Umali), current Chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice, questioning the six (6)-month rotational representation arrangement of Congress adopted by the Judicial and Bar Council pursuant to <i>Chavez v.

Petitioner claims that the current arrangement unfairly deprives both chambers of Congress of its full participation in the Judicial and Bar Council.<br><br>An understanding of the process of appointment to the judiciary, especially in its historical context, is important to situate this Court's proper interpretation of the current provisions of the Constitution.<br><br>Before the creation of the Judicial and Bar Council, the power to nominate and appoint members of the judiciary was vested in the executive and legislative branches.<br><br>Title X, Article 80 of the Malolos Constitution provides:<br><blockquote><center>TITLE X <br>The Judicial Power<br></center><br>Article 80. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Solicitor-General shall be chosen by the National Assembly in concurrence with the President of the Republic and the Secretaries of the Government, and shall be absolutely independent of the Legislative and Executive Powers.<br></blockquote>The 1935 Constitution similarly states:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VIII <br>Judicial Department<br></center><br>Section 5. The Members of the Supreme Court and all judges of inferior courts shall be appointed by the President with the consent of the Commission on Appointments.<br></blockquote>The promulgation of the 1973 Constitution, however, vested the chief executive with both executive and legislative powers. Vetting and appointing of members to the judiciary became the sole prerogative of the President:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE X<br>The Judiciary<br></center><br>Section 4. The Members of the Supreme Court and judges of inferior courts shall be appointed by the President.<br></blockquote>Hoping to unshackle the Republic from the abuses of power during Martial Law but at the same time wanting to insulate the process of judicial appointments from partisan politics, the 1986 Constitutional Commission, through Commissioner Roberto Concepcion, proposed the creation of an independent body that would vet potential appointees to the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This body would be represented by the different stakeholders of the legal sector and would have the mandate of preparing the list of potential judicial appointees to be submitted to the President. The proposal became what is now the Judicial and Bar Council. Article VIII, Section 8 of the Constitution now provides:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE VIII<br>Judicial Department<br></div><br>. . . .<br><br>Section 8. (1) A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created under the supervision of the Supreme Court composed of the Chief Justice as <i>ex officio</i> Chairman, the Secretary of Justice, and a representative of the Congress as <i>ex officio</i> Members, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired Member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector.<br><br>(2) The regular members of the Council shall be appointed by the President for a term of four years with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. Of the Members first appointed, the representative of the Integrated Bar shall serve for four years, the professor of law for three years, the retired Justice for two years, and the representative of the private sector for one year.<br><br>(3) The Clerk of the Supreme Court shall be the Secretary <i>ex officio</i> of the Council and shall keep a record of its proceedings.<br><br>(4) The regular Members of the Council shall receive such emoluments as may be determined by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court shall provide in its annual budget the appropriations for the Council.<br><br>(5) The Council shall have the principal function of recommending appointees to the Judiciary. It may exercise such other functions and duties as the Supreme Court may assign to it.<br></blockquote>Based on their understanding of the provision stating that one (1) of its ex officio members would be "<i>a</i> representative of Congress," both the House of Representatives and Senate sent representatives to the Council. Representative Rogaciano A. Mercado sat as ex officio member from December 10, 1987 to February 23, 1989 while Senator Wigberto E. Tañada sat as ex officio member from March 2, 1988 to May 21, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In a previous case, however, this Court stated that membership in the Council would be altered only in 1994, stating that before then, the House of Representatives and the Senate would alternate its representation:<br><blockquote>[F]rom the moment of the creation of the JBC, [Congress] designated one representative to sit in the JBC to act as one of the <i>ex officio</i> members. Perhaps in order to give equal opportunity to both houses to sit in the exclusive body, the House of Representatives and the Senate would send alternate representatives to the JBC. In other words, Congress had only one (1) representative.<br><br>In 1994, the composition of the JBC was substantially altered. Instead of having only seven (7) members, an eighth (8th) member was added to the JBC as two (2) representatives from Congress began sitting in the JBC—one from the House of Representatives and one from the Senate, with each having one-half (1/2) of a vote. Then, curiously, the JBC En Banc, in separate meetings held in 2000 and 2001, decided to allow the representatives from the Senate and the House of Representatives one full vote each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The practice of giving each member of Congress one (1) full vote was questioned in 2012 in <i>Chavez v.

They decided that the representation would be on a rotation basis. For the first six (6) months, Senator Pimentel would be the one to represent both Houses of Congress; and for the next six (6) months, it would be he. In the absence of Senator Pimentel, Congressman Tupas will automatically attend the meetings, and vice versa. He cautioned that since it is quite difficult for both Houses to come up with an agreement, it would not be good to assume that whenever the Senate President or the Speaker of the House writes the JBC, it is the decision of Congress. It should be a communication from both Houses. He then requested that he be furnished with copies of all notices from the JBC even during the term of Senator Pimentel.<br><br>Chief Justice Sereno clarified that she received the Letter of Senate President Drilon stating, among other things, that the Speaker of the House and the Senate President agreed that Senator Pimentel would be the one to represent Congress until December 31, 2013, but that in his absence it would be Congressman Tupas. She assured both Congressman Tupas and Senator Pimentel that they will both receive copies of all notices and information that are being circulated among the JBC Members.

The definition of legal standing is settled:<br><blockquote>Locus standi is defined as "a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question." In private suits, standing is governed by the "real-parties-in interest" rule as contained in Section 2, Rule 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended. It provides that "every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest." Accordingly, the "real-party-in interest" is "the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit or the party entitled to the avails of the suit." Succinctly put, the plaintiff's standing is based on his own right to the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent contends that petitioner has no standing to file this case absent a resolution from the House of Representatives authorizing him to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> It anchors its argument on <i>Philippine Constitutional Association v.

No. 113174 was filed by 16 Senators, including the Senate President and the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, the suit was not authorized by the Senate itself. Likewise, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 113766 and 113888 were filed without an enabling resolution for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent, however, failed to read the entirety of the quoted portion. In <i>Philippine Constitutional Association</i>, the procedural issue on standing was whether Senators could question a presidential veto on an appropriations bill despite the absence of a Senate resolution authorizing them to file the case. This Court, in addressing the issue, first acknowledged that previous decisions have required Senators to first submit a Senate resolution authorizing the filing of the case. Nevertheless, this Court ruled that members of Congress have standing to question any action that impairs the Congress' powers and privileges, regardless of whether there was a prior Congressional resolution:<br><blockquote>The legal standing of the Senate, as an institution, was recognized in <i>Gonzales v. Macaraig, Jr.</i> . . . In said case, 23 Senators, comprising the entire membership of the Upper House of Congress, filed a petition to nullify the presidential veto of Section 55 of the GAA of 1989. The filing of the suit was authorized by Senate Resolution No. 381, adopted on February 2, 1989, and which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Authorizing and Directing the Committee on Finance to Bring in the Name of the Senate of the Philippines the Proper Suit with the Supreme Court of the Philippines contesting the Constitutionality of the Veto by the President of Special and General Provisions, particularly Section 55, of the General Appropriation Bill of 1989 (H.B. No. 19186) and For Other Purposes.<br></blockquote>In the United States, the legal standing of a House of Congress to sue has been recognized . . .<br><br>While the petition in G.R. No. 113174 was filed by 16 Senators, including the Senate President and the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, the suit was not authorized by the Senate itself. Likewise, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 113766 and 113888 were filed without an enabling resolution for the purpose.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>We rule that a member of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives for that matter, has the legal standing to question the validity of a presidential veto or a condition imposed on an item in an appropriation bill.<br><br>Where the veto is claimed to have been made without or in excess of the authority vested on the President by the Constitution, the issue of an impermissible intrusion of the Executive into the domain of the Legislature arises . . .<br><br><i>To the extent the powers of Congress are impaired, so is the power of each member thereof, since his office confers a right to participate in the exercise of the powers of that institution</i> . . .<br><br>An act of the Executive which injures the institution of Congress causes a derivative but nonetheless substantial injury, which can be questioned by a member of Congress . . . In such a case, any member of Congress can have a resort to the courts.<br><br>Former Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, as Amicus Curiae, noted[:]<br><blockquote>This is, then, the clearest case of the Senate as a whole or individual Senators as such having substantial interest in the question at issue. It could likewise be said that there was requisite injury to their rights as Senators. It would then be futile to raise any locus standi issue. Any intrusion into the domain appertaining to the Senate is to be resisted. Similarly, if the situation were reversed, and it is the Executive Branch that could allege a transgression, its officials could likewise file the corresponding action. What cannot be denied is that a Senator has standing to maintain inviolate the prerogatives, powers and privileges vested by the Constitution in his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Every member of Congress has standing to question acts which affect the powers, prerogatives, and privileges of Congress. In <i>Pimentel v. Executive Secretary</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><blockquote>As regards Senator Pimentel, it has been held that "to the extent the powers of Congress are impaired, so is the power of each member thereof, since his office confers a right to participate in the exercise of the powers of that institution." Thus, <i>legislators have the standing to maintain inviolate the prerogatives, powers and privileges vested by the Constitution in their office and are allowed to sue to question the validity of any official action which they claim infringes their prerogatives as legislators</i>. The petition at bar invokes the power of the Senate to grant or withhold its concurrence to a treaty entered into by the executive branch, in this case, the Rome Statute. The petition seeks to order the executive branch to transmit the copy of the treaty to the Senate to allow it to exercise such authority. Senator Pimentel, as member of the institution, certainly has the legal standing to assert such authority of the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, petitioner, as a member of Congress and the Chair of the House Committee on Justice, alleges that the rotational representation arrangement adopted by respondent Judicial and Bar Council impairs the prerogative of Congress to have full representation within the Council.

It then becomes the duty of this Court to abandon that decision:<br><blockquote>The principle of <i>stare decisis</i> does not mean blind adherence to precedents. The doctrine or rule laid down, which has been followed for years, no matter how sound it may be, if found to be contrary to law, must be abandoned. The principle of <i>stare decisis</i> does not and should not apply when there is conflict between the precedent and the law. The duty of this Court is to forsake and abandon any doctrine or rule found to be in violation of the law in force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br></blockquote>Similarly, in <i>De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><blockquote>The Court, as the highest court of the land, may be guided but is not controlled by precedent. Thus, the Court, especially with a new membership, is not obliged to follow blindly a particular decision that it determines, after re-examination, to call for a rectification. The adherence to precedents is strict and rigid in a common-law setting like the United Kingdom, where judges make law as binding as an Act of Parliament. But ours is not a common-law system; hence, judicial precedents are not always strictly and rigidly followed. A judicial pronouncement in an earlier decision may be followed as a precedent in a subsequent case only when its reasoning and justification are relevant, and the court in the latter case accepts such reasoning and justification to be applicable to the case. The application of the precedent is for the sake of convenience and stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Whenever this Court renders its decisions, the intended effects of those decisions to future cases are taken into consideration. The changing membership of the bench likewise contributes to the evolution of this Court's stand on certain issues and cases. Ruling by precedent, thus, requires more than a mechanical application:<br><blockquote>[T]he use of precedents is never mechanical.<br><br>Some assumptions normally creep into the facts established for past cases. These assumptions may later on prove to be inaccurate or to be accurate only for a given historical period. Sometimes, the effects assumed by justices who decide past cases do not necessarily happen. Assumed effects are given primacy whenever the spirit or intent of the law is considered in the interpretation of a legal provision. Some aspect of the facts or the context of these facts would not have been fully considered. It is also possible that doctrines in other aspects of the law related to a precedent may have also evolved.<br><br>In such cases, the use of precedents will unduly burden the parties or produce absurd or unworkable outcomes. Precedents will not be useful to achieve the purposes for which the law would have been passed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>There is also a need to abandon decisions "when this Court discerns, after full deliberation, that a continuing error in the interpretation of the spirit and intent of a constitutional provision exists."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Assuring the public of stability in the law and certainty of court actions is important. It is, however, more important for this Court to be right. Thus, it becomes imperative for this Court to re-examine previous decisions to avoid continuing its error:<br><blockquote>The rule of stare decisis is entitled to respect. Stability in the law . . . is desirable. But idolatrous reverence for precedent, simply as precedent, no longer rules. More important than anything else is that the court should be right. And particularly is it not wise to subordinate legal reason to case law and by so doing perpetuate error when it is brought to mind that the views now expressed conform in principle to the original decision and that since the first decision to the contrary was sent forth there has existed a respectable opinion of non-conformity in the court. Indeed, on at least one occasion has the court broken away from the revamped doctrine, while even in the last case in point the court was as evenly divided as it was possible to be and still reach a decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Chavez v.

A relevant portion of the <i>Chavez</i>'s, fallo states:<br><blockquote>The Judicial and Bar Council is hereby enjoined to reconstitute itself so that only one (1) member of Congress will sit as a representative in its proceedings, in accordance with Section 8 (1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br></blockquote>The method of reconstitution was left to the discretion of the Judicial and Bar Council, in recognition of its status as an independent constitutional body. The Council, in turn, implemented <i>Chavez</i> by requiring that Congress provide it with only one (1) representative. In the July 23, 2013 En Banc Meeting, Representative Tupas relayed the instructions of the House of Representatives. Then Senate President Drilon sent the instructions of the Senate through a letter to the Chief Justice. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives did not offer any other type of representation that may have been agreed upon. The Council, therefore, was merely complying with the directive in <i>Chavez</i>. In <i>De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><blockquote>Judicial decisions assume the same authority as a statute itself and, until authoritatively abandoned, necessarily become, to the extent that they are applicable, the criteria that must control the actuations, not only of those called upon to abide by them, but also of those duty-bound to enforce obedience to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br></blockquote>These events, however, highlight the inevitable difficulty in implementing <i>Chavez's</i> interpretation of Article VIII, Section 8(1). There is no one (1) office in Congress that could provide the Council with one (1) representative. The Council has no authority to order Congress to jointly convene for the determination of its sole representative. Thus, the Council would only be able to implement what is practicable, that is, whatever arrangement the Congressional representatives may have agreed upon. Considering that the Congressional representatives have not yet manifested to the Council that it was considering another type of arrangement, the Council could not have been faulted for refusing to count petitioner's votes at a time when Senate was representing Congress in the Council.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General likewise requests that this Court take up the matter of rotational representation in the review of the Council's rules in <i>Aguinaldo v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>In <i>Aguinaldo</i>, the new rules and practices of the Judicial and Bar Council were docketed as a separate administrative matter to be discussed at a future time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>This case, however, is a matter of constitutional interpretation. There is, thus, no need to direct the Judicial and Bar Council to review its own rules to allow for the interpretation of this constitutional provision.<br><br><center><b>VI</b><br></center><br>The Judicial and Bar Council could have been compelled by a writ of mandamus to count petitioner's votes in the En Banc sessions of December 2 and 9, 2016.<br><br>Mandamus is provided for under Rule 65, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Petition for Mandamus. - When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br></blockquote>Mandamus may issue to compel the performance of a ministerial duty. It cannot be issued to compel the performance of a discretionary act. In <i>Metro Manila Development Authority v. Concerned Residents of Manila Bay</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br><blockquote>Generally, the writ of mandamus lies to require the execution of a ministerial duty. A ministerial duty is one that "requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment." It connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person executing it. It is a "simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist and imposed by law." Mandamus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involving discretion, but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion one way or the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The difference between a discretionary act and a ministerial act is settled:<br><blockquote>The distinction between a ministerial and discretionary act is well delineated. A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The determination of the qualifications and fitness of judicial applicants is discretionary on the part of the Judicial and Bar Council.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> A writ of mandamus cannot be issued to compel the council to withdraw a list originally submitted and to add other nominees that have not previously qualified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br><i>De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> however, states that a writ of mandamus may be issued to compel the Council to comply with its constitutional mandate to submit a list of nominees to the President before the 90-day period to appoint:<br><blockquote>The duty of the JBC to submit a list of nominees before the start of the President's mandatory 90-day period to appoint is ministerial, but its selection of the candidates whose names will be in the list to be submitted to the President lies within the discretion of the JBC. The object of the petitions for mandamus herein should only refer to the duty to submit to the President the list of nominees for every vacancy in the Judiciary, because in order to constitute unlawful neglect of duty, there must be an unjustified delay in performing that duty. For mandamus to lie against the JBC, therefore, there should be an unexplained delay on its part in recommending nominees to the Judiciary, that is, in submitting the list to the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Judicial and Bar Council has the ministerial duty to count the votes of <i>all</i> its members. Petitioner, as the Chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice, should be considered a regular ex officio member of the Council, and his votes in the December 2 and 9, 2016 En Banc Meetings should have been counted. This relief, however, has already become moot in light of the recent appointments to this Court. In future deliberations, however, the Judicial and Bar Council should have the ministerial duty to separately count the votes of both Congressional representatives in the Council.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Petition.
