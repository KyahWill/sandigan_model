				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a Petition for Review on<em> Certiorari </em>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA upheld the validity of the assailed Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 42, City of San 
Fernando, Pampanga. The RTC denied the motion of NSC Holdings (Phils.) 
Inc. (NSC) to revise the approved rehabilitation plan.
  <p align="center"><strong> THE ANTECEDENT FACTS</strong>
  </p><p> Trust International Paper Corporation (TIPCO) is a pulp and 
paper manufacturing company organized and existing under the laws of the
 Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 29 July 2005, TIPCO filed a "Petition for Corporate Rehabilitation with Prayer for Suspension of Payments"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> before the RTC.</p><p>
 The trial court subsequently issued a Stay Order directing, among 
others, the appointment of respondent Atty. Monico Jacob as the 
rehabilitation receiver (Receiver).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p><p>NSC filed its "Comment with Motion,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>alleging
 that certain receivables, as well as the authority to collect payments 
for these receivables, were being held by TIPCO for and on behalf of NSC
 as its agent. This was pursuant to a Trade Receivables Purchase and 
Sale Agreement (TRPSA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> entered into by both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p><p> NSC claimed that under the TRPSA, it entered into a 
Certificate of Assignment with TIPCO. In that agreement, the latter sold
 and assigned receivables to NSC in the total amount of P155,380,590.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 There was supposedly a stipulation therein designating TIPCO as 
servicing agent with the obligation to enforce the rights and interests 
of NSC over the purchased receivables, as well as to hold the 
collections in trust for the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>
 In light of the TRPSA, NSC claimed that it was a trustor, not a 
creditor, of TIPCO. As such, it moved that TIPCO be directed to 
segregate the receivables held by the latter on behalf of NSC. These 
receivables would thereby be excluded from TIPCO's list of assets and 
payables that would be subject to the rehabilitation plan. NSC likewise 
prayed that TIPCO be ordered to directly remit any collection or payment
 to the former as soon as practicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> During the initial hearing, the Court summarily heard NSC's contentions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> as well as TIPCO's counter-argument that the true agreement was really one of a loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Afterwards, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 holding that both parties had "agreed to submit the issue that 
receivables transferred to NSC should not be included as TIPCO's assets 
for the resolution of the Court-appointed Rehabilitation Receiver, 
subject to the Court's approval."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p>
 On 20 January 2006, the Receiver submitted to the RTC his "Evaluation 
and Recommendation Report" (Report) which addressed NSC's contentions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He stated therein that after a review of the documents, he found that NSC was an unsecured creditor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and that the receivables were covered by the rehabilitation plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p><em><strong> First Order</strong></em>
  </p><p> Through an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 dated 31 January 2006 (First Order), the RTC approved TIPCO's proposed 
rehabilitation plan as amended and modified by the "Evaluation and 
Recommendation Report."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> NSC received a copy of the Order on 9 February 2006.</p><p>
 On 2 February 2006, unaware that the RTC had already approved the 
proposed rehabilitation plan in the First Order, NSC filed a Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 praying for the suspension of the approval of the plan. In this Motion,
 it claimed that it had called the Receiver's attention to the fact that
 the Report lacked legal and factual basis insofar as its claim was 
concerned. NSC alleged that, as a result, the Receiver manifested at the
 hearing on 23 January 2006 that he was amenable to a further discussion
 of its claim and subsequently submitting his report thereon to the 
trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  </p><p><em><strong> Second Order  </strong></em>
  </p><p> The RTC then issued an Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 dated 21 February 2006 (Second Order), which treated NSC's prior Motion
 as a motion for reconsideration. Consequently, it denied the Motion for
 being a prohibited pleading. Nevertheless, it directed the Receiver to 
comment on the nature of NSC's claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
  </p><p> Meanwhile, prior to its receipt of the Second Order but after 
it had finally received a copy of the First Order, NSC filed another 
Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It stated therein 
that it had received the First Order and held a meeting with the 
Receiver. It then reiterated its contentions and asked that the Receiver
 be directed to submit its report. By that submission, NSC sought the 
resolution of its claims and the revision of the approved rehabilitation
 plan.</p><p> The Receiver filed a "Manifestation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 stating that he had a meeting with the parties' respective counsels on 7
 February 2006. In that meeting, the parties insisted on their 
respective positions with respect to the nature of TIPCO's obligation to
 NSC. Both counsels exhibited pieces of documentary evidence to support 
their respective allegations.
  </p><p> The Receiver rendered the opinion that the issue raised in 
that meeting needed to be litigated separately, as to make a 
recommendation thereon was not 	within his competence. He also said that
 the approval of the rehabilitation plan need not be affected, 
particularly since the plan also called for the payment of TIPCO's 
obligation to NSC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
  </p><p><em><strong> Third Order</strong></em>
  </p><p> The RTC agreed with the Receiver's recommendations in its assailed Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated 9 March 2006 (Third Order), in which it held as follows: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The court finds the Receiver's position, namely, that the issues
 involved would require a full blown litigation, justified. Considering 
the seriousness of the issues and the legal implications of a resolution
 thereon, the Court rules that it is not within the competence of a 
Rehabilitation Receiver to adjudicate and resolve the said issues.</p>
    <p> xxxx</p>
    <p> Considering that the rehabilitation plan calls for the payment 
of the obligations of petitioner to NSC, the implementation of the 
rehabilitation plan shall not be suspended because of the pendency of 
this issue. xxx While the parties may decide to elevate the matter for 
determination in an appropriate court, the rehabilitation plan shall 
continue to be implemented without prejudice to a final and executory 
decision on such issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Aggrieved, petitioner NSC appealed the Third Order before the CA. 
The former argued that there was no legal or jurisprudential basis for 
the RTC's ruling that the Receiver was not competent to determine 
whether the receivables should be excluded from TIPCO's assets. 
Petitioner further alleged that it was not a creditor of TIPCO, since 
the latter merely held the purchased receivables in trust as evidence by
 the TRPSA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p> The CA dismissed NSC's appeal and affirmed the Third Order<em> in toto</em>.
 According to the appellate court, petitioner essentially moved to amend
 the approved rehabilitation plan in the latter's petition. Hence, 
petitioner should have appealed the First, and not the Third Order of 
the RTC, as it was the First Order that had approved the rehabilitation 
plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The failure to 
appeal the First Order supposedly rendered it final and executory and 
effectively prevented NSC from challenging the recommendations made by 
the Receiver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
  </p><p> For the CA, NSC could no longer insist that the receivables be
 excluded from TIPCO's assets. The appellate court held that this matter
 had already been addressed and resolved by the RTC when the latter 
approved the rehabilitation plan in its First Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> Upon the denial of its Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 NSC is now assailing the CA's ruling before this Court by raising the 
following arguments: (a) the CA erred in holding that the NSC should 
have appealed the First Order; (b) the CA erred in affirming the RTC's 
finding that the matters presented by NSC were beyond the scope of the 
rehabilitation receiver's authority, and; (c) the CA erred in affirming 
the inclusion of NSC as a creditor of TIPCO in the approved 
rehabilitation plan. 
  </p><p align="center"><b>ISSUE</b>  
  </p><p> Given the recital of facts, it is apparent that petitioner's 
Motion subsequent to the First Order was actually a move to modify the 
approved rehabilitation plan. Notably, the Motion of NSC is based on the
 same assertions it presented to the RTC and the Receiver at the start 
of the rehabilitation proceedings. </p><p> Therefore, the threshold 
issue to be resolved is whether or not petitioner could still raise the 
issue before the CA of its inclusion as a creditor in the approved 
rehabilitation plan, considering that the RTC had already resolved this 
issue in the First Order. </p><p align="center"><strong> THE COURT'S RULING </strong>
  </p><p><em> We deny the petition. </em>
  </p><p> The issues raised by petitioner center on its inclusion as a 
creditor in the approved rehabilitation plan. We agree with the CA 
ruling that it was the First, not the Third Order, that should have been
 appealed by NSC; and that the latter's failure to appeal the First 
Order barred it from insisting that it be excluded from the 
rehabilitation plan as a creditor. </p><p> For reasons as follows, the First Order is valid, final, and executory. </p><p><em><strong> NSC is barred from raising before<br> 
    the CA the issue of its inclusion as a <br>
    creditor	m the approved rehabilitation plan. </strong></em>
  </p><p> Certain fundamental principles must be considered. First, a 
court order is final in character if it puts an end to the particular 
matter resolved or definitely settles the matter disposed therein, such 
that no further questions can come before the court except the execution
 of that order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> 
  </p><p>Second, it is an established rule that the perfection of an 
appeal within the period and in the manner prescribed by law is 
jurisdictional. Non­compliance with such legal requirements is fatal and
 has the effect of rendering the judgment final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As explained by this Court in <em>Pascual v. Robles</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The failure to perfect an appeal as required by the rules has 
the effect of defeating the right to appeal of a party and precluding 
the appellate court from acquiring jurisdiction over the case. The right
 to appeal is not a natural right nor a part of due process; it is 
merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the manner 
and in accordance with the provisions of the law. The party who seeks to
 avail of the same must comply with the requirement of the rules. 
Failing to do so, the right to appeal is lost. The reason for rules of 
this nature is because the dispatch of business by courts would be 
impossible, and intolerable delays would result, without rules governing
 practice. Public policy and sound practice demand that judgments of 
courts should become final and irrevocable at some definite date fixed 
by law. Such rules are a necessary incident to the proper, efficient and
 orderly discharge of judicial functions. Thus, we have held 	that 	the 
failure to perfect 	an appeal 	within 	the prescribed reglementary 
period is not a mere technicality, but jurisdictional. Just as a losing 
party has the privilege to file an appeal within the prescribed period, 
so does the winner also have the correlative right to enjoy the finality
 of the decision. Failure to meet the requirements of an appeal deprives
 the appellate court of jurisdiction to entertain any appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In the present case, the RTC in its First Order determined that 
NSC was a creditor whose claims must be paid in accordance with the 
approved rehabilitation plan. It must be emphasized that this 
determination was made after addressing NSC's contentions and TIPCO's 
counter-allegations with respect to the receivables in the initial 
hearing as well as in the Receiver's Report which we find to be 
credible.
  </p><p> It must also be noted that after the initial hearing, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
 stating that both parties had "agreed to submit the issue that 
receivables transferred to NSC should not be included as TIPCO's assets 
for the resolution of the Court-appointed Rehabilitation Receiver, 
subject to the Court's approval."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 Accordingly, the trial court adopted the findings of the Receiver in 
his Report. It approved the inclusion of NSC in the plan as a creditor 
and the payment of the latter's claims over the receivables in 
accordance with the approved rehabilitation plan. Definitely, the RTC 
was able to resolve the issue of the inclusion of NSC as a creditor in 
the plan.  Thus, the latter was wrong in its contention that the First 
Order did not resolve its contentions. On the contrary, it is an order 
that definitely settled the issue.
  </p><p> This makes it a final order with respect to that issue. 
Therefore, pursuant to the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate 
Rehabilitation (Interim Rules),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
 petitioner should have ventilated its discontent with the First Order 
via a Rule 43 petition for review before the CA, and not through a mere 
motion before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> 
However, the records show that NSC failed to file such a petition before
 the CA within 15 days from the former's receipt of the First Order. 
Instead, it filed a motion before the RTC. That motion, however, did not
 stop the First Order from lapsing into finality.</p><p> Clearly, NSC 
availed of the wrong remedy and the issue on its inclusion as a creditor
 in the approved rehabilitation plan has already lapsed into finality. 
Therefore, the CA was correct in denying its appeal. We cannot allow 
petitioner to benefit from its negligence in failing to find out what 
its remedies were and to promptly avail itself of any of them. As ruled 
by the CA, there is no compelling reason for this Court to relax the 
rules on appeal only to accommodate petitioner's contentions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p>
 NSC argues that the First Order was not final insofar as its claims 
were concerned. This contention is based on its allegation that prior to
 the issuance of the First Order, specifically during the hearing held 
on 23 January 2006, the Receiver manifested a willingness to study 
petitioner's contentions further and to submit a report thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 To NSC, this manifestation prior to the issuance of the First Order had
 the effect of explicitly setting aside the issue for study, evaluation,
 and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p>
 Unfortunately, petitioner failed to support this allegation with any 
proof. The records are bereft of any clear indication that the Receiver 
indeed made the alleged manifestation. What is clear from the records is
 that the RTC issued an Order dated 23 January 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 The trial court stated that after holding a hearing on even date and 
listening to the parties' remarks on the Receiver's Report, it 
considered the proposed rehabilitation plan and the Report "submitted 
for approval." Notably, NSC never questioned the latter Order.</p><p> If
 the Receiver indeed made the purported manifestation, NSC should have 
immediately appealed the Order dated 23 January 2006. It should have 
done so upon realizing that the Order did not reflect what it alleged to
 have really happened during that hearing. The allegation, therefore, 
appears to be a mere afterthought. 
  </p><p><em><strong>The Second and the Third Orders did <br>
  not modify or reverse the First Order.  </strong></em>
  </p><p> It cannot be said that it is the Second or Third Orders that should be appealed by petitioner.  
  </p><p> The Second and the Third Orders were acts of the RTC that were
 distinct and separate from the First Order. They did not reverse or 
modify it. Nowhere did the foregoing orders modify the validity, 
content, or immediate enforceability of the First Order or the approved 
rehabilitation plan.  
  </p><p> In view of the foregoing and the finding that petitioner's 
Motion subsequent to the First Order was in reality a motion to revise 
the approved plan, the Third Order had the effect of simply denying 
NSC's Motion and clarifying the First Order. We take note of the fact 
that the RTC did not order the parties to initiate the suggested 
separate action, but left it to their discretion. As the trial court 
pronounced in its Third Order, "[w]hile the parties<strong> may decide</strong>
 to elevate the matter for determination in an appropriate court, the 
rehabilitation plan shall continue to be implemented without prejudice 
to a final and executory decision on such issue." (emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
  </p><p> The terms of the approved rehabilitation plan were therefore 
not conditioned on the results of the separate litigation. The plan 
stands on its own, whether or not a separate action was initiated by the
 parties. Should they opt to initiate such action and a decision be 
issued on the issue, only then will the RTC resolve the effect of the 
decision on the approved rehabilitation plan. Until then, the matter 
remains beyond the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.</p><p>NSC would
 have us believe that what the RTC granted with one hand, it denied with
 the other. The fact remains, however, that the approved rehabilitation 
plan, uncontested, is the final will of the trial court.
  </p><p> </p><p> <b><i>The motion to revise the <br>
    rehabilitation 	plan was 	<br>
    properly denied by the RTC.</i></b> 
  </p><p> In view of our conclusion that the Third Order was essentially
 a denial of NSC's motion to revise the approved rehabilitation plan, we
 find this course of action to be in line with the law. The motion to 
revise the plan had no basis in law.
  </p><p> Section 26 of the Interim Rules allows the modification and 
alteration of the approved rehabilitation plan, if these steps are 
necessary to achieve the desired targets or goals set forth therein. As 
explained by this Court in <em>Victorio-Aquino v. Pacific Plans</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 the Interim Rules allow the modification of the plan, precisely because
 of conditions that may supervene or affect its implementation 
subsequent to its approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>
  </p><p> In this case, NSC based its motion to revise the approved plan
 on its persistent contention that it was a trustor, not a creditor, of 
TIPCO. However, this contention is not a supervening event that warrants
 the modification of the rehabilitation plan under Section 26 of the 
Interim Rules. The facts clearly show that this issue was raised at the 
start of the rehabilitation proceedings, considered by the Receiver in 
his Report, and accordingly resolved by the RTC in its First Order as 
extensively discussed above. Therefore, petitioner's contention could 
not have been a supervening matter that arose only after the approval of
 the rehabilitation plan and would thereby affect its implementation. As
 discussed above, it was a matter that should have been timely raised 
before the CA via a Rule 43 Petition for Review. Hence, the denial of 
the motion to revise was proper.</p><p> In view of the foregoing conclusion, we find no need to resolve the other issues raised.
  </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition for Review on<em> Certiorari </em>under Rule 45 is<strong> DENIED</strong> for lack of merit.
