The various audits conducted confirmed the fact of overpricing as follows:<br><blockquote>To make things worse, it was also indubitably established that aside from the fact that there was no public bidding conducted, the accused overpriced the construction supplies and materials in the amount of P512,967.69, to the disadvantage and prejudice of the government (Exhibits "C", "C-1", "D", "D-1", "D-2", "D-3", "D-3-a").<br><br>In the case at bar, there being no public bidding conducted, the government was deprived of setting the standard or parameter upon which to lay the basis of what may be considered just or reasonable prices of the purchases made from the lone supplier.

Hence, the manifest or gross disadvantage complained of is not purely speculative or that it has no basis in fact and in law because the same have been quantified by the overpriced purchases.
