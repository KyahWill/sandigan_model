				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 24, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 05752, which affirmed with modification the Consolidated Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 16, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) of Legazpi City, Albay, Branch 8, finding accused-appellant Salvador Aycardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, (<i>RPC</i>) as amended, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0272, and Qualified Rape under Art. 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the RPC, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0273.<br><br>Accused-appellant Salvador Aycardo was initially charged in two (2) separate Informations dated July 7, 2008 with the crimes of Rape as defined under Article 266-A, par. 2 in relation to par. 1(d) of the RPC, and Rape as defined under Article 266-A, par. 1(d) thereof. Later on, the said charges against Aycardo were amended. The accusatory portions of the Amended Informations dated December 2, 2008 read:<br><blockquote><center><u>Criminal Case No. FC-08-0272</u><br></center><br>That sometime in the evening of September 2007, at Barangay Tinapian, of the Municipality of Manito, Province of Albay, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, <u>an adult, taking advantage of his influence being the uncle and relative by affinity within the 3</u><sup>rd</sup><u> civil degree of [AAA]</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><u> as well as the tender age of the said [AAA]</u>, with lewd and unchaste design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously committed an act of sexual assault by inserting his finger into the genital orifice <u>upon the person of the said minor [AAA], an eleven (11) year old girl, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice</u>.<br><br>ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center><u>Criminal Case No. FC-08-0273</u><br></center><br>That sometime in the evening of September, 2007, at Barangay Tinapian, of the Municipality of Manito, Province of Albay, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, <u>an adult, taking advantage of his influence being the uncle and relative by affinity within the 3</u><sup>rd</sup><u> civil degree of [AAA] as well as the tender age of the said [AAA]</u>, with lewd and unchaste design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge upon the person of said minor [AAA], <u>an eleven (11) year old girl</u>, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, Aycardo, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded "not guilty" to both charges. After the pre-trial conference was terminated, a joint trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented three (3) witnesses, namely: AAA, the victim; BBB, her mother; and Dr. James M. Belgira, a forensic physician and Medical Officer of the Philippine National Police Forensic Service, who conducted the medical examination on AAA. The facts established by the conducted the medical examination on AAA. The facts established by the evidence of the prosecution, as summed up by the CA, are as follows:<br><blockquote>In 2007, private complainant AAA, then 11 years old, was residing in Manito, Albay, at the house of her Tiya Tess and the latter's husband "Tiyu Buddy," herein accused-appellant, as AAA's mother, BBB, who was based in Batangas, entrusted her to Tiya Tess, BBB's sister.<br><br>Sometime in September 2007, at around one o'clock in the afternoon, AAA was in a room inside the house of accused-appellant, when the latter entered, attempted to remove her shorts and panties and tried to insert his finger into her vagina. Accused-appellant failed to undress AAA because she resisted his advances, but accused-appellant was able to touch her vagina with his finger. AAA then ran to the house of her cousin Joy. Later in the evening that same day, accused-appellant came by to fetch her, telling her she needed to prepare his and Tiya Tess' meal. AAA yielded and returned to accused-appellant's house.<br><br>Back at accused-appellant's house, AAA prepared supper as instructed and had dinner with accused-appellant and his son Bongbong, his (sic) cousin. After supper, AAA sought accused-appellant's permission to spend the night at the house of Tiya Ening (another sister of her mother) but accused-appellant denied her request. As told, AAA just went to the sala to watch TV, and thereafter, slept on a mat where Bongbong lay between her and accused-appellant. In the middle of the night, AAA was roused from her sleep when she felt somebody removing her panties and shorts, who turned out to be accused-appellant. AAA resisted but accused-appellant told her he would do it slowly. Accused-appellant then undressed and inserted his penis into her vagina. Gripped with fear, she just wept, with accused-appellant warning to kill her if she tells anyone of the incident.<br><br>On 26 March 2008, while sleeping with her mother BBB, AAA yelled in her sleep "Enough Tiyo Buddy! I do not want anymore!" Alarmed, BBB immediately asked the latter why she mentioned accused-appellant's name in her dream, but AAA did not respond. The following day, or on 27 March 2008, BBB again asked AAA why the latter uttered accused-appellant's name in her dream and this time, AAA told BBB that accused-appellant had raped her.<br><br>BBB and AAA reported the incident to the barangay then to the police station, after which she was medically examined by forensic physician Dr. James M. Belgira. Dr. Belgira's examination (Medico-Legal Report No. MLB-34-08) revealed the following:<br><blockquote>GENITAL:<br><br>There is absence of growth of pubic hair. The labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with the dark brown labia minor presenting in between. On separating the same disclosed a <b>markedly dilated</b> and redundant fleshy type <b>hymen</b>. The posterior fourchette is sharp. The external vaginal orifice offers strong resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger. The vaginal canal is narrow with prominent rugosities. The cervix is firm and closed.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br><b>Findings show clear sign of blunt vaginal penetrating trauma.</b><br><br>There are no extra genital signs of application of any form of physical trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>To substantiate its claims of denial and <i>alibi</i>, on the other hand, the defense presented as witnesses Aycardo himself and Odilon Trilles, the barangay captain of Tinapian, Manito, Albay.The facts established by the evidence of the defense, as stated by the CA, are as follows:<br><blockquote>Accused-appellant is engaged in handicrafts and farming. He works at the farm owned by his wife in Tinapian, Manito, Albay. He knows AAA to be the daughter of his wife's sister who is also from Tinapian, Manito, Albay. AAA lives with her mother at a place which is 100 meters away from his house. In September 2007, he accompanied his wife on three occasions to his sister's house to treat AAA. He denied AAA to have worked in his house as a helper in September 2007 and further denied to have raped her during at the (sic) time. Accused-appellant testified that he only learned of the case when he was arrested at the police station to inquire about the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>After trial, the RTC convicted appellant&nbsp;of the crimes of Acts of Lasciviousness and Qualified Rape. The dispositive portion of the RTC Consolidated Judgment dated July 16, 2012 states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0272, this Court finds accused Salvador Aycardo <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness defined and penalized under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance alleged and proved, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, this Court imposes upon him a penalty of six months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four years and two months of <i><i>prision correccional</i></i>, as maximum.<br><br>Likewise, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0273, this Court finds accused Salvador Aycardo <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined under Article 266-A 1(d) and penalized under Article 266-B thereof. The qualifying circumstances of the victim's minority and her relationship with the accused as the latter's relative by affinity within the 3<sup>rd</sup> degree being properly alleged in the information and proven during the trial, this Court, in view of Republic Act No. 9346 which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i><i>reclusion perpetua</i></i> without eligibility for parole. Accused is likewise ordered to pay the victim [AAA] the amount of Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the further sum of Php25,000.00 as exemplary damages plus costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>With respect to the first charge, the RTC held that since Aycardo was not actually able to insert his finger inside AAA's vagina, he cannot be convicted of the crime of rape by sexual assault. Still, he can be convicted of acts of lasciviousness, because it is necessarily included in the offense charged in the first Information, and it was proved in court. The RTC noted that, while appellant failed to insert his finger inside AAA's vagina, he was nonetheless able to touch the same, thereby consummating the crime of acts of lasciviousness.<br><br>As to the second charge, the RTC found that the prosecution successfully proved the elements of statutory rape, qualified by the circumstances of relationship and minority under Article 266-B of the RPC, namely: that Aycardo, a relative by affinity within the 3<sup>rd</sup> civil degree, had carnal knowledge of his niece, AAA, a child below 12 years of age. The RTC also ruled that Aycardo's self-serving denial cannot prevail over AAA's positive, straightforward, and credible testimony, which was supported by the medico-legal findings of markedly dilated hymen and blunt vaginal penetrating trauma.<br><br>Aggrieved by the RTC decision, Aycardo filed an appeal before the CA, arguing that the RTC gravely erred in convicting him of the crimes of Acts of Lasciviousness and Rape, despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated April 24, 2014, the CA affirmed with modification the Consolidated Judgment of the RTC, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Consolidated Judgment dated 16 July 2012 of Branch 8, Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Albay, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> but with <b>MODIFICATION</b> to read as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0272, this Court finds the accused Salvador Aycardo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness defined and penalized under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance alleged and proved, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, this Court imposes upon him a penalty of six months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four years and two months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum. <b>Accused is also ordered to pay the victim (AAA) the amount of Php20,000.00, as civil indemnity and Php15,000.00 as moral damages.</b><br><br>Likewise, in Criminal Case No. FC-08-0273, this Court finds accused Salvador Aycardo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined under Article 266-A par. 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code and penalized under Article 266-B thereof. The qualifying circumstances of the victim's minority and her relationship with the accused as the latter's relative by affinity within the 3<sup>rd</sup> degree being properly alleged in the Information and proven during the trial, this Court, in view of Republic Act No. 9346 which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole. Accused is likewise ordered to pay the victim (AAA) the amount of seventy-five thousand (Php75,000.00) pesos as civil indemnity, <b>seventy-five thousand (Php75,000.00) pesos</b> as moral damages and to pay the further sum of <b>thirty thousand (Php30,000.00) pesos</b> as exemplary damages plus costs. <b>The victim is also entitled to an interest on all damages awarded at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this judgment.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Citing Section 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Rule 120 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the CA agreed with the RTC that while Aycardo may not be convicted of the charge of rape by sexual assault, he may still be held liable for acts of lasciviousness, because such crime is necessarily included in the said rape charge which was duly proved in court. The CA gave credence to the testimony of AAA that Aycardo failed in his attempt to remove her shorts and underwear, but was still able to touch her vagina with his finger. Contrary to Aycardo's contention, the CA ruled that AAA's belated disclosure of sexual abuse, as well as her act of returning to his house, do not weaken or discredit her straightforward testimony. The CA stressed that the delay in reporting of such abuse does not imply that the charge is untrue, because the victim may prefer to bear the ignominy of pain in silence rather than reveal her harrowing experience to the shame of the world. Besides, AAA did not have much choice but to return to Aycardo's house, since she was then residing therein and was dependent on him for support.<br><br>Dissatisfied with the CA Decision, Aycardo filed a notice of appeal. In compliance with the Court's Resolution dated June 22, 2015, notifying the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, both Aycardo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and the Office of the Solicitor General<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (OSG) manifested that they will no longer file such briefs, considering that they have argued exhaustively all the relevant issues in their respective appeal briefs.<br><br>In the Appellant's Brief, Aycardo argued that AAA's behavior after the alleged first sexual assault in September 2007 was inconsistent with the crime of acts of lasciviousness. He pointed out that AAA testified clearly that his finger was never inserted into her vagina, and that he only tried or attempted to remove her shorts and panties, but was unable to do so because she resisted his indecent act. He claimed that AAA's conduct after the alleged first act of sexual abuse negates the possibility that he committed the second rape charge against him. He noted that despite AAA's claim that she ran to the house of her cousin, Joy, to seek refuge, she failed to tell anybody what he supposedly did to her. He found it perplexing that she still went with him when he fetched her from Joy's house in the evening of the same day when he allegedly abused her. He also observed that AAA was too nonchalant about her first harrowing experience, considering that when they arrived home, she immediately prepared food, ate dinner with him and his son, Bongbong, prepared the bed, watched television and slept with Bongbong beside her.<br><br>Aycardo further contended that he cannot be convicted of rape because AAA's testimony shows that his private part touched her vagina slightly only; thus, it did not enter the <i>labia</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> of the female organ. He also noted that the forensic physician who examined AAA did not clearly say that it was his penis, which caused the findings in the medico-legal report that showed that there is a markedly dilated and redundant flesh-type hymen and a sign of blunt vaginal penetrating trauma. He then stressed that no laceration was found on AAA's vagina, and that her medical examination was conducted six (6) months after the alleged sexual abuse, hence, the possibility that she had sexual experience with someone else cannot be discounted. Finally, he posited that it is incredible that the alleged rape incident would go unnoticed by Bongbong, considering the close proximity between them while they were sleeping, which would have easily roused the latter from his sleep.<br><br>In the Appellee's Brief, the OSG argued that Aycardo's guilt for the crimes of Qualified Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness were proved beyond reasonable doubt. It also rejected as inherently weak his defenses of denial and <i>alibi</i> that he was staying in Batangas in September 2007.<br><br>The appeal lacks merit, but a modification of the penalty imposed and the damages awarded, is in order.<br><br>It is well settled that in criminal cases, an examination of the entire records of a case may be explored for the purpose of arriving at a correct conclusion, as an appeal in criminal cases throws the whole case open for review, it being the duty of the appellate court to correct such error as may be found in the judgment appealed from, whether they are made the subject of the assignment of errors or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> After a careful review of the records, the Court finds no cogent reason to depart from the findings of both the RTC and the CA that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes of Acts of Lasciviousness and Qualified Rape.<br><br>With respect to Criminal Case No. FC-08-0272, both the RTC and the CA ruled correctly that Aycardo cannot be convicted of the charge of rape by sexual assault, as he was unable to insert his finger inside AAA's vagina, but he can still be convicted of acts of lasciviousness because its elements are necessarily included in the offense charged, and were proved in court. The rulings of the RTC and the CA are consistent with Section 4, in relation to Section 5, of Rule 120 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure which provide for the "variance doctrine," <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof</i>. - When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.<br><br>SEC. 5. <i>When an offense includes or is included in another</i>. - An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter. And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former continue or form part of those constituting the latter.<br></blockquote>In <i>Navarrete v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court noted that, under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> when the victim is under 12 years old, the accused shall be prosecuted under either Article 335 (for rape) or Article 336 (for acts of lasciviousness) of the RPC. Accordingly, although an accused is charged in the information with the crime of statutory rape (<i>i.e.</i>, carnal knowledge of a woman under twelve years of age), the offender can be convicted of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness, which is included in rape.<br><br>In <i>People v. Bon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court ruled that even if the statutory rape charge against the accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt, he can still be held liable for the crime of acts of lasciviousness, as defined and penalized under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to R.A. No. 7610, since all the elements of this offense were established. It cannot, therefore, be successfully argued that the accused's constitutionally-protected right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him was violated when he was found guilty under Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Applying the variance doctrine to this case, Aycardo, who was charged with one (1) count of rape by sexual assault, can still be convicted of acts of lasciviousness under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 even though he was unable to insert his finger into the victim's vagina, because the prosecution has proved that he intentionally touched the same -an act which is deemed a lascivious conduct.<br><br>Acts of lasciviousness committed against a child<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> is defined and penalized under Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(b) <b>Those who commit</b> the act of sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct with a child</b> exploited in prostitution <b>or subject to other sexual abuse</b>; Provided, That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 punishes sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct not only with a child exploited in prostitution, but also with a child subjected to other sexual abuses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It covers not only a situation where a child is abused for profit, but also where one — through coercion, intimidation or influence — engages in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child. Thus, a child is deemed subjected to other sexual abuse when he or she indulges in lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In <i>Quimvel vs. People of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (<i>Quimvel</i>), the Court held that it is immaterial whether or not the accused himself employed the coercion or influence to subdue the will of the child for the latter to submit to his sexual advances for him to be convicted under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The first paragraph of Section 5 thereof even provides that the offense can be committed by "any adult, syndicate or group," without qualification. The clear language of the law does not preclude the prosecution of lascivious conduct performed by the same person who subdued the child through coercion or influence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is inconsequential that the sexual abuse occurred only once. As stressed in <i>Quimvel</i>, the very definition of "child abuse" under Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 7610 does not require that the victim suffer a separate and distinct act of sexual abuse aside from the act complained of, for it refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child. Thus, a violation of Section 5(b) of the same law occurs even though the accused committed sexual abuse against the child victim only once, even without a prior sexual affront.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>To be sure, Article III of R.A. No. 7610 is captioned as "Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse" because Congress really intended to cover a situation where the minor may have been coerced or intimidated into lascivious conduct, not necessarily for money or profit, hence, the law covers not only child prostitution but also other forms of sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>However, before an accused can be convicted of child abuse through lascivious conduct committed against a minor below 12 years of age, the requisites for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC must be met in addition to the requisites for sexual abuse under Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Acts of Lasciviousness, as defined in Article 336 of the RPC, has the following elements:<blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">That the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">That it is done under any of the following circumstances:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a. </div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">By using force or intimidation; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">b.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">c. </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the offended party is under 12 years of age; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"> That the offended party is another person of either sex.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On the other hand, the following elements of sexual abuse under Section 5, Article III of R.A. No. 7610 must be established:<br><blockquote>1. The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.<br><br>2. The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.<br><br>3. The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<br></blockquote>As correctly found by the CA, all the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, as amended, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, are present in Criminal Case No. 08-0272 because the evidence of the prosecution showed that Aycardo, an adult, took advantage of his influence as the uncle and a relative by affinity within the 3<sup>rd</sup> civil degree of AAA, and was able to touch her vagina, while he forcibly removed her shorts and panties, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

Padit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court explained why the slightest penetration of the female genitalia consummates the rape. Carnal knowledge is defined as the act of a man having sexual bodily connections with a woman; as such, a mere touching of the external genitalia by the penis capable of consummating the sexual act already constitutes consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In seeking his acquittal of the crimes charged, Aycardo raised the defenses of denial and <i>alibi</i>. AAA's positive and credible testimony, coupled with the medical findings, deserves more persuasive weight than Aycardo's bare denial and <i>alibi</i>, which are self-serving defenses that cannot be given greater weight than the declaration of a credible witness who testified on affirmative matters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and positively identified him as the perpetrator of the crimes. Anent AAA's credibility and indifferent behavior shortly after her sexual abuse in the hands of Aycardo, the Court finds that the CA has exhaustively addressed such issues, as follows:<br><blockquote>It is not disputed that accused-appellant failed to completely undress AAA on that occasion since she was unable to fend off his advances. This, however, does not necessarily negate accused-appellant's act of having successfully touched AAA's vagina with his finger in his struggle to remove her clothes.<br><br>Neither can her belated disclosure of the sexual abuse nor her act of returning to accused-appellant's house weaken her testimony and render the same unworthy of credence. AAA could not be blamed for not immediately reporting the incident to her cousin Joy whose house she ran to after the first incident of molestation since she distrusted Joy, [for] being a "gossiper." It has been held that delay in the reporting of sexual abuse does not imply that the charge was not true, as the victim may prefer to bear the ignominy of pain in silence rather than reveal her harrowing experience and expose her shame to the world. Such delay is not unusual, especially when the victim is a minor.<br><br>If AAA eventually chose to return to accused-appellant's house despite the first incident, it was not because she welcomed his overtures but more in deference to accused-appellant's moral ascendancy as her uncle. In her direct testimony, she said that despite the first incident, AAA still returned to accused-appellant's house in obedience to his order for AAA to prepare dinner since according to accused-appellant, her Tiya Tess, accused-appellant's wife, was coming home that evening. AAA did not have much of a choice but to return to accused-appellant's house since she was, at that time, dependent on accused-appellant in whose house she resided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>As regards the claim that Dr. Belgira's medico-legal report is unreliable because he did not clearly attribute that AAA's markedly dilated hymen and blunt vaginal penetrating trauma was caused by Aycardo's penis, and the fact that AAA was medically examined only six (6) months after the sexual abuse incident, the Court upholds the CA's correct ruling, to wit:<br><blockquote>Accused-appellant has not adduced any evidence showing Dr. Belgira's lack of qualification as to render his testimony unworthy of belief. Neither did he present any evidence showing any ill motive on the part of Dr. Belgira to testify falsely against him. More[over], it has been held that expert testimony is merely corroborative in nature and not essential to conviction. Hence, an accused can still be convicted of rape on the basis of the sole testimony of the private complainant. Hence, even if We were to disregard Dr. Belgira's medico-legal report and testimony, accused-appellant's conviction may still be sustained on the basis of AAA's testimony who categorically testified that accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina and even subsequently showed her his semen spurting out of his organ after satiating his lust. Meanwhile, accused-appellant's claim that the belated medical examination of AAA raised the possibility that she may have had sexual intercourse with some other person is purely speculative and cannot be given credence. We, in fact, do not find any reason to disbelieve the account of AAA, a girl who had been sexually molested at the tender age of eleven, who spontaneously shed tears while narrating her sordid experience with accused-appellant. It has been held that the crying of the victim lends credence to her charge of rape for the display of such emotion indicates the pain she feels when asked to recall her harrowing experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>There is also no merit in Aycardo's claim that the absence of laceration on AAA's vagina belies the rape charge against him. As held in <i>People v. Pangilinan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> "[p]roof of hymenal laceration is not an element of rape. An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped. Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even without laceration of the hymen, is enough to constitute rape, and even the briefest of contact is deemed rape." In this case, Dr. Belgira's finding of "a clear sign of blunt vaginal penetrating trauma,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> bolstered AAA's credible testimony that Aycardo raped her.<br><br>Regarding the claim that the rape incident would not go unnoticed by Bongbong, who was just sleeping between Aycardo and AAA, the CA aptly stressed that rapists are not deterred by the presence of people nearby, such as members of their own family, inside the same room, considering that lust respects no time, place or circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Neither the smallness of the room, nor the presence of other people therein, nor the high risk of being caught, has been held efficient to deter the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The imposable penalty for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 under the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A.

Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and with the presence of the aggravating circumstance of relationship, the maximum term of the sentence to be imposed shall be taken from the maximum of the imposable penalty, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium in its maximum period, the range of which is from Sixteen (16) years, Five (5) months and Ten (10) days to Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months, while the minimum term shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum, the range of which is from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Accordingly, Aycardo is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of Twelve (12) years and One (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum, as minimum, to Sixteen (16) years, Five (5) months and Ten (10) days of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium in its maximum period, as maximum.<br><br>It is not amiss to stress that the alleged and proved modifying circumstances that the victim is under 12 years old and the offender is a relative by affinity within the third (3<sup>rd</sup>) civil degree, are insufficient in order for the maximum period to be imposed against the perpetratorpursuant to Section 31,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Article XII of R.A. No. 7610, because the same provision requires that such collateral relative must be within the second (2<sup>nd</sup>) civil degree.
