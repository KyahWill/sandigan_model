The essential elements of agency are: (1) there is consent, express or implied, of the parties to establish the relationship; (2) the object is the execution of a juridical act in relation to a third person; (3) the agent acts as a representative and not for himself; and (4) the agent acts within the scope of his authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> All the elements of agency exist in this case. Under the promissory note with chattel mortgage, Spouses Briones appointed iBank as their attorney-in-fact, authorizing it to file a claim with the insurance company if the mortgaged vehicle was lost or damaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Petitioner was also authorized to collect the insurance proceeds as the beneficiary of the insurance policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Sections 6 and 22 of the promissory note state: </p><ol start="6"><li> The MORTGAGOR agrees that he will cause the mortgaged property/ies to be insured against loss or damage by accident, theft and fire . . . with an insurance company/ies acceptable to the MORTGAGEE . . .; that he will make all loss, if any, under such policy/ies payable to the MORTGAGEE or its assigns . . .

They both found the existence of an agency relationship between the Spouses Briones and iBank, based on the clear wording of Sections 6 and 22 of the promissory note with chattel mortgage, which petitioner prepared and respondents signed.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b></p><p> Petitioner asserts that the Spouses Briones effectively revoked the agency granted under the promissory note when they filed a claim with the insurance company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner is mistaken. </p><p>Revocation as a form of extinguishing an agency under Article 1924<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the Civil Code only applies in cases of incompatibility, such as when the principal disregards or bypasses the agent in order to deal with a third person in a way that excludes the agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p>In the case at bar, the mortgaged vehicle was carnapped on November 5, 2003 and the Spouses Briones immediately informed petitioner about the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The Spouses Briones continued paying the monthly installment for the next three (3) months following the vehicle's loss to show their good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> However, on March 26, 2004, petitioner demanded full payment from Spouses Briones for the lost vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The Spouses Briones were thus constrained to file a claim for loss with the insurance company on April 30, 2004, precisely because petitioner failed to do so despite being their agent and being authorized to file a claim under the insurance policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Not surprisingly, the insurance company declined the claim for belated filing. </p><p>The Spouses Briones' claim for loss cannot be seen as an implied revocation of the agency or their way of excluding petitioner. They did not disregard or bypass petitioner when they made an insurance claim; rather, they had no choice but to personally do it because of their agent's negligence. This is not the implied termination or revocation of an agency provided for under Article 1924 of the Civil Code. </p><p> While a contract of agency is generally revocable at will as it is primarily based on trust and confidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Article 1927 of the Civil Code provides the instances when an agency becomes irrevocable: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1927. An agency cannot be revoked if a bilateral contract depends upon it, or if it is the means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted, or if a partner is appointed manager of a partnership in the contract of partnership and his removal from the management is unjustifiable.</p> </blockquote> <p> A bilateral contract that depends upon the agency is considered an agency coupled with an interest, making it an exception to the general rule of revocability at will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <em>Lim v. Saban</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> emphasizes that when an agency is established for both the principal and the agent, an agency coupled with an interest is created and the principal cannot revoke the agency at will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> In the promissory note with chattel mortgage, the Spouses Briones authorized petitioner to claim, collect, and apply the insurance proceeds towards the full satisfaction of their loan if the mortgaged vehicle were lost or damaged. Clearly, a bilateral contract existed between the parties, making the agency irrevocable. Petitioner was also aware of the bilateral contract; thus, it included the designation of an irrevocable agency in the promissory note with chattel mortgage that it prepared for the Spouses Briones to sign. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b></p><p> Petitioner asserts that the insurance coverage is only an alternative available to the Spouses Briones;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and with the denial of the insurance claim, the Spouses Briones are obligated to pay the remaining balance plus interest of the mortgaged vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p><p> The petitioner is again mistaken. </p><p> As the agent, petitioner was mandated to look after the interests of the Spouses Briones. However, instead of going after the insurance proceeds, as expected of it as the agent, petitioner opted to claim the full amount from the Spouses Briones, disregard the established principal-agency relationship, and put its own interests before those of its principal. </p><p> The facts show that the insurance policy was valid when the vehicle was lost, and that the insurance claim was only denied because of the belated filing. </p><p> Having been negligent in its duties as the duly constituted agent, petitioner must be held liable for the damages suffered by the Spouses Briones because of non-performance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of its obligation as the agent, and because it prioritized its interests over that of its principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> Furthermore, petitioner's bad faith was evident when it advised the Spouses Briones to continue paying three (3) monthly installments after the loss, purportedly to show their good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> A principal and an agent enjoy a fiduciary relationship marked with trust and confidence, therefore, the agent has the duty "to act in good faith [to advance] the interests of [its] principal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> If petitioner was indeed acting in good faith, it could have timely informed the Spouses Briones that it was terminating the agency and its right to file an insurance claim, and could have advised them to facilitate the insurance proceeds themselves. Petitioner's failure to do so only compounds its negligence and underscores its bad faith. Thus, it will be inequitable now to compel the Spouses Briones to pay the full amount of the lost property. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the Petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
