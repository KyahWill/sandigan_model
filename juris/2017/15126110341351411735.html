The Regional Trial Court Decision dismissed petitioner Richelle P. Abella's (Richelle) action for support of her minor daughter, Marl Jhorylle Abella (Jhorylle) against respondent Policarpio Cabañero (Cabañero).

This, however, was dismissed. Later, she initiated another criminal case, this time for child abuse under Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. This, too, was dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> Richelle prayed for the child's monthly allowance in the amount of P3,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> In his Answer, Cabañero denied sexually abusing Richelle, or otherwise having any sexual relations with her. Thus, he asserted that he could not have been the father of Richelle’s child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> After two (2) re-settings, pre-trial was held on February 21, 2007. Only Richelle's counsel appeared. Richelle's motion to present her evidence<em> ex parte </em>was granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> In her testimony, Richelle noted that Cabañero was related to her mother and that she treated him as her uncle. She narrated how she was sexually abused by Cabañero on July 25, 2000, September 10, 2000, and February 8, 2002 and how Cabañero threatened her to keep her silent. She added that during this period, Cabañero sent her three (3) letters. She testified that she bore her and Cabañero's child, whom she named Marl Jhorylle Abella, on August 21, 2002. She insisted on her certainty that Cabañero was the father of the child as she supposedly had no sexual relations with any other man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> In its March 19, 2007 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Regional Trial Court dismissed Richelle's Complaint without prejudice, on account of her failure to implead her minor child, Jhorylle, as plaintiff.</p><p> Richelle filed a petition for <em>certiorari </em>and mandamus before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> In its assailed August 25, 2011 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court of Appeals sustained the dismissal of the Complaint.</p><p> However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the Regional Trial Court's basis for dismissing the Complaint. It emphasized that non-joinder of indispensable parties is not a ground for the dismissal of an action and added that it would have sufficed for the Regional Trial Court to have "ordered the amendment of the caption of the [C]omplaint to implead the minor child."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Court of Appeals still ruled that the dismissal of the Complaint was proper as the filiation and paternity of the child had not been previously established. As the child's birth certificate did not indicate that Cabañero was the father and as Cabañero had not done anything to voluntarily recognize the child as his own, the Court of Appeals asserted that Richelle "should have first instituted filiation proceedings to adjudicate the minor child's paternity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> Following the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Richelle filed this Petition.</p><p> For resolution is the sole issue of whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that filiation proceedings should have first been separately instituted to ascertain the minor child's paternity and that without these proceedings having first been resolved in favor of the child's paternity claim, petitioner Richelle P. Abella's action for support could not prosper.</p><p> This Court reverses the Court of Appeals Decision. </p><p> While it is true that the grant of support was contingent on ascertaining paternal relations between respondent and petitioner's daughter, Jhorylle, it was unnecessary for petitioner's action for support to have been dismissed and terminated by the Court of Appeals in the manner that it did. Instead of dismissing the case, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the Regional Trial Court. There, petitioner and her daughter should have been enabled to present evidence to establish their cause of action—inclusive of their underlying claim of paternal relations—against respondent. </p><p align="center"><strong>I </strong> </p><p> Article 194 of the Family Code delineates the extent of support among family members, while Article 195 identifies family members who "are obliged to support each other": </p><blockquote> <p> Article 194.

The Court of Appeals later affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's Complaint, insisting that separate filiation proceedings and their termination in petitioner's daughter's favor were imperative.</p><p> While ably noting that filiation had yet to be established, the Court of Appeals' discussion and final disposition are not in keeping with jurisprudence.</p><p> <em>Dolina v. Vallecera</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> clarified that since an action for compulsory recognition may be filed ahead of an action for support, the direct filing of an action for support, "where the issue of compulsory recognition may be integrated and resolved,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> is an equally valid alternative: </p><blockquote> <p> To be entitled to legal support, petitioner must, in proper action, first establish the filiation of the child, if the same is not admitted or acknowledged. Since Dolina's demand for support for her son is based on her claim that he is Vallecera's illegitimate child, the latter is not entitled to such support if he had not acknowledged him, until Dolina shall have proved his relation to him. The child's remedy is to file through her mother a judicial action against Vallecera for compulsory recognition. If filiation is beyond question, support follows as matter of obligation. In short, illegitimate children are entitled to support and successional rights but their filiation must be duly proved.</p> <p> Dolina's remedy is to file for the benefit of her child an action against Vallecera for compulsory recognition in order to establish filiation and then demand support. <em>Alternatively, she may directly file an action for support, where the issue of compulsory recognition may be integrated and resolved</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> <em>Agustin v. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> extensively discussed the deep jurisprudential roots that buttress the validity of this alternative. </p><p> <em>Agustin</em> concerned an action for support and support<em> pendente lite</em> filed by a child, represented by his mother. The putative father, Arnel Agustin, vehemently denied paternal relations with the child. He disavowed his apparent signature on the child's birth certificate, which indicated him as the father. Agustin "moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of cause of action, considering that his signature on the birth certificate was a forgery and that, under the law, an illegitimate child is not entitled to support if not recognized by the putative father."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The Regional Trial Court denied Agustin's motion to dismiss; it was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals. </p><p> In sustaining the lower courts' decisions, this Court noted that enabling the mother and her child to establish paternity and filiation in the course of an action for support was merely a permission "to prove their cause of action against [Agustin,] who had been denying the authenticity of the documentary evidence of acknowledgement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> This Court added that an action to compel recognition could very well be integrated with an action for support. This Court drew analogies with extant jurisprudence that sustained the integration of an action to compel recognition with an action to claim inheritance and emphasized that "the basis or rationale for integrating them remains the same,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> [Petitioner] claims that the order and resolution . . . effectively converted the complaint for support to a petition for recognition, which is supposedly proscribed by law. According to petitioner, Martin, as an unrecognized child, has no right to ask for support and must first establish his filiation in a separate suit. . . </p> <blockquote> <p> The petitioner's contentions are without merit.</p> </blockquote> <p> The assailed resolution and order did not convert the action for support into one for recognition but merely allowed the respondents to prove their cause of action against petitioner who had been denying the authenticity of the documentary evidence of acknowledgement. But even if the assailed resolution and order effectively integrated an action to compel recognition with an action for support, such was valid and in accordance with jurisprudence. In<em> Tayag v. Court of Appeals</em>, we allowed the integration of an action to compel recognition with an action to claim one's inheritance:</p> <blockquote> <p> ... In<em> Paulino</em>, we held that an illegitimate child, to be entitled to support and successional rights from the putative or presumed parent, must prove his filiation to the latter. We also said that it is necessary to allege in the complaint that the putative father had acknowledged and recognized the illegitimate child because such acknowledgment is essential to and is the basis of the right to inherit. There being no allegation of such acknowledgment, the action becomes one to compel recognition which cannot be brought after the death of the putative father. The<em> ratio decidendi</em> in <em>Paulino</em>, therefore, is not the absence of a cause of action for failure of the petitioner to allege the fact of acknowledgment in the complaint, but the prescription of the action.</p> <p> Applying the foregoing principles to the case at bar, although petitioner contends that the complaint filed by herein private respondent merely alleges that the minor Chad Cuyugan is an illegitimate child of the deceased and is actually a claim for inheritance, from the allegations therein the same may be considered as one to compel recognition. Further, that, the two causes of action, one to compel recognition and the other to claim inheritance, may be joined in one complaint is not new in our jurisprudence.</p> <p> As early as [1922] we had occasion to rule thereon in <em>Briz vs. Briz</em>, et al. . . . wherein we said:</p> <blockquote> <p> The question whether a person in the position of the present plaintiff can in any event maintain a complex action to compel recognition as a natural child and at the same time to obtain ulterior relief in the character of heir, is one which in the opinion of this court must be answered in the affirmative, provided always that the conditions justifying the joinder of the two distinct causes of action are present in the particular case. In other words, there is no absolute necessity requiring that the action to compel acknowledgment should have been instituted and prosecuted to a successful conclusion prior to the action in which that same plaintiff seeks additional relief in the character of heir. Certainly, there is nothing so peculiar to the action to compel acknowledgment as to require that a rule should be here applied different from that generally applicable in other cases . . .</p> <p> The conclusion above stated, though not heretofore explicitly formulated by this court, is undoubtedly to some extent supported by our prior decisions. Thus, we have held in numerous cases, and the doctrine must be considered well settled, that a natural child having a right to compel acknowledgment, but who has not been in fact legally acknowledged, may maintain partition proceedings for the division of the inheritance against his coheirs . . .; and the same person may intervene in proceedings for the distribution of the estate of his deceased natural father, or mother ... In neither of these situations has it been thought necessary for the plaintiff to show a prior decree compelling acknowledgment. The obvious reason is that in partition suits and distribution proceedings the other persons who might take by inheritance are before the court; and the declaration of heirship is appropriate to such proceedings.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Although the instant case deals with support rather than inheritance, as in<em> Tayag</em>, the basis or rationale for integrating them remains the same. Whether or not respondent Martin is entitled to support depends completely on the determination of filiation. A separate action will only result in a multiplicity of suits, given how intimately related the main issues in both cases are. To paraphrase<em> Tayag</em>, the declaration of filiation is entirely appropriate to these proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Indeed, an integrated determination of filiation is "entirely appropriate"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to the action for support filed by petitioner Richelle for her child. An action for support may very well resolve that ineluctable issue of paternity if it involves the same parties, is brought before a court with the proper jurisdiction, prays to impel recognition of paternal relations, and invokes judicial intervention to do so. This does not run afoul of any rule. To the contrary, and consistent with <em>Briz v. Briz</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this is in keeping with the rules on proper joinder of causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This also serves the interest of judicial economy—avoiding multiplicity of suits and cushioning litigants from the vexation and costs of a protracted pleading of their cause. </p><p> Thus, it was improper to rule here, as the Court of Appeals did, that it was impossible to entertain petitioner's child's plea for support without her and petitioner first surmounting the encumbrance of an entirely different judicial proceeding. Without meaning to lend credence to the minutiae of petitioner's claims, it is quite apparent that the rigors of judicial proceedings have been taxing enough for a mother and her daughter whose claim for support amounts to a modest P3,000.00 every month. When petitioner initiated her action, her daughter was a toddler; she is, by now, well into her adolescence. The primordial interest of justice and the basic dictum that procedural rules are to be "liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> impel us to grant the present Petition.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
