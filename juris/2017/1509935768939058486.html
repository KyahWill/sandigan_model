Those shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Commonwealth Act No. 141 is a special law that applies to agricultural lands of the public domain, not to forests, mineral lands, and national parks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The requisite period of possession and occupation is different from that of land classification.<br><br>In an application for judicial confirmation of title, an applicant already holds an imperfect title to an agricultural land of the public domain after having occupied it from June 12, 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, for purposes of obtaining an imperfect title, the date it was classified is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Classifying a land of the public domain as agricultural is essential only to establish the applicant's "eligibility for land registration, not the ownership or title over it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> explained:<br><blockquote>[T]he applicant's imperfect or incomplete title is derived only from possession and occupation since June 12, 1945, or earlier. This means that the character of the property subject of the application as alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain determines its eligibility for land registration, not the ownership or title over it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Malabanan</i>, the Court <i>En Banc</i> affirmed that June 12, 1945 is the "reckoning point of the requisite <i>possession</i> and occupation" and not of the land classification as alienable and disposable:<br><blockquote>[T]he choice of <i>June 12, 1945</i> as the reckoning point of the requisite possession and occupation was the sole prerogative of Congress, the determination of which should best be left to the wisdom of the lawmakers. Except that said date qualified the <i>period of possession and occupation</i>, no other legislative intent appears to be associated with the fixing of the date of June 12, 1945. Accordingly, the Court should interpret only the plain and literal meaning of the law as written by the legislators.<br><br>[A]n examination of Section 48 (b) of the Public Land Act indicates that Congress prescribed no requirement that the land subject of the registration should have been classified as agricultural since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, the land may be declared alienable and disposable at any time, not necessarily before June 12, 1945. The moment that the land is declared alienable and disposable, an applicant may then initiate the proceedings for the judicial confirmation of title.<br><br>On the other hand, for the requisite duration of possession, an applicant must have had possession of the property under a bona fide claim of ownership or acquisition, from June 12, 1945 or earlier. Such possession must have also been open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Under Section 11(4)(a) of Commonwealth Act No, 141, the judicial confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles, which the law describes as "judicial legalization," allows for agricultural public lands to be disposed of by the State and acquired by Filipino citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> provides for the procedure to register a title under the Torrens system:<br><blockquote>Section 14.

First, they must prove that they, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the property. Second, it must be settled that the applicants' occupation is under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition or ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier, immediately before the application was filed. Third, it should be established that the land is an agricultural land of public domain. Finally, it has to be shown that the land has been declared alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The Spouses Go's possession, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, does not meet the statutory requirements.<br><br>The evidence the Spouses Go submitted to prove their required length of possession consist of Anselmo's testimony, Cristina's sole Tax Declaration, and the Spouses Go's sole Tax Declaration. Other than these pieces of evidence, the Spouses Go could not support their claim of possession in the concept of an owner, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, from June 12, 1945 or earlier.<br><br>The records do not show that the Spouses Go's predecessors-in-interest fenced the original 3,994-square-meter Lot No. 4699, claiming it as exclusively theirs or that they introduced improvements on it since June 12, 1945 or earlier.

Payment of real property taxes is a "good indicia of the possession in the concept of owner for no one in his [or her] right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his [or her] actual, or at the least constructive, possession."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Anselmo only gave bare assertions that his parents paid the real property taxes during their lifetime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Neither did the Spouses Go give any proof of the alleged tax payments of the Spouses de Torres or of Anselmo's grandparents, the Spouses Almero.<br><br>Although not adequate to establish ownership, a tax declaration may be a basis to infer possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> This Court has highlighted that where tax declaration was presented, it must be the 1945 tax declaration because June 12, 1945 is material to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The specific date must be ascertained; otherwise, applicants fail to comply with the requirements of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In <i>Republic v.

In <i>Republic v. T.A.N. Properties</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><blockquote>[I]t is not enough for the PENRO or CENRO to certify that a land is alienable and disposable. The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. In addition, the applicant for land registration must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records. These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Republic v. Hanover</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> ruled that a CENRO certification does not constitute incontrovertible proof that a piece of land is alienable and disposable. This is because "the CENRO is not the official repository or legal custodian of the issuances of the DENR Secretary declaring the alienability and disposability of public lands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> <i>Republic v. Vda. De Joson</i> explained:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><blockquote>This doctrine unavoidably means that the mere certification issued by the CENRO or PENRO did not suffice to support the application for registration, because the applicant must also submit a copy of the original classification of the land as alienable and disposable as approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br></div><br>The pieces of evidence the Spouses Go adduced fall short of the requirements of the law.<br><br>First, the Spouses Go failed to present a certified true copy of the original classification of the DENR Secretary. This Court has given them enough chances to prove their claim. As a rule, this Court can only consider the evidence submitted before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Nevertheless, this Court gave respondents the opportunity to submit "a certified true copy of the Presidential or Department of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary's issuance declaring the property alienable and disposable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> They failed to comply despite being given a show-cause order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>This Court also required them to file their Comment on petitioner's opposition to their original registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Instead of complying, they asked that their Comment be dispensed with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>Second, although the Spouses Go submitted a CENRO certification stating that the land was verified to be within alienable and disposable zone under Project No. 13, Land Classification Map No. 718, Maglinao, the person who issued the CENRO Certification, testified otherwise. She admitted in her testimony that, she certified the lot only to determine "the point or monument of the entire or whole area" and not to identify its alienable character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>The Spouses Go have the burden to show that the land for registration is alienable or disposable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> which they miserably failed to do so. Without the original land classification approved by the DENR Secretary, the Spouses Go's application for registration must be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> The land remains inalienable.<br><br>In sum, the Court of Appeals gravely erred in affirming the trial court's Decision that granted the Spouses Go's application for registration of Lot No. 4699-B. The Spouses Go failed to adequately prove their claim of possession in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945. They likewise failed to establish that the land applied for registration is alienable and disposable. Thus, their occupation of this land, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership and cannot be registered as a title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
