This was docketed as Civil Case No. 130783. In addition to the amounts claimed, he also sought the following: the annulment of the "Whereas Clause" providing for the completion of the construction project within 150 working days; the rescission/annulment of the Contract of Building Construction dated May 22, 1979 and the Agreement dated May 24, 1979; and the declaration of the FGU Surety Bond as unenforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> In its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim dated June 30, 1980,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Philtrust Bank claimed that it did not release the P24,000.00 because Dominguez failed to submit an accounting of the previous releases made. Philtrust Bank added that Dominguez failed to complete even 60% of the project despite its release of P876,000.00. As such, it asked Dominguez to pay P1,000.00 per day of delay as liquidated damages until fulfillment of his obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Lastly, Philtrust Bank averred that it sent several demand letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> to FGU to pay P450,000.00 for non-performance of its principal, but the latter re/fused to pay.

It prayed for reimbursement against Dominguez for any amount it may be adjudged to pay to the Spouses Roxas. It also filed a fourth-party complaint against Dominguez, Gloria Dominguez, Dominador Caiyod, Felicisima Caiyod, Rufino Andal, and Amada Caiyod under their May 29, 1979 Agreement of Counterguaranty "to secure the obligation of FGU [Insurance Corporation] under the surety bond."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p>FGU later moved to strike the fourth-party complaint but it was denied by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Branch 40, Regional Trial Court, Manila found that the Spouses Roxas breached their obligation to Dominguez under the Contract of Building Construction and the May 24, 1979 Agreement. Likewise, it ruled that Dominguez's non-completion of the project within the stipulated period was justified because of the rising prices of materials and labor. Finally, it held that Dominguez was made to accept the construction contract due to the deceit and misrepresentation of the Spouses Roxas and Philtrust Bank. Hence, it rendered judgment in favor of Dominguez as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, viewed in the light of the foregoing circumstances, this court hereby renders judgment in favor of plaintiff Rosendo Dominguez[, Jr.] as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="97%"> <div align="justify">Declaring the "Whereas Clause" paragraph 7 of the Contract Building Construction dated May 22, 1979 as voided and cancelled, as well as the agreement dated May 24, 1979 between the plaintiffs and defendant Roxas spouses; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Ordering the cancellation of the Performance Bond of the FGU Insurance Corporation for P450,000.00 of no further force and effect;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Ordering the defendants Roxas spouses to pay Rosendo Dominguez[, Jr.] the sum of P90,000.00 with 14% yearly interest from due date until fully paid;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Ordering the defendants Roxas spouses to pay P73,146.75 with legal rate thereon from October 27, 1971 until fully paid;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(e) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Ordering the defendants Roxas spouses to pay Rosendo Dominguez[, Jr.] moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and ordering them to pay [a]ttorney's fees in the amount of P50,000; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(f) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Denying other claims and counterclaims for lack of sufficient proof;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">This is without prejudice to the filing of the proper case for collection by the Philippine Trust Company against defendant Roxas spouses for their indebtedness to the Bank;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(g) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Defendant spouses Roxases (sic) are ordered to pay the cost of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The Court of Appeals modified the Decision of the Regional Trial Court. It held that the "Whereas Clause" of the Contract of Building Construction dated May 22, 1979 and the Agreement dated May 24, 1979 were valid. According to the Court of Appeals, the Spouses Roxas' non-payment of the stipulated P90,000.00 in three (3) equal installments and their offering of properties different from those stipulated in the May 24, 1979 Agreement did not constitute the kind of fraud that would give rise to the annulment of the contracts. It held that the parcels of land were not even mentioned in the May 22, 1979 Contract and that Dominguez agreed to finish the project within the 150-day period whether or not the Spouses Roxas could supply the funds to finance the labor costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals also found no basis for the upward adjustment of the contract price claimed by Dominguez. It held that no proof was presented by Dominguez to establish extraordinary inflation during the intervening period. In addition, the precedent conditions for the recovery of additional construction costs under Article 1724<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Civil Code were not complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> On the liability of the Spouses Roxas to Philtrust Bank, the Court of Appeals held that Philtrust Bank failed to prove that the requests for the release of the sum of P422,000.00 to Dominguez were with the conformity of the Spouses Roxas. Hence, Philtrust Bank had no one else to blame but itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> The Court of Appeals also reversed the Regional Trial Court decision to cancel the Surety Bond. It held that FGU, as surety under FGUIC Bond No. G(23) 5994 dated May 24,1979, was obligated to pay the Spouses Roxas and Philtrust Bank the amount of P450,000.00 for Dominguez's non-completion of the construction project within the stipulated period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p>Finally, the Court of Appeals found the award of damages in favor of Dominguez to be improper. It held that Dominguez failed to prove bad faith, fraud, or ill motive on the part of the Spouses Roxas that would justify the award of moral damages. Furthermore, without the award of moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees could likewise not be awarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>On the other hand, it ruled that "the unjustified stoppage and abandonment of the construction works by Dominguez, Jr. constitute a breach of his contractual obligation characterized by bad faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, the Court of Appeals adjudged Dominguez liable to the Spouses Roxas for P100,000.00 as moral damages, PI00,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p>The Court of Appeals May 26, 2009 Decision disposed as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the appeal is partially GRANTED, Accordingly, the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila dated September 4, 1990 is MODIFIED as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> 1.

Tomas Matic, Jr. (Atty. Matic) informing this Court that no appearance was made either by Dominguez or his counsel Atty. Matic before the Court of Appeals despite notice. Moreover, the counsel of the Spouses Roxas knew that Atty.

Dominguez, Jr.'s non-completion of the project; </p><p> Second, whether or not the Spouses Floro and Eufemia Roxas are entitled to liquidated damages under the Contract for Building Construction; Third, whether or not there is factual basis for the award of P90,000.00 with 14% stipulated interest and P 73,146.75 with legal interest in favor of Rosendo P. Dominguez, Jr.;</p><p> Fourth, whether or not the liabilities of the Spouses Floro and Eufemia Roxas to Rosendo P. Dominguez, Jr. may be set off against any liability of FGU Insurance Corporation pursuant to Articles 1280<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and 1283<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the Civil Code; and</p><p> Fifth, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case to the trial court for the reception of evidence and computation of the other claims of the Philippine Trust Company against the Spouses Floro and Eufemia Roxas.</p><p> Finally, whether or not Philtrust Bank should be held liable for the unauthorized release of the remaining construction funds.</p><p> FGU questions the Court of Appeals Decision, which held it liable to the Spouses Roxas for the full amount of the Surety Bond.</p><p> First, it argues that the face amount of P450,000.00 only indicates its maximum potential liability in case Dominguez does not comply with its obligation under the Contract of Building Construction. FGU submits that it should only be liable for the actual damages that may have been sustained by the Spouses Roxas or the cost that may have been incurred by them to finish the contracted work. Since the Spouses Roxas failed to prove the added cost to them to finish the construction, FGU argues that their claim for damages cannot be granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p>Second, FGU contends that under Article 2054 of the Civil Code, its liability cannot be greater than the liability of the principal. Thus, it was erroneous for the Court of Appeals to adjudge it liable for actual damages but without adjudging any liability upon Dominguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p>Third, FGU submits that the Spouses Roxas may only claim up to one-half (1/2) of the face amount because Philtrust Bank is a joint creditor under the Surety Bond. </p><p> The Spouses Roxas counter that under the Contract of Building Construction, Dominguez's liability in case of non-completion of the project is not limited to the additional cost that the Spouses Roxas would have incurred to finish the project. They hold that his liability includes liquidated damages of P1,000.00 per day until the contractor shall have complied with his obligation.

Under the terms of this bond, FGU guaranteed to pay the amount of P450,000.00 should Dominguez be unable to faithfully comply with the contract for the completion of the Spouses Roxas' housing project. FGU's obligation to pay is solidary with Dominguez and is realized once the latter fails to perform his obligation under the Contract of Building Construction.</p><p> FGU's contention that the P450,000.00 face amount simply indicates its maximum potential liability and that it should only be liable for actual damages or the cost overrun as a result, of the non-completion of the project is untenable. The terms of the bond were clear; hence, the literal meaning of its stipulation should control.</p><p> The specific condition in the FGU Surety Bond did not clearly state the limitation of FGU's liability. From the terms of this bond, FGU guaranteed to pay the amount of P450,000.00 in the event of Dominguez's breach of his contractual undertaking. Hence, FGU was bound to pay the stipulated indemnity upon proof of Dominguez's default without the necessity of proof on the measure of damages caused by the breach. A stipulation not contrary to law, morals, or public order is binding upon the obligor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> If FGU's intention was to limit its liability to the cost overrun or additional cost to the Spouses Roxas to complete the project up to the extent of P450,000.00, then it should have included in the Surety Bond specific words indicating this intention. Its failure to do so must be construed against it.</p><p> A suretyship agreement is a contract of adhesion ordinarily prepared by the surety or insurance company. Therefore, its provisions are interpreted liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the Insurer who, as the drafter of the bond, had the opportunity to state plainly the terms of its obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> It was undisputed that Dominguez failed to finish the construction work within the agreed time frame, triggering FGU's liability under the Surety Bond. Dominguez's breach of the Contract of Building Construction gave the Spouses Roxas and/or Philtrust Bank the immediate right to pursue FGU on the surety bond. Thus, FGU is duty-bound to perform what it has guaranteed—to pay P450,000.00 upon notice of Dominguez's default.</p><p> FGU, on the other hand, has the right to be indemnified for any payments made, both under the law and the indemnity agreement. In <em>Escaño v. Ortigas, Jr.,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> this Court explained this right to full reimbursement by a surety: </p><blockquote> <p> [E]ven as the surety is solidarity bound with the principal debtor to the creditor, the surety who does pay the creditor has the right to recover the full amount paid, and not just any proportional share, from the principal debtor or debtors. Such right to full reimbursement falls within the other rights, actions and benefits which pertain to the surety by reason of the subsidiary obligation assumed by the surety.</p> <p> What is the source of this right to full reimbursement by the surety? We find the right under Article 2066 of the Civil Code, which assures that "[t]he guarantor who pays for a debtor must be indemnified by the latter," such indemnity comprising of, among others, "the total amount of the debt." Further, Article 2067 of the Civil Code likewise establishes that "[t]he guarantor who pays is subrogated by virtue thereof to all the rights which the creditor had against the debtor."</p> <p> Articles 2066 and 2067 explicitly pertain to guarantors, and one might argue that the provisions should not extend to sureties, especially in light of the qualifier in Article 2047 that the provisions on joint and several obligations should apply to sureties. We reject that argument, and instead adopt Dr. Tolentino's observation that "[t]he reference in the second paragraph of [Article 2047] to the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I, Book IV, on solidary or several obligations, however, does not mean that suretyship is withdrawn from the applicable provisions governing guaranty." For if that were not the implication, there would be no material difference between the surety as defined under Article 2047 and the joint and several debtors, for both classes of obligors would be governed by exactly the same rules and limitations.</p> <p> Accordingly, the rights to indemnification and subrogation as established and granted to the guarantor by Articles 2066 and 2067 extend as well to sureties as defined under Article 2047.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><strong> I.B</strong> </p><p> This Court disagrees with FGU's contention that it should only be liable to the Spouses Roxas for one-half (1/2) of the face amount of the Surety Bond.</p><p> Under the Surety Bond, FGU guaranteed Dominguez's fulfilment of the undertakings, terms, and conditions stipulated in the Contract of Building Construction.

Hence, in enforcing this bond, its provisions must be read together with the Contract of Building Construction. </p><p> Jurisprudence refers to this rule as the "complementary-contracts-construed-together" doctrine, which mandates that the stipulations, terms, and conditions of both the principal and accessory contracts must be construed together in order to arrive at the true intention of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p><p> This doctrine is consistent with Article 1374 of the Civil Code, which states: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1374.

In the event the Contractor fails to comply with its obligation under any of the aforementioned premises and the herein terms and conditions of this Contract, the Contractor shall pay to the <em>Bank and/or Owners</em> the sum of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00), Philippine Currency, daily, as liquidated damages, until it shall have complied with its obligation;</p> <p> 7. To insure and guarantee the faithful performance of its obligation under this Contract, the Contractor binds himself to post and file a Performance Bond of P450,000.00 and a Contractor's All Risk Bond of P1,200,000.00 in favor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bank and/or Owners</span> to be issued by a reputable insurance/surety firm approved by the Bank[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, FGU is bound to pay the Spouses Roxas and Philtrust Bank as solidary creditors and not joint creditors.</p><p align="center"><strong> II</strong> </p><p> Dominguez is liable to pay liquidated damages to the Spouses Roxas under the Contract of Building Construction from scheduled date of completion until the time he effectively abandoned the project.</p><p> The Contract of Building Construction contains the following stipulation for liquidated damages: </p><blockquote> <p> 6.

What is decisive for the recovery of liquidated damages in this case is the fact of delay in the completion of the works.</p><p> The law allows parties to stipulate on liquidated damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> A clause on liquidated damages is normally added to construction contracts not only to provide indemnity for damages but also to ensure performance of the contractor "by the threat of greater responsibility in the event of breach."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In <em>Philippine Economic Zone Authority v.

Liquidated damages must necessarily make non-compliance <em>more cumbersome</em> than compliance. Otherwise, contracts might as well make no threat of a penalty at all:</p> <blockquote> <p> Liquidated damages are those that the parties agree to be paid in case of a breach. As worded, the amount agreed upon answers for damages suffered by the owner due to delays in the completion of the project. Under Philippine laws, these damages take the nature of penalties.

It is attached to an obligation in order to ensure performance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> If this Court goes by FGU's reasoning that the liquidated-damages clause does not apply in case of abandonment, then, in effect, this Court diminishes or disregards altogether the coercive force of this stipulation. Moreover, it is contrary to the intention of the parties because it was clearly provided that liquidated damages are recoverable for delay in the completion of the project; hence, there is more reason in case of non-completion. </p><p> Thus, this Court holds that Dominguez is bound to pay liquidated damages from September 23, 1979, the scheduled date of completion, until October 31, 1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> when he effectively abandoned the project. FGU cannot be held liable for it because it is not a party to the Contract of Building Construction.

This court believes that the defendant spouses reneged in their obligations . . . <em><strong>Moreover, the defendant spouses borrowed sums of money which should be used for the project but instead, were diverted to their personal benefits ... </strong></em>This court has assessed the sincerity of Rosendo Doming[u]ez to make good his commitment but there was no rec[i]procity with regards to the spouses Roxases.<em><strong> There was no attempt to comply with their agreement and moreover, they got money from Rosendo Dominguez for their personal benefit. </strong></em>The failure of the defendant Philipine Trust Company to release the balance of P24,000 to Rosendo Dominguez was because of his failure to submit the invoices and receipts of the previous releases other than the P450,000.00. However, there is no proof that the subsequent releases were diverted from the use they were intended. <em><strong>Only the amount of P73,136.75 went to the spouses Roxases. </strong></em>To require Rosendo Dominguez to return these amounts to the [Philtrust] Bank would be unfair to the plaintiff in the absence of proof that he spent the amount for other purposes.

Aside from this, the real properties promised were also different from those shown to him. It also found sufficient evidence showing the Spouses Roxas' debt to Dominguez in the amount of P73,136.75.</p><p> In this case, the factual findings of the trial court, which were affirmed by the Court of Appeals, were based on substantial evidence and were not refuted with contrary proof by the Spouses Roxas.

No. 171897.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> That case involved the execution of the final and executory December 26, 1988 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bataan, with the dispositive portion as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment (a) Ordering the issuance of a writ of permanent injunction perpetually enjoining defendant Philippine Trust Company and defendant provincial sheriff of Bataan or any of his deputies from foreclosing extrajudicially the real estate mortgage(s) executed in its favor by plaintiffs covering the real properties subject of this action;</p> <p> <b><i>(b) Condemning said defendant bank to pay to plaintiffs: (1) Ordinary damages for breach of the provisions of the contract of building construction (Exits.

No. 171897 that while this case was pending in the trial court, Philtrust Bank sought to extra-judicially foreclose the mortgaged properties of the Spouses Roxas. Consequently, the Spouses Roxas filed a complaint against Philtrust Bank for damages with preliminary injunction in the Regional Trial Court of Bataan docketed as Civil Case No. 4809. The Regional Trial Court of Bataan eventually ruled in favor of the Spouses Roxas. Upon the finality of the decision, the Spouses Roxas sought and were granted a writ of execution. Philtrust Bank opposed the issuance of the writ all the way up to this Court in G.R. No. 171897 mainly setting up the defense of legal compensation to offset the judgment debt due to the Spouses Roxas against the latter's loan obligation to Philtrust Bank. This Court rejected Philtrust Bank's contention on several grounds. This Court ruled that this defense of legal compensation to offset Philtrust Bank's judgment debt against the Spouses Roxas' loan obligation was belatedly raised. Additionally, legal compensation could not take place because the amount and demandibility of the loan obligation are still being disputed, and hence, could not be considered liquidated. Finally, this Court found Philtrust Bank guilty of forum shopping.</p><p> The question of Philtrust Bank's liability for unauthorized release of the funds has already been settled in Civil Case No. 4809, Philtrust Bank has been adjudged liable by the Regional Trial Court of Bataan to the Spouses Roxas for damages of P100,000.00 for breach of the provisions of the Contract of Building Construction in a decision that has already attained finality.
