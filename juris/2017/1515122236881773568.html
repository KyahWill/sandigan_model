				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As laypersons, seafarers cannot be expected to make completely accurate accounts of their state of health. Unaware of the nuances of medical conditions, they may, in good faith, make statements that tum out to be false. These honest mistakes do not negate compensability for disability arising from pre-existing illnesses shown to be aggravated by their working conditions. However, when a seafarer's proper knowledge of pre-existing conditions and intent to deceive an employer are established, compensability is negated.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure praying that the assailed April 10, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and July 18, 4013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Section 32 of the POEA-SEC provides a schedule of disabilities and their corresponding impediment grades.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The grades range from 1 to 14, with 1 being the most severe and entailing the highest amount of compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC provides a non-exhaustive list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of diseases considered as occupational. The mere occurrence of a listed illness does not automatically engender compensability. The first paragraph of Section 32-A requires the satisfaction of all of its listed general conditions "[f]or an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable":<br><blockquote>Section 32-A OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES<br><br>For an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>To enable compensation, an occupational disease and ensuing death or disability must, thus, be "work-related";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that is to say that there must be a "reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Common sense dictates that an illness could not possibly have been "contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> if it has been existing before the seafarer's services are engaged. Still, preÂ­ existing illnesses may be aggravated by the seafarer's working conditions. To the extent that any such aggravation is brought about by the work of the seafarer, compensability ensues:<br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that for illness to be compensable, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, <i>at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>Consistent with the basic standard in labor cases and other administrative proceedings, the linkage between the disease or its aggravation and the working conditions of a seafarer must be proven by substantial evidence. In <i>Jebsens Maritime v. Undag</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote>In labor cases as in other administrative proceedings, substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion is required. The oft-repeated rule is that whoever claims entitlement to the benefits provided by law should establish his or her right thereto by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. <i>The evidence must be real and substantial, and not merely apparent; for the duty to prove work-causation or work-aggravation imposed by law is real and not merely apparent.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Compensability is not limited to Section 32-A's listed occupational diseases. For as long as seafarers are able to show by substantial evidence that they suffered disabilities occasioned by a disease contracted on account of or aggravated by working conditions, compensation is availing:<br><blockquote>Of course, the law recognizes that under certain circumstances, certain diseases not otherwise considered as an occupational disease under the POEA-SEC may nevertheless have been caused or aggravated by the seafarer's working conditions. In these situations, the law recognizes the inherent paucity of the list and the difficulty, if not the outright improbability, of accounting for all the known and unknown diseases that may be associated with, caused or aggravated by such working conditions.<br><br>Hence, the POEA-SEC provides for a disputable presumption of work-relatedness for non-POEA-SEC-listed occupational disease and the resulting illness or injury which he may have suffered during the term of his employment contract.<br><br>This disputable presumption is made in the law to signify that the non inclusion in the list of compensable diseases/illnesses does not translate to an absolute exclusion from disability benefits. In other words, the disputable presumption does not signify an automatic grant of compensation and/or benefits claim; the seafarer must still prove his entitlement to disability benefits by substantial evidence of his illness' work-relatedness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br></div><br>The POEA-SEC bars the compensability of disability arising from a pre-existing illness when attended by an employee's fraudulent misrepresentation. Section 20(E) of the POEA-SEC states:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">E. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">A seafarer who knowingly conceals and does not disclose past medical condition, disability and history in the pre-employment medical examination constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation and shall disqualify him from any compensation and benefits. This may also be a valid ground for termination of employment and imposition of the appropriate administrative and legal sanctions.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The POEA-SEC's terminology is carefully calibrated: it does not merely speak of incorrectness or falsity, or of incompleteness or inexactness. Rather, to negate compensability, it requires <i>fraudulent misrepresentation</i>.<br><br>To speak of fraudulent misrepresentation is not only to say that a person failed to disclose the truth but that he or she deliberately concealed it for a malicious purpose. To amount to fraudulent misrepresentation, falsity must be coupled with intent to deceive and to profit from that deception.<br><br>Consequently, reasonable leeway may be extended for inability to make complete and fastidiously accurate accounts when this inability arises from venial human limitation and frailty. This is a normal tendency for laypersons-such as seafarers-rendering accounts of their own medical conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Prospective seafarers undergo a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) to determine if they are fit to work.

First is information obtained from and colored by the prospective seafarer's opinion, i.e., information on medical history gained from probing questions asked to prospective seafarers and answered by them to the best of their knowledge. Second is information generated by procedures conducted by health professionals. From these, a determination is made on whether a prospective seafarer is fit, unfit, or temporarily unfit for sea duty:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>C.

Apart from one's literal body, a prospective seafarer's only other contribution to a medical examination is a set of responses to questions. A seafarer's personal health assessment is home by his or her amateur opinion, or otherwise unrefined understanding of nuanced medical conditions. In contrast, the procedures attendant to a PEME are conducted and supervised by professionals with sGientific and technical capabilities. Their examinations generate verifiable empirical data, which are then evaluated by a physician.<br><br>A PEME is not expected to be an in-depth examination of a seafarer's health.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Still, it must fulfill its purpose of ascertaining a prospective seafarer's capacity for safely performing tasks at sea. Thus, if it concludes that a seafarer, even one with an existing medical condition, is "fit for sea duty," it must, on its face, be taken to mean that the seafarer is well in a position to engage in employment aboard a sea vessel "without danger to his health."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>A recommendation stating that a seafarer is "fit for sea duty" when standardized procedures would readily reveal that he or she is not can only mean that medical examiners failed to diligently screen a seafarer. The persons responsible for the examination are then bound by their negligence. Ultimately, it is more appropriate that the examining physician, a trained professional, and not the seafarer, who is a layperson, be faulted for discounting the presence of diseases even after subjecting the seafarer to a series of procedures.<br><br>For its part, a recruiting employer is expected to know the physical demands of a seafarer's engagement. It is then equally expected to peruse the results of PEMEs to ensure that, healthwise, its recruits are up to par. An employer who admits a physician's "fit to work" detennination binds itself to that conclusion and its necessary consequences. This includes compensating the seafarer for the aggravation of negligently or deliberately overlooked conditions.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Essential hypertension is among the occupational diseases enumerated in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC.

Any definition of hypertension is therefore, arbitrary.<br><br>....<br><br>The cardiovascular risks associated with a given blood pressure are dependent upon the combination of risk factors in the specific individual. These include age, gender, weight, physical inactivity, smoking, family history, serum cholesterol, diabetes mellitus and pre existing vascular disease. Effective management of hypertension therefore requires a holistic approach that is based on the identification of those at highest cardiovascular risk and the adoption of multifactorial interventions, targeting not only blood pressure but all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.<br><br>In light of these observations[,] a practical definition of hypertension is 'the level of blood pressure at which the benefits of treatment outweigh the costs and hazards'.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>Consistent with this, "most [hypertensive] patients remain asymptomatic";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and frequently, patients only discover that they are hypertensive because of a routine examination or because complications have arisen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The POEA-SEC's treatment of essential hypertension recognizes its gradations. To enable compensation, the mere occurrence of hypertension, even as it is work-related and concurs with the four basic requisites of the first paragraph of Section 32-A, does not suffice. The POEA-SEC requires an element of gravity. It speaks of essential hypertension only as an overture to the "impairment of function of body organs like kidneys, heart, eyes and brain." This impairment must then be of such severity as to be "resulting in permanent disability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Section 32-A, paragraph 2(20), thus, requires three successive occurrences: first, the contracting of essential hypertension; second, organ impairment arising from essential hypertension; and third, permanent disability arising from that impairment.<br><br>In keeping with the requisite gravity occasioning essential hypertension, the mere averment of essential hypertension and its incidents do not suffice. In addition to the substantive requirements of essential hypertension's being the cause of organ impairment leading to permanent disability, the POEA-SEC identifies documentary requirements for considering a claim under Section 32-A, paragraph 2(20). As is evident from the use of the conjunctive word "and," this enumeration is inclusive and cumulative, rather than alternative. Accordingly, all documentary requirements must be submitted and satisfied; otherwise, a claim for benefits should not be entertained. These prerequisites are: first, a chest x-ray report; second, an electrocardiogram (ECG) report; third, a blood chemistry report; fourth, a funduscopy report; and fifth, a C-T Scan.<br><br>The POEA-SEC also includes cardio-vascular diseases in its list of occupational diseases. They are compensable if, in addition to the requirements of the first paragraph of Section 32-A, <i>any</i> of the conditions listed in Section 32-A, paragraph 2(11) are attendant:<br><blockquote>11. Cardio-Vascular Diseases. Any of the following conditions must be met:<br><ol type="a"><li>If the heart disease was known to have been present during employment, there must be proof thut an acute exacerbation was clearly precipitated by the unusual strain by reasons of the nature ofhis work.<br><br></li><li>The strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship.<br><br></li><li>If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Diabetes is not among Section 32-A's listed occupational diseases. As with hypertension, it is a complex medical condition typified by gradations. Blood sugar levels classify as normal, pre-diabetes, or diabetes depending on the glucose level of a patient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="25%"><div align="center"></div><br></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Normal </strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Pre-diabetes</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Diabetes Mellitus</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">FPG</div></td><td><div align="center">&lt;5.6 mmol/L</div></td><td><div align="center">5.6-6.9 mmol/L</div></td><td><div align="center"><u>&gt;</u>7.0 mmol/L</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">2-h PG</div></td><td><div align="center">&lt;7.8 mmol/L</div></td><td><div align="center">7.8-11.0 mmol/L</div></td><td><div align="center"><u>&gt;</u>11.1 mmol/L</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">HbA1C</div></td><td><div align="center">&lt;5.6%</div></td><td><div align="center">5.7-6.4%</div></td><td><div align="center"><u>&gt;</u>6.5% </div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Diabetes "is a clinical syndrome characterised by hyperclycaemia due to absolute or relative deficiency of insulin."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It can cause several symptoms depending on its type, Type 1 or Type 2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Patients with Type 1 diabetes show more prominent symptoms, while patients with Type 2 diabetes are mostly asymptomatic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> However, the symptoms between these two types may overlap.

Even the POEA-SEC's appreciation of essential hypertension proceeds from an understanding that hypertension per se does not equate to disability warranting cessation of work and entailing compensation. Rather, it concedes that hypertension is identified by degrees of severity.<br><br>Hypertension and diabetes can be difficult to recognize because of gradations whose demarcations are not readily perceptible and because they can be asymptomatic. This is especially true in their mild stages. Even in relatively advanced stages, their symptoms may be generic that they are as ea sly mistaken to be indicating other conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The greater possibility, then, is that a seafarer's self-assessment of personal medical conditions will fail to capture nuances that can make the difference between fitness and unfitness for work As laypersons, they do not have the requisite medical knowledge to properly characterize their illnesses. Even if they are aware of their own medical conditions, they may, in their non professional opinion but still in good faith, be convinced that their conditions are not so sey re and that they can manage to perform work aboard a vessel. Seafarers cannot be held to account under an inordinate standard. The POEA-SEC takes exception to fraudulent misrepresentation, not to honest mistakes.<br><br><center><b>VI</b><br></center><br>This Court finds petitioner to have knowingly and fraudulently misrepresented himself as not afflicted with hypertension or diabetes. He did not merely make inaccuracies in good faith but engaged in serial dishonesty. Thus, this Court affirms the Decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>During his PEME, petitioner was recorded to have "categorically answered 'No' when asked whether he has ever suffered from or has been told to have hypertension and diabetes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> After repatriation and while being treated by Dr. Barrairo, the company-designated physician, he again "denied that he ha[d] any past history of diabetes and hypertension."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>However, in the medical opinion and evaluation prepared by his own physician, Dr. San Luis, petitioner was indicated to not only have admitted that "he ha[d] a past history of hypertension and diabetes,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> but even that he was "regularly taking Enalapril and Metformin respectively to treat the said illnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Forced into a corner by his own conflicting declarations, petitioner attempted to extricate himself by disavowing the declarations he made in his PEME and claiming that it was the examining physician who failed to accurately reflect his responses on his examination certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's assertion is an admission that he fully knew of his conditions at the moment he was examined, rendering it pointless for this Court to consider whether he was merely confused at the time of his examination. Additionally, his assertion burdens him with the task of proving his claims. As he was duty-bound to truthfully answer questions during his examination, petitioner must show that despite his knowledge, he did not willfully or deceptively withhold information. Likewise, his imputation of the examining physician's liability despite the examination certificate's indication that his responses were duly recorded is an affirmative defense or an alternative version of events that becomes his burden to prove.<br><br>Petitioner failed to discharge his burden. On the contrary, the confluence of circumstances belies his claims.<br><br>Petitioner adequately understood the significance of the declarations attributed to him in his examination certificate. Petitioner's engagement aboard the MIV Seaboxer was not his first stint as a seafarer. He had been a seafarer since 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> although he worked for respondents, on and off, only since 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> His prolonged seafaring experience must have familiarized him with the conduct of PEMEs and the need for him to give truthful answers. He explicitly declared, too, that he was "aware of the contents of Section 20.E [on misrepresentation] in the POEA [Standard Employment Contract]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Certainly, his awareness of Section 20(E) must have impressed upon him not only the potentil complications of what he claims to be a false declaration foisted on him by the examining physician but also the urgency of rectifying that error. Instead, he remained silent and did nothing. Petitioner's concession by omission militates against him.<br><br>This Court has nothing to rely on but petitioner's bare recollection. This does not satisfy, He should have actively endeavored to demonstrate that the false declarations in his examination certificate were anomalous, stray errors. As a seafarer since 1994, he must have completed several other medical examinations. His good faith could have ben substantiated by prior acts in analogous situations. He could have presented copies of the certificates for his previous medical examinations, but he did not These would have shown that while the responses he otiered about his conditions in prior instances had been properly recorded, the examining physician during his March 23, 2010 examination failed to render an accurate account.<br><br>It is, of course, possible that prior to his most recent medical examination on March 23, 2010, petitioner had not been diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes. This would make it impossible for him to present evidence of countervailing prior declarations. However, even conceding this, petitioners good faith is belied by other circumstances attending this case.<br><br>Petitioner's good faith could have been demonstrated by his subsequent acts. Knowing full well that a false declaration was made on his examination certificate, petitioner should, at the very least, not have compounded it. Instead of this, however, he maintained before Dr. Barrairo upon repatriation that he had no history of either hypertension or diabetes. It was only before his personally chosen physician did petitioner admit to not only a history of diabetes and hypertension but even to the maintenance medications he had been taking to address those illnesses.<br><br>A measure of good faith can be appreciated on the part of a seafarer who is unable to grasp the nuances of his or her medical condition. This Court is unable to appreciate this good faith here. Petitioner knew that his illnesses were of such severity that he needed to take maintenance medicine. Despite this, he consistently maintained that he had no history of hypertension or diabetes. Finally confronted with his own discrepant statements he denied accountability by shifting the blame to a person who was beyond the reach of the proceedings he had initiated.<br><br>We are not a trier of facts and only questions of law may be brought before this Court in Rule 45 petitions. Faced with nothing more than petitioner's self-serving, unsubstantiated backtracking on his own inconsistencies, we see no need to deviate from the uniform findings of the Labor Arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals. Petitioner's disavowals were not statements made in good faith but were part of a serial utterance of lies.<br><br><center><b>VII</b><br></center><br>It works no less in petitioner's favor that he failed to observe the procedure outlined by the POEA-SEC concerning disputed disability assessments by company-designated physicians. Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC requires referral to a third physician in the event of diverging findings by a company-designated physician and a seafarer's personally chosen physician:<br><blockquote>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS<br><br>....<br><br>B.

Rosales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> explained the significance of this referral and emphasized that it is "mandatory":<br><blockquote>This referral to a third doctor has been held by this Court to be a mandatory proc dure as a consequence of the provision that it is the company-designated doctor whose sessment should prevail. In other words, the company can insist on its disability rating even against a contrary opinion by another doctor, unless the seafarer expresses his disagreement by king for the referral to a third doctor who shall make his or her determination and whose decision is final and binding on the parties. We have followed this rule in a string of cases, among them, <i>Philippine Hammonia, Ayungo v. Beamko Shipmanagement Corp., Santiago v. Pacbasin Shipmanagement, Inc., Andrada v. Agemar Manning Agency</i>, and <i>Masangkay v. Trans-Global Maritime Agency, Inc.</i> Thus, at this point, the matter of referral pursuant to the provision of the POEAÂ­SEC is a settled ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Petitioner made no effort to comply with the required referral. He did not even consult a personally chosen physician before filing his Complaint.&nbsp; Upon repatriation, the company-designated physician, Dr. Barrairo, assessed petitioner and twice rendered Grade 10 disability assessments in September 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Disagreeing with these assessments, petitioner would proceed to file his Complaint on October 21, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In need of support for his Complaint, only two months after would petitioner pick a personal physician, Dr. San Luis, to seek another opinion.

However, his failure to observe Section 20(B)(3)'s requirements is not all that there is to this case. We cite his non-referral to a third physician, not as a mitigating circumstance, but to emphasize how multi-layered exigencies militate against him. We have explained at length how petitioner engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation, deceptively concealing his pre-existing hypertension and diabetes. This, in itself, is fatal to his cause.

Mendoza, Third Division]:<br><br>At any rate, said finding ought not to be given more weight than the disability grading given by the company-designated doctor. The POEA Standard Employment Contract clearly provides that when a seafarer sustains a work-related illness or injury while on board the vessel, his fitness or unfitness for work shall be determined by the company-designated physician. However, if the doctor appointed by the seafarer makes a finding contrary to that of the assessment of the companyÂ­-designated physician, the opinion of a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer as the decision final and binding on both of them. In this case, Santiago did not avail of this procedure. There was no agreement on a third doctor who shall examine him anew and whose finding shall be final and binding. Thus, this Court is left without choice but to uphold the certification made by Dr. Lim with respect to Santiago's disability. (Citation omitted)</div>
