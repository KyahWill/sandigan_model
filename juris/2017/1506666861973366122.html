She insists that said Order has become final and executory, <i>because Dr. Magalit did not appeal it</i>.<br><br>We disagree. Final, in the phrase <i>judgments or final orders</i> found in Section 49 of Rule 39, has two accepted interpretations. In the first sense, it is an order that one can no longer appeal because the period to do so has expired, or because the order has been affirmed by the highest possible tribunal involved. The second sense connotes that it is an order that <i>leaves nothing else to be done</i>, as distinguished from one that is interlocutory. The phrase refers to a. <i>final determination</i> as opposed to a judgment or an order that settles only some incidental, subsidiary or collateral matter arising in an action; for example, an order postponing a trial, denying a motion to dismiss or allowing intervention. <i>Orders that give rise to <i>res judicata</i> and conclusiveness of judgment apply only to those falling under the second category.</i><br><br>....<br><br>For example, an Order overruling a motion to dismiss does not give rise to <i>res adjudicata</i> [sic] that will bar a subsequent action, because <i>such order is merely interlocutory and is subject to amendments until the rendition of the final judgment</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>A decision denying a petition for bail settles only a collateral matter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup>—whether accused is entitled to provisional liberty—and is not a final judgment on accused's guilt or innocence.

Kapunan, First Division]. Kho involves three (3) petitions for bail filed before the Regional Trial Court. Then Regional Trial Court Judge Lucas Bersamin (now Supreme Court Associate Justice) denied the first bail petition, and then the second bail petition on the ground that there was no new matter or fact that would lead the trial court to reconsider its previous denial of the bail application. Judge Bersamin granted the third bail petition, ruling that the prosecution failed to establish any linkage between the accused and the alleged gunman. The case primarily involved the voluntary inhibition of Judge Bersamin after he granted the third bail application. This Court ordered Judge Bersamin to proceed with the trial of the case as his voluntary inhibition "was not in the exercise of sound discretion[.]" Simply put, this Court found nothing irregular about Judge Bersamin's reversal of his earlier rulings that denied the bail application. At the very least, Kho implicitly recognized that a court may validly reverse its previous denials of a bail application.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 39-40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Id. at 42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> Id. at 42-43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Id. at 36-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Id. at 42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Id. at 216.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> <i>People v.
