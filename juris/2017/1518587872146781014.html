				<H3>RE: JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 20, CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, MISAMIS ORIENTAL<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DEL CASTILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present administrative matter arose from the judicial audit conducted on March 12 and 13, 2013, of Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, then presided by Judge Bonifacio M. Macabaya (Judge Macabaya). <p> In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 17, 2013, the audit team found that out of the 573 cases examined by it, (1) 69 cases were submitted for decision but have yet to be decided despite the lapse of the 90-day period [as mandated by par. 1, Section 15, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution];<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (2) 33 cases with pending incidents were not yet resolved despite the lapse of the reglementary period to resolve them; and (3) 155 cases were dormant and unacted upon for a considerable length of time. </p><p> The audit team noted the following irregularities: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. In Criminal Case No. 2001-888 entitled<em> People [v.] Jabinao</em>, the [RTC] issued an Order dated 22 November 2011 directing the accused to secure another bond within five (5) days from notice, '<em>it appearing that the bond put up by the accused had already expired</em>.' The Order [goes against] Sec. 2(a) of Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that '<em>(t)he undertaking shall be effective upon approval, and unless cancelled, shall remain in force at all stages of the case until promulgation of the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, irrespective of whether the case was originally filed in or appealed to it</em>.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p> <p> 2. In Criminal Case Nos. 2000-260 and 2000-316, both entitled<em> People [v.] Alba, et. al</em>. as well as Criminal Case Nos. 2002-098 and 2002-100, [also] both entitled <em>People [v.] Alba</em>, the [RTC] issued twin Orders, both dated 26 September 2006, directing the issuance of a Warrant of Arrest against the accused for his failure to appear[,] and directing the Branch Clerk of Court '<em>to receive evidence of the prosecution through ex-parte hearing</em>' - [in violation of] the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure [and by] existing jurisprudence x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, the audit team noted inaccuracies in the RTC's February 2013 report. It failed to include 43 cases already submitted for decision and 13 cases with unresolved motions, while it prematurely reported six cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> as submitted for decision, although the records did not show that the appellees received the appellants' briefs or memoranda, against which the prescribed period within which to submit the formers' briefs or memoranda should be reckoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> These omissions and inaccuracies in the report violated paragraph 8 of the Guidelines and Instructions in Administrative Circular No. 61-2001 dated December 10, 2001, which state that "<em>(i)nfilling up Item No. VI x x x where all the data needed must be indicated, include all cases with unresolved motions which may determine the disposition of the cases, e.g., Motion to Dismiss on Demurrer to Evidence. Patent non-indication of undecided cases or unresolved motions is tantamount to falsification of official document."</em> </p><p>In addition, the audit team discovered that the docket books for civil cases were not updated regularly; the docket inventory for the period July-December 2012 suffered from a number of defects in form; and, there was no judgment book, no book of entries of judgment, nor an execution book.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> The audit team furthermore noted the constant presence and active participation of Judge Macabaya's wife during the entire judicial audit although she was not a court employee. She was observed to be handing over case records to, and talking with, the court staff. When this matter was brought to the attention of Judge Macabaya, the latter assured the audit team that he was in full control of the actions of his wife, and even acknowledged "that she has been a big help x x x [in] overseeing the administrative functions of his office, [thus allowing] him to focus his attention on his judicial functions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> In a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated April 4, 2013, Judge Macabaya's Clerk of Court V Atty. Taumaturgo U. Macabinlar (Atty. Macabinlar) submitted a copy of an Action Plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for the Period April 2013 to April 2014, bearing the signature of Judge Macabaya himself. The Action Plan was "formulated as a result of (their) discussions with the Supreme Court Audit Team and (their) brainstorming session with all the Branch 20 staff," and "is intended to make a more lasting plan of action to prevent recurring audit exceptions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> The audit team noted that the action plan provided for a single strategy only and an inflexible time frame for the disposition of three kinds of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Hence, the audit team recommended that the Action Plan be revised to make it more specific and more results-oriented for easier measurement of output. </p><p> Taking a holistic approach, the audit team made the following recommendations to Judge Macabaya to: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">1.1</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">SUBMIT x x x within fifteen (15) days x x x a revised action plan, incorporating therein the strategies, specific courses of action and the corresponding time frame[s], to be measured by specific number of calendar days, for: (a) the disposition of the cases x x x; (b) the resolution of the incidents or motions x x x; and (c) all the other judicial audit findings above x x x; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">1.2</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Immediately TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION on the untranscribed stenographic notes taken down by then court stenographer Oscar P.

Macabinlar, merely submitted copies of the Decisions and Orders in some of the cases enumerated in the April 17, 2013 Memorandum; and this was done despite the passage of almost 10 months. Thus, in a letter-directive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to Judge Macabaya dated March 14, 2014, Deputy Court Administrator (DCA) Jenny Lind R. Aldecoa-Delorino (DCA Aldecoa-Delorino) reiterated the recommendations above. </p> <p> In reply thereto, on May 12, 2014, Judge Macabaya attached another set of copies of orders, resolutions, and decisions, without any other explanation other than the inadvertent attachment of the letter-directive to the RTC's October 2013 monthly report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Via a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated May 19, 2014, one month after the deadline set in the action plan, DCA Aldecoa-Delorino gave an updated summary on the number of cases that had not yet been decided or resolved, and acted upon. This letter likewise reiterated the directive for Judge Macabaya to comply with the audit team's Memorandum, particularly item nos. 2, 3, 8 and 9, with a reminder that "<i>all directives coming from the Court Administrator and his deputies are issued in the exercise of the Court's administrative supervision of trial courts and their personnel, hence, should be respected. These directives are not mere requests but should be complied with promptly and completely</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Thus, DCA Aldecoa­-Delorino directed Judge Macabaya to: </p><ol><li> EXPLAIN x x x the delay in: (a) deciding the remaining thirty [30] cases x x x; (b) resolving the incidents in the remaining fifteen (15) cases listed x x x; and (c) taking appropriate actions [on] the remaining fifty-seven [57] dormant cases x x x; and SUBMIT the same to this Office within fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof; <br><br></li><li> SUBMIT x x x within fifteen (15) from receipt hereof a copy of each of the decisions, orders[,] or resolutions, if any, rendered or issued in the cases referred to above; and <br><br></li><li> SUBMIT x x x within fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof a written report on the actions x x x taken on x x x the directives contained in our Memorandum dated 19 April 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </li></ol> <p> In a letter-compliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated June 30, 2014, Judge Macabaya attached copies of the decisions, resolutions and orders rendered or issued by his court. He then asked for a 90-day extension to decide or resolve the remaining cases, giving as reason therefor the court's heavy caseload and claiming that the remaining cases submitted for decision comprised "mainly of those referred to the Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Taumaturgo U. Macabinlar[,] for ex-parte hearing x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> Owing to Judge Macabaya's repeated failure to fully comply with the directives of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for more than one year,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court on December 1, 2014 resolved to: </p><blockquote> <p> 1.

RELIEVE Judge Macabaya of his judicial and administrative functions, effective immediately and to continue until further orders from the Court, EXCEPT to: (a) DECIDE the remaining twenty-eight (28) cases submitted for decision; (b) RESOLVE the remaining eleven (11) cases with incidents for resolution; and (c) TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS [on] the remaining thirty-eight (38) dormant cases; </p> <p> 3. WITHHOLD the salaries and other benefits accruing to Judge Macabaya, effective immediately until such time that the Court shall have ordered the restoration of his judicial and administrative functions; </p> <p> 4.

ENTITLE Judge Bollozos to x x x traveling expenses with per diems (if applicable), as well as an additional expense allowance and judicial incentive allowance, x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On February 18, 2015, Judge Macabaya filed a Motion for Reconsideration/Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> claiming that the penalties imposed upon him were unjust because they were solely based on the Memorandum dated April 17, 2013; that no formal charge had been filed against him, nor had any investigation been conducted relative to any administrative case filed against him. Simply put, Judge Macabaya insisted that he was not given his day in court, as he "was not apprised of any administrative complaint about him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> Judge Macabaya then filed a Supplemental Explanation to the Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> reiterating the arguments he put forward in his MR, and further claiming that some unresolved cases, those filed between 1971 to 2009, had long been submitted for decision, and were well within the extension of time he had requested in his compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Judge Macabaya claimed that the judicial audit mistakenly and inaccurately found that there were only 26 inherited cases when in fact he inherited no more than 361 unresolved cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Judge Macabaya also argued that the audit team's recommendation that he be made to resolve one case per day was "preposterous if not downright impossible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Nevertheless, Judge Macabaya hastened to add that he was ready to dispose of the remaining inherited cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> On March 5, 2015, Judge Macabaya filed a Recapitulative Statement with Urgent Reiterative Motion to Lift the Suspension of Administrative and Judicial Functions and the Release of Salaries, Benefits[,] and Emoluments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> to enable him to "issue orders and help in the restoration and reconstitution of the records of cases scorched by fire."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> On March 16, 2015, this Court referred Judge Macabaya's (1) motion for reconsideration/explanation dated February 16, 2015; (2) supplemental explanation to the motion for reconsideration dated February 27, 2015, and (3) recapitulative statement with urgent reiterative motion to lift the suspension of administrative and judicial function and the release of salaries, benefits and emoluments dated March 4, 2015, to the OCA for evaluation, report, and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated May 7, 2015, the OCA recommended that the matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative complaint; that Judge Macabaya be adjudged guilty of gross misconduct (due to his failure to comply with the OCA and this Court's directives) and also of gross ignorance of the law or procedure;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and that Judge Macabaya be dismissed "from the service, with forfeiture of his retirement benefits, except his accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reinstatement in any branch of government, including government­ owned and controlled corporations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> The OCA explained that Judge Macabaya and his court staff never questioned the findings and observations of the audit team; and that Judge Macabaya even undertook to decide all the cases/incidents listed in the audit findings within one year from April 2013. The OCA noted that in all five of his letters-compliance with the April 19, 2013 Memorandum of the OCA, Judge Macabaya never took issue with such findings, but instead merely submitted copies of his Decisions and Orders on the cases submitted for decision in his sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Needless to say, the derelictions imputed against Judge Macabaya constituted insubordination, disrespect, and disdain against the authority of this Court, as these acts stemmed from his deliberate failure to comply with the directives of the OCA - which directives contained the command to "be complied with promptly and completely."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The OCA likewise noted the officious interference of Judge Macabaya's wife in the court's functions - an observation that was never refuted by Judge Macabaya; this, in turn, further tarnished Judge Macabaya's already compromised integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, the OCA affirmed the findings of the audit team that Judge Macabaya's Order dated November 22, 2011 in Criminal Case No. 2001-888,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and his twin Orders dated September 26, 2006 in Criminal Case Nos. 2000-260,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> 2000-316<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and 2000-098,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> were clearly violative of the Constitution and the law, thus rendering Judge Macabaya guilty of ignorance of the law and procedure.</p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b> </p><p> Whether Judge Macabaya is guilty of gross misconduct and of gross ignorance of the law, warranting his dismissal from the service and the forfeiture of his retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), with prejudice to reinstatement in any branch of government, including government-owned and controlled corporations. </p><p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> We adopt and agree with the OCA's findings but with modification as regards the recommended penalty. </p><p> Judge Macabaya claimed that the audit team made vague and sweeping accusations that were allegedly meant to mislead and misinform the Court about the status of cases pending before his sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> He also insisted that the administrative charges against him were made without notice and hearing, hence violative of his right to due process. Judge Macabaya moreover assailed the Report/Memorandum dated April 17, 2013, saying that the 264-working day-period requiring him to decide or resolve 168 cases was unrealistic due to (1) the cases' voluminous records, (2) his sala's receipt of 761 new cases upon his assumption into office, (3) his appointment as acting presiding judge of the RTC Branch 9 in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, (4) the assignment to his court of other cases from other courts caused by the inhibition of other judges, and (5) his busy schedule of hearings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Lastly, Judge Macabaya maintained that as much as he was willing to decide the 12 remaining cases that he had inherited, he was unable to do so because of the conflagration that gutted the records in the Hall of Justice of Cagayan de Oro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Judge Macabaya's arguments lack basis. </p><p> We find it surprising that throughout the breadth and length of the space and time that were accorded to him as shown in the OCA's (1) Memorandum dated April 19, 2013, (2) the letter dated March 14, 2014, and (3) the letter dated May 19, 2014, Judge Macabaya never protested against the validity or correctness of the judicial audit's findings. Interestingly, it was only after this Court resolved on December 1, 2014 to withhold his salaries and benefits that he started to question the audit findings. However, his assertion that the audit findings were incorrect or baseless, is self-serving and lacked credence vis-a-vis the clear-cut and well-supported findings of the audit team.</p><p> Judge Macabaya's woeful lamentation that his right to due process had been violated fails to persuade. It is axiomatic that due process requires nothing else but the opportunity to be heard - by no means does it require a formal, trial­ type hearing. Thus we held in <em>F/O Ledesma v. Court of Appeals</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Due process, as a constitutional precept, does not always and in all situations require a trial-type proceeding. Due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend himself. In administrative proceedings, the filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process. The essence of due process is simply to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, Judge Macabaya was given ample opportunities to be heard. Indeed, as early as April 19, 2013, Judge Macabaya was asked to submit a written explanation to answer the directives issued in the Memorandum dated April 17, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and to comment (in writing) on the observations raised in the judicial audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated March 14, 2014, the OCA acknowledged receipt of Judge Macabaya's and his clerk of court's compliance letter dated July 22, 2013, but noted the lack of explanation/full compliance to its directives, as mandated in the OCA's earlier letters. In the May 19, 2014 OCA letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and December 1, 2014 Court Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Judge Macabaya was directed anew to explain the delay in (1) deciding cases, (2) resolving incidents, and (3) taking appropriate action in dormant cases. Yet, despite such repeated behests and warnings, punctuated by the caveat that "<em>all directives from the Court Administrator and his deputies are issued in the exercise of the Court's administrative supervision of trial courts and their personnel, hence, said directives should be respected [and should not be construed] as mere requests [and] should be complied with promptly and completely</em>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Judge Macabaya only submitted decisions and resolutions on a<strong> piecemeal </strong>basis sans explanation for his failure to comply in full. Judge Macabaya ought to be reminded that: </p><blockquote> <p> A resolution of the Supreme Court should not be construed as a mere request, and should be complied with promptly and completely. Such failure to comply accordingly betrays not only a recalcitrant streak in character, but also disrespect for the Court's lawful order and directive. This contumacious conduct of refusing to abide by the lawful directives issued by the Court has likewise been considered as an utter lack of interest to remain with, if not contempt of, the system. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The records disclose that Judge Macabaya utterly failed to decide the cases submitted for decision or resolve pending incidents within the reglementary period as well as within the time frame that he himself fixed in the initial Action Plan. As noted during the audit, these cases were already deemed submitted for decision much further beyond the period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> allowed by the Constitution and by statute. In <em>Re: Judicial Audit of the RTC, Br. 14, Zamboanga City</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we cited Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which underscores the need to speedily resolve cases, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The Supreme Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. Failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to a speedy disposition of their cases. </p> <p> The office of the judge exacts nothing less than faithful observance of the Constitution and the law in the discharge of official duties. Section 15 (1), Article VIII of the Constitution mandates that cases or matters filed with the lower courts must be decided or resolved within three months from the date they are submitted for decision or resolution. Moreover, Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct directs judges to 'dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.' Judges must closely adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct in order to preserve the integrity, competence, and independence of the judiciary and make the administration of justice more efficient. Time and again, we have stressed the need to strictly observe this duty so as not to negate our efforts to minimize, if not totally eradicate, the twin problems of congestion and delay that have long plagued our courts. Finally, Canons 6 and 7 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics [exhort] judges to be prompt and punctual in the disposition and resolution of cases and matters pending before their courts, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> 6. PROMPTNESS He should be prompt in disposing of all matters submitted to him, remembering that justice delayed is often justice denied. </p> <p> 7. PUNCTUALITY He should be punctual in the performance of his judicial duties, recognizing that the time of litigants, witnesses, and attorneys is of value and that if the judge is unpunctual in his habits, he sets a bad example to the bar and tends to create dissatisfaction with the administration of justice. </p> </blockquote> <p> Parenthetically, Administrative Circular No. 1 dated 28 January 1988, requires all magistrates to observe scrupulously the periods prescribed in Article VII, Section 15 of the Constitution and to act promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts. </p> <p> We cannot overstress this policy on prompt disposition or resolution of cases. Delay in case disposition is a major culprit in the erosion of public faith and confidence in the judiciary and the lowering of its standards. </p> <p> Failure to decide cases within the reglementary period, without strong and justifiable reason, constitutes gross inefficiency warranting the imposition of administrative sanction on the defaulting judge. </p> </blockquote> <p> Nor is there merit in Judge Macabaya's claim that at the time his motion for reconsideration was filed, there were only 11 to 12 cases left undecided or unresolved, and that the period to decide or resolve these cases were within the time extension he prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Judge Macabaya ought to know that requests for extension of time are not always granted as a matter of course and, even if they were, such requests for extension of time in no wise operate to absolve him from administrative liability. Here, the records showed that Judge Macabaya asked for additional time to resolve the cases submitted for decision only on June 30, 2014<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and on November 24, 2014<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> - or 61 and 208 days respectively, past the deadline that Judge Macabaya himself set in the action plan.

Jabinao</em>, Judge Macabaya issued an Order dated November 22, 2011 directing the accused to secure another bail bond within five days from notice, "it appearing that the bond put up by the accused had already expired,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> in clear violation of Section 2(a) Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. Conditions of the Bail; Requirements. — All kinds of bail are subject to the following conditions:</p> <p> (a) The undertaking shall be effective upon approval, and unless cancelled, shall remain in force at all stages of the case until promulgation of the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, irrespective of whether the case was originally filed in or appealed to it; </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> of July 20, 2004, had already clarified that "[u]nless and until the Supreme Court directs otherwise, the lifetime or duration of the effectivity of any bond issued in criminal and civil action/special proceedings, or in any proceeding or incident therein shall be from its approval by the court until the action or proceeding is finally decided, resolved or terminated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> </p><p> Then again, in Criminal Case Nos. 2000-260 and 2000-316, both entitled <em>People v. Alba</em>, and in Criminal Case Nos. 2002-098 and 2002-100, also entitled <em>People v. Alba</em>, Judge Macabaya issued twin Orders directing his Branch Clerk of Court ''to receive evidence of the prosecution through<em> ex-parte</em> hearing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Nowhere in the Rules of Criminal Procedure are Clerks of Court allowed to receive evidence <em>ex-parte</em> in criminal proceedings - unlike in ordinary civil actions and in special proceedings where the judge may delegate such act to his Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> These orders clearly showed gross ignorance of the rules of procedure. Thus, we held in <em>Spouses Lago v. Judge Abul, Jr</em>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law or of the rules, and that, when committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, the rule applies only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment. <u>When the law or the rule is so elementary, not to be aware of it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. One who accepts the exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court proficiency in the law, and the duty to maintain professional competence at all times. When a judge displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he erodes the confidence of the public in the courts</u>. A judge is expected to keep abreast of the developments and amendments thereto, as well as of prevailing jurisprudence. Ignorance of the law by a judge can easily be the mainspring of injustice. (Underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The audit team also noted that Judge Macabaya's wife meddled or interfered with the court's business. Judge Macabaya, however, saw nothing wrong with that, and even claimed that her presence helped him focus more on his judicial functions. Apparently, Judge Macabaya seems to have missed the point of his being the presiding Judge of his court; he seems to be unaware that this unwholesome atmosphere can only further aggravate the court's already fractured integrity and efficiency. It is not too much to say that the court's official business is none of Mrs. Macabaya's officious business. In <em>Gordon v. Judge Lilagan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> we said: </p><blockquote> <p> As pointed out by the Investigating Justice in his factual findings, there is enough evidence on record to show that respondent [judge] permitted [his wife] to have access to court records in order to monitor the dates when cases are submitted for decision. There is impropriety in this. Records of cases are necessarily confidential, and to preserve their integrity and confidentiality, access thereto ought to be limited only to the judge, the parties or their counsel and the appropriate court personnel in charge of the custody thereof. Since [the judge's wife] is not a court employee, much less the employee specifically in charge of the custody of said records, it was improper for respondent to allow her to have access thereto.</p> <p> In this regard, the Code of Judicial Conduct states in no uncertain terms that —</p> <blockquote> <p> Rule 3.08. A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in court management and facilitate the performance of the administrative functions of other judges and court personnel. </p> <p> Rule 3.09. A judge should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity. </p> </blockquote> <p> The foregoing rules should be observed by respondent judge with the help of his staff and without the intervention of his wife who is not a court employee. It needs be stressed in this regard that respondent judge is not wanting in help from his staff to warrant the assistance of one who, while closely related by affinity to respondent judge, is actually an outsider in his sala insofar as official business and court functions are concerned. </p> </blockquote> <p> In sum, Judge Macabaya must be held to account for acts constitutive of serious misconduct and gross ignorance of the law and/or procedure. </p><p> Although this Court has meted out the penalty of dismissal or forfeiture of retirement benefits to judges who were found guilty of several infractions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> such as in this case, we have nevertheless imposed lighter penalties towards members of the bench when mitigating circumstances merit the same. </p><p> Judge Macabaya has continuously rendered almost 31 years of government service - starting as Trial Attorney II of the Citizen's Legal Assistance Office on December 2, 1986, as Public Attorney II of the Public Attorney's Office from January 1, 1990 to March 31, 1997, as a prosecutor on April 1, 1997 up to his appointment to the Judiciary on March 5, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> In the three decades he has been in public service, this Court has not adjudged him guilty of an infraction - with four of the six administrative cases filed against him dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup></p><p> Also, this Court notes that in the four years Judge Macabaya was sitting as Presiding Judge of Branch 20, 761 new cases were raffled to his sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> At the same time, he was appointed as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 9 of the RTC of Malaybalay City, Bukidnon - some 93 kilometers away from his sala - to hear, resolve and dispose of cases in that branch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> This is notwithstanding the assignment of other cases from other courts where judges had inhibited and his continuous hearings in his sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, this Court notes the fire that engulfed the Cagayan de Oro Hall of Justice last January 30, 2015.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> Albeit beyond the prescribed period for Judge Macabaya to act on the cases mentioned in the audit, this may have contributed to the difficulty in disposing of or resolving the remaining cases under his responsibility. </p><p> In light of the above-mentioned circumstances, we believe that a fine equivalent to two (2) months' salary, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with severely, is more commensurate.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, Judge Bonifacio M.
