The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made. </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, EBCC claims that the CTA<em> En Banc</em> erred in failing to consider the judicial admission made by the CIR in her Memorandum that EBCC remitted FWT in the amount of P2,842,630.20. </p><p> We do not agree.</p><p> A careful reading of the Memorandum reveals that the alleged remittance of the amount of P2,842,630.20 was based on a Memorandum Report prepared by the revenue officers recommending the denial of EBCC's protest, which was issued prior to EBCC's filing of its Petition for Review before the CTA. In fact, there was no mention of such remittance in the Joint Stipulations of Facts and Issues by the parties and in the Answer filed by the CIR. Thus, we find no error on the part of the CTA <i>En Banc</i> in not considering such statement as a judicial admission.</p><p> Besides, the CTA Former Second Division, in its April 7, 2011 Resolution already explained how it computed EBCC's deficiency FWT, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> It must be emphasized that the assessment for deficiency FWT against [EBCC] in the amount of P10,227,622.72 is composed of FWT on Interest Payments on Syndicated Loan in Dollars in the amount of P2,520,117.76 and FWT on Interest on Loan Agreement with Ogden Power International Holdings, Inc. (Ogden) in the amount of P7,707,504.96. Since [EBCC] presented documentary evidence in support of its Petition for Review assailing respondent's assessments, the Court considered said documentary evidence in deciding the instant case. In other words, the Court did not consider outright the alleged withholding remittances of P12,842,630.20 as a deduction to [EBCC's] FWT liability, but first examined the supporting documents presented by [EBCC].</p> <p> At the risk of being repetitive, although we found that [EBCC] is not liable to pay FWT on interest payment on loan from Ogden in the amount of P7,707,504.96; however, as regards the deficiency assessment of FWT on Interest Payments on Syndicated Loan in Dollars, in the amount of P2,520,117.76, the Court found that petitioner failed to present proof of withholding and/or remittance of FWT on its interest payments to UCPB and Sung Hung Kai Bank. Likewise, BIR Forms No. 2306 (Certificates of Final Income Tax Withheld), pertaining to petitioner's alleged interest payments to First Metro Investment Corporation and United Overseas Bank/Westmont Bank, were not considered by the Court for reasons stated in our Decision dated November 30, 2010.</p> <p> Therefore, [EBCC's] contention that the amount of P2,842,630.20 should still be deducted from the deficiency assessment, as found by this Court in the amount of P1,785,717.53 is misplaced. As heretofore discussed, out of P2,520,117.76 deficiency FWT assessment on Interest Paid on Syndicated Loan in US Dollars, [EBCC] was able to substantiate FWT remittance in the total amount of P734,400.23 only. Thus, we found [EBCC] liable to pay basic deficiency FWT for the year 2000 in the amount of P1,785,717.53.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, considering that EBCC filed the Petition for Review before the CTA to question the deficiency tax assessment issued by the CIR, it was incumbent upon EBCC to prove that the deficiency tax assessment bad no legal or factual basis or that it had already paid or remitted the deficiency tax assessment as it is the taxpayer that has the burden of proof to impugn the validity and correctness of the disputed deficiency tax assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In addition, it is a basic rule in evidence that the person who alleges payment has the burden of proving that payment has indeed been made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> More so, in cases filed before the CTA, which are litigated <i>de novo</i>, party-litigants must prove every minute aspect of their case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> <b><u>G.R. No. 201668</u></b> </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>RR No.02-98 provides that the term payable refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Section 2.57.4 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 2.57.4. <i>Time of Withholding</i>. - The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax under Section 2.57 of these regulations arises at the time an income is paid or payable, whichever comes first, the term 'payable' refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable. </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, the CIR insists that EBCC was liable to pay the interest from the date of the execution of the contract on January 5, 2000, not from the date of the first payment on June 1, 2002. </p><p> We are not convinced. </p> <p> EBCC's loan agreement with Ogden stated that: </p> <blockquote> <p> 3. Repayment and Interest </p> <p> 3.1 The BORROWER shall repay the Loan to the LENDER (or as it may in writing direct) in sixteen (16) consecutive semi-annual [installments] of US DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED and EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND and TWO HUNDRED and FIFTY (US$881,250.00) commencing on 1 June 2002 and thereafter on June 1 and December 1 of each year. </p> <p> 3.2 Interest shall accrue on the Loan from the date hereof until the date of repayment at a rate equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, subject to review every 90 days. </p> <p> 3.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 3.2 above, if the BORROWER fails to make payment of an amount due on a payment date, the BORROWER shall pay additional interest on such past due and unpaid amount from the due date until the date of payment at the rate of ½% per month. </p> <p> 3.4 The interest payable to the LENDER shall be exclusive of withholding tax and/or any other similar taxes which shall be to the account of the BORROWER. Every payment to the LENDER hereunder shall be net of any present or future tax assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any taxing authority of any jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, EBCC's liability for interest payment became due and demandable starting June 1, 2002. And considering that under RR No. 02-98, the obligation of EBCC to deduct or withhold tax arises at the time an income is paid or payable, whichever comes first, and considering further that under the said RR, the term "payable" refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable, we find no error on the part of the CTA<em> En Banc</em> in ruling that EBCC had no obligation to withhold any taxes on the interest payment for the year 2000 as the obligation to withhold only commenced on June 1, 2002, and thus cancelling the assessment for deficiency FWT on interest payments arising from EBCC's loan from Ogden. </p><p> Neither do we find any reason for the retroactive application of RR No. 12-01, which provides that the withholding of final tax commences "at the time an income payment is paid or payable, or the income payment is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable in the payor's book, whichever comes first." To begin with, this issue was never raised before the CTA. Thus, we cannot rule on this matter now. It is a settled rule that issues not raised below cannot be pleaded for the first time on appeal because a party is not allowed to change his theory on appeal; to do so would be unfair to the other party and offensive to rules of fair play, justice and due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p> Moreover, as aptly pointed out by EBCC, whether it omitted to state a material fact or acted in bad faith in failing to present documents on its interest payments to show the exact date of payment is a factual issue, which is not allowed under Rule 45. </p><p> In any case, even if the first payment was due on January 4, 2001 as claimed by the CIR, EBCC would still not be liable, as the tax assessment pertained to taxable year 2000 and not 2001.</p><p> All told, we find no reason to reverse the January 30, 2012 Decision and the April 17, 2012 Resolution of the CTA in CTA EB Case Nos. 766 and 769. </p><p> We need not belabor that "findings and conclusions of the CTA are accorded the highest respect and will not be lightly set aside because by [its] very nature x x x, it is dedicated exclusively to the resolution of tax problems and has accordingly developed an expertise on the subject."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petitions are hereby<strong> DENIED.</strong> The assailed January 30, 2012 Decision and the April 17, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA EB Case Nos. 766 and 769 are hereby <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b> </p><p> <em>Peralta</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> and <em>Tijam, JJ.,</em> concur. <br>S<em>ereno, C.J</em>., on leave. <br> <em>Leonardo-De Castro, J</em>., on official leave per Special Order No. 2473 dated August 24, 2017. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> Acting Chairperson, per Special Order No. 2476 dated August 29, 2017. <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> Per August 23, 2017 Raffle; vice Justice Francis H.
