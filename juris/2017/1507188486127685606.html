Alba</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><br><blockquote>How is DNA typing performed? From a DNA sample obtained or extracted, a molecular biologist may proceed to analyze it in several ways. There are five (5) techniques to conduct DNA typing. They are: the <i>RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism); "reverse dot blot" </i>or HLA DQ a/Pm loci which was used in 287 cases that were admitted as evidence by 37 courts in the U.S. as of November 1994; mtDNA process; VNTR (variable number tandem repeats); and the most recent which is known as the PCR-([polymerase] chain reaction) based STR (short tandem repeats) method which, as of 1996, was availed of by most forensic laboratories in the world. PCR is the process of replicating or copying DNA in an evidence sample a million times through repeated cycling of a reaction involving the so-called DNA polymerize enzyme. <i>STR, </i>on the other hand, takes measurements in 13 separate places and can match two (2) samples with a reported theoretical error rate of less than one (1) in a trillion.<br><br>Just like in fingerprint analysis, in DNA typing, <i>"matches" </i>are determined. To illustrate, when DNA or fingerprint tests are done to identify a suspect in a criminal case, the evidence collected from the crime scene is compared with the <i>"known " </i>print. If a substantial amount of the identifying features are the same, the DNA or fingerprint is deemed to be a match. But then, even if only one feature of the DNA or fingerprint is different, it is deemed not to have come from the suspect.<br><br>As earlier stated, certain regions of human DNA show variations between people. In each of these regions, a person possesses two genetic types called <i>"allele", </i>one inherited from each parent. <b><i>In [a] paternity test, the forensic scientist looks at a number of these variable regions in an individual to produce a DNA profile. Comparing next the DNA profiles of the mother and child, it is possible to determine which half of the child's DNA was inherited from the mother. The other half must have been inherited from the biological father. The alleged father's profile is then examined to ascertain whether he has the DNA types in his profile, which match the paternal types in the child.</i></b> If the man's DNA types do not match that of the child, the man is <b>excluded</b> as the father. If the DNA types match, then he is <b><i><u>not excluded</u> </i></b> as the father.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[162]</sup></font> (Emphasis provided, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Based on the result of the DNA test conducted in this case, Allan is disputably presumed to be the child's father.<br><br><blockquote>The DNA testing result shows that "[t]here is a <b>COMPLETE MATCH</b> in all of the fifteen (15) loci tested using the Powerflex 16 System between the alleles of Edgar Allan F.
