				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is the Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corporation (Emerald) against The H.D.

SP No. 126253. The CA reversed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated August 10, 2012, of the Intellectual Property Office's (IPO) then Director General Ricardo R. Blancaflor (DG Blancaflor) in Inter Partes Case No. 14-2007-00054, approving H.D. Lee's application for registration of the trademark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>." <p align="center"> <b>Antecedents</b> </p><p>On December 21, 2001, H.D. Lee filed before the IPO an application for the registration of the trademark, "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>." H.D. Lee claimed that the said mark was first used in the Philippines on October 31, 1996. Relative thereto, Application No. 4-2201-009602, on outer clothing categorized under Class 25, which includes jeans, casual pants, trousers, slacks, shorts, jackets, vests, shirts, blouses, sweaters, tops, skirts, jumpers, caps, hats, socks, shoes, suspenders, belts and bandannas, was filed. Within three years from the filing of the application, H.D. Lee submitted to the IPO a Declaration of Actual Use of the mark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p>H.D. Lee's application was published in the Intellectual Property Philippines' Electronic Gazette for Trademarks, which was belatedly released on January 5, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p>Emerald opposed H.D. Lee's application; hence, Inter Partes Case No. 14-2007-00054 arose. Emerald argued that the approval of the application will violate the exclusive use of its marks, "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>," and "<em>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</em>," which it has been using on a line of clothing apparel since October 1, 1973<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and 1980, respectively. Further, Section 123.1(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code (IPC), will likewise be breached because the "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>” is confusingly similar or identical to the "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" previously registered in Emerald's name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p>Refuting Emerald's opposition, H.D. Lee insisted that it is the owner and prior user of "<span style="font-style: italic;">LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</span>." H.D. Lee maintained that it initially used the said mark on February 18, 1946, and registered the same in the United States of America (USA) on April 10, 1984 under Registration No. 1,273,602. The mark has been commercially advertised and used all over the world as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Decision of the IPO's Director of the Bureau of Legal Affairs</b> </p><p> On February 27, 2009, the then Director of Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA), Atty.

Abelardo based on the grounds cited below:</p> <blockquote> <p> [H.D. Lee] has established by substantial evidence that it is the owner of LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN. <u>It has adduced evidence showing that it has registered and/or applied in 115 countries around the world the mark LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN and that it secured a certificate of registration for this mark in the [USA] on April 1984</u>. [H.D. Lee] also submitted proof of its advertising activities and sales invoices.</p> <p> That [Emerald] has trademark applications and/or registrations in the Philippines on marks similar to [H.D. Lee] and which were filed and/or registered earlier than [H.D. Lee's] trademark application is not sufficient to overcome the pieces of evidence proving [H.D. Lee's] ownership of LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN.<u> It is not the application or the registration that confers ownership of a mark but it is the ownership thereof that confers the right to registration</u>. </p> <p>Moreover, [H.D. Lee] has shown that <u>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN is a well-known mark</u>. x x x </p> <p>x x x x </p> <p><u>[H.D. Lee's] pieces of evidence satisfy a combination of the criteria</u> x x x <u>such as the duration, extent and geographical area of any use of the mark, the extent to which the mark has been registered in the world, and the extent to which the mark has been used in the world</u>. [H.D. Lee] cited the over 100 countries where it has registered and/ or applied for the registration of LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN. The affidavits of Helen L. Winslow and Wilfred T. Siy explained the long, continuous and global use of [H.D. Lee's] mark. These pieces of evidence are sufficient enough to consider [H.D. Lee's] mark as well-known internationally and in the Philippines. </p> <p> Furthermore, <u>there is nothing in the records which explained how [Emerald] came to use a highly distinctive sign such as a "Back Pocket Design" or the "Double Curve Lines" which are identical or confusingly similar to the well-known mark LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</u>. The absence of any explanation on how [Emerald] conceived these marks gives credence to the position that [H.D. Lee] is the owner and creator of LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN and is, therefore, entitled to the registration of this mark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Citations omitted and underlining ours)</p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p> Undaunted, Emerald filed a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, which the CA denied in the herein assailed decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> According to the CA, H.D. Lee substantially complied with the procedural requirements in filing before the IPO a petition for registration of the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>." </p><p> Further, the CA considered the following factors in H.D. Lee's favor: (1) while the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is registered only in India and Greece, with pending application in the Philippines, the "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is registered and/or applied for registration in about 100 countries;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (2) the inconsistent dates, to wit, 1946 and 1949, which H.D. Lee claimed as the year when it initially used the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," will not affect its position as being the first and prior user thereof for at least 20 years before Emerald utilized the marks "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>” and "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" in 1973 and 1980, respectively;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (3) registration in the Principal Register is limited to the actual owner of the trademark, hence, the Certificate of Registration issued to Emerald by the IPO on May 31, 1982 covering the mark "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>," which pre-dated the registration in the USA of the mark "<em>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</em>'' on April 10, 1984, merely gave rise to a prima facie but rebuttable proof of registrant's ownership of a mark;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (4) even if the mark "<em>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</em>” is not locally registered, it is entitled to protection as a well-known brand under the IPC and international treaties entered into by the Philippines;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (5) H.D. Lee cannot be blamed regarding the confusing similarity between the marks "<em>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</em>” and "<em>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</em>'' considering that it has been using the latter design for at least two decades earlier than Emerald;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and (6) it is of judicial notice that in the 1950s movie, "Rebel Without a Cause," James Dean wore H.D. Lee's jeans with the "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>'' sewn in the back pockets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> Emerald moved for reconsideration, pointing out that in G.R. No. 195415,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court issued Resolutions, dated November 28, 2012<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and January 28, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which denied with finality H.D. Lee's opposition against Emerald's registration of the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>." In the Resolution dated November 28, 2012, the Court's reasons were unequivocal, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> First, the evidence proferred by [Emerald] sufficiently proves that it has been actually using the mark "<b>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</b>" since October 1973. The sales invoices established actual commercial use of the mark more than two months prior to [Emerald's] application for its registration in 1990.</p> <p> Second, [H.D. Lee] was not able to prove that the mark "<b>OGIVE CURVE DEVICE</b>" was well known internationally and in the Philippines at the time of the filing of [Emerald's] application for registration. For a trademark to be protected, the same must be "well known" in the country where protection is sought. Such is not the case here, since the sale of garments in the Philippines bearing [H.D. Lee's] mark "<b>OGIVE CURVE DEVICE</b>" began only in 1996. Prior to said date, there was no substantial evidence proving commercial use of goods bearing the mark in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the herein assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated January 6, 2014, the CA denied Emerald's motion for reconsideration. According to the CA, it was belatedly notified of the Court's Resolutions dated November 28, 2012 and January 28, 2013 in G.R. No. 195415 only on April 10, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Further, even if the aforementioned resolutions were promptly brought to the CA's attention, the rule on "<i>conclusiveness of judgment</i>" still finds no application. In G.R. No. 195415, the issue was the non-registrability of Emerald's mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>" based on the opposer H.D. Lee's claim that "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is internationally well-known and legally protected by the Paris Convention and other pertinent trademark laws. The issues, which were resolved, centered on the goodwill and prior use of Emerald's mark in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> On the other hand, in CA-G.R. SP No. 12625, from which the petition now before the Court arose, the issue was the non-registrability of H.D. Lee's mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" for being confusingly similar to the marks "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>" and "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>," which are registered in Emerald's name. The focal issue is "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>'s" alleged international reputation, hence, the dispensability of its prior use in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Proceedings Before the Court</b> </p><p> In the instant petition for review on <em>certiorari</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Emerald argues that the herein assailed decision and resolution are in conflict with the final and executory dispositions rendered in G.R. No. 195415. The Court already upheld the registration of Emerald's mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>," and an Entry of Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> was thereafter recorded on March 20, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Further, Emerald's prior application for the registration of its mark "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>''<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> had likewise been resolved with finality by the IPO DG on June 5, 2008, and the corresponding Entry of Judgment was recorded on October 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Hence, the principle of conclusiveness of judgment under Rule 39, Section 47(b) and (c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Rules of Court applies. The issues of confusing similarity between the marks involved herein and their prior use had been determined with finality by the Court and the IPO DG. The same issues can no longer be raised before the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 126253 from which the instant petition arose. </p><p> Repetitive as it may be, in G.R. No. 195415, the Court had adjudged that Emerald had prior actual use in the Philippines of the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>" since October of 1973. In Inter Partes Case No. 3498, the IPO DG had ruled that Emerald started using the mark "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>” on January 8, 1980. On the other hand, H.D. Lee initially sold in the Philippines garments with the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DEVICE</i>” only in 1996, and filed an application for the said mark in the USA on November 9, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> Emerald likewise emphasizes the following: (1) on January 19, 1990, H.D Lee applied for the registration of the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," but the same was abandoned with finality as indicated in the IPO's website;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (2) contrary to H.D. Lee's representations, the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>” is not registered in the USA, its home country, as USA Registration No. 1,273,602 issued on April 10, 1984 merely covers the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (3) the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" was only registered in Greece and India in 1996, while in other countries, the pending applications for registration pertain to "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and (4) in the Declaration of Actual Use filed before the IPO on May 13, 2002, H.D. Lee indicated that it first used the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>” in the Philippines only on October 31, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated March 24, 2014, the Court initially denied the instant petition for failure to sufficiently show any reversible error committed by the CA.</p><p> Emerald moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> primarily anchored on the argument that the non-registrability of H.D. Lee's mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is a foregone conclusion in view of the finality of the Resolution issued by the Court relative to the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>" in G.R. No. 195415.</p><p> It was further argued that "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," being the dominant feature of the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," can no longer be registered by H.D. Lee due to its confusing similarity to Emerald's "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>" and "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>." Section 123.1(d) of the IPC precludes registration of a mark identical with another with an earlier filing or priority date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> Emerald concluded that the principle of conclusiveness of judgment applies. The Court's disposition in G.R. No. 195415 and the IPO's ruling in Inter Partes Case No. 3498, both of which had become final and executory, proscribe H.D. Lee from further pursuing the registration of the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> In the Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> on the Motion for Reconsideration, H.D. Lee averred that Emerald merely reiterated the arguments raised in the petition, which had already been judiciously resolved by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Further, there exists no identity of issues raised in G.R. No. 195415, on one hand, and in the instant petition, on the other. In G.R. No. 195415, the issue was the non-registrability of the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>” in view of the alleged international use and well-renowned character of the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" In the instant petition, the issue is the non-registrability of the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," which has confusing similarity with the already registered marks "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>'' and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> In its Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Emerald insisted that the instant petition still involves the issue of the confusing similarity between "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," on one hand, and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>” and "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>," on the other. While H.D. Lee claims that the issue herein is the registrability of "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," the dominant feature of the mark sought to be registered remains to be the "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>." The latter had been among the foci of G.R. No. 195415. Moreover, "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is a composite mark, the parts of which can be registered separately. H.D. Lee already registered "<i>LEE</i>" in its name, but it abandoned the application to register "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>” which was filed before the IPO on January 19, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Emerald also stressed anew that on April 4, 2013, before the promulgation of the herein assailed Decision on April 8, 2013, the CA had been furnished with copies of the Court's Resolutions dated November 28, 2013 and January 28, 2014 in G.R. No. 195415.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p> On November 28, 2016, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> reinstating the instant petition to afford the contending parties ample opportunities to argue their respective stances.</p><p> In its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> on the instant petition, H.D. Lee once again stresses the lack of identity between the facts and issues presented herein with those resolved in G.R. No. 195415 and Inter Partes Case No. 3498. H.D. Lee posits that G.R. No. 195415 and Inter Partes Case No. 3498 dealt with the registrability of the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," which is distinct and separate from "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DEVICE</i>," subject of the instant petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> Further, even granting for argument's sake that by reason of the similarities of the marks involved, the issues are indeed identical, prior decisions cannot bar a contrary disposition from being subsequently rendered as the result would be the preclusion of any application for registration of variants of a mark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> By way of a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to H.D. Lee's Comment, Emerald reiterates its contentions already raised in the instant petition. </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> <i>The instant petition is impressed with merit. </i></p><p> The present controversy arose from H.D. Lee's application for the registration of the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," which was filed in 2001, <b><u>pending</u></b> the final resolution of Emerald's separate applications for the registration of the marks "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>'' and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>." </p><p> In 2009, then BLA Director Atty. Abelardo denied H.D. Lee's application for registration of "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" by reason of opposer Emerald's proven <b>prior</b> commercial use of "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>." Back then, Atty. Abelardo already took note of the pendency of Emerald's two separate applications for the registration of "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> Despite the foregoing, the IPO's DG and CA proceeded to resolve the case <b>unmindful</b> of the pending applications for the registration of "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>" previously filed by Emerald.</p><p> Meanwhile, in G.R. No. 195415, the Court, <i>via</i> the Resolutions dated November 28, 2012 and January 28, 2013, made the following findings with finality: (1) Emerald has been using the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>" since October 1973, with sales invoices proving actual commercial use of the mark more than two months before the application for its registration in 1990; (2) H.D. Lee's sale of its garments in the Philippines only began in 1996; and (3) H.D. Lee failed to prove that the mark "<i>OGIVE CURVE DEVICE</i>" was well-known locally and internationally at the time Emerald filed its application for the registration of the mark "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE (Back Pocket Design)</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, Emerald's application for the registration of its mark "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" had likewise been resolved with finality by the IPO DG on June 5, 2008, and the corresponding Entry of Judgment was recorded on October 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p>In <i>Pryce Corporation v. China Banking Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court declared that: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>[W]ell-settled is the principle that a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable</b> and may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court of the land.</p> <p> The reason for this is that litigation must end and terminate sometime and somewhere, and <b>it is essential to an effective and efficient administration of justice</b> that, once a judgment has become final, the winning party be not deprived of the fruits of the verdict. Courts must guard against any scheme calculated to bring about that result and must frown upon any attempt to prolong the controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>The Court also emphatically instructs anent the concept and application of <i>res judicata, viz</i>.: </p> <blockquote> <p>According to the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, "a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on all points and matters determined in the former suit."</p> <p> The elements for<i> res judicata</i> to apply are as follows: (a) the former judgment was final; (b) the court that rendered it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (c) the judgment was based on the merits; and (d) between the first and the second actions, there was an identity of parties, subject matters, and causes of action. </p> <p> <i>Res judicata</i> embraces two concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment and (2) conclusiveness of judgment.</p> <p> Bar by prior judgment exists "when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action."</p> <p> On the other hand, the concept of conclusiveness of judgment finds application "when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction." This principle only needs identity of parties and issues to apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> H.D. Lee argues that the principle of conclusiveness of judgment does not apply since no identity of issue exists between the instant petition, on one hand, and G.R. No. 195415, on the other. The Court finds the foregoing <b>untenable</b> as the issues all point to the <b>registrability of the confusingly similar marks</b> "DOUBLE CURVE LINES," "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>," and "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>." Further, H.D. Lee's claim that the instant petition involves the mark "<i>LEE &amp; OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" and not "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>" is<b> specious</b> and a clear attempt to engage into hair-splitting distinctions. A thorough examination of the pleadings submitted by H.D. Lee itself shows that indeed, the focus is the "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>," which remains to be the dominant feature of the mark sought to be registered. The Court needs to stress that in G.R. No. 195415 and Inter Partes Case No. 3498 before the IPO, Emerald had already <b>established with finality its rights </b>over the registration of the marks "<i>DOUBLE CURVE LINES</i>" and "<i>DOUBLE REVERSIBLE WAVE LINE</i>" as against H.D. Lee's "<i>OGIVE CURVE DESIGN</i>."</p><p> As a final note, the courts are reminded to be <i>constantly vigilant in extending their judicial gaze to cases related to the matters submitted for their resolution as to ensure against judicial confusion and any seeming conflict in the judiciary's decisions</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The assailed Decision and Resolution, of the Court of Appeals dated April 8, 2013 and January 6, 2014, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 126253, are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The H.D.
