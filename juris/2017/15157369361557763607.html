Hence, the CSC contends that the appointment of the respondent was ineffectual considering that the certification of the municipal budget officer, the joint affidavit of the members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Masiu, and the certification from the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Lanao del Sur all showed that the Municipality of Masiu had no approved annual budget for 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the CSC points out the lack of concurrence by the majority of the members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Masiu as required by Section 443 of the LGC; and that such concurrence of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> in relation to the appointment of the "heads of departments and offices" under paragraph (d) of Section 443 of the LGC likewise referred to the officials mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (d) thereof, among them the MENRO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In refutation, the respondent counters that the LGC created the position of the MENRO; that the LGC validly enacted and adopted an appropriation ordinance (Resolution No. 29, series of 2005); that the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Masiu confirmed his appointment on February 7, 2007 through Resolution No. 02-24, series of 2007 (entitled <i>A Resolution Confirming the Appointment of Mr. Samad M. Unda as Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Officer-1</i>);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that the letter sent by the Provincial Government of Lanao del Sur could not be relied upon for being partial considering that the then incumbent Provincial Governor was the party-mate of the Representative of the First Congressional District of Lanao del Sur who was the brother of Mayor Pangandaman; that the power of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> over appropriation ordinances of the Municipality of Masiu was merely supervisory in character; that Resolution No. 29 dated October 24, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> could not be collaterally attacked; and that if there was no approved 2006 budget, it would have been improbable to pay the respondent his salaries and benefits for the months of May and June 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The issues to be considered and resolved may be stated thusly: (1) Was the respondent validly appointed as the MENRO of the Municipality of Masiu?; and (2) Did the appointment of the respondent as the MENRO require a prior resolution by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> creating the position, confirming the appointment, and appropriating funds for the salaries and benefits to be given to the appointee?<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>, and <b>REVERSES</b> the CA.<br><br><center><b>I<br>Municipal governments have the discretion to appoint their MENROs</b><br></center><br>A public office is created either by the Constitution, by law, or by authority of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The legal basis for the appointment of the respondent as the MENRO of the Municipality of Masiu was Section 443 of the LGC, which provides in full:<br><blockquote>SECTION 443. Officials of the Municipal Government. -<br><br>(a) There shall be in each municipality a municipal mayor, a municipal vice-mayor, <i>sangguniang bayan</i> members, a secretary to the sangguniang bayan, municipal treasurer, a municipal assessor, a municipal accountant, a municipal budget officer, a municipal planning and development coordinator, a municipal engineer/building official, a municipal health officer and a municipal civil engineer.<br><br>(b) In addition thereto, <b>the mayor may appoint</b> a municipal administrator, a municipal legal officer, a municipal agriculturist, <b>a municipal environment and natural resources officer</b>, a municipal social welfare and development officer, a municipal architect, and a municipal information officer.<br><br>(c) The <i>sangguniang bayan</i> may:<br><blockquote>(1) Maintain existing offices not mentioned in subsections (a) and (b) hereof;<br><br>(2) Create such other offices as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the municipal government; or<br><br>(3) Consolidate the functions of any office with those of another in the interest of efficiency and economy.<br></blockquote>(d) Unless otherwise provided herein, <b>heads of departments and offices shall be appointed by the municipal mayor with the concurrence of the majority of all the <i>sangguniang bayan</i> members, subject to civil service law, rules and regulations</b>. The <i>sangguniang bayan</i> shall act on the appointment within fifteen (15) days from the date of its submission; otherwise, the same shall be deemed confirmed.<br><br>(e) <b>Elective and appointive municipal officials shall receive such compensation, allowances and other emoluments as may be determined by law or ordinance, subject to the budgetary limitations on personal services as prescribed in Title Five, Book II of this Code</b>: <i>Provided</i>, That no increase in compensation of the mayor, vice-mayor, and <i>sangguniang bayan</i> members shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of all the elective local officials approving such increase. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the foregoing, there ought to be no question that the appointment of the respondent as the MENRO was but optional on the part of the Municipality of Masiu, and that such appointment required the concurrence of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i>, as well as the adoption of the appropriation ordinance to fund the payment of his salaries and other emoluments.<br><br>The CA opined that Section 443 and Section 484 of the LGC institutionalized the position of MENRO in the LGUs; hence, no resolution of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> was required to create the office. The CA was correct in light of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 443 of the LGC expressly creating and identifying the public offices of the municipalities.<br><br>Even so, the Municipality of Masiu was also justified in construing the appointment of the MENRO as optional on its part. This is based on the usage in paragraph (b) of the term <i>may</i>, which means that the Municipal Mayor has been given the discretion whether or not to appoint the MENRO and the other officers of the municipality listed in the provision. It is a basic postulate of statutory construction that the word <i>may</i> means a merely permissive act, and operates to confer upon a party discretion to do or not to do the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Indeed, the second paragraph of Section 484(a) of the LGC expressly states that the appointment of the MENRO is optional on the part of the LGU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>II<br>The appointment of the respondent as the MENRO further required the concurrence by the majority of the members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i><br>as well as a validly enacted appropriation ordinance</b><br></center><br>Section 443 of the LGC expressly includes the position of the MENRO in the municipality. Nonetheless, the provision subjects the appointment of the MENRO to several conditions, namely: (1) the concurrence by the majority of the <i>sangguniang bayan</i> as provided in its paragraph (d); and (2) the adoption of an ordinance setting the compensation, allowances and other emoluments conformably with its paragraph (e). The requirement for the appropriation ordinance is consistent with the fundamental principle of fiscal administration enunciated in Section 305 of the LGC that "[n]o money shall be paid out of the local treasury except in pursuance of an appropriations ordinance or law."<br><br>Evidently, Section 443(b) of the LGC institutionalizes the office of the MENRO in local governments, while Section 443(e) sets the corresponding budgetary mechanism for the establishment of the position. In other words, the LGU must enact an ordinance allocating the budget for the office of the MENRO. Thus, the determination should be made whether or not the Municipality of Masiu enacted an appropriation ordinance for the position of the MENRO to which the respondent was appointed.<br><br>The petitioners insist that the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Masiu did not enact an appropriation ordinance for the years 2006 and 2007. On the other hand, the respondent claims that the appropriation for his position was emb9died in Resolution No. 29 dated October 24, 2005.<br><br>The insistence of the petitioners is fully warranted. The fact that the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Masiu had no appropriation ordinances for the years 2006 and 2007 relative to the position of the MENRO belied the respondent's claim. His reliance on Resolution No. 29 dated October 24, 2005 did not suffice. Under Section 306(b) of the LGC, an <i>appropriation</i> is defined as the "authorization made <b>by ordinance</b>, directing the payment of goods and services from local government funds under specified conditions or for specific purposes." Also, Section 305 and Section 443(d) of the LGC specifically refer to an <b>ordinance</b>, not to a resolution. Thus, the appropriation for the office of the MENRO could have only been through an ordinance.<br><br>The adoption of Resolution No. 29 dated October 24, 2005 was inherently inadequate for the purpose. The distinctions between an ordinance and a resolution are significant, and cannot be ignored. The Court has pointed out such distinctions in <i>Municipality of Parañaque v. V.M. Realty Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>We are not convinced by petitioner's insistence that the terms "resolution" and "ordinance" are synonymous. <b>A municipal ordinance is different from a resolution. An ordinance is a law, but a resolution is merely a declaration of the sentiment or opinion of a lawmaking body on a specific matter. An ordinance possesses a general and permanent character, but a resolution is temporary in nature.</b> Additionally, the two are enacted differently a third reading is necessary for an ordinance, but not for a resolution, unless decided otherwise by a majority of all the Sanggunian members.

Based on the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> issued by Atty. Cosain M. Macarambon, the secretary of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Lanao del Sur, the LGU of Masiu did not submit its budget for the fiscal year of 2006 to the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i>.
