No. 31985. The assailed Decision affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which found petitioners Bro. Bernard Oca, Bro. Dennis Magbanua, Cirila N. Mojica, Alejandro N. Mojica, Josefina Pascual, Atty. Silvestre Pascual, and St. Francis School of General Trias, Cavite, Inc. (petitioners) guilty of Indirect Contempt. The assailed Resolution denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>This indirect contempt case stemmed from an intra-corporate controversy among the Board of Trustees of petitioner St. Francis School of General Trias, Cavite, Inc. (St. Francis School).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>St. Francis School was established with the assistance of the La Salle brothers on July 9, 1973 by respondent Laurita Custodio (Custodio), petitioner Cirila N. Mojica (Cirila), petitioner Josefina Pascual (Josefina), Monsignor Felix Perez, and Brother Vernon Poore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> These five (5) incorporators served as St. Francis School's Board of Trustees until the latter two (2) passed away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Without a written agreement, the La Salle brothers agreed to give the necessary supervision to establish the school's academic foundation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On September 8, 1988, the incorporators and the La Salle brothers formalized their arrangement in a Memorandum of Agreement, under which De La Salle Greenhills (La Salle) would supervise the academic affairs of St. Francis School to increase enrollment. La Salle appointed supervisors to sit in the Board of Trustees without voting rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In 1998, petitioner Bro. Bernard Oca (Bro.

Cirila, Josefina, Bro. Oca, and Bro. Magbanua wanted to expand the scope of La Salle's supervision to include A matters relating to the school's finances, administration, and operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>This was opposed by Custodio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> After several incidents relating to the disagreement, Custodio filed a complaint against St. Francis School, Bro. Oca, and Bro. Magbanua on June 7, 2002 with Branch 23, Regional Trial Court, Trece Martires, Cavite. She alleged that Bro. Oca and Bro. Magbanua were never qualified to sit in the Board of Trustees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> She also prayed for a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent Bro. Oca from calling a special membership meeting to remove her from the Board of Trustees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>This case was dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Custodio was subsequently removed from the Board of Trustees and as Curriculum Administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Custodio filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal but eventually withdrew her appeal to file a new suit instead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On October 3, 2002, Custodio again filed a complaint against petitioners for violating the Corporation Code with Branch 21, Regional Trial Court, Imus, Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> She sought to disqualify Bro. Oca and Bro. Magbanua as members and trustees of the school and to declare void all their acts as President and Treasurer, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She likewise prayed for a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction to enjoin the remaining board members from holding meetings and to prevent Bro. Oca and Bro. Magbanua from discharging their functions as members, trustees, and officers of St. Francis School.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This case was docketed as SEC Case No. 024-02.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On October 8, 2002, the Regional Trial Court heard Custodio's prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The day after the hearing, Custodio filed a Manifestation and Motion dated October 9, 2002. She alleged that after the hearing for the Temporary Restraining Order, the counsel for petitioners went to St. Francis School to instruct several parents not to acknowledge Custodio's administration as she had been removed as a member, trustee, and curriculum administrator and that her complaint had been dismissed. The parents were also allegedly directed to pay the students' matriculation fees exclusively to petitioner Alejandro N. Mojica (Alejandro), son of petitioner Cirila. Alejandro held office at the Rural Bank of General Trias, Inc. which was allegedly owned by the family of petitioner Josefina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This meeting allegedly caused 15 teachers to hold a strike, which nearly disrupted classes and caused parents to request the early dismissal of their children for fear that violence would ensue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Custodio reiterated her prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order. She moved that the hearing be converted into an injunction hearing or that a status quo order be issued to allow her to continue functioning as school director and curriculum administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Custodio also filed a Motion for Clarification praying that the trial court clarify to whom the school's fees should be paid while her Complaint and Manifestation and Motion were still pending. Petitioners allegedly manifested that the payment of matriculation fees must be made to Alejandro. However, Custodio pointed out that Alejandro was not the school cashier and that the Rural Bank of General Trias, Inc. was not authorized to receive payments for St. Francis School. She also manifested that prior to October 8, 2002, the school cashier was Ms. Herminia Reynante (Reynante).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This Motion was set for hearing on October 18, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On October 21, 2002, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order designating Reynante to act as school cashier "with authority to collect all fees" and, together with Custodio, "to pay all accounts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The trial court also directed all parties in the case to submit a report on and to turn over to Reynante all money previously collected, thus:<br><blockquote>Regarding the collection of matriculation fees and other collectibles, <i>Ms. Herminia Reynante is hereby designated by the Court to act as cashier of the school to the exclusion of others with authority to collect all fees and, together with plaintiff Laurita Custodio, to pay all accounts</i>.

This is hereby ordered so that an orderly operation of the school will be achieved.<br><br><i>Plaintiff and defendants, as well as Mr. Al Mojica, are directed to turn-over to Ms. Herminia Reynante all money previously collected and to submit a report on what have been collected, how much, from whom, and the dates collected.</i> Effective October 22, 2002, Ms. Herminia Reynante shall submit to the Court, to the plaintiff and to all the defendants made.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that they would have proven that Reynante lacked the moral integrity to act as court-appointed cashier had they been given the opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On January 3, 2003, the Regional Trial Court denied reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On February 21, 2003, petitioners filed an Explanation, Manifestation and Compliance. They alleged that they partially complied with the October 21, 2002 Order by submitting an accounting on the tuition fee collections and by turning over to Reynante a manager's check in the amount of P397,127.64 payable to St. Francis School.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The amount allegedly represented the school's matriculation fees from October to December 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> However, they alleged that Reynante refused to accept the check and required that the amount be turned over in cash or in a check payable to cash. Thus, petitioners placed the check in the custody of the Regional Trial Court for safekeeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Custodio filed a Comment dated February 26, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Custodio manifested that petitioners did not even substantially comply with the October 21, 2002 Order because it excluded from its accounting and turnover the following amounts:<br><br>1) P4,339,601.54 deposited in Special Savings Deposit No. 239 of the Rural Bank of General Trias, Inc.;<br><br>2) P5,639,856.11 deposited in Special Savings Deposit No. 459 of the Rural Bank of General Trias, Inc.;<br><br>3) P92,970.00 representing fees paid by the school canteen; and<br><br>4) All other fees collected from January 2003 to February 19, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Custodio also claimed that petitioners violated the trial court order that only she and Reynante were authorized to pay the outstanding accounts of St. Francis School. Petitioners allegedly made salary payments to four (4) employees who had resigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On March 24, 2003, the Regional Trial Court issued another Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> directing petitioners to fully comply with its earlier order to submit a report and to turn over to Reynante all the money they had collected:<br><blockquote>This treats of defendants' explanation, manifestation and compliance and plaintiff's comments thereto.<br><br>A perusal of the allegations of defendants' pleading shows that they merely turned-over a manager's check in the amount of P397,127.64 representing money collected from the students from October 2002 to December 2002. The Order of October 21, 2002 directed plaintiff and defendants, as well as, Mr. Al Mojica to turn-over to Ms. Herminia Reynante all money previously collected and to submit a report on what have been collected, how much, from whom and the dates collected.<br><br>Defendants and Mr. Al Mojica are hereby directed, within ten days from receipt hereof, to submit a report and to turn-over to Ms. Herminia Reynante all money collected by them, more particularly:<br><br>(1) P4,339,601.54 deposited in Special Savings Deposit No. 239 (Rural Bank of Gen.

No. 01-2-04-SC). The motion which assails the two questioned orders is actually a motion for reconsideration but worded differently - "motion to set aside March 24, 2003 Order" but both have the same purpose and objective and that is to reconsider the order(s).<br><br>....<br><br>On the contrary, the court found out that defendants have not complied with the order of the court dated March 24, 2003 directing defendants and Mr. Al Mojica to submit a report and to turn over to Ms. Herminia Reynante all money collected by them, more particularly:<br><blockquote>1. P4,339,601.54 deposited in Special Savings Deposit No. 239 (Rural Bank of Gen. Trias, Inc.)<br><br>2. P5,639,856.11 deposited in Special Savings Deposit No. 459 (Rural Bank of Gen.

Accounting on how and how much defendants are paying Ms. Daisy Romero and the three (3) other teachers who already resigned.<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the defendants and Mr. Al Mojica are hereby directed to comply with the aforementioned order of March 24, 2003, within ten days from receipt hereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>In the meantime, La Salle served Custodio a notice dated January 4, 2003, that they were terminating the Memorandum of Agreement with St. Francis School.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On August 21, 2003, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order granting Custodio's Manifestation and Motion dated October 9, 2002 and issuing a status quo order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> allowing Custodio to discharge her functions as school director and curriculum administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The trial court ruled in favor of Custodio when it found that petitioners had already established another school, the Academy of St. John (Academy of St. John) in Sta. Clara, General Trias, Cavite:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote>This treats of plaintiff's manifestation and motion praying that the court "immediately issue a temporary restraining order . . . where plaintiff will be allowed to continue discharging the functions of a school director and curriculum administrator..."<br><br>During the hearing of the said motion and manifestation on October 11, 2002, both parties and counsel agreed before the court that no incident similar to what happened on October 8, 2002 will occur while the motion is being heard.<br><br>Plaintiff and defendants presented evidence, testimonial and documentary, to prove their respective causes. It took them nine months to present their evidence before the matter was submitted for the court's resolution.<br><br>After a thorough review of all the evidences presented by both parties, the Court is inclined to rule in favor of the plaintiff. The [pieces of] evidence of both parties are convincing. But, the factor that convinced the Court to rule in favor of plaintiff was the information conveyed to the court by plaintiff and admitted by defendants, through their counsel, that another school named Academy of St. John, a new La Sallian Supervised School in Sta. Clara, General Tria[s], Cavite, was opened by defendants Josefina A. Pascual and Cirila N. Mojica and their respective families. In a brochure handed by plaintiff's counsel to the court during the hearing on June 17, 2003 with a heading of Academy of Saint John, De La Salle[-]Supervised, General Tria[s], Cavite, it said that "such idea was conceived as a result of the corporate problems and the never ending dispute in a former La Salle[-]supervised school that finally brought confusion and havoc in the said community."<br><br>It further said that "alarmed with the impending loss of the La Salle Supervision which they both thought of leaving it as a legacy to the youth, Mrs. Pascual and Mrs. Mojica together with their respective families were convinced to continue their mission of spreading quality education etc."<br><br>It appears from the brochure that defendants Pascual and Mojica have set up another school in the same municipality where the St. Francis School is located. The name of the school is Academy of St. John. The Academy of St. John likewise offers the same courses as th[ose] offered by St. Francis [S]chool. Needless to state, this action of defendants Pascual and Mojica is very inimical to the interest of St. Francis School as the Academy of St. John put up by the aforementioned defendants is in direct competition with St. Francis School. In other words, a conflict of interest now exists insofar as defendants Pascual and Mojica are concerned in view of their establishment of the Academy of St. John which is of the same kind and of the same nature of business as that of St. Francis School. One cannot serve two masters a[t] the same time. And as already intimated above, considering that there are now two competing schools in the same locality where defendants Pascual and Mojica hold an interest, they cannot be expected to give their full devotion and cooperation to one without being disloyal and unfaithful to the other.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the motion is granted. Accordingly, a status quo order is hereby issued wherein the plaintiff is hereby allowed to continue discharging her functions as school director and curriculum administrator as well as those who are presently and actually discharging functions as school officer[s] to continue performing their duties until the application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order is resolved.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners filed their Motion for Clarification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> They alleged that the bulk of the money ordered to be turned over to Custodio and Reynante was allotted to St. Francis School's teachers' retirement fund. Considering that it must be preserved, petitioners raised several queries. They wanted to know if Custodio and Reynante would use the money for other purposes other than for the teachers' retirement benefit and if Custodio and Reynante would be required to file a bond to guaranty its safekeeping and exclusive use as teacher's retirement compensation. Finally, they asked who would be held liable in case of Custodio and Reynante's unlawful use of this fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On September 2, 2003, Custodio filed the Petition to Cite Respondents in Contempt of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> She likewise prayed that an order be issued reiterating the Orders dated October 21, 2002, March 24, 2003, and August 5, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In response to petitioners' Motion for Clarification, the trial court issued an Order dated October 8, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> clarifying that the retirement fund was to be held in trust by Custodio and Reynante. It also directed Custodio and Reynante to file a bond of P300,000.00 each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Later, it ordered petitioners to comply with the mandate in the March 24, 2003 and August 5, 2003 Orders and directed them to disclose to the court the total amount of the fund deposited and reserved for teachers' retirement benefit and its bank details:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><blockquote>This treats of the motion for clarification filed by the defendants through counsel.<br><br>The motion sprung from the Order dated March 24, 2003 and again reiterated in the Order of August 5, 2003 which required the defendants and Mr. Al Mojica to turn-over to Ms. Herminia Reynante all the money which [is] in their possession enumerated in the aforesaid orders.<br><br>Considering that the bulk of the money pertains to the teacher[s'] retirement funds, defendants seek to clarify (1) for what purpose the funds will be used by the plaintiff and Ms. Reynante; (2) whether the funds will be turned-over to the plaintiff and Ms. Reynante without them having to put up a bond as a security for the protection of the teachers; and (3) whether defendants will be held liable civilly and criminally, in case of unlawful use and disbursement of the funds.<br><br>Teachers' retirement funds are funds principally set aside for the purpose of the retirement of the teachers. As such, these funds cannot be used for any other purpose other than that for which it is intended. Thus, neither the plaintiff nor Ms. Reynante may use this amount for the operation of the school. They should hold the same in trust for the beneficiaries of the same.<br><br>As to whether the plaintiff and Ms. Reynante shall be required to put up a bond as a security for the protection of the teachers before they receive the teachers' retirement funds, the same is not only correct but also proper. Considering that they will hold these funds in trust for the retiring teachers, they should be required to file a bond to guarantee their obligations as trustees of these funds. Accordingly, the plaintiff and Ms. Herminia Reynante are hereby directed to file a bond in the amount of P300,000.00 each.<br><br>As to whether the defendants will be held liable, civilly and criminally, in case of unlawful use and disbursement of the teachers' retirement funds, the answer is in the negative. A person cannot be held liable for his action when such was done in compliance with the lawful order of the court. Besides, considering that the plaintiff and Ms. Reynante are required to file a bond, the bond shall guarantee for whatever damage the retiring teachers may incur by reason of the unlawful use and disbursement of the funds.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the defendants are hereby ordered to comply with the mandate contained in the order dated March 24 and August 5, 2003.<br><br>Defendants are further directed to inform the court of the total amount of the funds deposited reserved for teachers' retirement, and in what bank and under what account the same is deposited.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 10, 2003, petitioners filed their Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals to question the Regional Trial Court's Orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated August 5, 2003, August 21, 2003 and October 8, 2003.

Thus, petitioners cannot claim grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court on the basis of denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, the question of whether petitioners were denied due process has already been settled.<br><br>This Court notes that petitioners'justification for refusing to turn over the stated amounts was that, the amounts constituted teachers' retirement fund, which consequently did not belong to St. Francis School and was not covered by the assailed Orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> However, the trial court lent credence to Joseph's testimony that the amounts deposited in the Special Savings Accounts were funds for the operations of the school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>In any case, whether the amounts are for the teachers' retirement fund or the school's operation fund, the trial court had determined who was to have custody over these amounts during the pendency of the intra-corporate case. Thus, it is not for petitioners to choose which amounts to turn over.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The same principle applies to petitioners' argument that the trial court orders were being questioned in G.R. No. 174996.<br><br>In intra-corporate controversies, all orders of the trial court are immediately executory:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Executory nature of decisions and orders</i>. — All decisions and orders issued under these Rules shall immediately be executory except the awards for moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees, if any. No appeal or petition taken therefrom shall stay the enforcement or implementation of the decision or order, unless restrained by an appellate court. Interlocutory orders shall not be subject to appeal.<br></blockquote>Questioning the trial court orders does not stay its enforcement or implementation. There is no showing that the trial court orders were restrained by the appellate court.<br><br>Hence, petitioners could not refuse to comply with the trial court orders just because they opined that they were invalid. It is not for the parties to decide whether they should or should not comply with a court order. Petitioners did not obtain any injunction to stop the implementation of the trial court orders nor was there an injunction to prevent the trial court from hearing and ruling on the contempt case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> Petitioners' stubborn refusal cannot be excused just because they were convinced of its invalidity. Their resort to the processes of questioning the orders does not show that they are in good faith.<br><br>Petitioners likewise cannot invoke the principle of judicial courtesy.<br><br>Judicial courtesy is exercised by suspending a lower court's proceedings although there is no injunction or an order from a higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> The purpose is to avoid mooting the matter raised in the higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> It is exercised as a matter of respect and for practical considerations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br><br>However, this principle applies only if the continuation of the lower court's proceedings will render moot the issue raised in the higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br>In the two (2) cases involved, there are two (2) separate issues. In G.R. No. 174996, the issue was whether the orders of the trial court were valid. In this indirect contempt case, the issue is whether petitioners willfully disobeyed the orders of the trial court. Although this Court may find the orders invalid in G.R. No. 174996, the petitioners may still be cited in contempt for their contumacious refusal and defiance of the trial court orders. Therefore, the finding of indirect contempt will not render moot this Court's ruling in G.R. No. 174996.<br><br>This Court has acknowledged the trial court's power to cite parties in indirect contempt for their refusal to follow its orders, although the validity of the orders is being questioned in another proceeding.<br><br>In <i>Roxas v. Tipon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> this Court found a party guilty of contempt although the disobeyed order was the subject of a pending petition before the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>The issue of indirect contempt needs further discussion because while the Order of the RTC to allow audit of books of HEVRI has been rendered moot, it does not change the fact that at the time that the Order was a standing pronouncement, petitioners refused to heed it...<br><br>....<br><br>Contempt of court is defined as a disobedience to the Court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice and dignity. It signifies not only a willful disregard or disobedience of the court's orders, but such conduct which tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or in some manner to impede the due administration of justice. Contempt of court is a defiance of the authority, justice or dignity of the court; such conduct as tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or to interfere with or prejudice parties-litigant or their witnesses during litigation. <i>The asseverations made by petitioners to justify their refusal to allow inspection or audit were rejected by the trial court.</i><br><br>....<br><br>The RTC initiated the contempt charge. In the Order dated 9 January 2002, petitioners were directed to appear in court and to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of court for their refusal to allow Financial Catalyst, Inc. to audit the books of HEVRI. <i>Petitioners filed an urgent motion for reconsideration claiming that said order was the subject of a pending petition before the Court of Appeals and that they can only be cited for contempt by the filing of a verified petition.</i> The RTC denied the motion and reiterated in its Order on 26 April 2002 explaining that it chose to initiate the contempt charge.<br><br><i>The RTC acted on the basis of the unjustified refusal of petitioners to abide by its lawful order.</i> It is of no moment that private respondents may have filed several pleadings to urge the RTC to cite petitioners in contempt. Petitioners utterly violated an order issued by the trial court which act is considered contemptuous. Thus, in <i>Leonidas v. Judge Supnet</i>, the MTC's order to the bank to show cause why it should not be held in contempt, was adjudged as a legitimate exercise of the MTC's judicial discretion to determine whether the bank should be sanctioned for disregarding its previous orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In this case, petitioners were given several opportunities to comply with the trial court orders. Even after the trial court clarified which funds to turn over, they still refused to obey. While petitioners questioned the legality of these orders, they are immediately executory. Moreover, the parties do not have the power to determine for themselves what should and should not be excluded from the orders. Their failure to turn over the amounts showed petitioners' defiance and disregard for the authority of the trial court.<br><br>Petitioners argue that contempt proceedings are similar to criminal proceedings, and thus, there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt of their guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>The punishment for contempt is classified into two (2): civil contempt and criminal contempt.<br><br>Civil contempt is committed when a party fails to comply with an order of a court or judge "for the benefit of the other party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> A criminal contempt is committed when a party acts against the court's authority and dignity or commits a forbidden act tending to disrespect the court or judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><br>This stems from the two (2)-fold aspect of contempt which seeks: (i) to punish the party for disrespecting the court or its orders; and (ii) to compel the party to do an act or duty which it refuses to perform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup><br><br>In <i>Halili v. Court of Industrial Relations</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><blockquote>Due to this twofold aspect of the exercise of the power to punish them, contempts are classified as civil or criminal. <i>A civil contempt is the failure to do something ordered to be done by a court or a judge for the benefit of the opposing party therein</i>; and a criminal contempt, is conduct directed against the authority and dignity of a court or of a judge, as in unlawfully assailing or discrediting the authority or dignity of the court or judge, or in doing a duly forbidden act. Where the punishment imposed, whether against a party to a suit or a stranger, is wholly or primarily to protect or vindicate the dignity and power of the court, either by fine payable to the government or by imprisonment, or both, it is deemed a judgment in a criminal case. Where the punishment is by fine directed to be paid to a party in the nature of damages for the wrong inflicted, or by imprisonment as a coercive measure to enforce the performance of some act for the benefit of the party or in aid of the final judgment or decree rendered in his behalf, the contempt, judgment will, if made before final decree, be treated as in the nature of an interlocutory order, or, if made after final decree, as remedial in nature, and may be reviewed only on appeal from the final decree, or in such other mode as is appropriate to the review of judgments in civil cases. . . . The question of whether the contempt committed is civil or criminal, does not affect the jurisdiction or the power of a couit to punish the same. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt was further elaborated in <i>People v. Godoy</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup><br><blockquote>It has been said that the real character of the proceedings is to be determined by the relief sought, or the dominant purpose, and the proceedings are to be regarded as criminal when the purpose is primarily punishment, and civil when the purpose is primarily compensatory or remedial.<br><br>Criminal contempt proceedings are generally held to be in the nature of criminal or quasi-criminal actions. They are punitive in nature, and the Government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. Their purpose is to preserve the power and vindicate the authority and dignity of the court, and to punish for disobedience of its orders. Strictly speaking, however, they are not criminal proceedings or prosecutions, even though the contemptuous act involved is also a crime. The proceeding has been characterized as <i>sui generis</i>, partaking of some of the elements of both a civil and criminal proceeding, but really constituting neither. In general, criminal contempt proceedings should be conducted in accordance with the principles and rules applicable to criminal cases, in so far as such procedure is consistent with the summary nature of contempt proceedings. So it has been held that the strict rules that govern criminal prosecutions apply to a prosecution for criminal contempt, that the accused is to be afforded many of the protections provided in regular criminal cases, and that proceedings under statutes governing them are to be strictly construed. However, criminal proceedings are not required to take any particular form so long as the substantial rights of the accused are preserved.<br><br>Civil contempt proceedings are generally held to be remedial and civil in their nature; that is, <i>they are proceedings for the enforcement of some duty, and essentially a remedy for coercing a person to do the thing required</i>. As otherwise expressed, a proceeding for civil contempt is <i>one instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of a private party to an action and to compel obedience to a judgment or decree intended to benefit such a party litigant</i>. So a proceeding is one for civil contempt, regardless of its form, <i>if the act charged is wholly the disobedience, by one party to a suit, of a special order made in behalf of the other party and the disobeyed order may still be obeyed, and the purpose of the punishment is to aid in an enforcement of obedience</i>. The <i>rules of procedure governing criminal contempt proceedings, or criminal prosecutions, ordinarily are inapplicable to civil contempt proceedings</i> . . .<br><br>In general, civil contempt proceedings should be instituted by an aggrieved party, or his successor, or someone who has a pecuniary interest in the right to be protected. In criminal contempt proceedings, it is generally held that the State is the real prosecutor.<br><br>Contempt is not presumed. In proceedings for criminal contempt, the defendant is presumed innocent and the burden is on the prosecution to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. In proceedings for civil contempt, there is no presumption, although the burden of proof is on the complainant, and <i>while the proof need not be beyond reasonable doubt, it must amount to more than a mere preponderance of evidence. It has been said that the burden of proof in a civil contempt proceeding lies somewhere between the criminal "reasonable doubt" burden and the civil "fair preponderance" burden</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Civil contempt proceedings seek to compel the contemnor to obey a court order, judgment, or decree which he or she refuses to do for the benefit of another party. It is for the enforcement and the preservation of a right of a private party, who is the real party in interest in the proceedings. The purpose of the contemnor's punishment is to compel obedience to the order. Thus, civil contempt is not treated like a criminal proceeding and proof beyond reasonable doubt is not necessary to prove it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the dispositive portion of the Decision of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the respondents, namely: Bro.

Silvestre Pascual, the latter was impleaded in this case because he was a member of the Board of St. Francis School at the time the petition was filed, and he is empowered to cause compliance with these Orders.

Moreover, it has been established that the matriculation fees had already been turned over to Reynante.<br><br>Atty. Silvestre was indeed a member of the Board of Trustees. However, decisions of the Board of Trustees are not subject to the control of just one (1) person. While a board member may protest, the majority of the board may overrule him or her. Thus, it is not correct to say that a board member is empowered to cause compliance of the trial court orders. It does not matter if Atty. Silvestre was unable to prove his intention to comply with the orders.
