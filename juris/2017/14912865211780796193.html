Thus,<br><br><blockquote>Finally, it must be pointed out that complainants elevated the alleged erroneous decision of herein respondent judge to the Court of Appeals by way of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment, which the appellate court dismissed in a Resolution dated i4 October 2013.&nbsp; To us, such actuation <i>is an indication that complainants indeed recognized that the issue that they were raising against respondent judge was one that was appropriate for judicial determination</i>. Also noteworthy is the fact that after their petition for annulment f judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, complainants sought recourse.&nbsp; On 17 September 2015, they filed an administrative complaint before this Office... (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>An issue of jurisdiction is a judicial matter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; which can only be decided upon through judicial remedies.

Nothing therefore would have precluded petitioners herein from amending their Answer to the Complaint in Civil Case No. 302 to raise at the start the issue that the Court Lacked any jurisdiction over the same because of the location of the subject property.

Because of this representation, defendants were able to secure loan from NIA-CAR, or from the Province of Benguet (Exhibits "1", "2", "3" and "4"). Defendants could not therefore state that they are under the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Pangasinan considering that with the dismissal of this case, it would greatly favor them.<br><br>Moreover, the Land Classification Map appended to Exhibit "13" clearly states therein that "Municipal boundaries are not established nor located on the ground but are merely indicated hereon as taken from available references.
