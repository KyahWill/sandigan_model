The Quezon City property's tax declarations revealed that Iglesias purchased the property on August 1, 1996 from the spouses Rosario and Elpidio Ablang. Likewise, the Pangasinan property's Transfer Certificate of Title was issued by virtue of a deed of sale showing that she purchased a portion of this property from Marina Lopez de Joya (Marina).

Otherwise, substantial justice would be undermined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner insists that the February 7, 2005 Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman was based on new accusations that were not included in the Complaint Affidavit filed by Atty. Acuña and Pizarro. She anchors her argument on the findings of the Ombudsman:<br><blockquote>"In her <b>first year</b> in the government service, respondent reported a net worth of P245,000.00 in her 1989 SALN, which swiftly grew to P1,685,000.00 during her <b>second year (1990 SALN)</b>. The additional P1,440,000.00 accumulated by respondent is a 60% jump from her <b>1989 net worth</b>. During that same period, respondent was able to purchase a property in Paco, Manila, in the amount of P800,000.00, acquired additional jewelry worth P250,000.00, and maintained cash in the bank in the amount of P400,000.00. This sudden upsurge in respondent's net worth, within the short period of one (1) year, is unjustified considering that she had no other employment, business activity or financial interests from which the acquisitions can be funded other than her employment in the Bureau of Customs.<br><br>"Respondent's <b>1991 and 1992 SALN</b> likewise reflected the meteoric rise of her assets. From the declared cash of P250,000.00 in 1991, the same soared high to the amount of P1,770,000.00 which was not sufficiently justified or explained by her income from the government, or her reported total new loans of P610,000.00, consisting of jewelry loan in the amount of P110,000.00 and an agricultural loan in the amount of P500,000.00.<br><br>"Apart from the properties in New Manila, Quezon City, and Pampanga which respondent justified as to have been inherited by her from her parents, respondent is likewise the owner of several properties located in Baguio City, Parañaque City, and Novaliches, Quezon City, which she acquired beginning <b>1994 to 2000</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Considering the above, this Court finds that there was a violation of due process with respect to the other charges which were <i>not in the original complaint</i>. This Court sternly reminds the Ombudsman that he cannot add new findings which were not part of the original complaint. To do so would violate the right of the accused to due process.<br><br>However, there were charges in the <i>original complaint</i> which should prosper. A reading of the Office of the Ombudsman Resolution reveals that she was dismissed from service not solely on the irregularities found in her 1989 to 1999 SALNs but also because of anomalies found in her 2000 to 2002 SALNs, which she was informed of and was given the opportunity to refute. Petitioner conveniently left out in her pleadings the following findings of the Office of the Ombudsman:<br><blockquote>It should be noted, however, that respondent has two (2) Baguio properties indicated in her 2000-2002 SALNs. The first Baguio property was acquired in 1995, thus, its declaration in her 1996 SALN. From 1996-1999, she had been maintaining that same property. However, as evidenced by her 2000 SALN, she acquired another property in Baguio. Presuming that, as claimed by respondent, the PNB loan paid for the acquisition of the first Baguio property, with what funds did she acquire the second Baguio property?<br><br>Moreover, on the same year, respondent also acquired the Para[ñ]aque property. <i>Although respondent claims that she sold one of the Baguio properties to buy the Para[ñ]aque property, she continued to declare the Baguio properties as her own in her SALN for 2000-2002</i>. This, therefore, would belie any assertion of sale . . .<br><br><i>Incidentally, it should be noted that during the years 2000-2002, respondent was no longer declaring any cash in bank as part of her assets.</i> She did not declare the proceeds received from the sale of the Baguio property to Mario Nicolas despite her admission that she was given the initial payment of P1,100,000.00. Granted that she used P1,000,000.00 thereof to make the [down payment] on the Para[ñ]aque property, this would still leave her with P100,000.00 cash in hand, not to forget the balance of P1,100,000.00 still owing her, which should have been declared as patt of her assets.<br><br>As for the monthly amortization for the Para[ñ]aque property that had to be paid to BPI, the claim that the rentals on the New Manila property answered for it does not seem to hold water. <i>First, respondent claims that in view of the fact that she has defaulted on the payments on the PNB loan, the PNB has since foreclosed the property. The inscription at the back of the title states that the property was foreclosed in 1999. This, thus, precludes respondent from having the place rented. Second, assuming that the said foreclosure is being contested and is now the subject of pending litigation, it is a puzzle how the lease was effected and why it was made for a lengthy period of time. Third, respondent did not specify how much the lease rental was and if it were sufficient to pay for the monthly mortgage owing BPI, and, most importantly, respondent failed to present evidence to substantiate the claim of lease by JIM-Mar Enterprises.</i><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">. . . .<br></div><blockquote>As for the trucks and vans, respondent justifies that the same were acquired by virtue of a loan from PNB-Dagupan Branch in the amount of Two Million Pe os (P2,000,000.00). She claims that the same loan was used to buy the dump trucks, van, and other equipment, and as operating capital for her trucking business. <span style="font-style: italic;">Respondent, however, failed to present evidence regarding the said loan and the security used to obtain it. She also did not present any evidence regarding the trucking business. Also, she did not disclose this in her SALN as one of her business interests.</span><br><br>Further, respondent admitted to committing another act of falsific:ation. <i>In explaining the classification of the Pampanga property as an inheritance/donation inter vivos, respondent admitted that she misdeclared the true value of the said land as merely P50,000.00 in the Deed of Sale conveying the said property in her favor.</i> This scheme was obviously resorted to in order to evade the payment of higher taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (Emph[lsis supplied)<br></blockquote>Even if the findings in relation to petitioner's 1989 to 1999 SALNs were disregarded, petitioner would still be liable for the discrepancies in her 2000 to 2002 SALNs. These discrepancies were stated in the Complaint Affidavit and were given clarification by petitioner in her Counter-Affidavit and Position Paper. Moreover, she was able to move for reconsideration of the Office of the Ombudsman February 7, 2005 Resolution. These circumstances preclude petitioner from claiming that she was denied her right to due process.<br><br>On a final note, this Court endeavors to strike a balance between the accountability of public officers as a result of public office being a privilege, on the one hand, and their right to privacy as protected in the Bill of Rights, on the other. Although this Court has held that the requirement of submitting a SALN does not violate the right to privacy of public officers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> it does not mean that they should completely shed this right. Therefore, minor or explainable errors in the SALN, which cannot be related to an attempt to conceal illicit activities should not be punishable. This Court may relax the rule on strictly complying with the SALN in cases where minor errors were committed since these may simply be used to harass and obstruct public officers in the performance of their duties. However, the errors in this case were so substantial and glaring that they should not escape prosecution.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated December 22, 2006 and the Resolution dated November 1, 4007 of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.
