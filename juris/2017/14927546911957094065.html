The assailed Decision affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated December 29, 2004 of the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in Case No. BLR-A-C-75-8-24-04, <i>In Re: Petition for Cancellation of Union Registration of Bigkis Manggagawa sa De Ocampo Memorial School, Inc., - Lakas Union Registration Number (NCR-12-CC-002-2003)</i>.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>De Ocampo Memorial Schools, Inc. (De Ocampo) is a domestic corporation duly-organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines. It has two main divisions, namely: De Ocampo Memorial Medical Center (DOMMC), its hospital entity, and the De Ocampo Memorial Colleges (DOMC), its school entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On September 26, 2003, Union Registration No. NCR-UR-9-3858-2002 was issued in favor of Bigkis Manggagawa sa De Ocampo Memorial Medical Center - LAKAS (BMDOMMC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Later, on December 5, 2003, <i>Bigkis Manggagawa sa</i> De Ocampo Memorial School, Inc. (BMDOMSI) was issued a Union Registration/Certificate of Creation of Local Chapter No. NCR-12-CC-002-2003 and declared a legitimate labor organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On March 4, 2004, De Ocampo filed a Petition for Cancellation of Certificate of Registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the Department of Labor and Employment - National Capital Region (DOLE-NCR). It sought to cancel the Certificate of Registration of BMDOMSI on the following grounds: 1) misrepresentation, false statement and fraud in connection with its creation and registration as a labor union as it shared the same set of officers and members with BMDOMMC; 2) mixed membership of rank-and-file and managerial/supervisory employees; and 3) inappropriate bargaining unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On April 13, 2004, De Ocampo filed a Supplemental Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> informing the DOLE-NCR of the cancellation of the Certificate of Registration of BMDOMMC in Case No. NCR-OD-0307-009-LRD. It attached a copy of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the DOLE-NCR dated March 3, 2004, which cancelled and struck off Union Registration No. NCR-UR-9-3858-2002 from the registry of legitimate labor organizations for being an inappropriate bargaining unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On May 18, 2004, BMDOMSI filed its Comment-Opposition to Petition for Cancellation of Certificate of Registration and Supplemental Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> denying De Ocampo's allegations and claiming that the latter only wants to impede the formation of the union.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated July 26, 2004, Acting Regional Director Ciriaco A. Lagunzad III of the DOLE-NCR ruled that BMDOMSI committed misrepresentation by <i>making it appear</i> that the bargaining unit is composed of faculty and technical employees. In fact, all the union officers and most of the members are from the General Services Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Furthermore, the members of the union do not share commonality of interest, as it is composed of academic and non-academic personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The nature of work of the employees of the General Services Division, while falling within the category of non-academic personnel, differs from that of the other non-academic employees composed of clerks, messengers, <i>etc.</i>, since they also serve the hospital component of De Ocampo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>BMDOMSI then filed an appeal to the BLR alleging that the union members are all employees of De Ocampo and that the bargaining unit it seeks to represent is appropriate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated December 29, 2004, the BLR reversed the Regional Director's finding of misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in BMDOMSI's application for registration. According to the BLR, De Ocampo failed to adduce proof to support its allegation of mixed membership within respondent union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Further, and contrary to De Ocampo's claim, records show that BMDOMSI stated in its application that its members are composed of rank-and-file employees falling under either faculty or technical occupational classifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The BLR also held that the existence of an inappropriate bargaining unit would not necessarily result in the cancellation of union registration, and the inclusion of a disqualified employee in a union is not a ground for cancellation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Even if BMDOMSI shared the same set of officers and members of BMDOMMC, the latter had already been delisted on March 3, 2004 and there is no prohibition against organizing another union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>De Ocampo filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> with the CA seeking to annul and set aside the BLR Decision as well as the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated January 24, 2005 denying its motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The CA affirmed the Decision of the BLR. It ruled that there was no misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in the application for registration.&nbsp; The record shows that, as BMDOMSI had indicated, the bargaining unit as described is composed of rank-and-file employees with occupational classifications under technical and faculty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The CA found that there could be no misrepresentation as the members appearing in the minutes of the general membership meeting, and the list of members who attended the meeting and ratified the union constitution and by-laws, are in truth employees of the school, though some service the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The CA also ruled that, other than De Ocampo's bare allegations, there was no proof of intent to defraud or mislead on the part of BMDOMSI. Hence, the charge of fraud, false statement or misrepresentation cannot be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>However, the CA observed that the members of the union, who are from academic, non-academic, and general services, do not perform work of the same nature, receive the same wages and compensation, nor share a common stake in concerted activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> While these factors dictate the separation of the categories of employees for purposes of collective bargaining,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the CA reasoned that such lack of mutuality and commonality of interest of the union members is not among the grounds for cancellation of union registration under Article 239 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>De Ocampo filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied in the assailed Resolution dated June 21, 2010. Hence, this petition.<br><br>De Ocampo maintains that BMDOMSI committed misrepresentation and fraud in connection with its application, creation and registration. It intentionally suppressed the fact that at the time of its application, there was another union known as BMDOMMC, with whom they shared the same set of officers and members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It was also made to appear that BMDOMMC is a labor union representing a separate bargaining unit whose personality, affairs and composition are unknown to BMDOMSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Lastly, BMDOMSI suppressed the fact that its members have no mutuality or commonality of interest as they belong to different work classifications, nature and designations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>Article 247, previously Article 239 of the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 247. <i>Grounds for Cancellation of Union Registration</i>. - The following may constitute grounds for cancellation of union registration:<br><br>(a) Misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in connection with the adoption or ratification of the constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto, the minutes of ratification, and the list of members who took part in the ratification;<br><br>(b) Misrepresentation, false statements or fraud in connection with the election of officers, minutes of the election of officers, and the list of voters;<br><br>(c) Voluntary dissolution by the members.<br></blockquote>For fraud and misrepresentation to constitute grounds for cancellation of union registration under the Labor Code, the nature of the fraud and misrepresentation must be <b>grave and compelling</b> enough to vitiate the consent of a majority of union members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>De Ocampo insists that "by conveniently disregarding" BMDOMMC's existence during the filing of its application, despite having the same set of officers and members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> BMDOMSI "had misrepresented facts, made false statements and committed fraud in its application for union registration for alleging facts therein which they [know] or ought to have known to be false."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>We agree with the BLR and the CA that BMDOMSI did not commit fraud or misrepresentation in its application for registration. In the form "Report of Creation of Local Chapter"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> filed by BMDOMSI, the applicant indicated in the portion "Description of the Bargaining Unit" that it is composed of "Rank and File" and under the "Occupational Classification," it marked "Technical" and "Faculty."<br><br>Further, the members appearing in the Minutes of the General Membership and the List of Workers or Members who attended the organizational meeting and adopted/ratified the Constitution and By-Laws are, as represented, employees of the school and the General Services Division, though some of the latter employees service the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Moreover, there is nothing in the form "Report of Creation of Local Chapter" that requires the applicant to disclose the existence of another union, much less the names of the officers of such other union. Thus, we cannot see how BMDOMSI made the alleged misrepresentation or false statements in its application.<br><br>De Ocampo likewise claims that BMDOMSI committed fraud and misrepresentation when it suppressed the fact that there exists "no mutuality and/or communality of interest"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of its members. This, De Ocampo asserts, is a ground for the cancellation of its registration.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>While the CA may have ruled that there is no mutuality or commonality of interests among the members of BMDOMSI, this is not enough reason to cancel its registration. The only grounds on which the cancellation of a union's registration may be sought are those found in Article 247 of the Labor Code. In <i>Tagaytay Highlands International Golf Club Incorporated v. Tagaytay Highlands Employees Union-PTGWO</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we ruled that "[t]he inclusion in a union of disqualified employees is not among the grounds for cancellation, unless such inclusion is due to misrepresentation, false statement or fraud under the circumstances enumerated in Sections (a) and (c) of Article [247] x x x of the Labor Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thus, for purposes of de-certifying a union, it is not enough to establish that the rank-and-file union includes ineligible employees in its membership. Pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 247 of the Labor Code, it must be shown that there was misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in connection with: (1) the adoption or ratification of the constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto; (2) the minutes of ratification; (3) the election of officers; (4) the minutes of the election of officers; and (5) the list of voters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Failure to submit these documents together with the list of the newly elected-appointed officers and their postal addresses to the BLR may also constitute grounds for cancellation, lack of mutuality of interests, however, is not among said grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The BLR and the CA's finding that the members of BMDOMSI are rank-and-file employees is supported by substantial evidence and is binding on this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> On the other hand, other than the allegation that BMDOMSI has the same set of officers with BMDOMMC and the allegation of mixed membership of rank-and-file and managerial or supervisory employees, De Ocampo has cited no other evidence of the alleged fraud and misrepresentation.<br><br>A final word. A party seeking the cancellation of a union's certificate of registration must bear in mind that:<br><blockquote>x x x [A] direct challenge to the legitimacy of a labor organization based on fraud and misrepresentation in securing its certificate of registration is a serious allegation which deserves careful scrutiny. Allegations thereof should be compounded with supporting circumstances and evidence. The records of the case are devoid of such evidence. Furthermore, this Court is not a trier of facts, and this doctrine applies with greater force in labor cases. Findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, such as the BLR, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only great respect but even finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.
