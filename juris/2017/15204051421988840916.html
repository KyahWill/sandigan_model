Thus, for purposes of determining the just compensation, RA 8974<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and its implementing rules and regulations (IRR), which were effective at the time of the filing of the complaint, shall govern.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p> Under Section 10 of the IRR, the improvements and/or structures on the land to be acquired shall be appraised using the <b>replacement cost method</b>, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 10. <i>Valuation of Improvements and/or Structures</i>. — Pursuant to Section 7 of [RA 8974], the Implementing Agency shall determine the valuation of the improvements and/or structures on the land to be acquired using the replacement cost method.<strong> The replacement cost of the improvements/structures is defined as the amount necessary to replace the improvements/structures, based on the current market prices for materials, equipment, labor, contractor's profit and overhead, and all other attendant costs associated with the acquisition and installation in place of the affected improvements/structures.</strong> In the valuation of the affected improvements/structures, the Implementing Agency shall consider, among other things, the kinds and quantities of materials/equipment used, the location, configuration and other physical features of the properties, and prevailing construction prices. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The replacement cost method is premised on the principle of substitution, which means that "all things being equal, a rational, informed purchaser would pay no more for a property than the cost of building an acceptable substitute with like utility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> Accordingly, the Implementing Agency should consider: (<em>a</em>) <u>construction costs</u> or the current market price of materials, equipment, labor, as well as the contractor's profit and overhead; and (<em>b</em>) <u>attendant costs</u> or the cost associated with the acquisition and installation of an acceptable substitute in place of the affected improvements/structures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In addition, the case of <i>Republic v. Mupas (Mupas)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> instructs that in using the replacement cost method to ascertain the value of improvements, the courts may also consider the <b>relevant standards</b> provided under Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of RA 8974, as well as <b>equity </b>consistent with the principle that eminent domain is a concept of <i>equity and fairness</i> that attempts to make the landowner whole. Thus, it is not the amount of the owner's investment, but the "value of the interest" in land taken by eminent domain, that is guaranteed to the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> While there are various methods of appraising a property using the cost approach, among them, the reproduction cost, the replacement cost new, and the depreciated replacement cost, <i>Mupas</i> declared that the use of the <b><i><u>depreciated replacement cost method</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> is consistent with the principle that the property owner shall be compensated for his actual loss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> bearing in mind that the concept of just compensation does not imply fairness to the property owner alone, but must likewise be just to the public which ultimately bears the cost of expropriation. <b>The property owner is entitled to compensation only for what he actually loses, and what he loses is only the actual value of the property at the time of the taking.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Hence, even as undervaluation would deprive the owner of his property without due process, so too would its overvaluation unduly favor him to the prejudice of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> It must be emphasized that in determining just compensation, the courts <u>must consider and apply</u> the parameters set by the law and its implementing rules and regulations in order to ensure that they do not arbitrarily fix an amount as just compensation that is contradictory to the objectives of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Be that as it may, when acting within the parameters set by the law itself, courts are not strictly bound to apply the formula to its minutest detail, particularly when faced with situations that do not warrant the formula's strict application. <b>Thus, the courts may, in the exercise of their discretion, relax the formula's application,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> subject to the jurisprudential limitation that the factual situation calls for it and the courts clearly explain the reason for such deviation.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the RTC and the CA upheld the recommendation of the court-appointed commissioners, fixing the just compensation for the improvements on the expropriated properties at P12,000.00/sq. m., which merely considered their location, classification, value declared by the owner, and the zonal valuation of the subject lots. However, there is no competent evidence showing that it took into account the prevailing construction costs and all other attendant costs associated with the acquisition and installation of an acceptable substitute in place of the affected improvements/structures as required by the IRR. Consequently, the Court cannot uphold and must, perforce, set aside the said valuation as the just compensation for the subject improvements.</p><p> On the other hand, it is unclear how the parameters set by the IRR have been factored-in in petitioner's proposed valuation of P11,138,362.74.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus, the Court cannot automatically adopt petitioner's own computation as prayed for in the instant petition. Neither can the Court accept respondent's submitted valuation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> which claimed to have used the prevailing replacement cost method for lack of proper substantiation to support the correctness of the values or data used in such computation.</p><p> It must be emphasized that the veracity of the facts and figures which the parties used in their respective computations involves the resolution of questions of fact which is, as a rule, improper in a petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> since the Court is not a trier of facts. Thus, a remand of this case for reception of further evidence is necessary in order for the RTC to determine just compensation for the subject improvements in accordance with the guidelines set under RA 8974 and its IRR.</p><p>In relation thereto, the Court deems it proper to correct the award of legal interest to be imposed on the unpaid balance of the just compensation, which shall be computed at the rate of twelve percent (12%) p.a. from the date of taking, <em>i.e</em>., from April 10, 2013 when the RTC issued a writ of possession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> in favor of petitioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> until June 30, 2013. Thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due respondent shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) p.a.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> in line with the amendment introduced by BSP-MB Circular No. 799, Series of 2013. </p><p> Finally, the Court finds the award of attorney's fees to be improper and should be, accordingly, deleted. Even when a claimant is compelled to incur expenses to protect his rights, attorney's fees may still be withheld where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party's persistence in a suit other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The case of <i>Republic v. CA (Republic)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> cited by the CA to justify the award is inapplicable because, unlike in this case where petitioner only acquired possession of the expropriated properties after paying respondent the amount of P17,822,362.74, representing the 100% zonal valuation thereof, the petitioner in <i>Republic</i> took possession of the landowner's real property without initiating expropriation proceedings, and over the latter's objection.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated July 1, 2016 and the Resolution dated January 23, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 102033 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> insofar as it upheld the just compensation fixed by the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, Branch 270 (RTC) for the subject 1,671-square meter (sq. m.) lots at P15,000.00/sq. m. However, the valuation of P12,000.00/ sq. m. fixed by the lower courts as the replacement cost of the subject improvements with an aggregate surface area of 2,121.7 sq. m. is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and Civil Case No. 38-V-13 is <b>REMANDED</b> to the RTC for reception of evidence on the issue of just compensation therefor in accordance with the guidelines set under Republic Act No. 8974 and its implementing rules and regulations. Legal interest is hereby imposed on the unpaid balance of the just compensation, as determined by the RTC, at twelve percent (12%) per annum (p.a.) reckoned from April 10, 2013 to June 30, 2013 and, thereafter, at six percent (6%) p.a. until full payment. Finally, the award of attorney's fees is <b>DELETED</b> for lack of factual and legal bases.</p><p> The RTC is directed to conduct the proceedings in said case with reasonable dispatch, and to submit to the Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within sixty (60) days from notice of this Decision.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <em>Carpio (Chairperson), Peralta, Caguioa</em>, and <em>Reyes, Jr., JJ</em>., concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 28-55. <p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 60-70.
