For this reason, you are advised to explain or show cause why your employment with Urios College will not be terminated for Serious Misconduct due to intentional misclassification/miscomputation of your salary and some employees named hereunder, thereby causing prejudice not only to the school but also to said employees as well.<br><ol><li>As Comptroller then, you belong to Office Pleads classification.

However, what is reflected in the Schedule of Salary Adjustment is PhP 1,000.00, which amount is appropriately given to Master's Degree holders. Considering that you have not even finished the degree up to the present, such circumstance resulted to overpayment in your salary by PhP 200.00 per month since June 2001.<br><br>This means that you have been receiving a monthly salary more than what is due to you. The overpayment therefore of PhP 3,851.76 per month (PhP 3,651.76 plus PhP 200.00) from June 2001 up to February 2005 presently amounts to PhP 185,131.34.<br><br></li><li>As Community Extension Service Officer then, Mrs. Nena A.

This entitled her [to] PhP 500.00 adjustment in salary due to Educational Qualification (E.Q.). However, what is reflected in the Schedule of Salary Adjustment is PhP 1,000.00, which resulted to overpayment in salary by PhP 500.00 from June 2001 to March 2003, or in the total amount of PhP 11,000.00.<br></li></ol>The foregoing actuations would necessarily affect your character as a teacher in the Commerce Program, and as an employee of the school, whose honesty and integrity ought to be beyond reproach to serve as role model for the students in this institution.<br><br>We are therefore requesting for your written explanation relative to these matters within three (3) days from receipt of this memorandum. Documentary evidence, if there be any, [may be] attached to the written explanation.

But, as regards a managerial employee, mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust of his employer would suffice for his dismissal. Hence, in the case of managerial employees, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for such loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br><br>Although a less stringent degree of proof is required in termination cases involving managerial employees, employers may not invoke the ground of loss of trust and confidence arbitrarily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> The prerogative of employers in dismissing a managerial employee "must be exercised without abuse of discretion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>Set against these parameters, this Court holds that petitioner was validly dismissed based on loss of trust and confidence. Petitioner was not an ordinary rank-and-file employee. His position of responsibility on delicate financial matters entailed a substantial amount of trust from respondent. The entire payroll account depended on the accuracy of the classifications made by the Comptroller. It was reasonable for the employer to trust that he had basis for his computations especially with respect to his own compensation. The preparation of the payroll is a sensitive matter requiring attention to detail. Not only does the payroll involve the company's finances, it also affects the welfare of all other employees who rely on their monthly salaries.<br><br>Petitioner's act in assigning to himself a higher salary rate without proper authorization is a clear breach of the trust and confidence reposed in him. In addition, there was no reason for the Comptroller's Office to undertake the preparation of its own summary table because this was a function that exclusively pertained to the Human Resources Department. Petitioner offered no explanation about the Comptroller's Office's deviation from company procedure and the discrepancies in the computation of other employees' salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Petitioner's position made him accountable in ensuring that the Comptroller's Office observed the company's established procedures. It was reasonable that he should be held liable by respondent on the basis of command responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>In termination based on just causes, the employer must comply with procedural due process by furnishing the employee a written notice containing the specific grounds or causes for dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The notice must also direct the employee to submit his or her written explanation within a reasonable period from the receipt of the notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Afterwards, the employer must give the employee ample opportunity to be heard and defend himself or herself. A hearing, however, is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> A formal hearing only becomes mandatory in termination cases when so required under company rules or when the employee requests for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>Previously, a formal hearing was considered as an indispensable component of procedural due process in dismissal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> However, in <i>Perez v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Co.</i>, this Court clarified:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><blockquote>The test for the fair procedure guaranteed under Article 277 (b) [now, Article 292(b)] cannot be whether there has been a formal pretermination confrontation between the employer and the employee. The "ample opportunity to be heard" standard is neither synonymous nor similar to a formal hearing. To confine the employee's right to be heard to a solitary form narrows down that right. It deprives him of other equally effective forms of adducing evidence in his defense. Certainly, such an exclusivist and absolutist interpretation is overly restrictive. <i>The "very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation."</i><br><br>. . . .<br><br>Significantly, Section 2 (d), Rule I of the Implementing Rules of Book VI of the Labor Code itself provides that the so-called standards of due process outlined therein shall be observed "<i>substantially</i>", not strictly. This is a recognition that <i>while a formal hearing or conference is ideal, it is not an absolute, mandatory or exclusive avenue of due process</i>.<br><br>An employee's right to be heard in termination cases under Article 277 (b) as implemented by Section 2 (d), Rule I of the Implementing Rules of Book VI of the Labor Code should be interpreted in broad strokes. It is satisfied not only by a formal face to face confrontation but by any meaningful opportunity to controvert the charges against him and to submit evidence in support thereof.<br><br>. . . <i>"To be heard" does not mean verbal argumentation alone inasmuch as one may be heard just as effectively through written explanations, submissions or pleadings.</i> Therefore, while the phrase "ample opportunity to be heard" may in fact include an actual hearing, it is not limited to a formal hearing only. In other words, the existence of an actual, formal "trial-type" hearing, although preferred, is not absolutely necessary to satisfy the employee's right to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Any meaningful opportunity for the employee to present evidence and address the charges against him or her satisfies the requirement of ample opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>Finally, the employer must serve a notice informing the employee of his or her dismissal from employment.<br><br>In this case, respondent complied with all the requirements of procedural due process in terminating petitioner's employment. Respondent furnished petitioner a show cause memo stating the specific grounds for dismissal. The show cause memo also required petitioner to answer the charges by submitting a written explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> Respondent even informed petitioner that he may avail the services of counsel. Respondent then conducted a thorough investigation. Three (3) hearings were conducted on separate occasions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> The findings of the investigation committee were then sent to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Lastly, petitioner was given a notice of termination containing respondent's final decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>Ordinarily, employees play no part in selecting the members of the investigating committee. That petitioner was not given the chance to comment on the selection of the members of the investigating committee does not mean that he was deprived of due process. In addition, there is no evidence indicating that the investigating committee was biased against petitioner. Hence, there is no merit in petitioner's claim that he was deprived of due process.<br><br>Under Article 294 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> the reliefs of an illegally dismissed employee are reinstatement and full backwages. "Backwages is a form of relief that restores the income that was lost by reason of [the employee's] dismissal" from employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> It is "computed from the time that [the employee's] compensation was withheld . . .
