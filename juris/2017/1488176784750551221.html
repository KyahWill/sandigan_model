Hence, he advised Jun to ask Verona's relatives to wait for his arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>It took a while before Eddie's employer finally permitted him to go home.

The Spouses Dizon's respective lawyers witnessed the signing. After Verona's death, Vida tolerated the petitioners' stay in the disputed property.

Eddie, on the other hand, could not have signed the Deed as well since he left the Philippines on September 27, 2009 and returned only on December 21, 2009. Further, Verona's signature appearing on the Deed was distinctly different from those she had affixed in her petition for the issuance of a temporary protection order and Compromise Agreement, dated March 26, 2008 and April 9, 2008, respectively. Besides, the purchase price of P1,500,000.00 was not in accord with the Spouses Dizon's agreement to sell the disputed property for not less than P4,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On November 11, 2011, the MTCC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> directing the petitioners and their co-defendants to turn over to Vida the possession of the disputed property, and pay P1,000.00 monthly rent from July 12, 2010 until the said property is vacated, P20,000.00 as attorney's fees and cost of suit. Vida was, however, ordered to pay therein defendants P414,459.78 as remaining balance relative to the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The MTCC rationalized as follows:<br><blockquote>The claim of [the petitioners] as to the falsity of the sale is a collateral attack on the generated title itself, which can only be impugned in a direct proceeding litigated for that matter. The fact that [Eddie] presigned the [Deed] prior to the death of [Verona], in the presence of counsels[,] which remained unrebutted[,] was in fact giving consent to the act of disposing the property to answer for any exigency or impending situation that will arise later[,] which may or may not be entirely connected with the medical requirements of his ailing spouse[,] whose health condition at that time of the execution [of the Deed] ha[d] apparently started to deteriorate.

The CA's reasons are cited below:<br><blockquote>[Vida] was able to sufficiently allege and consequently established the requisites of unlawful detainer.<br><br><i>First</i>, [Vida] alleged that she is the registered owner of the [disputed] property and she merely tolerated the continuous possession of the [petitioners] [of] the [disputed] property after she purchased it and had it titled in her name. <i>Second</i>, [the petitioners'] possession became illegal upon notice by [Vida] to [the petitioners] of the termination of the [petitioners'] right of possession as shown by the Notice to Vacate dated 18 May 2010 sent by [Vida's] counsel to [the petitioners]. <i>Third</i>, [the petitioners] refused to vacate the [disputed] property x x x thereby depriving [Vida] of the enjoyment thereof. And <i>fourth</i>, [Vida] instituted the complaint dated 03 June 2010 for unlawful detainer within one (1) year from demand to vacate the premises. x x x.<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>x x x While the said [Deed] was questioned by [the petitioners] for being a nullity in a separate case, yet, it should be emphasized that the determination of the validity or the nullity of the [Deed] should be properly threshed out in that separate proceeding and not in the summary action for unlawful detainer. x x x.<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>x x x Nothing is more settled than the rule that "[i]n an unlawful detainer case, the sole issue for resolution is the physical or material possession of the property involved, independent of any claim of ownership by any of the parties. However, where the issue of ownership is raised, the courts may pass upon the issue of ownership in order to determine who has the right to possess the property. The Court stresses, however, that this adjudication is only an initial determination of ownership for the purpose of settling the issue of possession, the issue of ownership being inseparably linked thereto. The lower court's adjudication of ownership in the ejectment case is merely provisional and would not bar or prejudice an action between the same parties involving title to the property. It is, therefore, not conclusive as to the issue of ownership, which is the subject matter of a separate case for annulment of [the Deed] filed by [the petitioners].<br><br>x x x [T]he RTC[,] in resolving the issue of possession in the unlawful detainer case[,] has not only provisionally passed upon the issue of ownership of the [disputed] property but it in fact made a determinative and conclusive finding on the ownership thereof, contrary to the settled rule that in [an] unlawful detainer case, the only issue to be resolve[d] by the court is the physical or material possession of the property involved x x x.<br><br>x x x [W]hile the Court may make provisional determination of ownership in order to determine who between [Vida] and [the petitioners] had the better right to possess the property, yet, the court is proscribed from making a conclusive finding on this issue. x x x [T]hc RTC has already made a preemptive finding on the validity or invalidity of the document, [but] the resolution thereof properly pertains to a separate proceeding pending before it in a separate case. x x x.<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>x x x [T]his Court agrees with the contention of [Vida] that the RTC:'s pronouncement that the signatures in the [Deed] were forged and [Vida's] title issued pursuant thereto is void is a collateral attack on [Vida's] title which violates the [principle of] indefeasibility of the Torrens title. x x x<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Verily, unless and until [Vida's] title over the [disputed] property is annulled in a separate proceeding instituted by [the petitioners], the same is valid and [Vida] has the right to possess the subject property, being an attribute of her ownership over it. x x x.<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>x x x [T]o stay the immediate execution of judgment in ejectment proceedings, the defendant-appellant must: (a) perfect his appeal, (b) file a supersedeas bond, and (c) periodically deposit the rentals falling due during the pendency of the appeal.<br><br>x x x [T]he supersedeas bond was paid by [the petitioners] only on 02 May 2012. x x x [T]he bond filed by [the petitioners] in order to stay the immediate execution of the MTCC Decision was filed out of time as it was not filed within the period to appeal.<br><br>x x x [T]he failure of the [petitioners] in this case to comply with <i>any</i> of the conditions provided under Section 19, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court is a ground tor the <i>outright execution</i> of the judgment, the duty of the court in this respect being "ministerial and imperative." x x x.<br><br>Thus, as the supersedeas bond was filed out of time or beyond the period to appeal, [Vida's] motion for immediate execution should have been acted upon by the RTC and the writ of execution should have been issued as a matter of right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Citations omitted and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>The CA, through the herein assailed resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The instant petition is anchored on the issues of whether or not:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Vida has a cause of action for unlawful detainer against the petitioners considering that the Deed she relied upon in filing her complaint was falsified, hence, null; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify">the RTC conectly ruled that in an unlawful detainer case, the MTCC can resolve the issue of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>In support thereof, the petitioners point out that relative to the falsification case filed by Eddie against Vida, the Office of the Davao City Prosecutor issued a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated June 11, 2010, stating that no expert eye is needed to ascertain that the signatures appearing in the Deed were different from the standard signatures of the Spouses Dizon.

When the Deed was purportedly executed on December 1, 2009, Verona was already unconscious, while Eddie was abroad. Having been simulated, the Deed was void and inexistent. It produced no effect and cannot create, modify or extinguish a juridical relation. lienee, Vida had no right to transfer the title in her name using the falsified Deed.

The petitioners complied before the RTC rendered its Decision dated June 13, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As counterclaims, the petitioners impute malice and bad faith against Vida in filing the complaint for unlawful detainer.

Having been notarized, the Deed enjoys the presumption of due execution, and shall remain valid unless annulJed in a proper proceeding. Besides, the allegations of forgery and nullity of the Deed are immaterial in a summary action for unlawful detainer. Allowing the foregoing claims to be litigated amounts to a collateral attack on Vida's title.<br><br>Vidal also points out that the petitioners paid the su,fsersedeas bond only on May 2, 2012, beyond the period to perfect an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br><b>On matters of procedure</b><br><br>While the petitioners explicitly raise only two substantive issues, in the body of the petition, they discuss procedural matters anent their payment of the supersedeas bond and an alleged error on the part of the CA in concluding that the RTC should have issued a writ of execution relative to the MTCC's decision in Vida's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The petitioners admit that they posted the supersedeas bond beyond the period to perfect an appeal, but claim that it was the MTCC, which belatedly fixed the amount.

Therefore, <u>even if the appealing defendant was not able to file a supersedeas bond, and make periodic deposits to the appellate court, immediate execution of the MTC decision is not proper where the circumstances of the case fall under any of the above-mentioned exceptions</u>. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Citations omitted and underlining ours)<br></blockquote>In <i>Laurel, et al. v. Hon. Abalos, etc., et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> therein respondent filed an action for reformation of the deed of sale against therein petitioners pending the appeal of the unlawful detainer case before the RTC. The RTC thereafter denied therein petitioners' motion for the issuance of a writ of execution relative to the MTCC judgment, and required therein respondent to post a supersedeas bond. According to the Court, the peculiar environmental circumstances obtaining in the case justify the non-immediate execution of the MTCC's judgment pending appeal. The Court further expounded as follows:<br><blockquote>[T]his Court took pains at length to explain that this provision (regarding immediate execution of the judgment of inferior courts in cases of unlawful detainer) can be availed of only if no question of title is involved and the ownership or the right to the possession of the property is an admitted fact. Through Mr. Justice Labrador, this Court said in <i>De los Reyes vs. Castro, et al.</i>:<br><blockquote>.... The provision for the immediate execution of a judgment of the justice of the peace court in actions of unlawful detainer under Section 8 of Rule 72 of the [old] Rules of Court, is not applicable to an action of detainer like the present, where there is no immediate urgency for the execution because it is not justified by the circumstances. This view is based on the history of the action of forcible entry. This action originated in the English common law where it was originally in the form of a criminal proceeding whereby lands or properties seized through the use of force could immediately be returned. x x x.<br><br>It is the opinion of the writer that inasmuch as the propet1y now subject of litigation was originally sold only with right to repurchase to the plaintiff, so that <u>the plaintiff was not really and originally the owner and possessor of the property</u>, and since there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contract entered into between them was not one of lease but one of loan with mortgage of the property, <u>the right of the plaintiff to the immediate possession of the property is not apparent, clear or conclusive, and neither should his right to the immediate execution of the property [be] allowed until opportunity to settle the question of ownership is had. In other words, the writer of the opinion holds that while Section 8 of Rule 72 is applicable also in cases of unlawful detainer, the immediate execution it provides for may be availed of only if no question of title is involved and the ownership and the right to the possession of the property is an admitted fact</u>.<br></blockquote><div align="center"><blockquote><div>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div></blockquote></div>Where supervening events (occurring subsequent to the judgment) bring about a material change in the situation of the parties which makes the execution inequitable, or <u>where there is no compelling urgency for the execution because it is not justified by the prevailing circumstances, the court may stay immediate execution of the judgment</u>.<br><br>The assertion by Laput of "ownership" of the house she is occupying, the appeal pending in the [CA] from the decision in Civil Case 1517 which declared null and void from the beginning the deed of sale in favor of the petitioners, the latter's unexplained silence in the face of the manifestation filed by Laput informing this Court of the supervening occurrences, and their failure to submit their comment as required by this Court, are strong and sufficient additional reasons, cumulatively, to justify the dismissal of the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations, emphasis and italics omitted, and underlining ours)<br></blockquote>By analogy, in the unlawful detainer case from which the instant petition arose, Eddie was originally a co-owner of the disputed property, and he remains in possession thereof. Vida, on the other, is not even a resident of Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Moreover, prior to Vida's filing of the unlawful detainer case, Eddie had already instituted actions for nullification of the Deed and falsification of public documents. The Office of the Davao City Prosecutor had likewise made a preliminary determination of probable cause that forgery was committed. Eddie, thus, insists that no valid conveyance was made by Verona to Vida. In the mind of the Court, the foregoing are persuasive reasons justifying the non-immediate execution of the MTCC judgment despite the petitioners' belated posting of the supersedeas bond. Hence, the CA erred in declaring that the RTC improperly denied Vida's motion for the issuance of a writ of execution pending appeal.<br><br><b>On substantive issues</b><br><br>Being interrelated, the two substantive issues raised shall be discussed jointly. Essentially, the petitioners allege that the MTCC should have dismissed Vida's complaint for unlawful detainer for lack of basis as the Deed she relied upon is falsified and void. It is also claimed that the CA erred in not upholding the RTC's ruling that the latter can take cognizance of the issue of ownership in an unlawful detainer case.<br><br><i>The Court finds merit in the petitioners' arguments.</i><br><br>In <i>Consolacion D. Romero and Rosario S.D. Domingo v. Engracia D. Singson</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> where there were similar allegations of forgery and the issue of ownership was raised in the ejectment case, the Court pronounced:<br><blockquote>In arriving at its pronouncement, the CA passed upon the issue or claim of ownership, which both parties raised. While the procedure taken is allowed - under Section 16, Rule 70<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the issue of ownership may be resolved only to determine the issue of possession - <u>the CA nonetheless committed serious and patent error in concluding that based solely on respondent's TCT 12575 issued in her name, she must be considered the singular owner of the subject property and thus entitled to possession thereof - pursuant to the principle that "the person who has Torrens Title over a land is entitled to possession thereof</u>." Such provisional determination of ownership should have been resolved in petitioners' favor.<br><br><u>When the deed of sale in favor of respondent was purportedly executed by the parties thereto and notarized on June 6, 2006, it is perfectly obvious that the signatures of the vendors therein, Macario and Felicidad, were forged. They could not have signed the same, because both were by then, long deceased</u>: Macario died on Febmary 22, 1981, while Felicidad passed away on September 14, 1997. <u>This makes the June 6, 2006 deed of sale null and void; being so, it is "equivalent to nothing; it produces no civil effect; and it does not create, modify or extinguish a juridical relation.</u>"<br><br>And while it is true that respondent has in her favor a Torrens title ovet the subject property, she nonetheless acquired no right or title in her favor by virtue of the null and void June 6, 2006 deed. "<u>Verily, when the insttument presented is forged, even if accompanied by the owner's duplicate certificate of title, the registered owner does not thereby lose his title, and neither does the assignee in the forged deed acquire any right or title to the property</u>."<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</div><blockquote>Insofar as a person who fraudulently obtained a property is concerned, the registration of the property in said person's name would not be sufficient to vest in him or her the title to the property. A certificate of title merely confirms or records title already existing and vested. The indefeasibility of the Torrens title should not be used as a means to perpetrate fraud against the rightful owner of real property. Good faith must concur with registration because, otherwise, registration would be an exercise in futility. A Torrens title does not furnish a shield for fraud, notwithstanding the long-standing rule that registration is a constructive notice of title binding upon the whole world. The legal principle is that if the registration of the land is fraudulent, the person in whose name the land is registered holds it as a mere trustee.<br></blockquote><u>Since respondent acquired no right over the subject property, the same remained in the name of the original registered owners</u>, Macario and Felicidad. Being heirs of the owners, petitioners and respondent thus became, and remain co-owners - by succession - of the subject property. As such, petitioners may exercise all attributes of ownership over the same, including possession whether <i>de facto</i> or <i>dejure</i>; respondent thus has no right to exclude them from this right through an action for ejectment.<br><br><u>With the Court's detennination that respondent's title is null and void, the matter of direct or collateral attack is a foregone conclusion as well. "An action to declare the nullity of a void title does not prescribe and is susceptible to direct, as well as to collateral, attack;" petitioners wery not precluded from guestioning the validity of respondent's title in the ejectment case.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Citations and emphasis omitted and underlining ours)<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, when the Deed was executed on December 1, 2009, Eddie claimed that he was abroad while Verona was already unconscious. Vida did not directly refute these allegations and instead pointed out that the Deed was pre-signed in April of 2008. The foregoing circumstances reduced the Deed into the category of a private instrument as can be drawn from the Court's discussion in <i>Adelaida Meneses (deceased) v. Venturozo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>As notarized documents, [Deeds] carry evidentiary weight conferred upon them with respect to their due execution and enjoy the presumption of regularity which may only be rebutted by evidence so clear, strong and conyincing as to exclude all controversy as to falsity. The presumptions that attach to notarized documents can be affirmed only so long as it is beyond dispute that the notarization was regular. <u>A defective notarization will strip the document of its public character and reduce it to a private instrument. Consequently, when there is a defect in the notarization of a document, the clear and convincing evidentiary standard normally attached to a duly-notarized document is dispensed with, and the measure to test the validity of such document is preponderance of evidence.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Citations omitted and underlining ours)<br></blockquote>Further, in <i>Dela Rama, et al. v. Papa, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the Court elucidated that:<br><blockquote>Papas['] admissions, refreshing in their self-incriminatory candor, beat legal significance. <u>With respect to deeds of sale or conveyance, what spells the difference between a public document and a private document is the acknowledgment in the former that the parties acknowledging the document appear before the notary public and specifically manifest under oath that they are the persons who executed it, and acknowledge that the same are their free act and deed.</u> x x x<br><br><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>The presumptions that attach to notarized documents can be affirmed only so long as it is beyond dispute that the notarization was regular. We cannot ascribe that conclusion at bar to the deed of sale. <u>Respondent failed to confirm before the RTC that he had actually appeared before the notary public, a bare minimum requirement under Public Act No. 2103. Such defect will not <i>ipso facto</i> void the deed of sale. However, it eliminates the presumptions that are carried by notarized public documents and subject the deed of sale to a different level of scrutiny than that relied on by the [CA].</u> This consequence is with precedent. In <i>Tigno v. Sps. Aquino</i>, where the public document in question had been notarized by a judge who had no authority to do so, <u>the Court dispensed with the clear and convincing evidentiary standard normally attached to duly notarized documents, and instead applied preponderance of evidence as the measure to test the validity of that document</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Citations omitted and underlining ours)<br></blockquote>In the instant petition, Vida impliedly admits the irregularity of the Deed's notarization as both of the vendors were not personally present. Consequently, due execution can no longer be presumed. Besides, the extant circumstances surrounding the controversy constitute preponderant evidence suggesting that forgery was committed. Eddie promptly filed a criminal case for falsification of documents and a civil case to nullify the Deed. Later, the Office of the Davao City Prosecutor found probable cause to indict Vida for falsification. Consequently, the issue of ownership cannot be disregarded in the unlawful detainer case. It bears stressing though that while the RTC aptly resolved the issue of ownership, it is at best preliminary and shall not be determinative of the outcome of the two other cases filed by Eddie against Vida.<br><br><b>Other matters</b><br><br>The Court observes that the MTCC ruling, which the CA affirmed, is based partly on equitable grounds. Notably, the MTCC referred to Verona's medical expenses of P1,085,540.21, which Vida had shouldered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The Court commiserates with Vida, if indeed she remains unpaid by Eddie for Verona's medical and burial expenses. However, a creditor cannot resort to procedural shortcuts to collect in kind for sums of money owed by a debtor.<br><br>In sum, the Court agrees with the RTC that the dismissal of Vida's complaintifor unlawful detainer is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision and Resolution, dated January 23, 2015 and September 7, 2015, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 05256-MIN, are <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
