				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Postmaster General may only execute contracts for procurement of services with the Board of Directors' approval. However, this lack of authority may be ratified through the Board of Directors' silence or acquiescence. The ratification of the unauthorized act does not necessarily mean that the contract is valid. If the contract is executed without complying with the laws on procurement, the erring public official may be held administratively liable.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the May 4, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and July 14, 2011 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The Office of the Ombudsman found respondent Antonio Z. De Guzman (De Guzman) guilty of grave misconduct and dishonesty for entering into a contract with a private entity for mail delivery in Luzon despite not having prior approval from the Philippine Postal Corporation Board of Directors.<br><br>Sometime in 2001, the Philippine Postal Corporation entered into a contract with Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation (Aboitiz Air) for the carriage of mail at a rate of P5.00 per kilogram.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; This contract would expire on December 31, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sometime in October 2003, or after the expiry of its contract with Aboitiz Air, the Philippine Postal Corporation purchased 40 vehicles for mail deliveries in Luzon.

Cruz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Central Mail Exchange Center of the Philippine Postal Corporation conducted a post study of the delivery system and found that the expenses for the salaries and maintenance of its vehicles for Luzon deliveries were higher than its previous system of outsourcing deliveries to Aboitiz Air. On April 15, 2004, it submitted a recommendation that the Philippine Postal Corporation would save P6,110,152.44 per annum if deliveries were outsourced instead at the cost of P8.00 per kilogram.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On April 29, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Philippine Postal Corporation held a Special Board Meeting where De Guzman,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Officer-in-Charge, endorsed for approval the Central Mail Exchange Center's recommendation to outsource mail delivery in Luzon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On May 7, 2004, De Guzman sent a letter to Aboitiz Air, now Aboitiz One, Inc.

The terms and conditions shall be the same as stipulated in the previous contract except for the schedule and the rate. The attached revised schedule shall be followed and the rate shall be P8.00 per Kilogram.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote><br><br>Aboitiz One accepted the proposal and commenced its delivery operations in Luzon on May 20, 2004. When Postmaster General Diomedo P. Villanueva (Postmaster General Villanueva) resumed work, the Aboitiz One contract had already been fully implemented. Thus, the Postmaster General approved payments made to Aboitiz One for services rendered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On October 20, 2005, Atty. Sim Oresca Mata, Jr. filed an administrative complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman against De Guzman. He alleged that the Aboitiz One contract renewal was done without public bidding and that the rate per kilogram was unilaterally increased without the Philippine Postal Corporation Board of Directors' approval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his Counter-Affidavit, De Guzman alleged that the Office of the Ombudsman no longer had jurisdiction over the case since it was filed one (1) year and five (5) months after the commission of the act complained of, or after he sent his May 7, 2004 letter to Aboitiz. He also alleged that the contract renewal was approved by the Board of Directors in the April 29, 2004 Special Meeting. He maintained that the expiration of the employment contracts of the drivers caused a delay in the delivery of mail, which justified the approval of the outsourcing of deliveries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 2007, the Office of the Ombudsman rendered its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> finding De Guzman guilty of grave misconduct and dishonesty.

Hence, this Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was filed.<br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent committed grave misconduct since he was not authorized to enter into a contract with Aboitiz One or to allow the rate increase per kilogram of mail considering that in the April 29, 2004 Special Board Meeting, respondent was merely instructed to provide more information on Aboitiz One and to submit a copy of the proposed contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It insists that the approval of the contract was contingent upon respondent's compliance with the conditions set by the Board of Directors and that the Board of Directors was not fully apprised of the details during the meeting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner likewise submits that negotiated procurement was not applicable. It alleges that Aboitiz One took over only two (2) months after the expiration of the mail delivery drivers' employment contracts, showing no urgency in the situation. It also avers that the Board of Directors could only exercise negotiated procurement when there are substantiated claims of losses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Respondent counters that he obtained the Board of Directors' approval of his request for authority to enter into the outsourcing contract with Aboitiz One after a full disclosure to the Board of Directors of the cost-benefit analysis submitted by the Central Mail Exchange Center.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Respondent likewise contends that he had no legal duty to conduct a public bidding since he was not the procuring entity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Board of Directors, as the procuring entity, did not direct or suggest the conduct of a public bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He insists that negotiated procurement was necessary, arguing that the non-renewal of the mail delivery drivers' employment contracts would cause delay or stoppage of mail delivery to various parts' of the country.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Respondent explains that the Philippine Postal Corporation had been incurring costs of P21.00 per kilogram and that if services were outsourced at P8.00 per kilogram, it could save P13.00 per kilogram or a total of P6,110,152.44 per annum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; He alleges that this price would have been the most advantageous for the government since no other company offered a rate lower than P8.00 per kilogram for its Luzon mail deliveries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent further asserts that a public bidding was conducted in 2005, and Airfreight 2100, Inc., the winning bidder, refused the award and did not sign the contract. He states that due to the cancellation of Aboitiz One's contract on January 31, 2006, the Philippine Postal Corporation has incurred costs of more than P25.00 per kilogram in Luzon mail deliveries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Respondent contends that if he was the only official of the Philippine Postal Corporation found liable of grave misconduct and dishonesty, it would violate his right to due process since he merely endorsed for approval a recommendation by the Central Mail Exchange Center.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>This Court is tasked to resolve the issue of whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in absolving respondent Antonio Z. De Guzman of his administrative offenses. In resolving this issue, this Court must first resolve whether or not he committed grave misconduct and dishonesty in (a) engaging the services of Aboitiz One, Inc. allegedly without the approval of the Philippine Postal Corporation Board of Directors, and (b) in procuring Aboitiz One, Inc.'s services through negotiated procurement.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>I</b></div><br><br>To determine whether or not respondent acted without authority when he procured Aboitiz One's services in outsourcing mail deliveries in Luzon, it is necessary to determine first the scope of his authority under the law.<br><br>Respondent was designated Officer-in-Charge when the contract between the Philippine Postal Corporation and Aboitiz One was effected, since the Postmaster General had taken a leave of absence.

On the contrary, Republic Act No. 9184, Section 5(j)(ii) defines head of the procuring entity as "the governing board <i> or its </i><i> duly </i><i> authorized official, </i> for government-owned and/or -controlled corporations."

As Acting Chief of the Management Division of the Philippine National Police Directorate for Comptrollership, Espina signed all the Inspection Report Forms without actually inspecting if the goods were delivered or services were rendered, which, in turn, resulted in the illegal disbursement of public funds.<br><br>This Court found that although Espina had the duty to ensure that procurement of goods and services must be done according to law, his failure would not be considered grave misconduct or dishonesty absent any independent evidence that he or some other person benefited from his infraction, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Here, the [Court of Appeals] correctly observed that while Espina may have failed to personally confirm the delivery of the procured items, the same does not constitute dishonesty of any form inasmuch as he did not personally prepare the [Inspection Report Forms] but merely affixed his signature thereon after his subordinates supplied the details therein.<br><br>Neither can Espina's acts be considered misconduct, grave or simple.
