				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We are asked to revisit our Decision in the case involving the death of Leonardo “Lenny” Villa due to fraternity hazing. While there is nothing new in the arguments raised by the parties in their respective Motions for Clarification or Reconsideration, we find a few remaining matters needing to be clarified and resolved.&nbsp; Some of these matters include the effect of our Decision on the finality of the Court of Appeals judgments insofar as respondents Antonio Mariano Almeda (Almeda), Junel Anthony D. Ama (Ama), Renato Bantug, Jr. (Bantug), and Vincent Tecson (Tecson) are concerned; the question of who are eligible to seek probation; and the issue of the validity of the probation proceedings and the concomitant orders of a court that allegedly had no jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>Before the Court are the respective Motions for Reconsideration or Clarification filed by petitioners People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), and Gerarda H. Villa (Villa); and by respondents Almeda, Ama, Bantug, and Tecson (collectively, Tecson et al.) concerning the Decision of this Court dated 1 February 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Court modified the assailed judgments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 15520 and found respondents Fidelito Dizon (Dizon), Almeda, Ama, Bantug, and Tecson guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. The modification had the effect of lowering the criminal liability of Dizon from the crime of homicide, while aggravating the verdict against Tecson et al. from slight physical injuries. The CA Decision itself had modified the Decision of the Caloocan City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 121 finding all of the accused therein guilty of the crime of homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Also, we upheld another CA Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in a separate but related case docketed as CA-G.R. S.P. Nos. 89060 &amp; 90153 and ruled that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the criminal case against Manuel Escalona II (Escalona), Marcus Joel Ramos (Ramos), Crisanto Saruca, Jr. (Saruca), and Anselmo Adriano (Adriano) on the ground that their right to speedy trial was violated. Reproduced below is the dispositive portion of our Decision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Judgment in G.R. No. 155101 finding petitioner Fidelito Dizon guilty of homicide is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE IN PART</b>. The appealed Judgment in G.R. No. 154954 – finding Antonio Mariano Almeda, Junel Anthony Ama, Renato Bantug, Jr., and Vincent Tecson guilty of the crime of slight physical injuries – is also <b>MODIFIED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE IN PART.</b> Instead, Fidelito Dizon, Antonio Mariano Almeda, Junel Anthony Ama, Renato Bantug, Jr., and Vincent Tecson are found <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide defined and penalized under Article 365 in relation to Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. They are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor,</i> as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of<i> prison correccional</i> as maximum. In addition, accused are ORDERED jointly and severally to pay the heirs of Lenny Villa civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> in the amount of P50,000, and moral damages in the amount of P1,000,000, plus legal interest on all damages awarded at the rate of 12% from the date of the finality of this Decision until satisfaction. <i>Costs de oficio.</i><br><br>The appealed Judgment in G.R. No. 154954, acquitting Victorino <i>et al.</i>, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>. The appealed Judgments in G.R. Nos. 178057 &amp; 178080, dismissing the criminal case filed against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano, are likewise <b>AFFIRMED</b>. Finally, pursuant to Article 89(1) of the Revised Penal Code, the Petition in G.R. No. 151258 is hereby dismissed, and the criminal case against Artemio Villareal deemed <b>CLOSED</b> and <b>TERMINATED</b>.<br><br>Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives for possible consideration of the amendment of the Anti-Hazing Law to include the fact of intoxication and the presence of non-resident or alumni fraternity members during hazing as aggravating circumstances that would increase the applicable penalties.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.</blockquote><br>To refresh our memories, we quote the factual antecedents surrounding the present case:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In February 1991, seven freshmen law students of the Ateneo de Manila University School of Law signified their intention to join the Aquila Legis Juris Fraternity (Aquila Fraternity). They were Caesar “Bogs” Asuncion, Samuel “Sam” Belleza, Bienvenido “Bien” Marquez III, Roberto Francis “Bert” Navera, Geronimo “Randy” Recinto, Felix Sy, Jr., and Leonardo “Lenny” Villa (neophytes).<br><br>On the night of 8 February 1991, the neophytes were met by some members of the Aquila Fraternity (Aquilans) at the lobby of the Ateneo Law School. They all proceeded to Rufo’s Restaurant to have dinner. Afterwards, they went to the house of Michael Musngi, also an Aquilan, who briefed the neophytes on what to expect during the initiation rites. The latter were informed that there would be physical beatings, and that they could quit at any time. Their initiation rites were scheduled to last for three days. After their “briefing,” they were brought to the Almeda Compound in Caloocan City for the commencement of their initiation.<br><br>Even before the neophytes got off the van, they had already received threats and insults from the Aquilans. As soon as the neophytes alighted from the van and walked towards the pelota court of the Almeda compound, some of the Aquilans delivered physical blows to them. The neophytes were then subjected to traditional forms of Aquilan “initiation rites.” These rites included the “Indian Run,” which required the neophytes to run a gauntlet of two parallel rows of Aquilans, each row delivering blows to the neophytes; the “Bicol Express,” which obliged the neophytes to sit on the floor with their backs against the wall and their legs outstretched while the Aquilans walked, jumped, or ran over their legs; the “Rounds,” in which the neophytes were held at the back of their pants by the “auxiliaries” (the Aquilans charged with the duty of lending assistance to neophytes during initiation rites), while the latter were being hit with fist blows on their arms or with knee blows on their thighs by two Aquilans; and the “Auxies’ Privilege Round,” in which the auxiliaries were given the opportunity to inflict physical pain on the neophytes. During this time, the neophytes were also indoctrinated with the fraternity principles. They survived their first day of initiation.<br><br>On the morning of their second day – 9 February 1991 – the neophytes were made to present comic plays and to play rough basketball. They were also required to memorize and recite the Aquila Fraternity’s principles. Whenever they would give a wrong answer, they would be hit on their arms or legs. Late in the afternoon, the Aquilans revived the initiation rites proper and proceeded to torment them physically and psychologically. The neophytes were subjected to the same manner of hazing that they endured on the first day of initiation. After a few hours, the initiation for the day officially ended.<br><br>After a while, accused non-resident or alumni fraternity members Fidelito Dizon (Dizon) and Artemio Villareal (Villareal) demanded that the rites be reopened. The head of initiation rites, Nelson Victorino (Victorino), initially refused. Upon the insistence of Dizon and Villareal, however, he reopened the initiation rites. The fraternity members, including Dizon and Villareal, then subjected the neophytes to “paddling” and to additional rounds of physical pain. Lenny received several paddle blows, one of which was so strong it sent him sprawling to the ground. The neophytes heard him complaining of intense pain and difficulty in breathing.&nbsp; After their last session of physical beatings, Lenny could no longer walk. He had to be carried by the auxiliaries to the carport. Again, the initiation for the day was officially ended, and the neophytes started eating dinner. They then slept at the carport.<br><br>After an hour of sleep, the neophytes were suddenly roused by Lenny’s shivering and incoherent mumblings. Initially, Villareal and Dizon dismissed these rumblings, as they thought he was just overacting. When they realized, though, that Lenny was really feeling cold, some of the Aquilans started helping him. They removed his clothes and helped him through a sleeping bag to keep him warm. When his condition worsened, the Aquilans rushed him to the hospital. Lenny was pronounced dead on arrival.<br><br>Consequently, a criminal case for homicide was filed against the following 35 Aquilans:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. C-38340(91)<br><ol><li>Fidelito Dizon (Dizon)</li><li>Artemio Villareal (Villareal)</li><li>Efren de Leon (De Leon)</li><li>Vincent Tecson (Tecson)</li><li>Junel Anthony Ama (Ama)</li><li>Antonio Mariano Almeda (Almeda)</li><li>Renato Bantug, Jr. (Bantug)</li><li>Nelson Victorino (Victorino)</li><li>Eulogio Sabban (Sabban)</li><li>Joseph Lledo (Lledo)</li><li>Etienne Guerrero (Guerrero)</li><li>Michael Musngi (Musngi)</li><li>Jonas Karl Perez (Perez)</li><li>Paul Angelo Santos (Santos)</li><li>Ronan de Guzman (De Guzman)</li><li>Antonio General (General)</li><li>Jaime Maria Flores II (Flores)</li><li>Dalmacio Lim, Jr. (Lim)</li><li>Ernesto Jose Montecillo (Montecillo)</li><li>Santiago Ranada III (Ranada)</li><li>Zosimo Mendoza (Mendoza)</li><li>Vicente Verdadero (Verdadero)</li><li>Amante Purisima II (Purisima)</li><li>Jude Fernandez (J.

On the other hand, the trial against the remaining nine accused in Criminal Case No. C-38340 was held in abeyance due to certain matters that had to be resolved first.<br><br>On 8 November 1993, the <b>trial court</b> rendered judgment in Criminal Case No. C-38340(91), holding the <b>26 accused guilty</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the <b>crime of homicide</b>, penalized with <i>reclusion temporal</i> under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. A few weeks after the trial court rendered its judgment, or on 29 November 1993, Criminal Case No. C-38340 against the remaining nine accused commenced anew.<br><br>On 10 January 2002, the CA in (CA-G.R. No. 15520) <b>set aside the finding of conspiracy by the trial court</b> in Criminal Case No. C-38340(91) and <b>modified the criminal liability</b> of each of the accused <b>according to individual participation</b>.

Having found no mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the CA sentenced them to an indeterminate sentence of 10 years of <i>prision mayor</i> to 17 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i>. They were also ordered to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Lenny Villa in the sum of P50,000 and to pay the additional amount of P1,000,000 by way of moral damages.<br></li></ol><br>On 5 August 2002, the trial court in Criminal Case No. 38340 dismissed the charge against accused Concepcion on the ground of violation of his right to speedy trial. Meanwhile, on different dates between the years 2003 and 2005, the trial court denied the respective Motions to Dismiss of accused Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano. On 25 October 2006, the CA in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 89060 &amp; 90153 reversed the trial court’s Orders and dismissed the criminal case against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano on the basis of violation of their right to speedy trial.<br><br>From the aforementioned Decisions, the five (5) consolidated Petitions were individually brought before this Court. (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><b><i>Motion for Partial Reconsideration <br>filed by Petitioner Gerarda H. Villa</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Villa filed the present Motion for Partial Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> in connection with G.R. Nos. 178057 &amp; 178080 (<i>Villa v. Escalona</i>) asserting that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the criminal case against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano (collectively, Escalona <i>et al</i>.) in its assailed Decision and Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Villa reiterates her previous arguments that the right to speedy trial of the accused was not violated, since they had failed to assert that right within a reasonable period of time. She stresses that, unlike their co-accused Reynaldo Concepcion, respondents Escalona <i>et al</i>. did not timely invoke their right to speedy trial during the time that the original records and pieces of evidence were unavailable. She again emphasizes that the prosecution cannot be faulted entirely for the lapse of 12 years from the arraignment until the initial trial, as there were a number of incidents attributable to the accused themselves that caused the delay of the proceedings. She then insists that we apply the balancing test in determining whether the right to speedy trial of the accused was violated.<br><br><i><b>Motion for Reconsideration filed<br>by the OSG</b></i><br><br>The OSG, in its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of G.R. Nos. 155101 (<i>Dizon v. People</i>) and 154954 (<i>People v. Court of Appeals</i>), agrees with the findings of this Court that accused Dizon and Tecson et al. had neither the felonious intent to kill (<i>animus interficendi</i>) nor the felonious intent to injure (<i>animus iniuriandi</i>) Lenny Villa. In fact, it concedes that the mode in which the accused committed the crime was through fault (<i>culpa</i>). However, it contends that the penalty imposed should have been equivalent to that for deceit (<i>dolo</i>) pursuant to Article 249 (Homicide) of the Revised Penal Code. It argues that the nature and gravity of the imprudence or negligence attributable to the accused was so gross that it shattered the fine distinction between <i>dolo</i> and <i>culpa</i> by considering the act as one committed with malicious intent. It maintains that the accused conducted the initiation rites in such a malevolent and merciless manner that it clearly endangered the lives of the initiates and was thus equivalent to malice aforethought.<br><br>With respect to the 19 other accused, or Victorino <i>et al</i>., the OSG asserts that their acquittal may also be reversed despite the rule on double jeopardy, as the CA also committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its assailed Decision (CA-G.R. No. 15520). The OSG insists that Victorino <i>et al. </i>should have been similarly convicted like their other co-accused Dizon, Almeda, Ama, Bantug, and Tecson, since the former also participated in the hazing of Lenny Villa, and their actions contributed to his death.<br><br><b><i>Motions for Clarification or <br>Reconsideration of Tecson</i> et al.</b><br><br>Respondents Tecson<i> et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> filed their respective motions pertaining to G.R. No. 154954 (<i>People v. Court of Appeals</i>). They essentially seek a clarification as to the effect of our Decision insofar as their criminal liability and service of sentence are concerned. According to respondents, they immediately applied for probation after the CA rendered its Decision (CA-G.R. No. 15520) lowering their criminal liability from the crime of homicide, which carries a non-probationable sentence, to slight physical injuries, which carries a probationable sentence. Tecson <i>et al.</i> contend that, as a result, they have already been discharged from their criminal liability and the cases against them closed and terminated. This outcome was supposedly by virtue of their Applications for Probation on various dates in January 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 968, as amended, otherwise known as the Probation Law. They argue that Branch 130 of Caloocan City Regional Trial Court (RTC) had already granted their respective Applications for Probation on 11 October 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and, upon their completion of the terms and conditions thereof, discharged them from probation and declared the criminal case against them terminated on various dates in April 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>To support their claims, respondents attached<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> certified true copies of their respective Applications for Probation and the RTC Orders granting these applications, discharging them from probation, and declaring the criminal case against them terminated.&nbsp; Thus, they maintain that the Decision in CA-G.R. No. 15520 had already lapsed into finality, insofar as they were concerned, when they waived their right to appeal and applied for probation.<br><br><center><b>ISSUES</b><br></center><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it dismissed the case against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano for violation of their right to speedy trial<br><br></li><li>Whether the penalty imposed on Tecson <i>et al. </i>should have corresponded to that for intentional felonies<br><br></li><li>Whether the completion by Tecson<i> et al.</i> of the terms and conditions of their probation discharged them from their criminal liability, and closed and terminated the cases against them<br></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>DISCUSSION</b><br><br><i><b>Findings on the Motion for Partial Reconsideration<br>of Petitioner Gerarda H. Villa</b></i><br></center><br>As regards the first issue, we take note that the factual circumstances and legal assertions raised by petitioner Villa in her Motion for Partial Reconsideration concerning G.R. Nos. 178057 &amp; 178080 have already been thoroughly considered and passed upon in our deliberations, which led to our Decision dated 1 February 2012. We emphasize that in light of the finding of violation of the right of Escalona <i>et al. </i>to speedy trial, the CA’s dismissal of the criminal case against them amounted to an acquittal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and that any appeal or reconsideration thereof would result in a violation of their right against double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Though we have recognized that the acquittal of the accused may be challenged where there has been a grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>certiorari</i> would lie if it is convincingly established that the CA’s Decision dismissing the case was attended by a whimsical or capricious exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. It must be shown that the assailed judgment constitutes “a patent and gross abuse of discretion amounting to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty imposed by law or to act in contemplation of law; an exercise of power in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility; or a blatant abuse of authority to a point so grave and so severe as to deprive the court of its very power to dispense justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Thus, grave abuse of discretion cannot be attributed to a court simply because it allegedly misappreciated the facts and the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>We have taken a second look at the court records, the CA Decision, and petitioner’s arguments and found no basis to rule that the CA gravely abused its discretion in concluding that the right to speedy trial of the accused was violated. Its findings were sufficiently supported by the records of the case and grounded in law. Thus, we deny the motion of petitioner Villa with finality.<br><br><b><i>Ruling on the Motion for Reconsideration<br>filed by the OSG</i></b><br><br>We likewise deny with finality the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the OSG with respect to G.R. Nos. 155101 (<i>Dizon v. People</i>) and 154954 (<i>People v. Court of Appeals</i>). Many of the arguments raised therein are essentially a mere rehash of the earlier grounds alleged in its original Petition for <i>Certiorari.</i><br><br>Furthermore, we cannot subscribe to the OSG’s theory that even if the act complained of was born of imprudence or negligence, malicious intent can still be appreciated on account of the gravity of the actions of the accused. We emphasize that the finding of a felony committed by means of <i>culpa</i> is legally inconsistent with that committed by means of <i>dolo</i>. Culpable felonies involve those wrongs done as a result of an act performed without malice or criminal design. The Revised Penal Code expresses thusly:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 365. <i>Imprudence and Negligence.</i> — <b>Any person who, by reckless imprudence, shall commit any act which, had it been intentional, would constitute a grave felony</b>, shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>prisión correccional </i>in its medium period; if it would have constituted a less grave felony, the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods shall be imposed.<br><br>Any person who, by simple imprudence or negligence, shall commit an act which would otherwise constitute a grave felony, shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium and maximum periods; if it would have constituted a less serious felony, the penalty of <i>arresto mayor </i>in its minimum period shall be imposed.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Reckless imprudence consists in voluntary, but without malice, doing or falling to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution</b> on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.<br><br>Simple imprudence consists in the lack of precaution displayed in those cases in which the damage impending to be caused is not immediate nor the danger clearly manifest. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>On the other hand, intentional felonies concern those wrongs in which a deliberate malicious intent to do an unlawful act is present. Below is our exhaustive discussion on the matter:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Our Revised Penal Code belongs to the classical school of thought. x x x The identity of <i>mens rea</i> – defined as a guilty mind, a guilty or wrongful purpose or criminal intent – is the predominant consideration. <b>Thus, it is not enough to do what the law prohibits. In order for an intentional felony to exist, it is necessary that the act be committed by means of <i>dolo</i> or “malice.”</b><br><br>The term “<i>dolo</i>” or “malice” is a complex idea involving the elements of <i>freedom, intelligence</i>, and <i>intent.</i> x x x x The element of<i> intent</i> – on which this Court shall focus – is described as the <b>state of mind accompanying an act,</b> especially a forbidden act. It refers to the <b>purpose of the mind and the resolve with which a person proceeds.</b> It does not refer to mere <i>will</i>, for the latter pertains to the act, while <i>intent</i> concerns the result of the act. While motive is the “moving power” that impels one to action for a definite result, <b>intent is the “purpose” of using a particular means to produce the result.</b> On the other hand, the term <b>“felonious”</b> means, <i>inter alia,</i> <b>malicious, villainous, and/or proceeding from an evil heart or purpose.</b> With these elements taken together, <b>the requirement of intent in intentional felony must refer to malicious intent, which is a vicious and malevolent state of mind accompanying a forbidden act</b>. Stated otherwise, intentional felony requires the existence of <i>dolus malus</i> – that the act or omission be done “willfully,” “maliciously,” “with deliberate evil intent,” and “with malice aforethought.” The maxim is<i> actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea</i> – a crime is not committed if the mind of the person performing the act complained of is innocent. As is required of the other elements of a felony, the <b>existence of malicious intent must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The presence of an<i> initial </i>malicious intent to commit a felony is thus a vital ingredient in establishing the commission of the intentional felony of homicide.</b> Being <i>mala in se</i>, the felony of homicide requires the <b>existence of malice or <i>dolo</i> immediately before or simultaneously with the infliction of injuries. Intent to kill – or<i> animus interficendi </i>– cannot and should not be inferred, unless there is proof beyond reasonable doubt of such intent.</b> Furthermore, the victim’s death must not have been the product of accident, natural cause, or suicide.<b> If death resulted from an act executed without malice or criminal intent – but with lack of foresight, carelessness, or negligence – the act must be qualified as reckless or simple negligence or imprudence resulting in homicide.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>In order to be found guilty of any of the felonious acts under Articles 262 to 266 of the Revised Penal Code, <b>the employment of physical injuries must be coupled with <i>dolus malus</i>.</b> As an act that is <i>mala in se, </i>the existence of malicious intent is fundamental, since injury arises from the mental state of the wrongdoer – <i>iniuria ex affectu facientis consistat.</i> If there is no criminal intent, the accused cannot be found guilty of an intentional felony. Thus, in case of physical injuries under the Revised Penal Code, <b>there must be a specific <i>animus iniuriandi </i>or malicious intention to do wrong against the physical integrity or well-being of a person, so as to incapacitate and deprive the victim of certain bodily functions. Without proof beyond reasonable doubt of the required <i>animus iniuriandi</i>, the overt act of inflicting physical injuries per se merely satisfies the elements of freedom and intelligence in an intentional felony.</b> The commission of the act does not, in itself, make a man guilty unless his intentions are.<br><br>Thus, we have ruled in a number of instances that the <b>mere infliction of physical injuries, absent malicious intent, does not make a person automatically liable for an intentional felony</b>. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The absence of malicious intent does not automatically mean, however, that the accused fraternity members are ultimately devoid of criminal liability. The Revised Penal Code also punishes felonies that are committed by means of fault (<i>culpa</i>). According to Article 3 thereof, there is fault when the wrongful act results from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.<br><br><b><i>Reckless imprudence or negligence</i></b> consists of a <b>voluntary act done without malice,</b> from which an immediate personal harm, injury or material damage results by reason of an inexcusable lack of precaution or advertence on the part of the person committing it. <b>In this case, the danger is visible and consciously appreciated by the actor</b>. In contrast, <i>simple imprudence or negligence</i> comprises an act done without grave fault, from which an injury or material damage ensues by reason of a mere lack of foresight or skill. Here, the threatened harm is not immediate, and the danger is not openly visible.<br><br>The test for determining whether or not a person is negligent in doing an act is as follows: <b>Would a prudent man in the position of the person to whom negligence is attributed foresee harm to the person injured as a reasonable consequence of the course about to be pursued? If so, the law imposes on the doer the duty to take precaution against the mischievous results of the act. Failure to do so constitutes negligence.</b><br><br>As we held in <i>Gaid v. People</i>, for a person to avoid being charged with recklessness, the degree of precaution and diligence required varies with the degree of the danger involved. If, on account of a certain line of conduct, the danger of causing harm to another person is great, the individual who chooses to follow that particular course of conduct is bound to be very careful, in order to prevent or avoid damage or injury. In contrast, if the danger is minor, not much care is required. It is thus possible that there are countless degrees of precaution or diligence that may be required of an individual, “from a transitory glance of care to the most vigilant effort.” The duty of the person to employ more or less degree of care will depend upon the circumstances of each particular case. (Emphases supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>We thus reiterate that the law requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of malicious intent or <i>dolus malus</i> before an accused can be adjudged liable for committing an intentional felony.<br><br>Since the accused were found to have committed a felony by means of <i>culpa,</i> we cannot agree with the argument of the OSG. It contends that the imposable penalty for intentional felony can also be applied to the present case on the ground that the nature of the imprudence or negligence of the accused was so gross that the felony already amounted to malice. The Revised Penal Code has carefully delineated the imposable penalties as regards felonies committed by means of <i>culpa</i> on the one hand and felonies committed by means of <i>dolo</i> on the other in the context of the distinctions it has drawn between them. The penalties provided in Article 365 (Imprudence and Negligence) are mandatorily applied if the death of a person occurs as a result of the imprudence or negligence of another. Alternatively, the penalties outlined in Articles 246 to 261 (Destruction of Life) are automatically invoked if the death was a result of the commission of a forbidden act accompanied by a malicious intent. These imposable penalties are statutory, mandatory, and not subject to the discretion of the court. We have already resolved – and the OSG agrees – that the accused Dizon and Tecson <i>et al.</i> had neither <i>animus interficendi</i> nor <i>animus iniuriandi</i> in inflicting physical pain on Lenny Villa. Hence, we rule that the imposable penalty is what is applicable to the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide as defined and penalized under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><b><i>Ruling on the Motions for Clarification or <br>Reconsideration filed by Tecson et al.</i></b><br><br>We clarify, however, the effect of our Decision in light of the motions of respondents Tecson <i>et al. </i>vis-à-vis G.R.

Except where the death penalty is imposed, <b>a judgment becomes final</b> after the lapse of the period for perfecting an appeal, or when the sentence has been partially or totally satisfied or served, or <b>when the accused</b> has waived in writing his right to appeal, or <b>has applied for probation</b>. (7a) (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Coupled with Section 7 of Rule 117<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and Section 1 of Rule 122,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> it can be culled from the foregoing provisions that only the accused may appeal the criminal aspect of a criminal case, especially if the relief being sought is the correction or review of the judgment therein. This rule was instituted in order to give life to the constitutional edict<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> against putting a person twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. It is beyond contention that the accused would be exposed to double jeopardy if the state appeals the criminal judgment in order to reverse an acquittal or even to increase criminal liability. Thus, the accused’s waiver of the right to appeal – as when applying for probation – makes the criminal judgment immediately final and executory. Our explanation in <i>People v. Nazareno</i> is worth reiterating:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>Further prosecution <i>via</i> an appeal</b> from a judgment of acquittal is likewise barred because the <b>government has already been afforded a complete opportunity to prove the criminal defendant’s culpability</b>; after failing to persuade the court to enter a final judgment of conviction, the underlying reasons supporting the constitutional ban on multiple trials applies and becomes compelling. The reason is <b>not only the defendant’s already established innocence at the first trial where he had been placed in peril of conviction, but also the same untoward and prejudicial consequences of a second trial initiated by a government who has at its disposal all the powers and resources of the State. Unfairness and prejudice would necessarily result, as the government would then be allowed another opportunity to persuade a second trier of the defendant’s guilt while strengthening any weaknesses that had attended the first trial,</b> all in a process where the government’s power and resources are once again employed against the defendant’s individual means. That the second opportunity comes via an appeal does not make the effects any less prejudicial by the standards of reason, justice and conscience. (Emphases supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>It must be clarified, however, that the finality of judgment evinced in Section 7 of Rule 120 does not confer blanket invincibility on criminal judgments. We have already explained in our Decision that the rule on double jeopardy is not absolute, and that this rule is inapplicable to cases in which the state assails the very jurisdiction of the court that issued the criminal judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The reasoning behind the exception is articulated in <i>Nazareno</i>, from which we quote:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In such instance, however, <b>no review of facts and law on the merits, in the manner done in an appeal, actually takes place; the focus of the review is on whether the judgment is <i>per se</i> void on jurisdictional grounds</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the verdict was rendered by a court that had no jurisdiction;<b> or where the court has appropriate jurisdiction, whether it acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. In other words, the review is on the question of whether there has been a validly rendered decision, not on the question of the decision’s error or correctness.</b> Under the exceptional nature of a Rule 65 petition, the burden — a very heavy one — is on the shoulders of the party asking for the review to show the presence of a whimsical or capricious exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction; or of a patent and gross abuse of discretion amounting to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty imposed by law or to act in contemplation of law; or to an exercise of power in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility. (Emphases supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>While this Court’s Decision in <i>Tan</i> may have created an impression of the unassailability of a criminal judgment as soon as the accused applies for probation, we point out that what the state filed therein was a mere motion for the modification of the penalty, and not a Rule 65 petition. A petition for <i>certiorari</i> is a special civil action that is distinct and separate from the main case. While in the main case, the core issue is whether the accused is innocent or guilty of the crime charged, the crux of a Rule 65 petition is whether the court acted (a) without or in excess of its jurisdiction; or (b) with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Hence, strictly speaking, there is no modification of judgment in a petition for <i>certiorari,</i> whose resolution does not call for a re-evaluation of the merits of the case in order to determine the ultimate criminal responsibility of the accused. In a Rule 65 petition, any resulting annulment of a criminal judgment is but a consequence of the finding of lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>In view thereof, we find that the proper interpretation of Section 7 of Rule 120 must be that it is inapplicable and irrelevant where the court’s jurisdiction is being assailed through a Rule 65 petition. Section 7 of Rule 120 bars the modification of a criminal judgment only if the appeal brought before the court is in the nature of a regular appeal under Rule 41, or an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45, and if that appeal would put the accused in double jeopardy. As it is, we find no irregularity in the partial annulment of the CA Decision in CA-G.R. No. 15520 in spite of its finality, as the judgment therein was issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><b><i>The orders of Caloocan City RTC<br>Branch 130 have no legal effect, as <br>they were issued without jurisdiction.</i></b><br><br><b>First, Tecson <i>et al.</i> filed their Applications for Probation with the wrong court</b>.

In that case, the trial court sentenced the accused to a maximum term of eight years of <i>prisión mayor,</i> which was beyond the coverage of the Probation Law. They only became eligible for probation after the CA reduced the maximum term of the penalty imposed to 1 year, 8 months and 21 days of <i>prisión correccional.</i><br><br>In deciding the case, this Court invoked the reasoning in Francisco and ruled that the accused was ineligible for probation, since they had filed an appeal with the CA. In <i>Francisco,</i> we emphasized that Section 4 of the Probation Law offers no ambiguity and does not provide for any distinction, qualification, or exception. What is clear is that all offenders who previously appealed their cases, regardless of their reason for appealing, are disqualified by the law from seeking probation. Accordingly, this Court enunciated in <i>Lagrosa</i> that the accused are disallowed from availing themselves of the benefits of probation if they obtain a genuine opportunity to apply for probation only on appeal as a result of the downgrading of their sentence from non-probationable to probationable.<br><br>While <i>Lagrosa</i> was promulgated three months after Caloocan City RTC Branch 130 issued its various Orders discharging Tecson <i>et al</i>. from probation, the ruling in <i>Lagrosa,</i> however, was a mere reiteration of the reasoning of this Court since the 1989 case <i>Llamado v.

The idea may not even have crossed his mind precisely since the penalty he got was not probationable.<br><br><b>The question in this case is ultimately one of fairness. Is it fair to deny Arnel the right to apply for probation when the new penalty that the Court imposes on him is, unlike the one erroneously imposed by the trial court, subject to probation?</b> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In our Decision, we set aside the RTC and the CA judgments and found Tecson <i>et al</i>. ultimately liable for the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. Pursuant to Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, the offense is punishable by <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period (from 4 months and 1 day to 6 months) to <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period (from 2 years, 4 months, and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months). Considering that the new ruling in <i>Colinares</i> is more favorable to Tecson <i>et al.</i>, we rule that they are now eligible to apply for probation. Since Fidelito Dizon (Dizon) was convicted of the same crime, we hereby clarify that Dizon is also eligible for probation.<br><br>While we cannot recognize the validity of the Orders of RTC Branch 130, which granted the Applications for Probation, we cannot disregard the fact that Tecson <i>et al</i>. have fulfilled the terms and conditions of their previous probation program and have eventually been discharged therefrom. Thus, should they reapply for probation, the trial court may, at its discretion, consider their antecedent probation service in resolving whether to place them under probation at this time and in determining the terms, conditions, and period thereof.<br><br><b><i>Final clarificatory matters</i></b><br><br>We now take this opportunity to correct an unintentional typographical error in the minimum term of the penalty imposed on the accused Dizon and Tecson <i>et al.</i> While this issue was not raised by any of the parties before us, this Court deems it proper to discuss the matter <i>ex proprio motu</i> in the interest of justice. In the first paragraph of the dispositive portion of our Decision dated 1 February 2012, the fourth sentence reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>They are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prisión correccional,</i> as maximum.</blockquote><br>As we had intended to impose on the accused the maximum term of the “penalty next lower” than that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, in accordance with the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the phrase “and one (1) day,” which had been inadvertently added, must be removed. Consequently, in the first paragraph of the dispositive portion, the fourth sentence should now read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>They are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) months of <i>arresto mayor,</i> as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prisión correccional</i>, as maximum.</blockquote><br>In this instance, we further find it important to clarify the accessory penalties inherent to the principal penalty imposed on Dizon and Tecson <i>et al</i>.<br><br>By operation of Articles 40 to 45 and 73 of the Revised Penal Code, a corresponding accessory penalty automatically attaches every time a court lays down a principal penalty outlined in Articles 25 and 27 thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The applicable accessory penalty is determined by using as reference the <b>principal penalty</b> imposed by the court <b>before the prison sentence is computed in accordance with the ISL</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> This determination is made in spite of the two classes of penalties mentioned in an indeterminate sentence. It must be emphasized that the provisions on the inclusion of accessory penalties specifically allude to the actual “penalty”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> imposed, not to the “prison sentence”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> set by a court. We believe that the ISL did not intend to have the effect of imposing on the convict two distinct sets of accessory penalties for the same offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The two penalties are only relevant insofar as setting the minimum imprisonment period is concerned, after which the convict may apply for parole and eventually seek the shortening of the prison term.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, the <b>prescribed penalty</b> for the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide is arresto mayor in its maximum period to <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period. As this provision grants courts the discretion to lay down a penalty without regard to the presence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the <b>imposable penalty</b> must also be within the aforementioned range.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Hence, before applying the ISL, we ultimately imposed on Dizon and Tecson<i> et al</i>. the <b>actual (straight) penalty</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of four years and two months of <i>prisión correccional.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Pursuant to Article 43 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> automatically carries with it<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the following accessory penalties:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 43. <i>Prisión Correccional — Its accessory penalties.</i> — The penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> shall carry with it that of suspension from public office, from the right to follow a profession or calling, and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage, if the duration of said imprisonment shall exceed eighteen months. The offender shall suffer the disqualification provided in this article although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.</blockquote><br>The duration of their suspension shall be the same as that of their principal penalty <i>sans</i> the ISL; that is, for four years and two months<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> or until they have served their sentence in accordance with law. Their suspension takes effect immediately, once the judgment of conviction becomes final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>We further point out that if the length of their imprisonment exceeds 18 months, they shall furthermore suffer a <b>perpetual</b> special disqualification from the right of suffrage. Under Article 32 of the Revised Penal Code, if this accessory penalty attaches, it shall forever deprive them of the exercise of their right (a) to vote in any popular election for any public office; (b) to be elected to that office; and (c) to hold any public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Any public office that they may be holding becomes vacant upon finality of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The aforementioned accessory penalties can only be wiped out if expressly remitted in a pardon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Of course, the aforementioned accessory penalties are without prejudice to a grant of probation, should the trial court find them eligible therefor. As we explained in <i>Baclayon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> the grant of probation suspends the execution of the principal penalty of imprisonment, as well as that of the accessory penalties. We have reiterated this point in <i>Moreno v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In <i>Baclayon v. Mutia</i>, the Court declared that an order placing defendant on probation is not a sentence but is rather, in effect, a suspension of the imposition of sentence. We held that <b>the grant of probation to petitioner suspended the imposition of the principal penalty of imprisonment, as well as the accessory penalties of suspension from public office and from the right to follow a profession or calling, </b>and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage. We thus deleted from the order granting probation the paragraph which required that petitioner refrain from continuing with her teaching profession.<br><br><b>Applying this doctrine to the instant case, the accessory penalties of suspension from public office, from the right to follow a profession or calling</b>, and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage, attendant to the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to<i> prisión correccional</i> in its minimum period<b> imposed upon Moreno were similarly suspended upon the grant of probation.</b><br><br>It appears then that <b>during the period of probation, the probationer is not even disqualified from running for a public office because the accessory penalty of suspension from public office is put on hold for the duration of the probation</b>. x x x x. During the period of probation, the probationer does not serve the penalty imposed upon him by the court but is <b>merely required to comply with all the conditions prescribed in the probation order</b>.</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of petitioner Gerarda H. Villa in connection with G.R. Nos. 178057 &amp; 178080 is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. The Motion for Reconsideration filed by the Office of the Solicitor General concerning G.R.
