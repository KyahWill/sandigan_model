The Court’s June 22, 2010 Resolution</i></b><br><br>These incidents stemmed from our June 22, 2010 Resolution referring the present case to the Commission on Human Rights (<i>CHR</i>) as the Court’s directly commissioned agency, tasked with the continuation of the investigation of Jonas Joseph T. Burgos’ abduction with the obligation to report its factual findings and recommendations to this Court. This referral was necessary as the investigation by the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (<i>PNP-CIDG</i>), by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (<i>AFP</i>) Provost Marshal, and even the initial CHR investigation had been less than complete. In all of them, there were significant lapses in the handling of the investigation. In particular, we <b>highlighted the PNP-CIDG’s failure to identify the cartographic sketches of two (one male and one female) of the five abductors of Jonas, based on their interview with the eyewitnesses to the abduction</b>.<br><br>In this same Resolution, we also affirmed the CA’s dismissal of the petitions for Contempt and issuance of a Writ of <i>Amparo</i> with respect to President Macapagal-Arroyo who was then entitled, as President, to immunity from suit.<br><br><b><i>The March 15, 2011 CHR Report </i></b><br><br>On March 15, 2011, the CHR submitted to the Court its <i>Investigation Report on the Enforced Disappearance of Jonas Burgos</i> (<i>CHR Report</i>), in compliance with our June 22, 2010 Resolution. On the basis of the gathered evidence, the CHR submitted the following findings:<br><blockquote>Based on the facts developed by evidence obtaining in this case, <b>the CHR finds that the enforced disappearance of Jonas Joseph T. Burgos had transpired; and that his constitutional rights to life liberty and security were violated by the Government have been fully determined</b>.<br><br><b>Jeffrey Cabintoy and Elsa Agasang have witnessed on that fateful day of April 28, 2007 the forcible abduction of Jonas Burgos by a group of about seven (7) men and a woman</b> from the extension portion of Hapag Kainan Restaurant, located at the ground floor of Ever Gotesco Mall, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The eyewitnesses mentioned above were <b>Jeffrey Cabintoy</b> (<b>Jeffrey</b>) and Elsa Agasang (Elsa), who at the time of the abduction were working as <b>busboy</b> and Trainee-Supervisor, respectively, at Hapag Kainan Restaurant.<br><br><b>In his Sinumpaang Salaysay, Jeffrey had a clear recollection of the face of HARRY AGAGEN BALIAGA, JR. as one of the principal abductors</b>, apart from the faces of the two abductors in the cartographic sketches that he described to the police, after he was shown by the <i>Team</i> the pictures in the PMA Year Book of Batch Sanghaya 2000 and group pictures of men taken some years thereafter.<br><br><b>The same group of pictures were shown to detained former 56<sup>th</sup> IB Army trooper Edmond M. Dag-uman (Dag-uman), who also positively identified Lt. Harry Baliaga, Jr. Daguman’s <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> states that he came to know Lt. Baliaga as a Company Commander in the 56<sup>th</sup> IB while he was still in the military service (with Serial No. 800693, from 1997 to 2002) also with the 56<sup>th</sup> IB but under 1Lt. Usmalik Tayaban, the Commander of Bravo Company.</b> When he was arrested and brought to the 56<sup>th</sup> IB Camp in April 2005, he did not see Lt. Baliaga anymore at the said camp. The similar reaction that the pictures elicited from both Jeffrey and Daguman did not pass unnoticed by the <i>Team</i>. Both men always look pensive, probably because of the pathetic plight they are in right now. It came as a surprise therefore to the <i>Team</i> when they could hardly hide their smile upon seeing the face of Baliaga, as if they know the man very well.<br><br>Moreover, when the <i>Team</i> asked how certain Jeffrey was or [sic] that it was indeed Baliaga that he saw as among those who actually participated in Jonas’ abduction. Jeffrey was able to give a graphic description and spontaneously, to boot, the blow by blow account of the incident, including the initial positioning of the actors, specially Baliaga, who even approached, talked to, and prevented him from interfering in their criminal act.<br><br>A Rebel-returnee (RR) named Maria Vita Lozada y Villegas @KA MY, has identified the face of the female in the cartographic sketch as a certain Lt. Fernando. While Lozada refuses to include her identification of Lt. Fernando in her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> for fear of a backlash, she told the Team that she was certain it was Lt. Fernando in the cartographic sketch since both of them were involved in counter-insurgency operations at the 56<sup>th</sup> IB, while she was under the care of the battalion from March 2006 until she left the 56<sup>th</sup> IB Headquarters in October 2007. Lozada’s involvement in counter-insurgency operations together with Lt. Fernando was among the facts gathered by the CHR Regional Office 3 Investigators, whose investigation into the enforced disappearance of Jonas Joseph Burgos was documented by way of an After Mission Report dated August 13, 2008.<br><br><b>Most if not all the actual abductors would have been identified had it not been for what is otherwise called as <i>evidentiary difficulties</i> shamelessly put up by some police and military elites. <u>The deliberate refusal of TJAG Roa to provide the CHR with the requested documents does not only defy the Supreme Court directive to the AFP but <i>ipso facto</i> created a disputable presumption that AFP personnel were responsible for the abduction and that their superiors would be found accountable, if not responsible, for the crime committed.</u></b> This observation finds support in the disputable presumption “<i>That evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced</i>.” (Paragraph (e), Section 3, Rule 131 on Burden of Proof and Presumptions, Revised Rules on Evidence of the Rules of Court of the Philippines).<br><br><b>In saying that the requested document is irrelevant, the <i>Team</i> has deemed that the requested documents and profiles would help ascertain the true identities of the cartographic sketches of two abductors because a certain Virgilio Eustaquio has claimed that one of the intelligence operatives involved in the 2007 ERAP 5 case fits the description of his abductor.<br><br><u>As regards the PNP CIDG, the positive identification of former 56<sup>th</sup> IB officer Lt. HARRY A. BALIAGA, JR. as one of the principal abductors has effectively crushed the theory of the CIDG witnesses that the NPAs abducted Jonas.</u> Baliaga’s true identity and affiliation with the military have been established by overwhelming evidence corroborated by detained former Army trooper Dag-uman.</b><br><br>For lack of material time, the Commission will continue to investigate the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos as an independent body and pursuant to its mandate under the 1987 Constitution. Of particular importance are the identities and locations of the persons appearing in the cartographic sketches; the allegations that CIDG Witnesses Emerito G. Lipio and Meliza Concepcion-Reyes are AFP enlisted personnel and the alleged participation of Delfin De Guzman @ Ka Baste in the abduction of Jonas Burgos whose case for Murder and Attempted Murder was dismissed by the court for failure of the lone witness, an army man of the 56<sup>th</sup> IB to testify against him.<br><br>Interview with Virgilio Eustaquio, Chairman of the Union Masses for Democracy and Justice (UMDJ), <b>revealed that the male abductor of Jonas Burgos appearing in the cartographic sketch was among the raiders who abducted him and four others, identified as Jim Cabauatan, Jose Curament, Ruben Dionisio and Dennis Ibona otherwise known as ERAP FIVE</b>.<br><br>Unfortunately, and as already pointed out above, The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) turned down the request of the Team for a profile of the operatives in the so-called “<i>Erap 5</i>” abduction on the ground of relevancy and branded the request as a fishing expedition per its Disposition Form dated September 21, 2010.<br><br>Efforts to contact Virgilio Eustaquio to secure his affidavit proved futile, as his present whereabouts cannot be determined. And due to lack of material time, the Commission decided to pursue the same and determine the whereabouts of the other members of the “<i>Erap 5</i>” on its own time and authority as an independent body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>B. The Court’s July 5, 2011 Resolution</i></b><br><br>On July 5, 2011, in light of the new evidence and leads the CHR uncovered, we issued a Resolution: (1) issuing anew a Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> and referring the <i>habeas corpus</i> petition to the CA; (2) <b>holding in abeyance our ruling on the merits of the <i>Amparo</i> aspect of the case; referring back the same to the CA in order to allow Lt.

Baliaga to be impleaded as a party to the <i>Amparo</i> petition</b>; and (3) affirming the dismissal of the petitioner’s petition for Contempt, without prejudice to the re-filing of the contempt charge as may be warranted by the results of the subsequent CHR investigation.

Considering that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance, the present case is beyond the ambit of a petition for <i>habeas corpus</i>.<b><b><b><b><br><br><b><i>Petition for the Writ of Amparo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></b><br><br></b></b></b></b>Based on its finding that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance, the CA concluded that the present case falls within the ambit of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>. The CA found that the totality of the evidence supports the petitioner’s allegation that the military was involved in the enforced disappearance of Jonas. The CA took note of Jeffrey Cabintoy’s positive identification of Lt. Baliaga as one of the abductors who approached him and told him not to interfere because the man being arrested had been under surveillance for drugs; he also remembered the face of Lt. Baliaga – the face he identified in the pictures because he resembles his friend Raven. The CA also held that Lt. Baliaga’s alibi and corroborative evidence cannot prevail over Cabintoy’s positive identification, considering especially the absence of any indication that he was impelled by hatred or any improper motive to testify against Lt. Baliaga. Thus, the CA held that Lt. Baliaga was responsible and the AFP and the PNP were accountable for the enforced disappearance of Jonas.<b><b><b><b><br><br>Based on these considerations, the CA resolved to:<br><br></b></b></b></b><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><b>RECOGNIZING</b> the abduction of Jonas Burgos as an enforced disappearance covered by the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="3%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2)</div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"> With regard to authorship,</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify">a)</div></td><td> <div align="justify"><strong>DECLARING</strong> Maj.

The motion made the following submissions:<b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b><blockquote>5. x x x[T]he Director General, PNP, respectfully takes exception to the Honorable Court’s findings that the PNP, specifically the CIDG, “failed to exercise extraordinary diligence in the conduct of its investigation.” x x x [T]hat this Honorable Court arrived at a conclusion different from that of the CIDG, or accorded different credence to the statements of the witnesses presented by the parties, does not necessarily translate to the CIDG’s failure to exercise extraordinary diligence.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>6. The Chief of Staff, AFP also takes exception to the Honorable Court’s findings that the “Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Commanding General should be held accountable for Jonas Burgos disappearance for failing to exercise extraordinary diligence in conducting an internal investigation on the matter. The unwillingness of the respondent officers of the 56<sup>th</sup> IB to cooperate in the investigation conducted by the CHR is a persuasive proof of the alleged cover up of the military’s involvement in the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos.”<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>The AFP and the Philippine Army conducted a thorough investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations implicating some of its officers and personnel. After the conduct of the same, it is the conclusion of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Army, based on the evidence they obtained, that Jonas Burgos has never been in custody.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>7. The Chief of Staff, AFP, also respectfully takes exception to the finding of the Honorable Court “recognizing the abduction of Jonas Burgos as an enforced disappearance.”<br><br>x x x x<br><br>That the Honorable Court found a member of the Philippine Army or even a group of military men to be responsible for the abduction of Jonas Burgos, does not necessarily make the same a case of “enforced disappearance” involving the State. There is dearth of evidence to show that the government is involved. Respondent Baliaga’s alleged participation in the abduction and his previous membership in the 56<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, by themselves, do not prove the participation or acquiescence of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><i>I.

The CA ruled that as far as the PNP was concerned, its failure to elicit leads and information from Cabintoy who witnessed Jonas’ abduction is eloquent proof of its failure to exercise extraordinary diligence in the conduct of its investigation. As far as the AFP was concerned, the CA held that the fact that Lt. Baliaga of the Philippine Army was positively identified as one of the abductors of Jonas, coupled with the AFP’s lack of serious effort to conduct further investigation, spoke loudly of the AFP leadership’s accountability.<br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><b>To date, the respondents have not appealed to this Court, as provided under Section 19 of the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>.</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br><b><i>J.

For this reason, the Court directly commissioned the CHR to continue the investigation of Jonas’ abduction and the gathering of evidence.<br><br>Based on its March 15, 2011 Report, the CHR uncovered a lead – a claim made by Eustaquio, Chairman of the Union Masses for Democracy and Justice, that the male abductor of Jonas appearing in the cartographic sketch was among the raiders who abducted him and four others, known as the “ERAP FIVE.”<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>This prompted the CHR to request copies of the documents embodied in par. III(i) of the <i>fallo</i> of the Court’s July 5, 2011 Resolution from General Gilberto Jose C. Roa of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, AFP. Gen. Roa initially denied this request but eventually complied with the Court’s directive of July 5, 2011 to submit the documents <i>via</i> the September 23, 2011 Manifestation and Motion and the June 7, 2013 Compliance. In the same July 5, 2011 Resolution, the Court made it plain that these documents shall be released exclusively to the Court for its examination to determine their relevance to the present case and the advisability of their public disclosure.<br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>Pursuant to the Court’s October 11, 2011 Resolution, the CHR submitted its March 20, 2012 Progress Report on its continuing investigation of Jonas’ abduction. Attached to this Progress Report was Virgilio Eustaquio’s sworn affidavit stating that: (1) he was one of the victims of the abduction incident on May 22, 2006, otherwise known as the “ERAP FIVE” incident; (2) as a result of this incident, they filed a case with the Ombudsman against Commodore Leonardo Calderon and other members of the Intelligence Service, AFP (<i>ISAFP</i>) for arbitrary detention, unlawful arrest, maltreatment of prisoners, grave threats, incriminatory machination and robbery; and (3) the male abductor of Jonas appearing in the cartographic sketch shown to him by the CHR was among the raiders who abducted him and his four companions because it resembled the cartographic sketch he described in relation to the ERAP FIVE incident on May 22, 2006.<br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>After reviewing the submissions of both the respondents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and the CHR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> pursuant to the Court’s July 5, 2011, August 23, 2011 and October 11, 2011 Resolutions, we resolve to grant the CHR access to these requested documents to allow them the opportunity to ascertain the true identities of the persons depicted in the cartographic sketches.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>At this point, we emphasize that the sworn affidavit of Eustaquio (that attests to the resemblance of one of Jonas’ abductors to the abductors of the ERAP FIVE) constitutes the sought-after missing link that establishes the relevance of the requested documents to the present case.

The documents shall be examined and compared with the cartographic sketches of the two abductors of Jonas, without copying and without bringing the documents outside the premises of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court. The inspection of the documents shall be within office hours and for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow the CHR to comprehensively investigate the lead provided by Eustaquio.<br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>To fully fulfill the objective of the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, further investigation using the standard of extraordinary diligence should be undertaken by the CHR to pursue the lead provided by Eustaquio. We take judicial notice of the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice (<i>DOJ</i>), through the NBI, on the disappearance of Jonas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In this regard, we direct the NBI to coordinate and provide direct investigative assistance to the CHR as the latter may require, pursuant to the authority granted under the Court’s June 22, 2010 Resolution.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>For this purpose, we require the CHR to submit a supplemental investigation report to the DOJ, copy furnished the petitioner, the NBI, the incumbent Chiefs of the AFP, the PNP and the PNP-CIDG, and all the respondents within sixty days (60) days from receipt of this Resolution.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br><b><i>B. On the Urgent Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela&nbsp; </i></b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>After reviewing the newly discovered evidence submitted by the petitioner and considering all the developments of the case, including the March 18, 2013 CA decision that confirmed the validity of the issuance of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> in the present case, we resolve to deny the petitioner’s Urgent <i>Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela</i>.<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>We note and conclude, based on the developments highlighted above, that the beneficial purpose of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> has been served in the present case. As we held in <i>Razon, Jr. v. Tagitis</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the writ merely embodies the Court’s directives<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b> <b>to police agencies to undertake specified courses of action</b> </b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>to address the enforced disappearance of an individual. The Writ of <i>Amparo</i> serves both a <i>preventive</i> and a <i>curative</i> role. It is <i>curative</i> as it facilitates the subsequent punishment of perpetrators through the investigation and remedial action that it directs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The focus is on procedural curative remedies rather than on the tracking of a specific criminal or the resolution of administrative liabilities. The unique nature of <i>Amparo</i> proceedings has led us to define terms or concepts specific to what the proceedings seek to achieve. In <i>Razon Jr., v. Tagitis</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we defined what the terms “responsibility” and “accountability” signify in an Amparo case. We said:<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b><blockquote><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Responsibility</b> </b></b></b></b></b></b></b>refers to the extent the actors have been established by substantial evidence to have participated in whatever way, by action or omission, in an enforced disappearance, as a measure of the remedies this Court shall craft, among them, the directive to file the appropriate criminal and civil cases against the responsible parties in the proper courts. <b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Accountability</b>, </b></b></b></b></b></b></b>on the other hand, refers to the measure of remedies that should be addressed to those who exhibited involvement in the enforced disappearance without bringing the level of their complicity to the level of responsibility defined above; or who are imputed with knowledge relating to the enforced disappearance and who carry the burden of disclosure; or those who carry, but have failed to discharge, the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>In the present case, while Jonas remains missing, the series of calculated directives issued by the Court outlined above and the extraordinary diligence the CHR demonstrated in its investigations resulted in the criminal prosecution of Lt. Baliaga. We take judicial notice of the fact that the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City, Branch 216, has already found probable cause for arbitrary detention against Lt. Baliaga and has ordered his arrest in connection with Jonas’ disappearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>We also emphasize that the CA in its March 18, 2013 decision<b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b> <b>already ruled with finality</b> </b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>on the entities responsible and accountable (as these terms are defined in <i>Razon, Jr. v. Tagitis</i>) for the enforced disappearance of Jonas. In its March 18, 2013 decision, the CA found, by substantial evidence, that Lt. Baliaga participated in the abduction on the basis of Cabintoy’s positive identification that he was one of the abductors of Jonas who told him not to interfere because the latter had been under surveillance for drugs. In the same Decision, the CA also held the AFP and the PNP accountable for having failed to discharge the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance of Jonas. Thus, the CA issued the following directives to address the enforced disappearance of Jonas:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">DIRECT the PNP through its investigative arm, the PNP-CIDG, to identify and locate the abductors of Jonas Burgos who are still at large and to establish the link between the abductors of Jonas Burgos and those involved in the ERAP 5 incident;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">DIRECT the incumbent Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Director General of the Philippines National Police, and their successors, to ensure the continuance of their investigation and coordination on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos until the persons found responsible are brought before the bar of justice;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">DIRECT the Commission on Human Rights to continue with its own independent investigation on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos with the same degree of diligence required under the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">DIRECT the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to extend full assistance to the Commission on Human Rights in the conduct of the latter’s investigation; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">DIRECT the Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Director General, Philippine National Police and the Chairman, Commission on Human Rights to submit a quarterly report to the Court on the results of their respective investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>We note that the respondents did not appeal the March 18, 2013 CA decision and the May 23, 2013 CA resolution denying their motion for partial reconsideration.<br><br>Based on the above considerations, in particular, the final ruling of the CA that confirmed the validity of the issuance of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> and its determination of the entities responsible for the enforced disappearance of Jonas, we resolve to deny the petitioner’s prayer to issue the writ of <i>Amparo</i> anew and to refer the case to the CA based on the newly discovered evidence. We so conclude as the petitioner’s request for the reissuance of the writ and for the rehearing of the case by the CA would be redundant and superfluous in light of: (1) the ongoing investigation being conducted by the DOJ through the NBI; (2) the CHR investigation directed by the Court in this Resolution; and (3) the continuing investigation directed by the CA in its March 18, 2013 decision.<br><br>We emphasize that while the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> accords the Court a wide latitude in crafting remedies to address an enforced disappearance, it cannot (without violating the nature of the writ of <i>Amparo</i> as a summary remedy that provides rapid judicial relief) grant remedies that would complicate and prolong rather than expedite the investigations already ongoing. Note that the CA has already determined with finality that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance.<br><br>We clarify that by denying the petitioner’s motion, we do not thereby rule on the admissibility or the merits of the newly discovered evidence submitted by the petitioner. We likewise do not foreclose any investigation by the proper investigative and prosecutory agencies of the other entities whose identities and participation in the enforced disappearance of Jonas may be disclosed in future investigations and proceedings. Considering that the present case has already reached the prosecution stage, the petitioner’s motion should have been filed with the proper investigative and prosecutory agencies of the government.<br><br>To expedite proceedings, we refer the petitioner’s motion, this Resolution and its covered cases to the DOJ for investigation, <i>for the purpose of filing the appropriate criminal charges</i> in the proper courts against the proper parties, if warranted, based on the gathered evidence. For this purpose, we direct the petitioner to furnish the DOJ and the NBI copies of her Urgent <i>Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela</i>, together with the sealed attachments to the Motion, within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution.<br><br>As mentioned, we take judicial notice of the ongoing investigation by the DOJ, through the NBI, of the disappearance of Jonas. This DOJ investigation is without prejudice to the Office of the Ombudsman’s exercise of its primary jurisdiction over the investigation of the criminal aspect of this case should the case be determined to be cognizable by the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As we direct below, further investigation for purposes of the present proceedings shall continue to be undertaken by the CHR, in close coordination with the NBI, for the completion of the investigation under the terms of our June 22, 2010 Resolution and the additional directives under the present Resolution.<br><br>As a final note, we emphasize that our ROLE in a writ of <i>Amparo</i> proceeding is merely to determine whether an enforced disappearance has taken place; to determine who is responsible or accountable; and to define and impose the appropriate remedies to address the disappearance.<br><br>As shown above, the beneficial purpose of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> has been served in the present case with the CA’s final determination of the persons responsible and accountable for the enforced disappearance of Jonas and the commencement of criminal action against Lt. Baliaga. At this stage, criminal, investigation and prosecution proceedings are already beyond the reach of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> proceeding now before us.<br><br>Based on the above developments, we now hold that the full extent of the remedies envisioned by the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> has been served and exhausted.Considering the foregoing, the Court<b>RESOLVES</b> to:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><b>DENY</b> petitioner Edita Burgos’ Urgent <i>Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"><b>REFER</b> the petitioner’s Urgent <i>Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela</i>, this Resolution and its covered cases to the Department of Justice for investigation <i>for the purpose of filing the appropriate criminal charges</i> in the proper courts against the proper parties if such action is warranted by the gathered evidence.
