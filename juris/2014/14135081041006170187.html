The RTC found that although petitioners failed to prove their allegation that Solito was not an heir of Telesforo,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> they were nevertheless able to convincingly show that Telesforo filed with the DENR two applications, covering two separate parcels of land, and that it was his first application, TSA No. V-2132, which resulted in the issuance of OCT No. P-2446.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; And since what Solito transferred to respondent spouses was his hereditary share in the parcel of land covered by TSA No. V-6667, respondent spouses acquired no right over the subject property, which was derived from a separate application, TSA No. V-2132.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the RTC disposed of the case in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [petitioners] and against the [respondents] who are hereby ordered to restore the possession of the land in question consisting of an area of 70 square meters, more or less, which is a portion of the land covered by [OCT] No. P-2446.

The CA found the Complaint dismissible on two grounds: (1) failure on the part of petitioners to identify the property sought to be recovered; and (2) lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The CA noted that petitioners failed to pinpoint the property sought to be recovered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, they did not present any survey plan to show that respondent spouses actually encroached on petitioners’ property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the CA was not fully convinced that the two applications pertain to two separate parcels of land since respondent spouses were able to present evidence to refute such allegation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The CA likewise pointed out that the Complaint failed to establish that the RTC had jurisdiction over the case as petitioners failed to allege the assessed value of the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is GRANTED.&nbsp; The decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; The complaint is DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, petitioners filed the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, raising the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE&nbsp; [CA] COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN RULING THAT PETITIONERS FAILED TO PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE [CA] COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN RULING THAT THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ACQUIRE JURISDICTION OVER THE COMPLAINT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br>At this juncture, it must be mentioned that in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> dated March 19, 2007, we required respondent spouses to file their Comment to the Petition which they failed to comply with.&nbsp; Thus, in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> dated March 11, 2013, we dispensed with the filing of respondent spouses’ Comment.&nbsp; At the same time, we required petitioners to manifest whether they are willing to submit the case for resolution based on the pleadings filed.&nbsp; To date, petitioners have not done so.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><b><i>The assessed value must be alleged <br>in the complaint to determine which <br>court has jurisdiction over the action.</i></b><br><br>Jurisdiction as we have said is conferred by law and is determined by the allegations in the complaint, which contains the concise statement of the ultimate facts of a plaintiff's cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Section 19(2) and Section 33(3) of <i>Batas Pambansa Blg.</i> 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, provide:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 19.&nbsp; Jurisdiction in Civil Cases. — Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2)&nbsp; In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 33.&nbsp; Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in Civil Cases. — Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions which involve title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein where the assessed value of the property or interest therein does not exceed Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value does not exceed Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs: Provided, That in cases of land not declared for taxation purposes, the value of such property shall be determined by the assessed value of the adjacent lots.</blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that in an action for recovery of possession, the assessed value of the property sought to be recovered determines the court’s jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In this case, for the RTC to exercise jurisdiction, the assessed value of the subject property must exceed P20,000.00.&nbsp; Since petitioners failed to allege in their Complaint the assessed value of the subject property, the CA correctly dismissed the Complaint as petitioners failed to establish that the RTC had jurisdiction over it.&nbsp; In fact, since the assessed value of the property was not alleged, it cannot be determined which trial court had original and exclusive jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>Furthermore, contrary to the claim of petitioners, the issue of lack of jurisdiction was raised by respondents in their Appellant’s Brief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; And the fact that it was raised for the first time on appeal is of no moment.&nbsp; Under Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Rule 9 of the Revised Rules of Court, defenses not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived, except for lack of jurisdiction, <i>litis pendentia, res judicata, </i>and prescription, which must be apparent from the pleadings or the evidence on record.&nbsp; In other words, the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even for the first time on appeal. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, the court may<i> motu proprio</i> dismiss a complaint at any time when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that lack of jurisdiction exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br><b><i>In an action to recover, the <br>property must be identified.</i></b><br><br>Moreover, Article 434 of the Civil Code states that “[i]n an action to recover, the property must be identified, and the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his title and not on the weakness of the defendant’s claim.”&nbsp; The plaintiff, therefore, is duty-bound to clearly identify the land sought to be recovered, in accordance with the title on which he anchors his right of ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; It bears stressing that the failure of the plaintiff to establish the identity of the property claimed is fatal to his case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners failed to identify the property they seek to recover as they failed to describe the location, the area, as well as the boundaries thereof.&nbsp; In fact, as aptly pointed out by the CA, no survey plan was presented by petitioners to prove that respondent spouses actually encroached upon the 70-square meter portion of petitioners’ property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Failing to prove their allegation, petitioners are not entitled to the relief prayed for in their Complaint.<br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CA in dismissing the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failing to identify the property sought to be recovered.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
