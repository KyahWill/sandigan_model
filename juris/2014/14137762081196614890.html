Both parties filed manifestations that they would merely adopt their briefs before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In his brief, Chavez raised presumption of innocence, considering that the trial court “overlooked and misapplied some facts of substance that could have altered its verdict.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; He argued that since the prosecution relied on purely circumstantial evidence, conviction must rest on a moral certainty of guilt on the part of Chavez.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, even if Peñamante saw him leaving Barbie’s house, Peñamante did not specify whether Chavez was acting suspiciously at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>As regards his mother’s statement, Chavez argued its inadmissibility as evidence since his mother was not presented before the court to give the defense an opportunity for cross-examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; He added that affidavits are generally rejected as hearsay unless the affiant appears before the court and testifies on it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Chavez argued that based on Dr. Salen’s findings, Barbie’s wounds were caused by two sharp bladed instruments, thus, it was possible that there were two assailants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; It was also possible that the assailants committed the crime after Chavez had left Barbie’s house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Given that many possible explanations fit the facts, that which is consistent with the innocence of Chavez should be favored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, plaintiff-appellee argued that direct evidence is not indispensable when the prosecution is establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt of Chavez.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The circumstantial evidence presented before the trial court laid down an unbroken chain of events leading to no other conclusion than Chavez’s acts of killing and robbing Barbie.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On the argument made by Chavez that his mother’s statement was inadmissible as hearsay, plaintiff-appellee explained that the trial court did not rely on, and did not even refer to, any of the statements made by Chavez’s mother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Finally, insofar as Chavez’s submission that Dr. Salen testified on the possibility that there were two assailants, Dr. Salen equally testified on the possibility that there was only one.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The sole issue now before us is whether Chavez is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with homicide.<br><br>We reverse the decisions of the lower courts, but find Chavez guilty of the crime of homicide.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Chavez was found guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide under the Revised Penal Code:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 294. Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons – Penalties. – Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><br>1)&nbsp; The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed. . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>Chavez invokes his constitutional right to be presumed innocent, especially since the prosecution’s evidence is purely circumstantial and a conviction must stand on a moral certainty of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The Rules of Court expressly provides that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the conviction of an accused:<br><br>SEC. 4. <i>Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient. </i>– Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:<br><br><blockquote>(a) There is more than one circumstance;<br>(b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and<br>(c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>The lower courts found that the circumstantial evidence laid down by the prosecution led to no other conclusion than the commission by Chavez of the crime charged:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, while there is no direct evidence showing that the accused robbed and fatally stabbed the victim to death, nonetheless, the Court believes that the following circumstances form a solid and unbroken chain of events that leads to the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that accused Mark Jason Chavez y Bitancor @ Noy committed the crime charged, vi[z]: <u>first</u>, it has been duly established, as the accused himself admits, that he went to the parlor of the victim at around 1:00 o’clock in the morning of 28 October 2006 and the accused was allowed by the victim to get inside his parlor as it serves as his residence too; <u>second</u>, the victim’s two (2) units of cellular phones (one red Nokia with model 3310 and the other one is a black Motorola) without sim cards and batteries, which were declared as part of the missing personal belongings of the victim, were handled to SPO3 Steve Casimiro by the mother of the accused, Anjanette C. Tobias on 05 November 2006 when the accused voluntarily surrendered, accompanied by his mother, at the police station: <u>third</u>, on 28 October 2006 at about 2:45 o’clock in the morning, witness Angelo Peñamante, who arrived from his work, saw a person holding and/or carrying something and about to get out of the door of the house of the victim located at 1325 G. Tuazon Street, Sampaloc, Manila, and trying to close the door but the said person was not able to successfully do so. He later positively identified the said person at the police station as MARK JASON CHAVEZ y BITANCOR @ NOY, the accused herein; and <u>finally,</u> the time when the accused decided on 27 October 2006 to patch up things with the victim and the circumstances (Dr. Salen’s testimony that the body of the victim was dead for more or less twelve (12) hours) when the latter was discovered fatally killed on 28 October 2006 is not a co-incidence.<br><br>The prosecution has equally established, based on the same circumstantial evidence, that the accused had indeed killed the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Factual findings by the trial court on its appreciation of evidence presented by the parties, and even its conclusions derived from the findings, are generally given great respect and conclusive effect by this court, more so when these factual findings are affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, this court has held that “[w]hat is imperative and essential for a conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide is for the prosecution to establish the offender’s<i> intent </i>to take personal property <i>before</i> the killing, regardless of the time when the homicide is actually carried out.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; In cases when the prosecution failed to conclusively prove that homicide was committed for the purpose of robbing the victim, no accused can be convicted of robbery with homicide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The circumstantial evidence relied on by the lower courts, as quoted previously, do not satisfactorily establish an original criminal design by Chavez to commit robbery.<br><br>At most, the intent to take personal property was mentioned by Chavez’s mother in her statement as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Na si Noy na aking anak ay nagtapat sa akin tungkol sa kanyang kinalaman sa pagkamatay ni Barbie at kasabay ang pagbigay sa akin ng dalawang (2) piraso ng cellular phones na pag/aari [sic] ni Barbie na kanyang kinuha pagka/tapos [sic] ng insidente.<br><br>Na ipinagtapat din sa akin ni Noy na ang ginamit na panaksak na isang kutsilyo na gamit namin sa bahay ay inihulog niya sa manhole sa tapat ng aming bahay matapos ang insidente.<br><br>At ang isang piraso ng kwintas na kinuha rin nya mula kay Barbie ay naisanla niya sa isang sanglaan sa Quezon City.<br><br>Na ang suot niyang tsinelas ay nag/iwan [sic] ng bakas sa pinangyarihan ng insidente.

Sanchez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this court found accused-appellant liable for the separate crimes of homicide and theft for failure of the prosecution to conclusively prove that homicide was committed for the purpose of robbing the victim:<br><br><blockquote>But from the record of this case, we find that the prosecution palpably failed to substantiate its allegations of the presence of criminal design to commit robbery, independent of the intent to commit homicide.&nbsp; There is no evidence showing that the death of the victim occurred by reason or on the occasion of the robbery.&nbsp; The prosecution was silent on accused-appellant’s primary criminal intent.&nbsp; Did he intend to kill the victim in order to steal the cash and the necklace? Or did he intend only to kill the victim, the taking of the latter’s personal property being merely an afterthought?&nbsp; Where the homicide is not conclusively shown to have been committed for the purpose of robbing the victim, or where the robbery was not proven at all, there can be no conviction for <i>robo con homicidio.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>II<br></center><br>This court finds that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of Chavez for the separate crime of homicide.<br><br>First, the alibi of Chavez still places him at the scene of the crime that early morning of October 28, 2006.<br><br>The victim, Elmer Duque, went by the nickname, Barbie, and he had a boyfriend named Maki.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Chavez described his friendship with Barbie to be “[w]e’re like brothers.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; He testified during cross-examination that he was a frequent visitor at Barbie’s parlor that he cannot recall how many times he had been there.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; This speaks of a close relationship between Chavez and Barbie.<br><br>Chavez testified that he went to Barbie’s house at 1:00 in the morning of October 28, 2006 to settle his misunderstanding with Barbie who suspected him of having a relationship with Barbie’s boyfriend:<br><br><blockquote>MARK JASON CHAVEZ was a friend to the victim, Barbie, for almost three (3) years and the two (2) treated each other like brothers. The latter, however, suspected Mark Jason of having a relationship with Maki Añover, Barbie’s boyfriend for six (6) months, which resulted in a misunderstanding between them. Mark Jason tried to patch things up with Barbie so thru a text message he sent on the evening of 27 October 2006, he asked if they could talk. When Barbie did not reply, he decided to visit him at his parlor at around 1:00 o’clock in the morning. Barbie let him in and they tried to talk about the situation between them. Their rift, however, was not fixed so he decided to go home.
