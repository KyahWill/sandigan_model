Section 37, paragraph (a), and Section 39, paragraph (a), of Presidential Decree No. 807 provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 37. <i>Disciplinary Jurisdiction. </i>- (a) The Commission shall decide upon appeal all administrative cases involving the imposition of a penalty of suspension for more than thirty days, or fine in an amount exceeding thirty days' salary, demotion in rank or salary or transfer, removal or dismissal from office.<br><br>Sec. 39. <i>Appeals.</i> - (a) Appeals, where allowable, <b>shall be made by the party adversely affected by the decision </b>within fifteen days from receipt of the decision unless a petition shall be decided within fifteen days. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Additionally, Section 47, paragraph (1), and Section 49, paragraph (1), of the Administrative Code provide:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 47. <i>Disciplinary Jurisdiction.</i>—(1) The Commission shall decide upon appeal all administrative disciplinary cases involving the imposition of a penalty of suspension for more than thirty days, or fine in an amount exceeding thirty days’ salary, demotion in rank or salary or transfer, removal or dismissal from office.<br><br>SECTION 49. <i>Appeals</i>.—(1) Appeals, where allowable, <b>shall be made by the party adversely affected by the decision</b> within fifteen days from receipt of the decision unless a petition for reconsideration is seasonably filed, which petition shall be decided within fifteen days….(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The phrase, “person adversely affected,” was not defined in either Presidential Decree No. 807 or the Administrative Code.&nbsp; This prompted a series of cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> providing the interpretation of this phrase.<br><br>The first of these cases, <i>Paredes v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> declared:<br><br><blockquote>Based on [Sections 37 (a) and 39 (a) of Presidential Decree No. 807], <b>appeal to the Civil Service Commission in an administrative case is extended to the party adversely affected by the decision, that is, the person or the respondent employee who has been meted out the penalty of suspension for more than thirty days; or fine in an amount exceeding thirty days salary demotion in rank or salary or transfer, removal or dismissal from office.</b>&nbsp; The decision of the disciplining authority is even final and not appealable to the Civil Service Commission in cases where the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty days salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This ruling was repeated in <i>Mendez v. Civil Service Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> where this court stated that:<br><br><blockquote>A cursory reading of P.D. 807, otherwise known as "The Philippine Civil Service Law" shows that said law does not contemplate a review of decisions exonerating officers or employees from administrative charges.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b>By inference or implication, the remedy of appeal may be availed of only in a case where the respondent is found guilty of the charges filed against him.&nbsp; But when the respondent is exonerated of said charges, as in this case, there is no occasion for appeal.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The same ratio would be reiterated and become the prevailing doctrine on the matter in <i>Magpale, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <i>Navarro v. Civil Service Commission and Export Processing Zone,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <i>University of the Philippines v. Civil Service Commission,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and <i>Del Castillo v. Civil Service Commission</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In these cases, this court explained that the right to appeal being merely a statutory privilege can only be availed of by the party specified in the law.&nbsp; Since the law presumes that appeals will only be made in decisions prescribing a penalty, this court concluded that the only parties that will be adversely affected are the respondents that are charged with administrative offenses.&nbsp; Since the right to appeal is a remedial right that may only be granted by statute, a government party cannot by implication assert that right as incidental to its power, since the right to appeal does not form part of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In effect, this court equated exonerations in administrative cases to acquittals in criminal cases wherein the State or the complainant would have no right to appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; When the Civil Service Commission enacted the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, or the URACCS, on September 27, 1999, it applied this court’s definition.&nbsp; Thus, Section 2, paragraph (l), Rule I, and Section 38, Rule III of the URACCS defined “party adversely affected” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Coverage and Definition of Terms.</i><br><br>. . . .<br><br>(l) PARTY ADVERSELY AFFECTED refers to the respondent against whom a decision in a disciplinary case has been rendered.</blockquote><br>For some time, government parties were, thus, barred from appealing exonerations of civil servants they had previously sanctioned.&nbsp; It was not until the promulgation by this court of <i>Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> on April 29, 1999 that the issue would be revisited.<br><br><b><i>Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy <br>and Philippine National Bank v. Garci</i></b>a<br><br>In <i>Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> an administrative complaint for habitual drunkenness, misconduct, and nepotism was filed against the Vocational School Administrator of Balicuatro College of Arts and Trade in Allen, Northern Samar.&nbsp; The Civil Service Commission found Dacoycoy guilty, but the Court of Appeals overturned this finding and exonerated Dacoycoy of all charges.&nbsp; The Civil Service Commission then appealed the ruling of the appellate court.&nbsp; This court, in addressing the issue of the Commission’s standing, stated that:<br><br><blockquote>Subsequently, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Civil Service Commission and held respondent not guilty of nepotism.&nbsp; Who now may appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court?&nbsp; Certainly not the respondent, who was declared not guilty of the charge.&nbsp; Nor the complainant George P. Suan, who was merely a witness for the government.&nbsp; <b>Consequently, the Civil Service Commission has become the party adversely affected by such ruling, which seriously prejudices the civil service system.&nbsp; Hence, as an aggrieved party, it may appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court</b>.&nbsp; By this ruling, we now expressly abandon and overrule extant jurisprudence that “the phrase ‘party adversely affected by the decision’ refers to the government employee against whom the administrative case is filed for the purpose of disciplinary action which may take the form of suspension, demotion in rank or salary, transfer, removal or dismissal from office” and not included are “cases where the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty (30) days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty days salary” or “when the respondent is exonerated of the charges, there is no occasion for appeal.”&nbsp; <b>In other words, we overrule prior decisions holding that the Civil Service Law “does not contemplate a review of decisions exonerating officers or employees from administrative charges” enunciated in <i>Paredes v. Civil Service Commission; Mendez v. Civil Service Commission; Magpale v. Civil Service Commission; Navarro v. Civil Service Commission and Export Processing Zone Authority</i> and more recently <i>Del Castillo v. Civil Service Commission</i>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In his concurring opinion, then Chief Justice Puno summed up the rationale for allowing government parties to appeal, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In truth, the doctrine barring appeal is not categorically sanctioned by the Civil Service Law.&nbsp; For what the law declares as “final” are decisions of heads of agencies involving suspension for not more than thirty (30) days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty (30) days salary.&nbsp; But there is a clear policy reason for declaring these decisions final.&nbsp; These decisions involve minor offenses.&nbsp; They are numerous for they are the usual offenses committed by government officials and employees.&nbsp; To allow their multiple level appeal will doubtless overburden the quasi-judicial machinery of our administrative system and defeat the expectation of fast and efficient action from these administrative agencies.&nbsp; <b>Nepotism, however, is not a petty offense.&nbsp; Its deleterious effect on government cannot be over-emphasized.&nbsp; And it is a stubborn evil.&nbsp; The objective should be to eliminate nepotic acts, hence, erroneous decisions allowing nepotism cannot be given immunity from review, especially judicial review.</b>&nbsp; It is thus non sequitur to contend that since some decisions exonerating public officials from minor offenses cannot be appealed, ergo, even a decision acquitting a government official from a major offense like nepotism cannot also be appealed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The decision in Dacoycoy would be reiterated in 2002 when this court promulgated <i>Philippine National Bank v. Garcia</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Philippine National Bank</i> categorically allowed the disciplining authority to appeal the decision exonerating the disciplined employee.<br><br>In that case, the bank charged Ricardo V. Garcia, Jr., one of its check processors and cash representatives, with gross neglect of duty when he lost ?7 million in connection with his duties.&nbsp; Both the Civil Service Commission and the Court of Appeals reversed the bank and exonerated Garcia from all liability.<br><br>This court, however, upheld Philippine National Bank’s right to appeal the case.&nbsp; Citing <i>Dacoycoy</i>, this court ruled:<br><br><blockquote><b>Indeed, the battles against corruption, malfeasance and misfeasance will be seriously undermined if we bar appeals of exoneration.&nbsp; After all, administrative cases do not partake of the nature of criminal actions, in which acquittals are final and unappealable based on the constitutional proscription of double jeopardy.<br><br>Furthermore, our new Constitution expressly expanded the range and scope of judicial review.&nbsp; Thus, to prevent appeals of administrative decisions except those initiated by employees will effectively and pervertedly erode this constitutional grant.</b><br><br>Finally, the Court in <i>Dacoycoy</i> ruled that the CSC had acted well within its rights in appealing the CA’s exoneration of the respondent public official therein, because it has been mandated by the Constitution to preserve and safeguard the integrity of our civil service system.&nbsp; In the same light, herein Petitioner PNB has the standing to appeal to the CA the exoneration of Respondent Garcia.&nbsp; After all, it is the aggrieved party which has complained of his acts of dishonesty.&nbsp; Besides, this Court has not lost sight of the fact that PNB was already privatized on May 27, 1996. Should respondent be finally exonerated indeed, it might then be incumbent upon petitioner to take him back into its fold.&nbsp; It should therefore be allowed to appeal a decision that in its view hampers its right to select honest and trustworthy employees, so that it can protect and preserve its name as a premier banking institution in our country.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, the Civil Service Commission issued Resolution No. 021600 published on December 29, 2002, which amended the URACCS, to allow the disciplining authority to appeal the decision exonerating the employee:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Coverage and Definition of Terms.</i> –<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(l) <b>PARTY ADVERSELY AFFECTED</b> refers to the respondent against whom a decision in a disciplinary case has been rendered or to the disciplining authority in an appeal from a decision exonerating the said employee.</blockquote><br>Subsequent decisions continued to reiterate the rulings in <i>Dacoycoy</i> and <i>Philippine National Bank.</i><br><br>In <i>Constantino-David v. Pangandaman-Gania,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> this court explained the rationale of allowing the Civil Service Commission to appeal decisions of exonerations as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That the CSC may appeal from an adverse decision of the Court of Appeals reversing or modifying its resolutions which may seriously prejudice the civil service system is beyond doubt.&nbsp; In <i>Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy</i>[,] this Court held that the CSC may become the party adversely affected by such ruling and the aggrieved party who may appeal the decision to this Court.<br><br>The situation where the CSC’s participation is beneficial and indispensable often involves complaints for administrative offenses, such as neglect of duty, being notoriously undesirable, inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duties, and the like, where the complainant is more often than not acting merely as a witness for the government which is the real party injured by the illicit act.&nbsp; In cases of this nature, a ruling of the Court of Appeals favorable to the respondent employee is understandably adverse to the government, and unavoidably the CSC as representative of the government may appeal the decision to this Court to protect the integrity of the civil service system.<br><br>The CSC may also seek a review of the decisions of the Court of Appeals that are detrimental to its constitutional mandate as the central personnel agency of the government tasked to establish a career service, adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness and courtesy in the civil service, strengthen the merit and rewards system, integrate all human resources development programs for all levels and ranks, and institutionalize a management climate conducive to public accountability.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the right of the CSC to appeal the adverse decision does not preclude the private complainant in appropriate cases from similarly elevating the decision for review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>Then in <i>Civil Service Commission v. Gentallan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this court declared:<br><br><blockquote>At the outset, it should be noted that the Civil Service Commission, under the Constitution, is the central personnel agency of the government charged with the duty of determining questions of qualifications of merit and fitness of those appointed to the civil service.&nbsp; Thus, the CSC, as an institution whose primary concern is the effectiveness of the civil service system, has the standing to appeal a decision which adversely affects the civil service.&nbsp; We hold, at this juncture, that CSC has the standing to appeal and/or to file its motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br>The right to appeal by government parties was not limited to the Civil Service Commission.<br><br>In <i>Pastor v. City of Pasig</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> this court ruled that the City of Pasig had standing to appeal the decision of the Civil Service Commission reinstating a city employee to her former position, despite the city government having reassigned her to another unit.<br><br>In <i>Geronga v. Varela,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this court ruled that the Mayor of Cadiz City had the right to file a motion for reconsideration of a decision by the Civil Service Commission exonerating a city employee on the ground that “as the appointing and disciplining authority, [he] is a real party in interest.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In <i>Department of Education v. Cuanan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> this court ruled that the Department of Education “qualifie[d] as a party adversely affected by the judgment, who can file an appeal of a judgment of exoneration in an administrative case.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>There are, however, cases, which sought to qualify this right to appeal.<br><br>In <i>National Appellate Board v. Mamauag,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> an administrative complaint for grave misconduct was filed by Quezon City Judge Adoracion G. Angeles against several members of the Philippine National Police (PNP).&nbsp; The Central Police District Command (CPDC) of Quezon City, upon investigation, dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; Dissatisfied, Judge Angeles moved for a reinvestigation by then PNP Chief Recaredo Sarmiento II.<br><br>PNP Chief Sarmiento issued a decision finding the accused police officers guilty of the offenses charged.&nbsp; Some were meted the penalty of suspension while others were dismissed from service.&nbsp; Upon motion for reconsideration by Judge Angeles, Chief Sarmiento modified his ruling and ordered the dismissal of the suspended police officers.<br><br>One of the officers, Police Inspector John Mamauag, appealed the decision with the National Appellate Board of the National Police Commission.&nbsp; The National Appellate Board, however, denied the appeal. Mamauag appealed the denial with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the National Appellate Board and ruled that it was the Philippine National Police, not Judge Angeles, which had the right to appeal the decision of PNP Chief Sarmiento, as it was the party adversely affected.&nbsp; The National Appellate Board then appealed this decision with this court.<br><br>This court, while citing <i>Dacoycoy,</i> declared that Judge Angeles, as complainant, had no right to appeal the dismissal by CPDC of the complaint against Mamauag.&nbsp; It qualified the right of government agencies to appeal by specifying the circumstances by which the right may be given, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>However, the government party that can appeal is not the disciplining authority or tribunal which previously heard the case and imposed the penalty of demotion or dismissal from the service.&nbsp; The government party appealing must be one that is prosecuting the administrative case against the respondent.</i></b>&nbsp; Otherwise, an anomalous situation will result where the disciplining authority or tribunal hearing the case, instead of being impartial and detached, becomes an active participant in prosecuting the respondent.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Mathay, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, </i>decided after <i>Dacoycoy,</i> the Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>To be sure, when the resolutions of the Civil Service Commission were brought before the Court of Appeals, the Civil Service Commission was included only as a nominal party.&nbsp; As a quasi-judicial body, the Civil Service Commission can be likened to a judge who should “detach himself from cases where his decision is appealed to a higher court for review.”<br><br>In instituting G.R.
