				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the July 7, 2009 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02929 that affirmed <i>in toto </i>the May 30, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Rosales, Pangasinan, Branch 53, in Criminal Case No. 4938-R, finding appellant Reynaldo Baturi (appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and imposing upon him the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>Factual Antecedents<br><br>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> contained the following accusatory allegations against appellant:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 7<sup>th</sup> day of August, 2005, in the morning, in Brgy. Carmen East, Municipality of Rosales, Province of Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to gain and without being authorized by law to possess and [sell], did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously [sell] ten (10) sachet[s] of heat[-]sealed transparent plastic bags containing white crystalline substance known as “shabu” with a total weight of 49.1 grams, a dangerous drug.<br><br>Contrary to Article II, Section 5, Republic Act 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>During arraignment, appellant entered a plea of “not guilty.” After the pre-trial conference, trial ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>From the testimonies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of PO3 Marlo Velasquez (PO3 Velasquez) and Forensic Chemist P/Insp. Emelda Besarra-Roderos (P/Insp. Roderos), the following facts emerged:<br><br>On August 6, 2005, a confidential informant reported to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) office in Dagupan City the illegal drug activities of appellant, a.k.a. Naldong, in Brgy. Carmen East, Rosales, Pangasinan. PO3 Velasquez received and relayed the information to SP02 Pedro Rabago (SPO2 Rabago), the Special Enforcement Team Leader of the PDEA, who, in turn, ordered the former to conduct a surveillance to verify the information.<br><br>Together with SPO1 Flash Ferrer (SPO1 Ferrer) and the confidential informant, PO3 Velasquez proceeded to Brgy. Carmen East to conduct the surveillance. Upon reaching the area, the confidential informant introduced PO3 Velasquez to appellant as a buyer of <i>shabu</i>. The two closed a deal regarding the sale of 10 “bultos” of <i>shabu</i> for the discounted price of P90,000.00 that would transpire the next day in appellant’s house.<br><br>SPO2 Rabago thus immediately formed a team to conduct an entrapment operation where PO3 Velasquez was to act as poseur-buyer and SPO1 Ferrer as back-up. The buy-bust team then placed on top of a bundle of boodle money a 500-peso bill marked with the initials of PO3 Velasquez and SPO1 Ferrer which were MMV and FF, respectively. It was further agreed that SPO1 Ferrer would give PO3 Velasquez a call in his cellular phone as a pre-arranged signal that the sale of<i> shabu</i> is already consummated.<br><br>The next day, August 7, 2005, the buy-bust team coordinated with the police authorities stationed in the Municipality of Rosales and held a final briefing before proceeding to appellant’s abode. Upon arrival thereat, PO3 Velasquez and the confidential informant approached appellant who was sitting in front of his house while SPO1 Ferrer positioned himself about 15 meters away from them. When PO3 Velasquez informed appellant that he already had the payment, appellant took out a carton, opened it and showed the contents thereof to PO3 Velasquez, who, in turn, gave the boodle money.<br><br>PO3 Velasquez examined the contents of the carton and upon seeing that it contained plastic sachets with white crystalline granules, he made the pre-arranged signal. SPO1 Ferrer immediately showed up and recovered the buy-bust money from appellant, while PO3 Velasquez seized the carton containing the sachets of white crystalline granules. After informing appellant of his rights, the police officers arrested and took him to the PDEA office for further investigation.<br><br>A Certificate of Inventory was then prepared by the police authorities which was signed by two <i>barangay</i> officials and a media representative. Appellant was requested to sign the certificate of inventory which he refused. This whole process was photographed. Thereafter, on the basis of a formal request,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the seized <i>shabu </i>was referred and delivered to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Provincial Crime Laboratory on August 8, 2005. P/Insp. Roderos issued Chemistry Report No. D-121-2005-U<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> stating that the white crystalline substance was positive for <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied selling <i>shabu</i> and claimed that he was a victim of frame-up by the PDEA. He recalled that on August 7, 2005, he was standing at the street corner near his house waiting for the funeral procession of his deceased nephew, Ricky Baturi, to pass. Police operatives arrived shortly and asked if he is Naldong. After he answered in the affirmative, he was asked as to the whereabouts of a former co-worker, Kamlon Montilla (Montilla). Appellant replied that he had no knowledge of the present location of Montilla. Dissatisfied with his answer, the police apprehended and took him inside their van. This was witnessed by his children. He was brought to Villasis where he was repeatedly asked at gunpoint about the whereabouts of Montilla to which he consistently replied that he did not know. He was thereafter detained. Appellant claimed that it was only during his arraignment that he discovered that he was being charged with illegal sale of <i>shabu.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s daughters Maribel Baturi and Rizalyn Raquedan corroborated his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>Giving credence to PO3 Velasquez’ testimony, the RTC convicted appellant of the crime charged and disposed of the case in its May 30, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused REYNALDO BATURI GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Sale of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or “shabu” in violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>Considering that the penalty of death was abolished, this Court hereby sentence[s] the accused to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>The sachets of shabu are hereby confiscated in favor of the government. Let the same be turned over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for destruction in accordance with law.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant filed a notice of appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which was approved by the RTC. Hence, the entire records of the case were forwarded to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> appellant pointed out that the buy-bust team failed to comply with the procedure governing the handling, custody and disposition of the illegal drugs. Because of this, there was failure on the part of the prosecution to establish the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Hence, the RTC erred in finding him guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>Negating appellant’s claims, appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), averred that the confiscated drug was properly inventoried and this was even witnessed by two <i>barangay kagawads, </i>a representative of the media and appellant himself. A Certificate of Inventory was then prepared which was signed by the said two <i>barangay kagawads</i> and the media representative. Then, a request letter for laboratory examination was signed by SPO4 Rabago. Contained in the said letter was the fact that PO3 Velasquez delivered the seized drug to the Crime Laboratory and that P/Insp. Roderos received the same. To the OSG, these circumstances clearly showed that the prosecution was able to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the confiscated drug. Moreover, there was no reason for the police to falsely testify against appellant. In view of these, the presumption that the police authorities regularly performed their duties must be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Finding that the seizure, handling, custody and examination of the seized drug were properly documented and undertaken in an uninterrupted manner, and the consummation of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> duly established by the prosecution, the CA, in its July 7, 2009 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED,</b> and accordingly, the herein assailed May 30, 2007 Decision of the trial court is hereby <b>AFFIRMED IN TOTO.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><b><i>Assignment of Error</i></b><br><br>Appellant imputes error upon the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> in finding him guilty of the crime charged despite the prosecution’s failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br><b><i>Elements for the Prosecution of Illegal Sale of Shabu</i></b><br><br>In a successful prosecution for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must concur: “(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. x x x What is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> or the illicit drug in evidence.<br><br>In this case, the prosecution successfully established all the essential elements of the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>. PO3 Velasquez, who acted as poseur-buyer, positively identified appellant as the seller of the <i>shabu</i> and categorically testified that the <i>shabu</i> was received by him, and the payment therefor by appellant, in a legitimate buy-bust operation.

Roderos, were found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>. This finding is contained in Chemistry Report Number D-121-2005-U<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and was testified to by P/Insp. Roderos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the prosecution, through the testimonies of PO3 Velasquez and P/Insp. Roderos, was able to successfully establish the elements of illegal sale of <i>shabu.</i><br><br>The Court acknowledges that “[p]rosecutions for illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In this case, the credibility of the prosecution witnesses cannot be doubted. Aside from the fact that both lower courts are one in finding that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were direct and definite, the said testimonies are also consistent with each other and with the physical evidence. Besides, “the trial court’s determination on the issue of credibility of witnesses and its consequent findings of facts must be given great weight and respect on appeal x x x. This is so because of the judicial experience that trial courts are in a better position to decide the question of credibility, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Defenses of Denial and Frame-Up are Unavailing. </i></b><br><br>In view of the positive declarations of the prosecution witnesses, appellant’s defense of denial becomes unavailing. “It has been consistently held that mere denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of a prosecution witness. A defense of denial which is unsupported and unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence becomes negative and self-serving, deserving no weight in law, and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over convincing, straightforward and probable testimony on affirmative matters.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s defense of frame-up likewise fails. “[F]rame-up is viewed with disfavor since, like alibi, it can easily be concocted and is a common ploy in most prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Appellant’s claim that he was framed by the police officers for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of a drug pusher by the name of Montilla is not worthy of belief. For the police officers to frame him, they must have known appellant prior to the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Here, the police officers do not personally know appellant prior to the incident. In fact, appellant himself testified that when the police operatives approached him, they still asked him if he is Naldong. Neither did the appellant claim that he knows the police officers who apprehended him. Also, if appellant was indeed a victim of frame-up by police officers, he should have filed the proper charges against them. “The fact that no administrative or criminal charges were filed lends cogency to the conclusion that the alleged frame-up was merely concocted as a defense scheme. This inaction clearly betrays appellant’s claim of frame-up.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Moreover, there is no allegation or evidence whatsoever that the members of the entrapment team were actuated by improper motive or were not performing their duty in accordance with law. They are therefore entitled to the legal presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions and their testimonies are accorded full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b><i>Failure to strictly comply with the <br>Chain of Custody Rule is not Fatal. </i></b><br><br>The Court is not persuaded by appellant’s averment that the prosecution failed to establish that the<i> shabu</i> allegedly seized from him was the same <i>shabu</i> submitted for laboratory examination. The following negates appellant’s claim: (1) the police officers inventoried the confiscated <i>shabu</i> immediately after its seizure from appellant. The process was witnessed by <i>barangay </i>officials and a media representative who affixed their signatures in the Certificate of Inventory;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (2) the inventory-taking was photographed and the photographs show that the actual conduct of inventory was witnessed by appellant himself;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (3) it is undisputed that appellant was asked to affix his signature in the Certificate of Inventory but he refused;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (4) it was shown that a PDEA personnel thereafter prepared a formal request and the white crystalline granules contained in the plastic sachets seized from appellant were indorsed and delivered promptly by PO3 Velasquez to P/Insp. Roderos to the crime laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>It is true that the prosecution did not formally offer in evidence the Certificate of Inventory and the formal request for examination of the confiscated substance. Be that as it may, the Court has previously held that even if an exhibit is not formally offered, the same “may still be admitted against the adverse party if, first, it has been duly identified by testimony duly recorded and, second, it has itself been incorporated in the records of the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> PO3 Velasquez categorically testified that an inventory of the seized drugs was performed, a corresponding certificate was prepared, and a formal request for examination was made. He further narrated that together with the formal request, he submitted and delivered the confiscated drugs to the crime laboratory. On the basis of the said formal request, P/Insp. Roderos examined the specimen and she likewise testified on this. Appellant’s counsel even asked the said prosecution witnesses regarding these documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Considering the said testimonies and the fact that the documents were incorporated in the records of the case, they are therefore admissible against appellant.<br><br>Besides, the failure of the police officers to comply strictly with the chain of custody rule is not fatal. It will not render the arrest of appellant illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> “What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court finds no hiatus or confusion in the confiscation, handling, custody and examination of the <i>shabu</i>. The illegal drug that was inventoried at the PDEA office, subjected to qualitative examination at the crime laboratory, and finally introduced in evidence against appellant was the same illegal drug that was confiscated from him when he was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling the same. No apparent irregularity is sufficiently shown to have attended the chain of custody of the <i>shabu.</i> Its identity, integrity and probative value were preserved and kept intact by the police officers.<br><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>All told, there is no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale of <i>shabu,</i> as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165. Under this law, the penalty for the unauthorized sale of <i>shabu</i>, regardless of its quantity and purity, is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10 million. However, with the enactment of RA 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> only life imprisonment and fine shall be imposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> upon appellant, without eligibility for parole pursuant to Section 2 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated July 7, 2009 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
