In <i>Oceanic Bic Division (FFW), et al. v. Romero, et al.,</i> this Court ruled that "a voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a quasi-judicial capacity." Under these rulings, it follows that the voluntary arbitrator, whether acting solely or in a panel, enjoys in law the status of a quasi-judicial agency but independent of, and apart from, the NLRC since his decisions are not appealable to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This court then stated that the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, even assuming that the office is not strictly a quasi-judicial agency, may be considered an instrumentality, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Assuming arguendo that the voluntary arbitrator or the panel of voluntary arbitrators may not strictly be considered as a quasi-judicial agency, board or commission, still both he and the panel are comprehended within the concept of a "quasi-judicial instrumentality." It may even be stated that it was to meet the very situation presented by the quasi-judicial functions of the voluntary arbitrators here, as well as the subsequent arbitrator/arbitral tribunal operating under the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, that the broader term "instrumentalities" was purposely included in the above-quoted provision.<br><br>An "instrumentality" is anything used as a means or agency. Thus, the terms governmental "agency" or "instrumentality" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed. The word "instrumentality," with respect to a state, contemplates an authority to which the state delegates governmental power for the performance of a state function. An individual person, like an administrator or executor, is a judicial instrumentality in the settling of an estate, in the same manner that a sub-agent appointed by a bankruptcy court is an instrumentality of the court, and a trustee in bankruptcy of a defunct corporation is an instrumentality of the state.<br><br>The voluntary arbitrator no less performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to him under the provisions therefor in the Labor Code and he falls, therefore, within the contemplation of the term "instrumentality" in the aforequoted Sec. 9 of B.P. 129. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Since the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators is considered a quasi-judicial agency, this court concluded that a decision or award rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator is appealable before the Court of Appeals.

Under Article IX, Section 1(e) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> a trainee who is “unable to demonstrate his ability to perform the work . . . shall be reverted to his previous assignment. . . .”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> According to the same provision, the trainee “shall hold that job on a trial or observation basis and . . . subject to prior approval of the authorized management official, be appointed to the position in a regular capacity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>Thus, training is a condition precedent for promotion. Selection for training does not mean automatic transfer out of the bargaining unit of rank-and-file employees.<br><br>Moreover, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement states that the training allowance of a rank-and-file employee “whose application for a posted job is accepted shall [be computed] in accordance with Section (f) of [Article IX].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Since Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were rank-and-file employees when they applied for training for the position of Foreman I, Lipio’s and Ignacio, Sr.’s training allowance must be computed based on Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>PHILEC allegedly applied the “Modified SGV” pay grade scale to prevent any salary distortion within PHILEC’s enterprise. This, however, does not justify PHILEC’s non-compliance with the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. This pay grade scale is not provided in the collective bargaining agreement. In <i>Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing United Workers of the Philippines (SMTFM-UWP) v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> this court ruled that “only provisions embodied in the [collective bargaining agreement] should be so interpreted and complied with. Where a proposal raised by a contracting party does not find print in the [collective bargaining agreement], it is not part thereof and the proponent has no claim whatsoever to its implementation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>Had PHILEC wanted the “Modified SGV” pay grade scale applied within its enterprise, “it could have requested or demanded that [the ‘Modified SGV’ scale] be incorporated in the [collective bargaining agreement].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> PHILEC had “the means under the law to compel [PWU] to incorporate this specific economic proposal in the [collective bargaining agreement].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> It “could have invoked Article 252 of the Labor Code”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> to incorporate the “Modified SGV” pay grade scale in its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. But it did not. Since this “Modified SGV” pay grade scale does not appear in PHILEC’s collective bargaining agreement with PWU, PHILEC cannot insist on the “Modified SGV” pay grade scale’s application. We reiterate Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez’s decision dated August 13, 1999 where he said that:<br><br><blockquote>. . . since the signing of the current CBA took place on September 27, 1997, PHILEC, by oversight, may have overlooked the possibility of a wage distortion occurring among ASSET-occupied positions. It is surmised that this matter could have been negotiated and settled with PWU before the actual signing of the CBA on September 27. Instead, PHILEC, again, allowed the provisions of Art. X, Sec. 4 of the CBA to remain the way it is and is now suffering the consequences of its laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>We note that PHILEC did not dispute PWU’s contention that it selected several rank-and-file employees for training and paid them training allowance based on the schedule provided in the collective bargaining agreement effective at the time of the trainees’ selection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> PHILEC cannot choose when and to whom to apply the provisions of its collective bargaining agreement. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement must be applied uniformly and complied with in good faith.<br><br>Given the foregoing, Lipio’s and Ignacio, Sr.’s training allowance should be computed based on Article X, Section 4 in relation to Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement. Lipio, who held the position of Machinist before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="90%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">First Month</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td width="30%">P456.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Second Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td>P1,031.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Third Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td>P1,031.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Fourth Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P1,031.00</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Ignacio, Sr., who held the position of DT-Assembler before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="90%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">First Month</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">P361.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Second Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P817.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Third Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P1,392.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Fourth Month</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">- - - - -</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P1,392.00</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Considering that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez’s decision awarded sums of money, Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. are entitled to legal interest on their training allowances. Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez’s decision having become final and executory on August 22, 2000, PHILEC is liable for legal interest equal to 12% per annum from finality of the decision until full payment as this court ruled in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.

In <i>Nacar v.
