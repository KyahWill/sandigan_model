Hence, the trial court’s July 29, 2003 order granting the issuance of the writ was null and void for having been issued by a court without jurisdiction.<br><br>The CA denied petitioner’s subsequent motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Petitioner is now before us on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b></center><br>The petitioner acknowledged the rule that the execution of a judgment could no longer be made by mere motion after the prescribed five-year period had already lapsed. However, it argued that the delay for the issuance of the writ of execution was caused by OCWD and Subic Water. The petitioner submitted that this Court had allowed execution by mere motion even after the lapse of the five-year period, when the delay was caused or occasioned by the actions of the judgment debtor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Also,&nbsp; the petitioner asserted that although Subic Water was not a party in the case, it could still be subjected to a writ of execution, since it was identified as OCWD’s co-maker and successor-in-interest in the compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the petitioner contended that the compromise agreement was signed by Mr. Noli R.

Section 1 of this Rule mandates:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1.</b> Filing of petition with Supreme Court. — A party desiring to <b>appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals</b>, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari.

Since the CA’s pronouncement<b> completely disposed of the case and the issues raised by the parties,</b> it was the proper subject of a Rule 45 petition.&nbsp; It was already a final order that resolved the subject matter in its entirety, leaving nothing else to be done.<br><br>A petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is appropriate only if there is<b> no appeal,</b> or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law available to the aggrieved party. As we have distinctly explained in the case of <i>Pasiona v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The aggrieved party is proscribed from assailing a decision or final order of the CA<i> via</i> Rule 65 because such recourse is proper only if the party has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the course of law. In this case, <b>petitioner had an adequate remedy, namely, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. A petition for review on certiorari, not a special civil action for certiorari was, therefore, the correct remedy.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Settled is the rule that where appeal is available to the aggrieved party, the special civil action for certiorari will not be entertained – remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive, not alternative or successive.

It could have even filed a motion for a 30-day extension of time, a motion that this Court grants for justifiable reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; But all of these, it failed to do.&nbsp; Thus, the assailed CA rulings became final and executory and could no longer be the subject of an appeal.<br><br>Apparently, to revive its lost appeal, petitioner filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>&nbsp; that – under Rule 65 – may be filed within sixty days from the promulgation of the assailed CA resolution (on January 3, 2006).&nbsp; A Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari</i>, however, cannot be a substitute for a lost appeal.&nbsp; With the lapse of the prescribed period for appeal without an action from the petitioner, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> – a mere replacement –must be dismissed.<br><br>But even without the procedural infirmity, the present recourse to us has no basis on the merits and must be denied.<br><br><b><i>Execution by motion is only <br>available within the five-year<br> period from entry of judgment.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Under Rule 39, Section 6,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> a judgment creditor has two modes in enforcing the court’s judgment. Execution may be either through motion or an independent action.<br><br>These two modes of execution are available depending on the timing when the judgment creditor invoked its right to enforce the court’s judgment. <b>Execution by motion is only available if the enforcement of the judgment was sought within five (5) years from the date of its entry.&nbsp; </b>On the other hand, execution by independent action is mandatory if the five-year prescriptive period for execution by motion had already elapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> However, for execution by independent action to prosper – the Rules impose another limitation – the action must be filed before it is barred by the statute of limitations which, under the Civil Code, is ten (10) years from the finality of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On May 7, 1999, within the five-year period from the trial court’s judgment, petitioner filed its motion for the issuance of a writ of execution. However, despite the grant of the motion, the court did not issue an actual writ. It was only on May 30, 2003 that petitioner filed a second motion to ask again for the writ’s issuance. By this time, the allowed five-year period for execution by motion had already lapsed.<br><br>As will be discussed below, since the second motion was filed beyond the five-year prescriptive period set by the Rules, then the writ of execution issued by the trial court on July 31, 2003 was null and void for having been issued by a court already ousted of its jurisdiction.<br><br>In <i>Arambulo v. Court of First Instance of Laguna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> we explained the rule that the jurisdiction of a court to issue a writ of execution by motion is only effective within the five-year period from the entry of judgment. Outside this five-year period, any writ of execution issued pursuant to a motion filed by the judgment creditor, is null and void. If no writ of execution was issued by the court within the five-year period, even a motion filed within such prescriptive period would not suffice.&nbsp; A writ issued by the court after the lapse of the five-year period is already null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; The judgment creditor’s only recourse then is to file an independent action, which must also be within the prescriptive period set by law for the enforcement of judgments.<br><br>This Court subsequently reiterated its <i>Arambulo</i> ruling in <i>Ramos v. Garciano</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where we said:<br><br><blockquote>There seems to be no serious dispute that the 4th alias writ of execution was issued eight (8) days after the lapse of the five (5) year period from the date of the entry of judgment in Civil Case No. 367. <b>As a general rule, after the lapse of such period a judgment may be enforced only by ordinary action, not by mere motion</b> (Section 6, Rule 39, Rules of Court).<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The limitation that a judgment be enforced by execution within five years, otherwise it loses efficacy, goes to the very jurisdiction of the Court.</b> A writ issued after such period is void, and the failure to object thereto does not validate it, for the reason that jurisdiction of courts is solely conferred by law and not by express or implied will of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>To clearly restate these rulings, for execution by motion to be valid, the judgment creditor must ensure the accomplishment of two acts within the five-year prescriptive period. These are: <b>a) the filing of the motion for the issuance of the writ of execution; and b) the court’s actual issuance of the writ.</b>&nbsp; In the instances when the Court allowed execution by motion even after the lapse of five years, we only recognized one exception, <i>i.e., when the delay is caused or occasioned by actions of the judgment debtor and/or is incurred for his benefit or advantage</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> However, petitioner failed to show or cite circumstances showing how OCWD or Subic Water caused it to belatedly file its second motion for execution.<br><br>Strictly speaking, the issuance of the writ should have been a ministerial duty on the part of the trial court after it gave its July 23, 1999 order, approving the first motion and directing the issuance of such writ. The petitioner could have easily compelled the court to actually issue the writ by filing a manifestation on the existence of the July 23, 1999 order.&nbsp; However, petitioner idly sat and waited for the five-year period to lapse before it filed its second motion. Having slept on its rights, petitioner had no one to blame but itself.<br><br><b><i>A writ of execution cannot affect<br> a non- party to a case.</i></b><br><br>Strangers to a case are not bound by the judgment rendered in it.&nbsp; Thus, a writ of execution can only be issued against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Subic Water never participated in the proceedings in Civil Case No. 580-0-90, where OCWD and petitioner were the contending parties. Subic Water only came into the picture when one Atty. Segundo Mangohig, claiming to be OCWD’s former counsel, manifested before the trial court that OCWD had already been judicially dissolved and that Subic Water assumed OCWD’s personality.<br><br>In the present case, the compromise agreement, although signed by Mr. Noli Aldip, did not carry the express conformity of Subic Water.&nbsp; Mr. Aldip was never given any authorization to conform to or bind Subic Water in the compromise agreement.&nbsp; Also, the agreement merely labeled Subic Water as a co-maker. It did not contain any provision where Subic Water acknowledged its solidary liability with OCWD.<br><br>Lastly, Subic Water did not voluntarily submit to the court’s jurisdiction. In fact, the motion it filed was only made as a special appearance, precisely to avoid the court’s acquisition of jurisdiction over its person. Without any participation in the proceedings below, it cannot be made liable on the writ of execution issued by the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantive Law Aspect<br><br><i>Solidary liability must be expressly stated.</i><br></b><br>The petitioner also argued that Subic Water could be held solidarily liable under the writ of execution since it was identified as OCWD’s co-maker in the compromise agreement.&nbsp; The petitioner’s basis for this is the following provision of the agreement:<br><br><blockquote>4. Both parties also <b>request</b> that Subic Water, Philippines which took over the operations of the defendant Olongapo City Water District be made as <b>co-maker</b> for the obligation herein above-cited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>As the rule stands, solidary liability is not presumed. This stems from Art. 1207 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 1207. x x x <b>There is a solidary liability only when the obligation expressly so states</b>, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity.&nbsp; [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>In <i>Palmares v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; the Court did not hesitate to rule that although a party to a promissory note was only labeled as a co-maker, his liability was that of a surety, since the instrument <b>expressly provided for his joint and several liability</b> with the principal.<br><br>In the present case, the joint and several liability of Subic Water and OCWD was nowhere clear in the agreement.&nbsp; The agreement simply and plainly stated that petitioner and OCWD were<b> only requesting</b> Subic Water to be a co-maker, in view of its assumption of OCWD’s water operations. No evidence was presented to show that such request was ever approved by Subic Water’s board of directors.<br><br>Under these circumstances, petitioner cannot proceed after Subic Water for OCWD’s unpaid obligations. The law explicitly states that <b>solidary liability is not presumed and must be expressly provided for.</b> Not being a surety, Subic Water is not an insurer of OCWD’s obligations under the compromise agreement.&nbsp; At best, Subic Water was merely a guarantor against whom petitioner can claim, provided it was first shown that: a) petitioner had already proceeded after the properties of OCWD, the principal debtor; b) and despite this, the obligation under the compromise agreement, remains to be not fully satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; But as will be discussed next, Subic Water could not also be recognized as a guarantor of OCWD’s obligations.<br><br><b><i>An officer’s actions can only bind <br>the corporation if he had been<br> authorized to do so.</i></b><br><br>An examination of the compromise agreement reveals that it was not accompanied by any document showing a grant of authority to Mr. Noli Aldip to sign on behalf of Subic Water.<br><br>Subic Water is a corporation.&nbsp; A corporation, as a juridical entity, primarily acts through its board of directors, which exercises its corporate powers. In this capacity, the general rule is that, in the absence of authority from the board of directors, no person, not even its officers, can validly bind a corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Section 23 of the Corporation Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 23</b>. The board of directors or trustees. – Unless otherwise provided in this Code, <b>the corporate powers of all corporations formed under this Code shall be exercised, all business conducted and all property of such corporations controlled and held by the board of directors or trustees</b> to be elected from among the holders of stocks, or where there is no stock, from among the members of the corporation, who shall hold office for one (1) year until their successors are elected and qualified.

Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; we held that under Section 23 of the Corporation Code, <b>the power and responsibility to decide whether a corporation can enter into a binding contract is lodged with the board of directors</b>, subject to the articles of incorporation, by-laws, or relevant provisions of law.&nbsp; As we have clearly explained in another case:<br><br><blockquote><b>A corporate officer or agent may represent and bind the corporation in transactions with third persons to the extent that [the] authority to do so has been conferred upon him</b>, and this includes powers which have been intentionally conferred, and also such powers as, in the usual course of the particular business, are incidental to, or may be implied from, the powers intentionally conferred, powers added by custom and usage, as usually pertaining to the particular officer or agent, and such apparent powers as the corporation has caused persons dealing with the officer or agent to believe that it has conferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> [emphasis ours]</blockquote><br>Mr. Noli Aldip signed the compromise agreement purely in his own capacity. Moreover, the compromise agreement did not expressly provide that Subic Water consented to become OCWD’s co-maker.&nbsp; As worded, the compromise agreement merely provided that <i>both parties [also] <b>request </b>Subic Water, Philippines, which took over the operations of Olongapo City Water District be made as co-maker [for the obligations above-cited]</i>.&nbsp; This request was never forwarded to Subic Water’s board of directors.&nbsp; Even if due notification had been made (which does not appear in the records), Subic Water’s board does not appear to have given any approval to such request. No document such as the minutes of Subic Water’s board of directors’ meeting or a secretary’s certificate, purporting to be an authorization to Mr. Aldip to conform to the compromise agreement, was ever presented. In effect, Mr. Aldip’s act of signing the compromise agreement was outside of his authority to undertake.<br><br>Since Mr. Aldip was never authorized and there was no showing that Subic Water’s articles of incorporation or by-laws granted him such authority, then the compromise agreement he signed cannot bind Subic Water. Subic Water cannot likewise be made a surety or even a guarantor for OCWD’s obligations. OCWD’s debts under the compromise agreement are its own corporate obligations to petitioner.<br><b><i><br>OCWD and Subic Water are two<br>separate and different entities</i></b>.<br><br>Petitioner practically suggests that since Subic Water took over OCWD’s water operations in Olongapo City, it also acquired OCWD’s juridical personality, making the two entities one and the same.<br><br>This is an interpretation that we cannot make or adopt under the facts and the evidence of this case.&nbsp; Subic Water clearly demonstrated that it was a separate corporate entity from OCWD.<br><br>OCWD is just a ten percent (10%) shareholder of Subic Water.&nbsp; As a mere shareholder, OCWD’s juridical personality cannot be equated nor confused with that of Subic Water.&nbsp; It is basic in corporation law that a corporation is a juridical entity vested with a legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Under this corporate reality, Subic Water cannot be held liable for OCWD’s corporate obligations in the same manner that OCWD cannot be held liable for the obligations incurred by Subic Water as a separate entity. The corporate veil should not and cannot be pierced unless it is clearly established that the separate and distinct personality of the corporation was used to justify a wrong, protect fraud, or perpetrate a deception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In <i>Concept Builders, Inc. v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court enumerated the possible probative factors of identity which could justify the application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil. These are:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Stock ownership by one or common ownership of both corporations;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Identity of directors and officers;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The manner of keeping corporate books and records; and<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Methods of conducting the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The burden of proving the presence of any of these probative factors lies with the one alleging it. Unfortunately, petitioner simply claimed that Subic Water took over OCWD’s water operations in Olongapo City.&nbsp; Apart from this allegation, petitioner failed to demonstrate any link to justify the construction that Subic Water and OCWD are one and the same.<br><br>Under this evidentiary situation, our duty is to respect the separate and distinct personalities of these two juridical entities.<br><br>We thus deny the present petition.&nbsp; The writ of execution issued by RTC Olongapo, Br. 75, in favor of Olongapo City, is hereby confirmed to be null and void.&nbsp; Accordingly, respondent Subic Water cannot be made liable under this writ.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>DISMISS</b> the petition.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals’ decision dated July 6, 2005 and resolution&nbsp; dated January 3, 2006,&nbsp; annulling and setting aside the orders&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Regional&nbsp; Trial&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Olongapo,&nbsp; Branch 75 dated July&nbsp; 29, 2003 and October 7, 2003, and the writ of execution dated July 31, 2003, are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; Costs against the City of Olongapo.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Perez, </i>and <i>Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.,</i> concur,<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Rollo</i>, p. 3-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Marina L.
