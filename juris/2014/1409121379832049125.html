She likewise contended that her removal as STI-Makati COO and transfer to the School Compliance Group as Compliance Manager was illegal and constituted a demotion amounting to constructive dismissal, as she was not given prior notice of the transfer; forced to give her written conformity thereto; placed in an embarrassing situation thereafter; and never given any task or work while she held such position.&nbsp; She added that the alleged reorganization which caused her removal as STI-Makati COO was a sham, calculated to ease her out in the guise of a restructuring; that she was illegally placed under suspension for alleged offenses which respondents could not substantiate and which she was not informed about; that she was not accorded due process during the conduct of the purported investigation; and that as a consequence of the discrimination and unfair treatment she received from respondents, she suffered untold injury.&nbsp; Petitioner thus pleaded:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, complainant respectfully prays that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered ordering respondents, jointly and severally, as follows:<br><br>1.

as a result, the positions of STI-Makati CEO and COO were abolished.&nbsp; They argued that petitioner was merely “laterally transferred” to the School Compliance Group as Compliance Manager, and was not demoted in rank; nor did she suffer a diminution in her salary and benefits, as the positions of STI-Makati COO and Compliance Manager are equivalent in rank under the STI structure, that is, they both fall under “Job Grade Manager B”.&nbsp; They added that petitioner committed anomalies and irregularities, as stated above, which became the subject of an Audit Report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; They asserted that the abolition of a position in STI is a recognized prerogative of management which may not be interfered with absent malice or bad faith, and more so when done pursuant to a valid corporate restructuring; the abolition of the CEO, COO, Treasurer, Corporate Secretary, and Director positions in STI-Makati was pursued as a matter of course because with the merger, STI-Makati ceased to exist as it was absorbed by STI, and consequently these positions became unnecessary.&nbsp; Petitioner’s transfer was justified as an exercise of STI’s prerogative and right to transfer its employees when called for, and was done reasonably, without malice or bad faith, and without unnecessarily inconveniencing petitioner.<br><br>Respondents added that petitioner’s suspension was vital for the protection of sensitive data and to ensure the smooth conduct of the investigation, and in order that she may not gain access to sensitive information which, if divulged to government agencies such as the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), would result in the denial/withholding of permits to STI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; On petitioner’s claim for regularization, respondents claimed that this was unnecessary since petitioner was already a regular employee of STI.&nbsp; Regarding petitioner’s money claims, respondents argued that petitioner could not be entitled to them, as she received all her salaries, benefits and entitlements during her stint with STI.&nbsp; Finally, respondents contended that petitioner was not entitled to damages and attorney’s fees, since she was not illegally dismissed and, in carrying out her transfer, they did not act with malice, bad faith, or in a wanton and oppressive manner.<br><br>In her Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to respondents’ Position Paper, petitioner noted that while STI and STI College Makati (Inc.) merged, there was in fact no restructuring that took place which required her transfer and demotion; on the contrary, the merger created 29 additional vacant positions in STI.&nbsp; Petitioner added that no prior announcement of the restructuring of STI-Makati was made, which thus renders such reorganization of questionable integrity; instead, the merger was utilized as a tool to ease her out, through the bogus reorganization.&nbsp; She contended that Fernandez had prejudged her case even before an investigation into the alleged anomalies could be conducted.&nbsp; Petitioner likewise noted that even her appointment as Compliance Manager was a sham, because no such vacant position existed within the School Compliance Group, as the only two Compliance Manager positions were then occupied by Eddie Musico (Musico) and Reynaldo Gozum (Gozum);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the only other vacant positions in that department were those for lower level Compliance Officers.&nbsp; In effect, petitioner was in fact made a mere Compliance Officer, which meant that she was effectively demoted.&nbsp; Petitioner claimed as well that her demotion was highlighted by the fact that while she had a masteral degree and doctorate units, all the others within the School Compliance Group – including her superior, Paraiso – were mere bachelor’s degree holders.<br><br>Finally, petitioner maintained that the multiple charges lodged against her were without basis, and respondents failed to prove them by adequate evidence.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents maintained in their Reply (to Complainant’s Position Paper)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that as to salary and benefits, petitioner was not discriminated against, and was merely given a compensation package commensurate to her rank as “Job Grade Manager B”, taking into consideration her length of service at STI.&nbsp; Her salary was thus at par with those of other STI employees of equivalent rank and similar durations of employment.&nbsp; They added that honoraria are not given to its employees, as well as to those who are deployed to company-owned schools such as STI-Makati.&nbsp; Respondents asserted further that the reorganization was not a ruse to ease petitioner out; it was necessary as a means toward streamlining STI’s operations.&nbsp; Fernandez characterized petitioner’s account of their conversation as inaccurate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents likewise debunked petitioner’s claims that she was discriminated against while she held the position of Compliance Manager, saying that this claim was specious and exaggerated.&nbsp; They added that even though Fernandez was later appointed COO of STI-Makati after petitioner was appointed Compliance Manager, his work as such STI-Makati COO was limited to performance of oversight functions, which functions he already performs as Senior Vice-President of the Education Management Division of STI.&nbsp; With regard to the July 19, 2004 meeting, respondents argued that nothing was achieved during said meeting owing to petitioner’s and her counsel’s “quarrelsome attitude” and insistence that she be furnished the written charges against her as well as the supporting evidence or documents, which would have been unnecessary if she only cooperated during said meeting and answered the charges against her.&nbsp; They underscored the fact that during said meeting, petitioner was furnished with a copy of the charges against her, including all other documents, particularly the Audit Findings.<br><br>On March 31, 2006, Labor Arbiter Renaldo O.

On May 18, 2004, she was subjected to threats and intimidation by Fernandez, the latter bullying and forcing her to receive the May 18, 2004 Memorandum while petitioner was inside his office;<br><br>2.

On May 20, 2004, an official written announcement was made regarding Jacob’s appointment as new STI President and CEO, Fernandez as new STI-Makati COO, and Luz as new STI-Makati School Administrator.&nbsp; Adding insult to injury, petitioner’s appointment as Compliance Manager was intentionally left out;<br><br>4. Petitioner, given her illustrious career in STI – having risen from the ranks as a faculty member, to full-time professor, to Dean, and finally to the position of STI-Makati COO, and having achieved multiple awards and distinctions – was thereafter treated “as a non-entity” by respondents.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter added that the purported audit and investigation of petitioner’s alleged irregularities was a sham, as the same was conducted without official sanction from STI and without petitioner’s knowledge; it was founded on hearsay evidence and based on charges known only to Fernandez; it was conducted merely to conceal respondents’ shabby treatment of petitioner, and without apprising petitioner of the written formal charges against her.<br><br>Finally, respondents were adjudged guilty of malice, bad faith, acts oppressive to labor and contrary to morals, good customs and public policy, which caused upon petitioner suffering and humiliation which entitles her to an award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission</i></b><br><br>Respondents interposed an appeal with the NLRC, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 050756-06.&nbsp;

the regulation of manpower is a management prerogative enjoyed by STI, and it was free to regulate according to its own discretion and judgment all aspects of petitioner’s employment.&nbsp; In this light, and since no concrete evidence was presented by petitioner to show that respondents acted with malice or bad faith, the NLRC held that it may not be said that the abolition of the position of STI-Makati COO was done to unduly ease her out of STI.<br><br>The NLRC added that while it may be conceded that a heated argument between petitioner and Fernandez took place during their May 18, 2004 meeting, the charged emotional outbreaks were nonetheless occasioned by extraneous matters injected during such meeting, and consequently, Fernandez may not be faulted for insisting that petitioner receive the May 18, 2004 Memorandum ordering petitioner’s transfer.<br><br>Moreover, the NLRC declared that petitioner’s preventive suspension was not done irregularly, as it was based on charges leveled against her and made pursuant to an administrative investigation then being conducted;

It noted further that the March 12, 2004 confirmation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of petitioner’s appointment as STI-Makati COO was done pursuant to an August 2003 reorganization – or one that was implemented <i>prior </i>to the November 2003 merger;

She adds that her appointment to the position of Compliance Manager was in fact a demotion: she was relegated to a position where she did not have any staff to supervise; her work became merely mechanical in nature; she became a mere Compliance Officer reporting to the Compliance Group Head; and her work was severely limited.<br><br>Petitioner adds that contrary to the CA’s pronouncement, she was subjected to harassment and discrimination, humiliated and became the victim of STI’s fraudulent scheme to illegally oust her from her position as STI-Makati COO.&nbsp; She cites: 1) the May 18, 2004 incident, noting the treatment accorded her by Fernandez and the manner by which she was allegedly forced to receive the Memorandum of even date; 2) the investigation into alleged irregularities, which she characterized as sham; 3) her preventive suspension, which she claims was illegal for being based on non-existent charges; and 4) the withholding of her travel award.<br><br>Petitioner insists that her suspension was illegal, as her new employment as Compliance Manager did not put her in a position where she would have access to sensitive STI records; thus, she was never a serious threat to such extent that respondents believed she was.&nbsp; Besides, the investigation into allegations of irregularities committed by her, which was the cause for her suspension as well, was a sham for violating her rights to a hearing and due process.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respondents maintain that the merger of STI and STI-Makati required the abolition of the Chairman, President/CEO, COO, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary positions in STI-Makati; likewise, it became necessary to effect a reorganization of STI’s corporate structure in order to streamline its operations.&nbsp; Petitioner’s transfer was in line with such merger and reorganization; no bad faith may thus be inferred from their actions, which were carried out legally and pursuant to STI’s rights, prerogatives, and needs at the time.<br><br>Respondents argue further that petitioner’s transfer did not amount to a demotion in rank, as the positions of COO and Compliance Manager are of equal importance; in fact, the functions of Compliance Manager are much broader in scope as they involve the conduct of operations and academic audits of all of STI’s schools, and not just STI-Makati.&nbsp; As to salary and benefits, petitioner as Compliance Manager is given the same salary and benefits which she received at the time she was STI-Makati COO.<br><br>Respondents add that, as correctly held by the NLRC and CA, petitioner was never subjected to harassment and humiliation, thus:<br><br>1. Petitioner was not excluded from the Compliance Group’s planning session held in Baguio City.&nbsp; At the time of petitioner’s transfer, Briones was not aware of the scheduled Baguio trip, and thus petitioner was not duly informed thereof.&nbsp; Thus, her inability to attend the official event may not be blamed on respondents;<br><br>2. Petitioner was assigned ample work at the Compliance Group, contrary to her claims that she virtually did nothing in her new position;<br><br>3. It is not true that petitioner was not given her own room as Compliance Manager in order to humiliate her.&nbsp; She could not be given a room simply on account of office space constraints.<br><br>On petitioner’s suspension, respondents reiterate that petitioner’s threats to divulge sensitive information and jeopardize STI’s then pending permit applications justified the taking of drastic measures to insure that company records are kept intact and free from access; the preventive suspension of petitioner thus became necessary.&nbsp; Moreover, an audit investigation was then being conducted on alleged irregularities committed by petitioner; preventive suspension as a preliminary step in the investigation is thus authorized.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Petition is granted.<br><br>As a rule, this Court is not a trier of facts, and thus the findings of fact of the NLRC and CA are final and conclusive and will not be reviewed on appeal.&nbsp; However, there are well-recognized exceptions to the rule, such as when its judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts or relevant facts not disputed by the parties were overlooked which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.&nbsp; Petitioner’s case falls under these exceptions.<br><br>Both the NLRC and CA found that petitioner was not constructively dismissed, for the following reasons:<br><br>1. Petitioner’s position as STI-Makati COO was abolished as a necessary result of the merger of STI and STI-Makati, and the restructuring of STI aimed at streamlining its operations;<br><br>2. Petitioner was merely “laterally transferred” to the Compliance Group as Compliance Manager, with no diminution in rank, salary and benefits; and<br><br>3. The reorganization of STI was done in good faith and in the exercise of the management prerogative.&nbsp; In the same manner, petitioner’s transfer was a) made in the exercise of the management prerogative to transfer employees when necessary; b) done in good faith; and c) not unreasonable, inconvenient or prejudicial to her interests.<br><br>It appears, however, that the position of STI-Makati COO was actually never abolished.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, soon after petitioner was removed from the position, Fernandez was appointed to take her place as STI-Makati COO; his appointment was even publicly announced via an official communication disseminated company-wide.&nbsp; This thus belies respondents’ claim that the position of STI-Makati COO became unnecessary and was thus abolished.&nbsp; Respondents may argue, as they did in their Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to petitioner’s Position Paper, that Fernandez’s appointment as STI-Makati COO replacing petitioner was merely for oversight purposes.&nbsp; Whatever the reason could be for Fernandez’s appointment as STI-Makati COO, the fact still remains that such position continued to exist.<br><br>Next, petitioner’s appointment as Compliance Manager appears to be contrived as well.&nbsp; At the time of petitioner’s appointment, the only two Compliance Manager positions within STI’s compliance department – the School Compliance Group – were already filled up as they were then occupied by Musico and Gozum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; None of them has been dismissed or resigned.&nbsp; Nor could petitioner have been appointed head of the department, as Paraiso was very much in charge thereof, as its Compliance Group Head.&nbsp; The only positions within the department that were at the time vacant were those of Compliance Officers, which are of lower rank.&nbsp; In other words, petitioner could not have been validly appointed as Compliance Manager, a position within STI that was then very much occupied; if ever, petitioner took the position of a mere Compliance Officer, the only vacant position within the department.<br><br>Thirdly, even though it is claimed that from May 28, 2004 up to June 10, 2004, STI’s Corporate Auditor/Audit Advisory Group conducted an audit of STI-Makati covering the whole period of petitioner’s stint as COO/School Administrator, it appears that even prior to such audit, petitioner’s superior – Fernandez – had already prejudged her case.&nbsp; The May 18, 2004 conversation between petitioner and Fernandez inside the latter’s office is quite revealing.<br><br>The May 18 conversation between petitioner and Fernandez, taken in conjunction with the Court’s findings that the position of STI-Makati COO was never abolished and that petitioner’s appointment as Compliance Manager was contrived, confirms the view that petitioner was not transferred to the School Compliance Group as a matter of necessity, but as punishment for her perceived irregularities. In effect, petitioner was demoted and relegated to a position of insignificance within STI, there to suffer for what her employer alleged were transgressions committed by her.&nbsp; To all intents and purposes, petitioner was punished even before she could be tried.<br><br>Fernandez’s declarations during the May 18 conversation undoubtedly provide the true motive behind petitioner’s removal as STI-Makati COO:<br><br>a.&nbsp; After “hearing too many things” about petitioner, Fernandez simply lost confidence in her – meaning that Fernandez had made up his mind about petitioner after hearing rumors about her;<br><br>b. Fernandez accused petitioner of specific violations, without the benefit of accurate information and without giving her the opportunity to refute the accusations;<br><br>c. Fernandez has no time to listen to petitioner’s explanations, despite her pleas to be heard;<br><br>d. Fernandez refused to provide petitioner with the evidence or other basis for his accusations, in spite of petitioner’s request for him to put the same in writing;<br><br>e. Fernandez has prejudged petitioner, and intimated to her that she was dishonest, even before she could be heard; and<br><br>f. Fernandez threatened petitioner, that if she pushed him further, she would suffer the fate of a former employee who was separated from STI without the benefit of clearing his name.&nbsp; In other words, she could find herself without a job at STI even before her innocence or guilt could be established.<br><br>From the May 18 conversation alone, it can be seen that petitioner’s fate in STI was a foregone conclusion.&nbsp; She was threatened to accept her fate or else she would find herself without work, either through dismissal or forced resignation.&nbsp; Evidently, she became the subject of an illegal constructive dismissal in the guise of a transfer.<br><br>The supposed audit conducted from May 28, 2004 up to June 10, 2004 by STI’s Corporate Auditor/Audit Advisory Group was a mere afterthought, as it was apparent that as early as May 18, 2004, petitioner has been found guilty of whatever transgressions she was being charged with, founded or unfounded.&nbsp; The same is true with respect to her preventive suspension; it was imposed with malice and bad faith, and calculated to harass her further, if not trick her into believing that respondents were properly addressing her case.&nbsp; Needless to say, all proceedings and actions taken in regard to petitioner’s employment and case, beginning on May 18, 2004, were all but a farce, done or carried out in bad faith, with the objective of harassing and humiliating her, all in the fervent hope that she would fold up and quit.<br><br><blockquote>Constructive dismissal exists where there is cessation of work because ‘continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay’ and other benefits.&nbsp; Aptly called a dismissal in disguise or an act amounting to dismissal but made to appear as if it were not, constructive dismissal may, likewise, exist if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him except to forego his continued employment.&nbsp; In cases of a transfer of an employee, the rule is settled that the employer is charged with the burden of proving that its conduct and action are for valid and legitimate grounds such as genuine business necessity and that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient or prejudicial to the employee.&nbsp; If the employer cannot overcome this burden of proof, the employee’s transfer shall be tantamount to unlawful constructive dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>There is no doubt that petitioner was subjected to indignities and humiliated by the respondents.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the Labor Arbiter, she was bullied, threatened, shouted at, and treated insolently by Fernandez on May 18, 2004 inside the latter’s own office.&nbsp; She was shamed when, on her very first day at the School Compliance Group, all of the employees of the department have gone on an official out-of-town event without her and, as a result, she was left alone at the office for several days.&nbsp; Respondents did not even have the courtesy to offer her the opportunity to catch up with the group so that she could make it to the event, even if belatedly.&nbsp; Then again, on May 20, 2004, STI made an official company-wide announcement of Jacob’s appointment as new STI President and CEO, Fernandez as new STI-Makati COO, and Luz as new STI-Makati School Administrator, but petitioner’s appointment as new Compliance Manager was inconsiderately excluded.&nbsp; Respondents made her go through the rigors of a contrived investigation, causing her to incur unnecessary legal expenses as a result of her hiring the services of counsel.&nbsp; Her well-deserved awards and distinctions were unduly withheld in the guise of continuing investigation – which obviously was taking too long to conclude; investigation began formally on May 28, 2004 (start of audit), yet by August 17 (date of memorandum informing petitioner of the withholding of Korea travel award), the investigation was still allegedly ongoing.&nbsp; She was deprived of the privilege to attend company events where she would have received her well-deserved awards with pride and honor, and her colleagues would have been inspired by her in return.&nbsp; Certainly, respondents made sure that petitioner suffered a humiliating fate and consigned to oblivion.<br><br>Indeed, petitioner could not be faulted for taking an indefinite leave of absence, and for altogether failing to report for work after August 9, 2004.&nbsp; Human nature dictates that petitioner should refuse to subject herself to further embarrassment and indignities from the respondents and her colleagues.&nbsp; All told, petitioner was deemed constructively dismissed as of May 18, 2004.<br><br>Finally, since the position of STI-Makati COO was never abolished, it follows that petitioner should be reinstated to the very same position, and there to receive exactly what Fernandez gets by way of salaries, benefits, privileges and emoluments, without diminution in amount and extent.&nbsp; Petitioner, multi-awarded, deserving and loyal, is entitled to what Fernandez receives, and is deemed merely to take over the office from him; moreover, the position of Chief Operations Officer is not merely an ordinary managerial position, as it is a senior managerial office.&nbsp; In turn, Fernandez – or anyone who currently occupies the position of STI-Makati COO – must vacate the office and hand over the same to petitioner.<br><br>It is correct for petitioner to have included among the reliefs prayed for in her Complaint that she be paid the salary, benefits and privileges being enjoyed by Fernandez currently.&nbsp; The Court, in granting said relief, deems it only fair that she should be entitled to what Fernandez is receiving.&nbsp; Not only that the position requires greater expertise in many areas, or that it involves great responsibility, or that petitioner deserves it from the point of view of her qualifications and experience; but it would be to prevent another form of oppressive practice, where an employee is appointed to a senior management position, there to enjoy only the prestige or title, but not the benefits commensurate with the work and responsibility assumed.&nbsp; It would likewise prevent a situation where, as in this case, an employer – obliged by law or the courts to reinstate an “unwanted” employee holding a senior management position – is given an opportunity to retaliate by limiting the employee’s salary, privileges and benefits to a certain level – low or high, so long as it is within the managerial range – that is however 1) not commensurate with the work and responsibility assumed by the employee, or 2) discriminatory, or 3) indicative of a tendency to favor only one or some employees.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court fails to discern any bad faith or negligence on the part of respondent Jacob.&nbsp; The principal character that figures prominently in this case is Fernandez; he alone relentlessly caused petitioner’s hardships and suffering.&nbsp; He alone is guilty of persecuting petitioner.&nbsp; Indeed, some of his actions were without sanction of STI itself, and were committed outside of the authority given to him by the school; they bordered on the personal, rather than official.&nbsp; His superior, Jacob, may have been, for the most part, clueless of what Fernandez was doing to petitioner.&nbsp; After all, Fernandez was the Head of the Academic Services Group of the EMD, and petitioner directly reported to him at the time; his position enabled him to pursue a course of action with petitioner that Jacob was largely unaware of.<br><br><blockquote>A corporation, as a juridical entity, may act only through its directors, officers and employees. Obligations incurred as a result of the directors’ and officers’ acts as corporate agents, are not their personal liability but the direct responsibility of the corporation they represent. As a rule, they are only solidarily liable with the corporation for the illegal termination of services of employees if they acted with malice or bad faith.<br><br>To hold a director or officer personally liable for corporate obligations, two requisites must concur: (1) it must be alleged in the complaint that the director or officer assented to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or that the officer was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith; and (2) there must be proof that the officer acted in bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The October 27, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
