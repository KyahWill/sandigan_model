				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 28, 2008 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR. No. 30650 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 8, 2006 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 21 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 01-197425 and 01-197426, finding petitioners Ricardo L. Atienza (Atienza) and Alfredo A. Castro (Castro) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Robbery and Falsification of Public Document.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Atienza and Castro (petitioners) are employees of the CA, particularly assigned to its Budget Division and holding the positions of Budget Officer I and Utility Worker I,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respectively, at the time material to this case.<br><br>On March 20, 1995, at about past noon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Juanito Atibula (Atibula), Records Officer I and Custodian of the CA Original Decisions in the CA Reporter’s Division, was invited by Castro to attend Atienza’s birthday party somewhere along Bocobo Street, Ermita, Manila. At the party, Atienza introduced Atibula to a certain Dario and asked him to assist the latter in searching for the CA decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> in the case entitled “<i>Mateo Fernando v. Heirs of D. Tuason, Inc</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (<i>Fernando</i>), docketed as CA-G.R. No. 36808-R.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Atibula returned to the office – followed a few minutes later by Dario – and searched for the aforementioned decision which was found compiled in Volume 260 of the CA Original Decisions. As Dario was scanning through the said volume, Atibula observed that he was comparing its pages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to the discolored papers he was holding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dario likewise scanned Volumes 265 and 267,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and placed check marks on the papers he was holding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On March 24, 1995, after office hours, Atibula saw Dario outside the CA compound along Maria Orosa Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As they walked side by side towards the jeepney stop, Dario requested Atibula to insert a Decision dated September 26, 1968 in one of the volumes of the CA Original Decisions. However, Atibula refused and immediately left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On April 21, 1995, Atienza offered Atibula the amount of P50,000.00 in exchange for Volume 260,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which the latter turned down. Atienza then ridiculed him saying, “<i>duwag ka, pera na nga ito ayaw mo pa</i>,” to which Atibula retorted, “<i>ikaw ang duwag dahil nagpapakita ka ng kabuktutan</i>.” Disturbed by the situation, Atibula reported the incident to Atty. Arnel Macapagal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Atty. Macapagal), the Assistant Chief of the CA Reporter’s Division, who then instructed him (Atibula) to hide Volumes 260, 265 and 267<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in a safe place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On May 9, 1995, Atibula discovered that Volume 266<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> covering the period from January 28 to February 12, 1969 was missing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and, hence, immediately reported the same to Atty. Macapagal. Two days after the discovery of the loss, Atibula encountered Atienza near the canteen,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> shouting “[<i>p</i>]<i>utang ina mo, Juaning, pinahirapan mo kami!</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On May 18, 1995, a certain Nelson de Castro, Clerk IV detailed at the CA Reporter’s Division,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> handed to Atibula a bag containing a gift-wrapped package which turned out to be the missing Volume 266. He claimed that it was Castro who asked him to deliver the said package to Atibula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Having been notified of Volume 266’s return, Atty. Macapagal then directed Atibula to ascertain who borrowed the volume. Records, however, disclosed no one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Separately, Atibula compared the contents of Volume 266 with the index of the decisions and noticed that there were two new documents inserted therein,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> namely: (<i>a</i>) a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated February 11, 1969 (subject resolution), ostensibly penned by Associate Justice Juan P. Enriquez (Justice Enriquez) and concurred in by Associate Justices Magno S. Gatmaitan and Edilberto Soriano, recalling and setting aside the Entry of Judgment earlier issued in the <i>Fernando</i> case; and (<i>b</i>) a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated April 16, 1970 (subject decision), also ostensibly penned by Justice Enriquez and concurred in by Associate Justices Jesus Y. Perez and Jose M. Mendoza, amending the original decision dated September 26, 1968 in the aforementioned case. Consequently, Atibula reported his findings to Atty. Macapagal who, in turn, informed Atty. Gemma Leticia F. Tablate (Atty. Tablate), then Chief of the CA Reporter’s Division, of the same. They tried to verify the genuineness, authenticity and existence of the subject resolution and decision, and found that the compilation of the duplicate original decisions/resolutions of Justice Enriquez did not bear the said promulgations. Atty. Tablate reported the incident to then CA Presiding Justice Nathanael P. De Pano, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> who immediately requested the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct an investigation on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Laboratory analysis and comparative examination of the subject resolution and decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as well as of a decision in another case found in pages 906 to 922 of Volume 266 of the CA Original Decisions were conducted by the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As a result, it issued its Questioned Documents Report No. 937-1295,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> finding that: (<i>a</i>) Volume 266 had indeed been altered;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the signatures of the CA Justices in the subject resolution and decision (questioned signatures) and their standard/sample signatures “were not written by one and the same person,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> leading to the conclusion that the questioned signatures were forgeries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, sometime in the second week of July 1995, an inspection of the air-conditioning units at the office of the CA Reporter’s Division was conducted, whereby it was discovered that the improvised angle bar supporting the air conditioning unit at the right most end from the main door was corroded with rust and the portion of the wall holding the same was broken (“<i>may bak-bak na</i>”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> NBI Agents, Atty.

Decampong<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> then conducted an ocular inspection of the premises, and, in the course thereof, interviewed several personnel of the CA Maintenance Division. Said investigation yielded the following findings: (<i>a</i>) there were no signs of forcible entry;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (<i>b</i>) the perpetrators gained entry to the office of the CA Reporter’s Division “by passing through the hole on the concrete wall after removing the air conditioning unit”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> located on the right most [sic] end from the main door;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (<i>c</i>) there was conspiracy to commit the crime of Falsification of Public Document between Atienza and Dario in view of their “concerted efforts through previous or simultaneous acts and deeds;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and (<i>d</i>) Castro assisted Atienza and Dario “to profit from the effects of the crime by returning safely the missing volume to the [CA Reporter’s Division].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Consequently, a criminal complaint was filed by the NBI and the Fact-Finding and Intelligence Bureau of the Office of the Ombudsman against Atienza, Castro, and Dario before the Evaluation and Preliminary Investigation Bureau of the OMB, docketed as OMB-0-97-2054,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> charging them for the following crimes: (<i>a</i>) Falsification of Public Document; (<i>b</i>) violation of Section 3(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as amended; and (<i>c</i>) violation of Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of RA 6713.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>After investigation, the charges involving the pertinent provisions of RAs 3019 and 6713 were dismissed for insufficiency of evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> but it was contrarily determined that there existed probable cause to charge Atienza, Castro, and Dario<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> for the crimes of Robbery under Article 299(a)(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>(RPC), as amended, and of Falsification of Public Document under Article 172(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> in relation to Article 171(6)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the same code. Thus, the corresponding Informations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respectively docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 01-197425 and 01-197426, were filed before the RTC.

It held that while there is no direct evidence showing that the petitioners committed the crimes charged, the testimonies of Atibula and NBI Agent Atty. Daganzo with respect to what had transpired before and after Volume 266 was taken from its shelf, when viewed together with the other circumstances in the case, constitute circumstantial evidence which sufficiently point to the guilt of petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In addition, it found that Atienza’s defenses were self-serving negative evidence which cannot outweigh the circumstantial evidence clearly establishing his participation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> adding too that while there was no proof of previous agreement between petitioners to unlawfully take Volume 266 out of the office of the CA Reporter’s Division and falsify the subject documents, their conspiracy may be inferred from the fact that Castro was in possession of the missing Volume 266 which was eventually discovered to have been falsified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> dated July 7, 2009, hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not petitioners’ conviction for the crimes of Robbery and Falsification of Public Document should be upheld on account of the circumstantial evidence in this case proving their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Circumstantial evidence consists of proof of collateral facts and circumstances from which the main fact in issue may be inferred based on reason and common experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It is sufficient for conviction if: (<i>a</i>) there is more than one circumstance; (<i>b</i>) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (<i>c</i>) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. To uphold a conviction based on circumstantial evidence, it is essential that the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain which leads one to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of the others, as the guilty person. Stated differently, the test to determine whether or not the circumstantial evidence on record is sufficient to convict the accused is that the series of circumstances duly proven must be consistent with each other and that each and every circumstance must be consistent with the accused’s guilt and inconsistent with his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Applying these principles to the facts that appear on record, the Court finds that no sufficient circumstantial evidence was presented in this case to establish the elements of Robbery under Article 299(a)(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> of the RPC and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171(6)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of the same code, or of petitioners’ supposed conspiracy therefor. To this end, the Court examines the participation of and evidence against each petitioner and forthwith explains its reasons for reaching the foregoing conclusions.<br><br><b><i>A. The Participation of and Evidence Against Castro </i></b><br><br>Notwithstanding Castro’s failure to refute the charges against him, the Court finds no evidence to link him to the commission of the crimes of Robbery and Falsification of Public Document, contrary to the conclusions reached by the RTC and concurred in by the CA. To begin with, it is essential to note that Castro’s purported possession and eventual return of Volume 266 was only premised upon the statement of one Nelson de Castro (Nelson), <i>i.e.</i>, the Sinumpaang Salaysay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> dated August 9, 1995, who averred that on May 18, 1995, at around 11:50 in the morning, Castro told him to pass by his office and there handed him a bag which, as it turned out, contained the missing Volume 266, <i>viz</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><blockquote>Noong Mayo 18, 1995 bandang 11:50 ng tanghali ay tumawag sa telepono si ALFREDO CASTRO, ng Budget Division, at sinabihan ako na dumaan sa kanyang opisina dahil mayroon daw siyang ibibigay para sa opisina namin. Pumunta po naman ako kaagad kay ALFREDO CASTRO sa opisina at iniabot sa akin ang isang bag na malaki kulay parang pink at may laman at sinabihan pa niya ako na buksan ko na lang daw ang bag pagdating sa opisina. Pagdating ko sa opisina ay tinawag ko si Mr. ATIBULA at doon ay binuksan naming dalawa ang bag. Nakita ko sa loob ang isang bagay na nakabalot sa isang gift wrap at ng buksan namin o alisin ang gift wrap ay ang Original Decisions, Volume 266 na nawawala mga ilang linggo na ang nakakaraan.<br></blockquote>Nelson was not, however, presented before the RTC during trial, hence, was not subjected to any in-court examination. It is settled that while affidavits may be considered as public documents if they are acknowledged before a notary public (here, a public officer authorized to administer oaths), they are still classified as hearsay evidence unless the affiants themselves are placed on the witness stand to testify thereon and the adverse party is accorded the opportunity to cross-examine them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> With the prosecution’s failure to present Nelson to affirm his statement that Castro caused the return of Volume 266,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the prosecution’s evidence on the matter should be treated as hearsay and, thus, inadmissible to establish the truth or falsity of the relevant claims. Consequently, there exists no sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove Castro’s guilt.<br><br><b><i>B. The Participation of and Evidence Against Atienza </i></b><br><br>In similar regard, the prosecution’s evidence on the circumstances in this case do not sufficiently establish Atienza’s guilt for the crimes of Robbery and Falsification of Public Document.<br><br>While records show that Atienza was positively identified by Atibula as having attempted to bribe him to take out <b>Volume 260</b> of the CA Original Decisions from the Reporter’s Division,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the fact is that the alleged intercalation actually occurred in a different document, that is <b>Volume 266</b>. The discrepancy of accounts on the very subject matter of the crimes charged dilutes the strength of the evidence required to produce a conviction. At best, the bribery attempt may be deemed as a demonstration of interest on the part of Atienza over said subject matter and in this regard, constitutes proof of motive. However, it is well-established that mere proof of motive, no matter how strong, is not sufficient to support a conviction, most especially if there is no other reliable evidence from which it may reasonably be deduced that the accused was the malefactor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In fact, even if Atienza’s bribery attempt is taken together with the other circumstance couched as a relevant link by the prosecution in this case – i.e., his averred encounter with Atibula, on May 11, 1995, or two (2) days after the discovery of the loss of Volume 266, wherein the latter uttered “[<i>p</i>]<i>utang ina mo, Juaning, pinahirapan mo kami</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> – the Court still finds the evidence to be lacking. This allegation, even if proven as true, does not indicate that Atienza howsoever affirmed the taking or even the falsification of Volume 266. Clearly, the utterance was made by Atibula who did not bother to state Atienza’s response thereto or any other subsequent action connected therewith so as to bolster a finding of guilt. Neither can this circumstance be properly linked to the act of Castro inviting Atibula to Atienza’s party. It would be a stretch to conclude that this mere invitation, without any other proof of Castro’s participation, was instrumental or, at the very least, reasonably connected to Atienza and his own alleged participation in the above-stated crimes.<br><br>In this relation, it may not be amiss to debunk the claim that petitioners conspired in this case. While direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy as it may be inferred from the collective acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime which point to a joint purpose, design, concerted action, and community of interests,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> records are, however, bereft of any showing as to how the particular acts of petitioners figured into the common design of taking out the subject volume and inserting the falsified documents therein. Hence, the prosecution’s theory of conspiracy does not deserve any merit.<br><br>All told, the prosecution has failed to show that the circumstances invoked constitute an unbroken chain of events which lead to a fair and reasonable conclusion that petitioners are, to the exclusion of the others, indeed the culprits. As such, their conviction, tested under the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt, was not warranted. To be sure, proof beyond reasonable doubt is the degree of proof that, after investigation of the whole record, produces moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind of the accused’s culpability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Such moral certainty is, however, lacking in this case due to the insufficiency of the circumstantial evidence presented.<br><br><b><i>C. Jurisdictional Defect: Falsification Case </i></b><br><br>Also, it bears mentioning that the RTC did not have jurisdiction to take cognizance of Criminal Case No. 01-197426 (i.e., the falsification case) since Falsification of Public Document under Article 172(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> of the RPC, which is punishable by <i><i>prision correccional</i></i> in its medium and maximum periods (or imprisonment for 2 years, 4 months and 1 day to 6 years<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>) and a fine of not more than P5,000.00, falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts pursuant to Section 32(2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> otherwise known as the “Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980,” as amended by RA 7691.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> While petitioners raised this jurisdictional defect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> for the first time in the present petition, they are not precluded from questioning the same. Indeed, jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred only by the Constitution or the law and cannot be acquired through a waiver or enlarged by the omission of the parties or conferred by the acquiescence of the court. The rule is well-settled that lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter <b><u>may be raised at any stage of the proceedings</u></b>. Hence, questions of jurisdiction may be cognizable even if raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br><b><i>D. A Final Word</i></b><br><br>The Constitution mandates that an accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proven beyond reasonable doubt. The burden lies on the prosecution to overcome such presumption of innocence, failing which, the presumption of innocence prevails and the accused should be acquitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> This, despite the fact that his innocence may be doubted, for a criminal conviction rests on the strength of the evidence of the prosecution and not on the weakness or even absence of defense. If the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction, as in this case. Courts should be guided by the principle that it would be better to set free ten men who might be probably guilty of the crime charged than to convict one innocent man for a crime he did not commit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Accordingly, there being no circumstantial evidence sufficient to support a conviction, the Court hereby acquits petitioners, without prejudice, however, to any subsequent finding on their administrative liability in connection with the incidents in this case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
