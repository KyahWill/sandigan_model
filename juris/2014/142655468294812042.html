Section 220 of the Tax Reform Act must not be understood as overturning the long established procedure before this Court in requiring the Solicitor General to represent the interest of the Republic.&nbsp; This Court continues to maintain that it is the Solicitor General who has the primary responsibility to appear for the government in appellate proceedings. </i> This pronouncement finds justification in the various laws defining the Office of the Solicitor General, beginning with Act No. 135, which took effect on 16 June 1901, up to the present Administrative Code of 1987. Section 35, Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV, of the said Code outlines the powers and functions of the Office of the Solicitor General which includes, but not limited to, its duty to —<br><blockquote>(1) Represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings; represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(3) Appear in any court in any action involving the validity of any treaty, law, executive order or proclamation, rule or regulation when in his judgment his intervention is necessary or when requested by the Court.</blockquote>In <i>Gonzales vs. Chavez</i>, the Supreme Court has said that, from the historical and statutory perspectives, the Solicitor General is the “principal law officer and legal defender of the government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>From the foregoing, we find that the Office of the Solicitor General is the proper party to represent the interests of the government through the Bureau of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; The Legal Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue should be mindful of this procedural lapse in the future.<br><br>However, records show that the Office of the Solicitor General has been apprised of developments in the case since the beginning of the proceedings.&nbsp; We, thus, rule that the interests of the government have been duly protected.<br><br>As petitioner is found entitled to the immunities and privileges granted under the tax amnesty program, the issue on the assessed deficiency income taxes is, thus, moot and academic.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of petitioner LG Electronics Philippines, Inc.’s availment of the tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for being <b>MOOT </b>and <b>ACADEMIC</b>.&nbsp; Petitioner’s deficiency taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years are deemed fully settled.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> and<i> Mendoza, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 55–82.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 86–104.&nbsp; The case was docketed as C.T.A.
