Camerino, whose findings revealed the following:<br><br><blockquote>“&gt;Thin circular hymen with rough edges and previous healed lacerations.<br><br>&gt;(-) vaginal lacerations<br>&gt;(-) bleeding/discharge<br>&gt;positive pregnancy test (9/15/04)<br>&gt;uterus enlarged to 4 months age of gestation.”</blockquote>On 16 January 2005, AAA gave birth to a baby boy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> took the witness stand in his own defense, denying that he raped AAA and offering an alibi for the afternoon of September 12, 2004.&nbsp; Accused-appellant’s testimony, in sum, was as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In his defense, [accused-appellant] interposed the lone defense of <i>alibi</i>, alleging that he was not in their house on the day of the incident but was at work as a cook in a restaurant, less than a kilometer or about a 30-minute walk away from their house.&nbsp; [Accused-appellant] testified that he never had the chance to be with the victim on the day in question since his work was from 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon to 2:00 o’clock in the morning of the following day.<br><br>On cross-examination, [accused-appellant] denied having any previous misunderstanding with the victim and admitted that he could not think of a reason why AAA would impute such a serious accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In its Decision dated November 26, 2008, the RTC convicted accused-appellant for simple statutory rape, and not for qualified rape as charged. The trial court reasoned that it could not appreciate the aggravating or qualifying circumstance of relationship alleged in the Information, particularly, accused-appellant being AAA’s stepfather, because, as admitted by the parties and proved during trial, accused-appellant was not legally AAA’s stepfather, but merely the common-law spouse of AAA’s mother.&nbsp; Hence, the RTC decreed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused ROEL VERGARA y CLAVERO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE as defined and punished under paragraph (1), (d) Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8363, and accordingly sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the victim [AAA] in the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, and the amount of P25,000 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>Accused-appellant sought recourse from the Court of Appeals, anchoring his appeal on a lone assignment of error, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE PROSECUTION’S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision on March 31, 2011, wholly affirming the judgment of conviction rendered by the RTC against accused-appellant.&nbsp; The appellate court upheld the assessment by the RTC of the witnesses’ credibility, as well as the conclusion of said trial court that the prosecution was able to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant’s guilt for the crime of simple statutory rape.<br><br>Aggrieved, accused-appellant comes before this Court through the instant appeal.<br><br>The appeal is bereft of merit.<br><br>Under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the crime of rape is committed by a man having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (a) through force, threat or intimidation; (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; (c) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and <b>(d) when the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</b><br><br>In <i>People v. Teodoro</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court clearly explained the elements of statutory rape committed under Article 266-A(1)(d):<br><br><blockquote>Rape under paragraph 3 of this article is termed <i>statutory rape</i> as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape. What the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman <i>below twelve (12) years old</i>. Thus, force, intimidation and physical evidence of injury are not relevant considerations; the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place.&nbsp; The law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years; the child’s consent is immaterial because of her presumed incapacity to discern good from evil. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA in the afternoon of September 12, 2004, when AAA was just nine years old.<br><br>In her Sworn Statement dated September 15, 2004 to Senior Police Officer 4 Eloisa B. Ocava, AAA narrated how accused-appellant had been raping her since 2003, and described in great detail the last rape that occurred on September 12, 2004.<br><br>AAA subsequently took the witness stand during trial and personally recounted her ordeal in accused-appellant’s hands, particularly, the last incident of rape on September 12, 2004.&nbsp; AAA, who was already starting to feel pregnant, finally gained courage soon after the last rape to tell her mother’s friend about what accused-appellant was doing to her.<br><br>It is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, because when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Herein, AAA’s testimony is not only consistent and straightforward, but is further corroborated by other evidence.&nbsp; According to AAA’s birth certificate, she was born on October 20, 1994, thus, establishing that she was nine years old on September 12, 2004.&nbsp; Dr. Camerino, after physical examination of AAA on September 15, 2004, found that AAA had “previous[ly] healed lacerations” in her vagina and that AAA’s “uterus [was] enlarged to [four (4)] months age of gestation.”&nbsp; AAA’s pregnancy test, also conducted on September 15, 2004, confirmed that she was pregnant.&nbsp; AAA later gave birth to a son on January 16, 2005, which was evidenced by her son’s birth certificate.<br><br>Accused-appellant challenged AAA’s credibility by pointing out that AAA often giggled and smiled while testifying before the trial court; AAA&nbsp; testified during direct examination that she was raped by accused-appellant on September 12, 2004 at home but later inconsistently declared during cross-examination that the rape took place in a room at accused-appellant’s place of work;&nbsp; Dr. Camerino, who examined AAA on September 15, 2004, only three days after AAA’s purported rape on September 12, 2004, did not find fresh lacerations on AAA’s vagina, hence, indicating that AAA had no recent sexual activity; and AAA could not have been just nine years old at the time of her alleged raped as pre-teen ovulation was rare and as Dr. Camerino himself observed, AAA already had the built of an adolescent woman.&nbsp; Accused-appellant further denied raping AAA and insisted that he was at some other place at the time AAA was supposedly raped.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s arguments were already considered and thoroughly addressed by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; As the appellate court appropriately held:<br><br><blockquote>Time-honored is the doctrine that the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of a witness, is entitled to great weight on appeal.&nbsp; The reason therefor is that the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing first-hand the deportment of the witnesses while testifying and is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions on the basis thereof.<br><br>AAA’s seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as smiling while narrating in open court about the rape, was properly explained by her, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Q (PROS. GARCIA):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, a while ago, while you were testifying you kept smiling, could you please tell this Hon. Court why you were smiling?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just trying to be brave, sir.</blockquote>Moreover, We consider the alleged inconsistency on the place where the crime happened as a minor inconsistency which should generally be given liberal appreciation considering that the place of the commission of the crime in rape cases is after all not an essential element thereof.&nbsp; What is decisive is that [accused-appellant’s] commission of the crime charged has been sufficiently proved.<br><br>The alleged inconsistency is also understandable considering that AAA was only ten (10) years old at the time she testified before the trial court.&nbsp; Courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim narrates the details of a harrowing experience like rape.&nbsp; Such inconsistencies on minor details are in fact badges of truth, candidness and the fact that the witness is unrehearsed.&nbsp; These discrepancies as to minor matters, irrelevant to the elements of the crime, cannot thus be considered a ground for acquittal.&nbsp; In this case, the alleged inconsistency in AAA’s testimony regarding the exact place of the commission of rape does not make her otherwise straightforward and coherent testimony on material points, less worthy of belief.<br><br>Significantly also, AAA’s testimony is supported by the medical evidence on record, which showed that she had scars in her hymen and was thus in a non-virgin state.&nbsp; That no fresh lacerations were found in her hymen is no indication that she was not raped on 12 September 2004.&nbsp; Contrary to [accused-appellant’s] contention, the old lacerations on AAA’s hymen confirm and strengthen her allegation that she had been repeatedly raped by [accused-appellant] not only on 12 September 2004, but even before.&nbsp; As the victim was no longer a virgin when she was raped on 12 September 2004, no new injury on her hymen could be expected.&nbsp; It is settled that healed lacerations do not negate rape.&nbsp; In fact, lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best physical evidence of defloration.<br><br>On the issue of AAA’s age, We quote the Supreme Court’s consistent ruling that “<i>in this era of modernism and rapid growth, the victim’s mere physical appearance is not enough to gauge her exact age</i>.”&nbsp; Hence, the best evidence to prove AAA’s age is her Certificate of Live Birth, which indicates that she was born on 20 October 2004 and was thus nine (9) years of age on 12 September 2004, when she was raped by [accused-appellant].<br><br>In <i>People v. Prun</i>a, the Supreme Court stated that in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance, “<i>[t]he best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.</i>”<br><br>A certificate of live birth is a public document that consists of entries (regarding the facts of birth) in public records (Civil Registry) made in the performance of a duty by a public officer (Civil Registrar).<br><br>As such, it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the fact of one’s birth and can only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; Obviously in this case, no such controverting evidence was adduced by the defense to question AAA’s Certificate of Live Birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In contrast, accused-appellant’s bare denial and uncorroborated alibi deserve scant consideration.&nbsp; The defense of alibi should be considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it is easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Denial and alibi constitute self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration of a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; AAA’s positive testimony that she was sexually ravished by accused-appellant, coupled with the appalling fact that she got pregnant at her tender age, certainly deserve more credence and greater evidentiary weight than that of accused-appellant’s uncorroborated defenses.<br><br>Moreover, for alibi to prosper, accused-appellant must not only prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed, he must also convincingly demonstrate the physical impossibility of his presence at the locus criminis at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, however, accused-appellant himself admitted that his place of work was less than a kilometer or a mere 30-minute walk away from his house, where AAA was raped.&nbsp; Given the short distance between these two places, it was not physically impossible for accused-appellant, in the afternoon of September 12, 2004, to have left his work for a short while to go home and commit the rape of AAA.<br><br>The sentence of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed upon accused-appellant by the RTC, affirmed by Court of Appeals, for the crime of statutory rape, without any aggravating or qualifying circumstance, is in accordance with Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.&nbsp; The awards of civil indemnity and moral damages in favor of AAA by the trial and appellate courts, in the amounts of P50,000.00 each, are also proper.&nbsp; However, the Court increases the amount of exemplary damages awarded to AAA from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00, in line with the latest jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated March 31, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 03772 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>, increasing the award of exemplary damages to P30,000.00 and ordering accused-appellant to pay the private offended party interest on all damages awarded at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Bersamin, Villarama, Jr., </i>and <i>Reyes, JJ</i>. concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 2-13; penned by Associate Justice Ricardo R.
