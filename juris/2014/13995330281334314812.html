				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A Judge who fails to decide cases and related matters within the periods prescribed by law is guilty of gross inefficiency, and may be punished with dismissal from the service even for the first offense, unless he has been meanwhile separated from the service, in which instance he may be imposed the stiffest of fines. For falsely rendering certificates of service to the effect that he did not have any unresolved cases and matters pending in his court's docket, he is also guilty of dishonesty, another act of gross misconduct, for which he should be sanctioned with dismissal from the service even for the first offense. But his intervening separation from the service leaves the only proper penalty to be the forfeiture of his entire retirement benefits, except his earned leaves.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br><center><b>A.M. No. 07-9-454-RTC</b><br></center><br>From February 21 to February 24, 2005, an Audit Team dispatched by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) conducted a judicial audit of Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court in Cagayan de Oro City, presided by respondent Judge Gregorio D. Pantanosas, Jr. The report of the Audit Team revealed that as of the audit dates, Branch 20 had a total caseload of 599 cases consisting of256 criminal cases and 343 civil cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Of the 256 criminal cases, the Audit Team found that: (<i>a</i>) Branch 20 failed to take any action on three criminal cases from the time of their filing; (<i>b</i>) no further action or setting was taken in 41 criminal cases; (<i>c</i>) 14 criminal cases had pending incidents already submitted for resolution but remained unresolved despite the lapse of the reglementary period to resolve; and (<i>d</i>) 28 criminal cases submitted for decision remained unresolved despite the lapse of the reglementary period to decide.<br><br>As to the 343 civil cases, the Audit Team uncovered that: (<i>a</i>) no action was taken on 11 cases from the time of their filing; (<i>b</i>) no further action or setting was taken in 54 cases for a considerable length of time; (<i>c</i>) 75 cases had pending incidents that remained unresolved despite the lapse of the reglementary period to resolve; and (<i>d</i>) 56 cases submitted for decision remained unresolved despite the lapse of the reglementary period to decide.<br><br>The Audit Team discovered that: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Branch 20 ordered the forfeiture of the bonds of the accused in 10 criminal cases; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) the latest Monthly Report of Cases submitted by Branch 20 to the Court Management Office was that for January 2004; despite reminders, the Presiding Judge failed to submit the required monthly reports; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) no certificates of arraignment were attached to the records of criminal cases where the accused had entered a plea; (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) the criminal and civil docket books were not updated; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) the stenographic notes in Criminal Case No. 4819 entitled <i>People v. Obita, et al.</i>, an appealed case for theft, were not transcribed because of the demise of court stenographer Josephine Casino and the retirement of court stenographer Valerio Piscos of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court in Jasaan.<br><br>Based on the audit report, then Deputy Court Administrator Christopher Lock issued a memorandum directing Judge Pantanosas, Jr. to:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><blockquote>1. Take appropriate action on the cases without any action taken from the time of their filing, as well as those cases without further setting or action for a considerable length of time;<br><br>2.

He pleaded for leniency for his delayed resolution of cases due to his heavy caseload.<br><br>Atty. Macabinlar also submitted his compliance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> in which he stated that the delay in the submission of monthly reports of cases had been caused by the difficulty of using the new form; and that he had failed to remind the clerks-in-charge of the civil and criminal cases to prepare their reports on time due to the volume of work as well as due to inadvertence. He apologized for the delay and reported the latest action of the court regarding the criminal cases with forfeited bonds.<br><br>Hernandez and Astique did not submit any compliance.<br><br>The OCA did not consider the foregoing explanations as sufficient compliance with its directives.

A careful reading of his certificates of service<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> for the months of January 2007 to March 2007, and from February 2006 to December 2006 revealed that he stated therein that he had only around 37 to 41 undecided cases, when he was aware that he had 60 undecided cases during such periods of time because he had failed to fully comply with the memoranda of the OCA dated April 4, 2005, May 2, 2006 and February 20, 2007.<br><br>The OCA concluded that pursuant to Administrative Circular No. 04-2004 dated February 4, 2004, the monthly reports of cases must be filed with or sent by registered mail to the Supreme Court on or before the 10<sup>th</sup> calendar day of the succeeding month; that Atty. Macabinlar had been consistently late in the submission of monthly reports of cases; that his lapses in the timely submission of monthly reports of cases and his failure to fully implement the writs of execution of forfeited bonds in some criminal cases had amounted to inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of his official duties; that under Civil Service Rules, inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duty was a grave offense with an imposable penalty of suspension of six months and one day to one year for the first offense, and dismissal from the service for the second offense.<br><br>However, the OCA considered Atty. Macabinlar's partial compliance with the directives to him, and the fact that this was his first offense as mitigating; and recommended as penalty his suspension from office for three months with a stern warning that a repetition of similar acts would be severely dealt with.<br><br>Due to the Second Audit Team's finding that he had not submitted the Commissioner's Reports in 39 cases where he had received evidence <i>ex-parte</i> as commissioner (which by then had already been reduced to 21 cases), Atty. Macabinlar should be required to submit the reports and to explain why he had not submitted them despite the lapse of a considerable time. In the meantime that he was preparing and completing the submission of all he Commissioner's Reports, he should not be deputized as commissioner to receive evidence <i>ex parte</i>.<br><br><center><b>The OCA's Modified Recommendation</b><br></center><br>On April 11, 2008, Court Administrator ElepaÃ±o modified the OCA's recommendations, as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Judge Gregorio G. Pantanosas, Jr. former Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Cagayan De Oro City be found Guilty of gross inefficiency and gross misconduct and that he be FINED an amount equivalent to his salary and benefits (including SAJJ, RATA, JDF and Extraordinary Allowance) for six (6) months to be deducted from the retirement benefits due him to serve as a strong deterrent to judges who may wish to thwart the coercive powers of this Court by filing a certificate of candidacy; and<br><br></li><li>Atty. Taumaturgo U. Macabinlar, Branch Clerk of Court, RTC, Branch 20, Cagayan de Oro City, be found GUILTY of inefficiency and incompetence and FINED the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely. It is likewise recommended that he be RELIEVED from being appointed as Commissioner to receive <i>ex parte</i> evidence until the submission of Comissioner's Report in all cases where he was deputized as such.<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Ruling</b><br></div><br>The Court agrees with the findings of the OCA.<br><br><center><b>Liability of Judge Pantanosas, Jr.</b><br></center><br>The speedy disposition of cases in our courts is a primary aim of the Judiciary, so that the ends of justice may not be compromised and the Judiciary will be true to its commitment to provide litigants their constitutional right to a speedy trial and a speedy disposition of their cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The <i>Code of Judicial Conduct</i> mandates that a judge administers justice impartially and without delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Under the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> a judge is obliged to perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> To comply with his obligation, he must display such interest in his office which stops not at the minimum of the day's labors fixed by law, and which ceases not at the expiration of official seasons, but which proceeds diligently on holidays and by artificial light and even into vacation periods. Only thereby can he do his part in the great work of speeding up the administration of justice and rehabilitating the Judiciary in the estimation of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Any unjustified failure to decide a case within the reglementary period constitutes gross inefficiency that deserves the imposition of the proper administrative sanctions. Hence, decision-making is his primordial and most important duty as a member of the Bench.<br><br>Based on the audit reports of the OCA's Audit Teams, Judge Pantanosas, Jr. did not live up to these tenets. Accordingly, he was administratively liable for gross inefficiency.<br><br>Yet, Judge Pantanosas, Jr. seeks to avoid liability by attributing part of the delay in deciding the pending cases to the absence of the transcripts of stenographic notes.<br><br>The excuse interposed by Judge Pantanosas, Jr. is unacceptable. The Court has ruled in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Aquino</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that the incompleteness of the transcripts of stenographic notes was not a valid reason for not deciding cases within the extended period granted by the Court, for, precisely, judges have been instructed to take notes of the salient portions of their hearings, and to proceed in the preparation of their decisions without waiting for the transcripts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> To let judges await the transcription of the stenographic notes before they could render their decisions would cause undue delays because judges could then easily find justifications for failing to comply with the mandatory period to decide cases. Verily, the proper and efficient management of his court is the responsibility of every presiding judge - he alone is directly responsible for the proper discharge of official functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Judge Pantanosas, Jr. could not also cite the incompleteness of the TSNs as an excuse for not deciding the cases inherited from a predecessor judge. This is because it was entirely within his power as the incumbent presiding judge to compel the stenographic reporters concerned to complete their transcripts, or face sanctions. He could have also resorted to other ways of seeing to the reproduction of testimonies should the incompleteness ever prevent the performance of his primary responsibility to resolve the cases. But it is clear to us that he did not exert his best effort towards that end. Consequently, he had no one else to blame but himself.<br><br>Under Rule 140 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, as amended, undue delay in rendering a decision is classified as a less serious charge that carries with it the penalty of suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one nor more than three months, or a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00. However, the offense of Judge Pantanosas, Jr. did not involve only a single but several unrendered decisions. Hence, his offense was a compounded one worthy of the highest sanction.<br><br>We are much dismayed to uncover that in addition to his gross inefficiency, Judge Pantanosas, Jr. was guilty of a grave misconduct pursuant to Section 8, Rule 140 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> by submitting false certificates of service in which he certified that he did not have any unresolved cases and matters pending in his court's docket. Thereby, he defrauded the Government. The certificates of service were not only the means to ensure his paycheck but were also the instruments by which the Court could fulfill the constitutional mandate of the people's right to a speedy disposition of cases. His dishonesty - because it badly reflected on his integrity as a member of the Judiciary and seriously undermined his service to our country and people - merited for him the very high penalty of suspension without pay for a period of six months, similar to what the Court prescribed for a judge who did not timely decide an election protest for eight months and submitted false certificates of service, in addition to being found guilty of habitual absenteeism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>This is not the first time that Judge Pantanosas, Jr. is administratively sanctioned. In <i>Uy v. Judge Pantanosas, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court already declared him guilty of gross inefficiency for the undue delay in the resolution of Civil Case No. 2002-241,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and fined him P10,000.00 with a warning that a repetition of a similar act would be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Given all the circumstances, Judge Pantanosas, Jr. was guilty of two grave offenses of compounded gross inefficiency and dishonesty. With the aggravating circumstance of his having been already severely sanctioned for the similar offense of failure to decide a case within the reglementary period, the highest penalty is warranted. That penalty would be dismissal from the service had he still been in the active service. But the filing on March 29, 2007 of his certificate of candidacy to run for public office automatically deemed him resigned from the service. Accordingly, the Court sanctions him properly by forfeiting all his retirement benefits, except earned leave credits.<br><br><center><b>Liability of Atty. Macabinlar</b><br></center><br>The Court adopts the recommendation of the OCA finding Atty. Macabinlar guilty of gross inefficiency and incompetence. Branch Clerks of Court are officers who perform vital functions in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. Their office is at the core of the adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns. One of their most important responsibilities is to conduct monthly physical inventory of cases. It is also their duty to assist in the proper management of the calendar of the court and in all matters that do not involve discretion or judgment that is the exclusive province of their judges. As such, they are required to be persons of competence, honesty and probity, and are not permitted to be lackadaisical on the job.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>This finding against Atty. Macabinlar serves to underscore the value of a Branch Clerk of Court like him in the organization of the Regional Trial Courts. Atty. Macabinlar did not tender any satisfactory explanation for his consistent failure to promptly submit the monthly report of cases, and for his failure to timely accomplish the Commissioner's Reports in the 39 cases assigned to him for <i>ex parte</i> reception of evidence. He is administratively liable. He ought to recognize that the great responsibility of ensuring that delays in the disposition of cases be kept to a minimum rested not only on the judge but also on him as the Branch Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The modified recommendation by then Court Administrator ElepaÃ±o for the imposition of a P50,000.00 fine is too harsh, however, for it would in effect require Atty. Macabinlar to continue rendering service as the Branch Clerk of Court without compensation until he would have fully paid the fine out of his salary. The fact that the offense was the first for him is a mitigating circumstance in his favor. As such, his suspension of one month without pay, plus a severe warning against a repetition, is sufficient.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court:<br><br>1. <b>FINDS</b> Judge <b>GREGORIO D.
