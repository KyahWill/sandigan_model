Fajardo and PO2 Trambulo.<br><br>P/Insp. Fajardo testified that in the morning of April 1, 1998, a confidential informant went to their office and reported that a certain Donald Vasquez was engaged in illegal drug activity.&nbsp; This alias Don supposedly claimed that he was an employee of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).&nbsp; According to the informant, alias Don promised him a good commission if he (the informant) would present a potential buyer of drugs.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo relayed the information to Police Superintendent (P/Supt.) Pepito Domantay, the commanding officer of their office.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo was then instructed to form a team and conduct a possible buy-bust against alias Don.&nbsp; She formed a team on the same day, which consisted of herself, PO2 Trambulo, PO1 Agravante, PO1 Pedrosa, PO1 Sisteno, and PO1 De la Rosa.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo was the team leader.&nbsp; With the help of the informant, she was able to set up a meeting with alias Don.&nbsp; The meeting was to be held at around 9:00 p.m. on that day at Cindy’s Restaurant located in Welcome Rotonda.&nbsp; She was only supposed to meet alias Don that night but she decided to bring the team along for security reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>At about 9:00 p.m. on even date, P/Insp. Fajardo and her team went to the meeting place with the informant.&nbsp; The members of her team positioned themselves strategically inside the restaurant.&nbsp; The informant introduced P/Insp. Fajardo to alias Don as the buyer of shabu.&nbsp; She asked alias Don if he was indeed an employee of the NBI and he replied in the affirmative.&nbsp; They agreed to close the deal wherein she would buy 250 grams of shabu for P250,000.00.&nbsp; They also agreed to meet the following day at Cindy’s Restaurant around 10:00 to 11:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the evening of April 2, 1998, P/Insp. Fajardo and her team went back to Cindy’s Restaurant.&nbsp; Alias Don was already waiting for her outside the establishment when she arrived.&nbsp; He asked for the money and she replied that she had the money with her.&nbsp; She brought five genuine P500.00 bills, which were inserted on top of five bundles of play money to make it appear that she had P250,000.00 with her.&nbsp; After she showed the money to alias Don, he suggested that they go to a more secure place.&nbsp; They agreed for the sale to take place at around 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. on April 3, 1998 in front of alias Don’s apartment at 765 Valdez St., Sampaloc, Manila.&nbsp; The team proceeded to the Western Police District (WPD) Station along U.N. Avenue for coordination.&nbsp; Afterwards, the team held their final briefing before they proceeded to the target area.&nbsp; They agreed that the pre-arranged signal was for P/Insp. Fajardo to scratch her hair, which would signify that the deal had been consummated and the rest of the team would rush up to the scene.&nbsp; The team then travelled to the address given by alias Don.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>When the team arrived at the target area around 1:15 a.m. on April 3, 1998, the two vehicles they used were parked along the corner of the street.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo and the informant walked towards the apartment of alias Don and stood in front of the apartment gate.&nbsp; Around 1:45 a.m., alias Don came out of the apartment with a male companion.&nbsp; Alias Don demanded to see the money, but P/Insp. Fajardo told him that she wanted to see the drugs first.&nbsp; Alias Don gave her the big brown envelope he was carrying and she checked the contents thereof.&nbsp; Inside she found a plastic sachet, about 10x8 inches in size, which contained white crystalline substance.&nbsp; After checking the contents of the envelope, she assumed that the same was indeed <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; She then gave the buy-bust money to alias Don and scratched her hair to signal the rest of the team to rush to the scene.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo identified herself as a narcotics agent.&nbsp; The two suspects tried to flee but PO2 Trambulo was able to stop them from doing so.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo took custody of the <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; When she asked alias Don if the latter had authority to possess or sell <i>shabu</i>, he replied in the negative.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo put her initials “JSF” on the genuine P500.00 bills below the name of Benigno Aquino.&nbsp; After the arrest of the two suspects, the buy-bust team brought them to the police station.&nbsp; The suspects’ rights were read to them and they were subsequently booked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>P/Insp. Fajardo said that she found out that alias Don was in fact the appellant Donald Vasquez.&nbsp; She learned of his name when he brought out his NBI ID while he was being booked.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo also learned that the name of the appellant’s companion was Reynaldo Siscar, who was also arrested and brought to the police station.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo explained that after she gave the buy-bust money to the appellant, the latter handed the same to Siscar who was present the entire time the sale was being consummated.&nbsp; Upon receiving the buy-bust money placed inside a green plastic bag, Siscar looked at the contents thereof and uttered “<i>okey na to</i>.”&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo marked the drug specimen and brought the same to the Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; She was accompanied there by PO2 Trambulo and PO1 Agravante.&nbsp; She handed over the drug specimen to PO1 Agravante who then turned it over to P/Insp. Taduran, the forensic chemist on duty.&nbsp; The police officers previously weighed the drug specimen.&nbsp; Thereafter, the personnel at the crime laboratory weighed the specimen again.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo and her team waited for the results of the laboratory examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>P/Insp. Fajardo further testified that the six plastic bags of <i>shabu</i> seized during the buy-bust operation were actually contained in a self-sealing plastic envelope placed inside a brown envelope.&nbsp; When the brown envelope was confiscated from the appellant, she put her initials “JSF” therein and signed it.&nbsp; She noticed that there were markings on the envelope that read “DD-93-1303 re Antonio Roxas y Sunga” but she did not bother to check out what they were for or who made them.&nbsp; When she interrogated the appellant about the brown envelope, she found out that the same was submitted as evidence to the NBI Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; She also learned that the appellant worked as a Laboratory Aide at the NBI Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; She identified in court the six plastic sachets of drugs that her team recovered, which sachets she also initialed and signed.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo also stated that after the appellant was arrested, PO2 Trambulo conducted a body search on the two suspects.&nbsp; The search yielded 12 more plastic sachets of drugs from the appellant.&nbsp; The 12 sachets were varied in sizes and were contained in a white envelope.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo placed her initials and signature on the envelope.&nbsp; As to the 12 sachets, the same were initialed by P/Insp. Fajardo and signed by PO2 Trambulo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The testimony of PO2 Trambulo corroborated that of P/Insp. Fajardo’s.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo testified that in the morning of April 1, 1998, a confidential informant reported to them about the illegal drug activities of alias Don.&nbsp; P/Supt. Domantay then tasked P/Insp. Fajardo to form a buy-bust team.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo was able to set up a meeting with alias Don at Cindy’s Restaurant in Welcome Rotonda, Quezon City.&nbsp; At that meeting, PO2 Trambulo saw P/Insp. Fajardo talk to alias Don.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo later told the members of the team that she convinced alias Don that she was a good buyer of <i>shabu</i> and the latter demanded a second meeting to see the money.&nbsp; After the initial meeting, P/Insp. Fajardo briefed P/Supt. Domantay about what happened.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo stated that on April 2, 1998, P/Insp. Fajardo was furnished with five genuine P500.00 bills together with the boodle play money.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo placed her initials in the genuine bills below the name “Benigno Aquino, Jr.”&nbsp; Afterwards, the team left the office.&nbsp; When they arrived at Cindy’s Restaurant past 10:00 p.m., alias Don was waiting outside.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo showed the boodle money to alias Don and after some time, they parted ways.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo later told the team that alias Don decided that the drug deal would take place in front of alias Don’s rented apartment on Valdez St., Sampaloc, Manila.&nbsp; After an hour, the team went to Valdez St. to familiarize themselves with the area.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the WPD station to coordinate their operation.&nbsp; Thereafter, P/Insp. Fajardo conducted a final briefing wherein PO2 Trambulo was designated as the immediate back-up arresting officer.&nbsp; The agreed pre-arranged signal was for P/Insp. Fajardo to scratch her hair to indicate the consummation of the deal.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo was to signal the same to the other members of the team.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The buy-bust team went to the target area at around 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. on April 3, 1998.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo and the informant walked towards the direction of alias Don’s apartment, while PO2 Trambulo positioned himself near a parked jeepney about 15 to 20 meters from the apartment gate.&nbsp; The rest of the team parked their vehicles at the street perpendicular to Valdez St.&nbsp; Later, alias Don went out of the gate with another person.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo saw alias Don gesturing to P/Insp. Fajardo as if asking for something but P/Insp. Fajardo gestured that she wanted to see something first.&nbsp; Alias Don handed P/Insp. Fajardo a big brown envelope, which the latter opened.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo then handed to alias Don a green plastic bag containing the buy-bust money and gave the pre-arranged signal.&nbsp; When PO2 Trambulo saw this, he immediately summoned the rest of the team and rushed to the suspects.&nbsp; He was able to recover the buy-bust money from alias Don’s male companion.&nbsp; Upon frisking alias Don, PO2 Trambulo retrieved 12 pieces of plastic sachets of suspected drugs.&nbsp; The same were placed inside a white envelope that was tucked inside alias Don’s waist.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo marked each of the 12 sachets with his initials “CVT” and the date.&nbsp; The police officers then informed the suspects of their rights and they proceeded to the police headquarters in Fort Bonifacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As regards the brown envelope that alias Don handed to P/Insp. Fajardo, the latter retained possession thereof.&nbsp; The envelope contained six pieces of plastic bags of white crystalline substance.&nbsp; When they got back to their office, the team reported the progress of their operation to P/Supt. Domantay.&nbsp; The arrested suspects were booked and the required documentations were prepared.&nbsp; Among such documents was the Request for Laboratory Examination of the drug specimens seized.&nbsp; PO2 Trambulo said that he was the one who brought the said request to the PNP Crime Laboratory, along with the drug specimens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>P/Insp. Marilyn Dequito, the forensic chemist, testified on the results of her examination of the drug specimens seized in this case.&nbsp; She explained that P/Insp. Macario Taduran, Jr. initially examined the drug specimens but the latter was already assigned to another office.&nbsp; The results of the examination of P/Insp. Taduran were laid down in Physical Science Report No. D-1071-98.&nbsp; P/Insp. Dequito first studied the data contained in Physical Science Report No. D-1071-98 and retrieved the same from their office.&nbsp; She entered that fact in their logbook RD-17-98.&nbsp; She then weighed the drug specimens and examined the white crystalline substance from each of the plastic sachets.&nbsp; She examined first the specimens marked as “A-1,” “A-2,” “A-3,” “A-4,” “A-5” and “A-6.”&nbsp; P/Insp. Dequito’s examination revealed that the white crystalline substances were positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; She also examined the contents of 12 heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets that also contained crystalline substances.&nbsp; The 12 plastic sachets were marked “B-1” to “B-12.”&nbsp; The white crystalline powder inside the 12 plastic sachets also tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.&nbsp; P/Insp. Dequito’s findings were contained in Physical Science Report No. RD-17-98.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The prosecution, thereafter, adduced the following object and documentary evidence: (1) photocopies of the five original P500.00 bills<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> used as buy-bust money (Exhibits A-E); (2) Request for Laboratory Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated April 3, 1998 (Exhibit F); (3) Initial Laboratory Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated April 3, 1998, stating that the specimen submitted for examination tested positive for <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride</i> (Exhibit G); (4) Court Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated September 2, 1998 (Exhibit H); (5) Physical Sciences Report No. D-1071-98<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated April 3, 1998 (Exhibit I); (6) Drug specimens A-1 to A-6 (Exhibits J-O); (7) Big brown envelope (Exhibit P); (8) Small white envelope (Exhibit Q); (9) Drug specimens B-1 to B-12 (Exhibits R-CC); (10) Physical Sciences Report No. RD-17-98<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Exhibit DD); (11) Joint Affidavit of Arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Exhibit EE); (12) Play money (Exhibit FF); (13) Booking Sheet and Arrest Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Exhibit GG); (14) Request for Medical Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Exhibit HH); (15) Medico Legal Slip<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of Donald Vasquez (Exhibit II); and (16) Medico Legal Slip<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of Reynaldo Siscar (Exhibit JJ).<br><br><i><b><u>The Defense’s Case</u></b></i><br><br>As expected, the defense belied the prosecution’s version of events.&nbsp; The appellant’s brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> before the Court of Appeals provides a concise summary of the defense’s counter-statement of facts.&nbsp; According to the defense:<br><br><blockquote><b>Donald Vasquez</b> was a regular employee of the NBI, working as a Laboratory Aide II at the NBI Forensics Chemistry Division.&nbsp; His duties at the time included being a subpoena clerk, receiving chemistry cases as well as requests from different police agencies to have their specimens examined by the chemist.&nbsp; He also rendered day and night duties, and during regular office hours and in the absence of the laboratory technician, he would weigh the specimens.&nbsp; As subpoena clerk, he would receive subpoenas from the trial courts.&nbsp; When there is no chemist, he would get a Special Order to testify, or bring the drug specimens, to the courts.<br><br>On 1 April 1998, Donald Vasquez took his examination in Managerial Statistics between 6:00 to 9:00 o’clock p.m.&nbsp; Thereafter, he took a jeepney and alighted at Stop and Shop at Quiapo.&nbsp; From there, he took a tricycle to his house, arriving at 9:45 o’clock that evening, where he saw Reynaldo Siscar and Sonny San Diego, the latter a confidential informant of the narcotics agents.<br><br>On 3 April 1998, at 1:45 o’clock in the morning, Donald’s household help, <b>Anatolia Caredo</b>, who had just arrived from Antipolo that time, was eating while Donald was asleep.&nbsp; She heard a knock on the door.&nbsp; Reynaldo Siscar opened the door and thereafter two (2) men entered, poking guns at Reynaldo.&nbsp; They were followed by three (3) others.&nbsp; The door to Donald’s room was kicked down and they entered his room.&nbsp; Donald, hearing noise, woke up to see P./Insp. Fajardo pointing a gun at him.&nbsp; He saw that there were six (6) policemen searching his room, picking up what they could get.&nbsp; One of them opened a cabinet and got drug specimens in [Donald’s] possession in relation to his work as a laboratory aide.&nbsp; The drugs came from two (2) cases and marked as DD-93-1303 owned by Antonio Roxas, and DD-96-5392 owned by SPO4 Emiliano Anonas.&nbsp; The drug specimen contained in the envelope marked as DD-93-1303 was intended for presentation on 3 April 1998.&nbsp; Aside from the drug specimens, the policemen also took his jewelry, a VHS player, and his wallet containing P2,530.00.<br><br><b>Angelina Arejado</b>, Donald’s neighbor, witnessed the policemen entering the apartment and apprehending Donald and Reynaldo from the apartment terrace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>The defense then offered the following evidence: (1) NBI Disposition Form<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated April 3, 1998 (Exhibit 1); (2) Sworn Statement of Idabel Bernabe Pagulayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Exhibit 2); (3) Photocopy of the buy-bust money<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Exhibit 3); (4) List of Hearings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> attended by Donald Vasquez (Exhibit 4); (5) Authorization Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> prepared by Acting Deputy Director Arturo A.

Figueras, Acting Deputy Director, Technical Services of the NBI to testify and identify the Letter issued by the said Acting Deputy Director in order to corroborate and strengthen his testimony that he was indeed authorized to keep in his custody the said shabu to be presented or turned over to the Court as evidence, and he should have filed the proper charges against those police officers who were responsible for such act.&nbsp; But the accused did not even bother to do the same.&nbsp; Further, the pieces of evidence (Disposition Form, Affidavit of [Idabel] Pagulayan and Letter dated March 27, 1998 issued by Acting Deputy Director) presented by the accused in Court could not be given weight and credence considering that the said persons were not presented in Court to identify the said documents and that the prosecution has no opportunity to cross-examine the same, thus, it has no probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court, thus, decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Crim.

Fajardo on the conduct of the buy-bust operation was found to be clear and categorical.&nbsp; As the appellant failed to adduce any evidence that tended to prove any ill motive on the part of the police officers to falsely charge the appellant, the Court of Appeals held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties on the part of the police officers had not been controverted in this case.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals decision stated:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The August 6, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 41 of the City of Manila in Criminal Cases No. 98-164174-75, finding appellant Donald Vasquez y Sandigan guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crimes of Violation of Section 15 and Section 16, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425 is <b>AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION</b> that in Criminal Case No. 98-164175, appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to two years, four months and one day of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium period, as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b></i><br><br>The appellant appealed his case to this Court to once again impugn his conviction on two grounds: (1) the purported illegality of the search and the ensuing arrest done by the police officers and (2) his supposed authority to possess the illegal drugs seized from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; He argues that the police officers did not have a search warrant or a warrant of arrest at the time he was arrested.&nbsp; This occurred despite the fact that the police officers allegedly had ample time to secure a warrant of arrest against him.&nbsp; Inasmuch as his arrest was illegal, the appellant avers that the evidence obtained as a result thereof was inadmissible in court.&nbsp; As the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime was rendered inadmissible, the appellant posits that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Appellant further insists that he was able to prove that he was authorized to keep the drug specimens in his custody, given that he was an employee of the NBI Forensic Chemistry Laboratory who was tasked with the duty to bring drug specimens in court.<br><br>After an assiduous review of the evidence adduced by both parties to this case, we resolve to deny this appeal.<br><br>At the outset, the Court rules that the appellant can no longer assail the validity of his arrest.&nbsp; We reiterated in <i>People v. Tampis</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> that “[a]ny objection, defect or irregularity attending an arrest must be made before the accused enters his plea on arraignment.&nbsp; Having failed to move for the quashing of the information against them before their arraignment, appellants are now estopped from questioning the legality of their arrest.&nbsp; Any irregularity was cured upon their voluntary submission to the trial court’s jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that the appellant was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> of selling illegal drugs to an undercover police officer in a buy-bust operation.&nbsp; His arrest, thus, falls within the ambit of Section 5(a), Rule 113<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure when an arrest made without warrant is deemed lawful.<br><br>Having established the validity of the warrantless arrest in this case, the Court holds that the warrantless seizure of the illegal drugs from the appellant is likewise valid.&nbsp; We held in <i>People v. Cabugata</i>n<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>This interdiction against warrantless searches and seizures, however, is not absolute and such warrantless searches and seizures have long been deemed permissible by jurisprudence in instances of (1) search of moving vehicles, (2) seizure in plain view, (3) customs searches, (4) waiver or consented searches, (5) stop and frisk situations (Terry search), and search incidental to a lawful arrest. The last includes a valid warrantless arrest, for, while as a rule, an arrest is considered legitimate [if] effected with a valid warrant of arrest, the Rules of Court recognize permissible warrantless arrest, to wit: (1) arrest in flagrante delicto, (2) arrest effected in hot pursuit, and (3) arrest of escaped prisoners. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>Thus, the appellant cannot seek exculpation by invoking belatedly the invalidity of his arrest and the subsequent search upon his person.<br><br>We now rule on the substantive matters.<br><br>To secure a conviction for the crime of illegal sale of regulated or prohibited drugs, the following elements should be satisfactorily proven: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; As held in <i>People v.

Fajardo and PO2 Trambulo established that a buy-bust operation was legitimately carried out in the wee hours of April 3, 1998 to entrap the appellant.&nbsp; P/Insp. Fajardo, the poseur-buyer, positively identified the appellant as the one who sold to her six plastic bags of <i>shabu</i> that were contained in a big brown envelope for the price of P250,000.00.&nbsp; She likewise identified the six plastic bags of <i>shabu</i>, which contained the markings she placed thereon after the same were seized from the appellant.&nbsp; When subjected to laboratory examination, the white crystalline powder contained in the plastic bags tested positive for <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; We find that P/Insp. Fajardo’s testimony on the events that transpired during the conduct of the buy-bust operation was detailed and straightforward.&nbsp; She was also consistent and unwavering in her narration even in the face of the opposing counsel’s cross-examination.<br><br>Apart from her description of the events that led to the exchange of the drug specimens seized and the buy-bust money, P/Insp. Fajardo further testified as to the recovery from the appellant of another 12 pieces of plastic sachets of<i> shabu</i>.&nbsp; After the latter was arrested, P/Insp. Fajardo stated that PO2 Trambulo conducted a body search on the appellant.&nbsp; This search resulted to the confiscation of 12 more plastic sachets, the contents of which also tested positive for <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; The testimony of P/Insp. Fajardo was amply corroborated by PO2 Trambulo, whose own account dovetailed the former’s narration of events.&nbsp; Both police officers also identified in court the twelve plastic sachets of<i> shabu</i> that were confiscated from the appellant.<br><br>In <i>People v. Ting Uy,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court explains that “credence shall be given to the narration of the incident by prosecution witnesses especially so when they are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there be evidence to the contrary.”&nbsp; In the instant case, the appellant failed to ascribe, much less satisfactorily prove, any improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses as to why they would falsely incriminate him.&nbsp; The appellant himself even testified that, not only did he not have any misunderstanding with P/Insp. Fajardo and PO2 Trambulo prior to his arrest, he in fact did not know them at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; In the absence of evidence of such ill motive, none is presumed to exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The records of this case are also silent as to any measures undertaken by the appellant to criminally or administratively charge the police officers herein for falsely framing him up for selling and possessing illegal drugs.&nbsp; Such a move would not have been a daunting task for the appellant under the circumstances.&nbsp; Being a regular employee of the NBI, the appellant could have easily sought the help of his immediate supervisors and/or the chief of his office to extricate him from his predicament.&nbsp; Instead, what the appellant offered in evidence were mere photocopies of documents that supposedly showed that he was authorized to keep drug specimens in his custody.&nbsp; That the original documents and the testimonies of the signatories thereof were not at all presented in court did nothing to help the appellant’s case. To the mind of the Court, the evidence offered by the appellant failed to persuade amid the positive and categorical testimonies of the arresting officers that the appellant was caught red-handed selling and possessing a considerable amount of prohibited drugs on the night of the buy-bust operation.<br><br>It is apropos to reiterate here that where there is no showing that the trial court overlooked or misinterpreted some material facts or that it gravely abused its discretion, the Court will not disturb the trial court’s assessment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses since the RTC was in a better position to assess and weigh the evidence presented during trial.&nbsp; Settled too is the rule that the factual findings of the appellate court sustaining those of the trial court are binding on this Court, unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness or palpable error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the foregoing, the Court is convinced that the prosecution was able to establish the guilt of the appellant of the crimes charged.<br><br><i><b><u>The Penalties</u></b></i><br><br>Anent the proper imposable penalties, Section 15 and Section 16, Article III, in relation to Section 20(3) of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, state:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 15</b>. <i>Sale, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Transportation and Distribution of Regulated Drugs.</i> - The penalty of <b><i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos</b> shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any regulated drug.<br><br>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20 of this Act to the contrary, if the victim of the offense is a minor, or should a regulated drug involved in any offense under this Section be the proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein provided shall be imposed.<br><br>SEC. 16. <i>Possession or Use of Regulated Drugs</i>. - The penalty of <b><i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos</b> shall be imposed upon any person who shall possess or use any regulated drug without the corresponding license or prescription, subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof.<br><br><b>SEC. 20.</b> <i>Application of Penalties, Confiscation and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or Instruments of the Crime</i>. - The penalties for offenses under Sections 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following quantities:<br><br>1.&nbsp;

(Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>In Criminal Case No. 98-164174 involving the crime of illegal sale of regulated drugs, the appellant was found to have sold to the poseur-buyer in this case a total of 247.98 grams of <i>shabu</i>, which amount is more than the minimum of 200 grams required by the law for the imposition of either <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or, if there be aggravating circumstances, the death penalty.<br><br>Pertinently, Article 63<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code mandates that when the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties and there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the lesser penalty shall be applied.&nbsp; Thus, in this case, considering that no mitigating or aggravating circumstances attended the appellant’s violation of Section 15, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court’s imposition of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; The P5,000,000.00 fine imposed by the RTC on the appellant is also in accord with Section 15, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended.<br><br>As to the charge of illegal possession of regulated drugs in Criminal Case No. 98-164175, the Court of Appeals properly invoked our ruling in <i>People v.
