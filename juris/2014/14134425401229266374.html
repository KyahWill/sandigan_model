Worse, official receipts were cancelled to conceal the unreported collections.

He pleaded for compassionate justice and humanitarian consideration citing “humanely error in discretion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He likewise informed the OCA that he already restituted the shortages totaling P796,841.00.<br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated June 8, 2006, the OCA adopted the findings of the audit team and made its recommendation. In the Court’s Resolution of August 14, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court approved the recommendation of the OCA, and resolved to:<br><br><blockquote>1.

He further informed the OCA that he had assumed office as Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC )Judge of Calubian-San Isidro, Leyte on December 29, 2006, but had yet to receive his initial salary for lack of clearance from the Financial Management Office. He prayed that the administrative case against him be considered closed and terminated.<br><br>In its Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated November 19, 2007, the Court took note of the said letter and modified the Court’s Resolution, dated August 14, 2006, by deleting the directive to file criminal charges against him.<br><br>In its Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated August 22, 2008, the OCA revealed that the amounts of P2,505.00 and P20.00 returned by Melchor were not the only shortages that he failed to remit on time. As previously illustrated in the table, he likewise incurred shortages in the collection for the JDF in the amount of P40,873.00, which was restituted only on March 14, 2006; SAJF for the amount of P99,326.80 and returned only on March 16, 2006; and FF collections totaling P796,841.00 that was restituted on various dates, the latest being on March 24, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated September 15, 2008, the Court denied Melchor’s request for the release of his initial salary and other benefits as Presiding Judge of MCTC, Calubian-San Isidro, Leyte.<br><br>In its Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated February 24, 2012, the OCA held that although the shortages were eventually restituted as reflected in the deposit slips presented to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, it should be not disregarded that Melchor violated various court circulars. The OCA likewise opined that Melchor’s promotion as a judge should not be taken to mean that the infractions he committed while in the service as Clerk of Court were forgotten. Thus, the OCA recommended:<br><br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is respectfully recommended that: (a) Judge Mario N. Melchor, Jr., former Clerk of Court VI, RTC, Branch 16, Naval, Biliran, be found GUILTY of GROSS NEGLECT OF DUTY, GROSS DISHONESTY and GROSS MISCONDUCT; and (b) Judge Mario N. Melchor, Jr., be DISMISSED from the service effective immediately, with FORFEITURE of all retirements benefits due him except payment of his accrued leave credits, if any, with prejudice to reemployment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities including government-owned and controlled corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Court’s Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>After careful examination of the records of this case, the Court finds the recommendation of the OCA to be well-taken.<br><br>By his own admission, Melchor knowingly used the court funds in his custody to defray the hospitalization expenses of his child. Regrettably though, personal problems or even medical emergencies in the family cannot justify acts of using the judiciary funds held by an accountable officer of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As Clerk of Court, Melchor was entrusted with delicate functions in the collection of legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> He acted as cashier and disbursement officer of the court; and was tasked to collect and receive all monies paid as legal fees, deposits, fines and dues, and controls the disbursement of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> He was designated as custodian of the court’s funds and revenues, records, properties and premises, and should be liable for any loss or shortage thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Administrative Circular No. 3-2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> equally requires that the aggregate total of the deposit slips for any particular month should always be equal to, and tally with, the total collections for that month as reflected in the Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits and Cash Book. Evidently, the accounting of the total collections and remittances did not tally in this case.<br><br>SC Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93, as incorporated into the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, likewise provide the guidelines for the accounting of court funds. All fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank. In SC Circular No. 5-93, the Land Bank was designated as the authorized government depository.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Furthermore, Section B(4) of Circular No. 50-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> directs that “all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited within twenty four (24) hours by the Clerk of court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with the Land Bank of the Philippines, in the name of the court as instructed in Circular No. 13-92.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Court personnel tasked with collections of court funds, such as clerk of court and cash clerks, should deposit immediately with the authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected. Being the custodian of court funds and revenues, it was Melchor’s primary responsibility to immediately deposit the funds received by his office with the Land Bank and not to keep the same in his custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>By failing to properly remit the cash collections constituting public funds, Melchor violated the trust reposed in him as the disbursement officer of the Judiciary. Delayed remittance of cash collections constitutes gross neglect of duty because this omission deprives the court of interest that could have been earned if the amounts were deposited in the authorized depository bank. It should be stressed that clerks of court are required by SC Circular No. 13-92 to withdraw interest earned on deposits, and to remit the same to the account of the JDF within two (2) weeks after the end of each quarter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Delay in the remittance of court funds in the period required casts a serious doubt on the court employee’s trustworthiness and integrity. As held <i>In Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao Del Norte</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and<i> Office of the Court Administrator v. Recio,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds is tantamount to gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br>The audit team likewise uncovered that the cash shortages in the collection of various court funds, such as the GF, SGF, JDF, SAJF for the Judiciary Fund, and FF. Although the said shortages were already restituted, his failure to deposit the correct amount upon collection was already prejudicial to the court, it did not earn interest income on the said amount or was not able to otherwise use the said funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thus, even when there is restitution of funds, unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction, and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Moreover, the restitution was only initiated by him after the discovery of the anomalous records of collection under his custody.<br><br>Melchor’s failure to manage and properly document the cash collections allocated for the JDF is likewise a clear violation of Administrative Circular No. 5-93, which mandates that:<br><br><blockquote><center>x x x x</center><br>3. Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge or accountable officers.-The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, or their accountable duly authorized representative designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the Judiciary Development Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefor, <b>maintain a separate cash book properly marked CASH BOOK FOR JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND, deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed, and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections for said Fund.</b><br><br>4. Depositary Bank for the Fund.- The amounts accruing to the Fund shall be deposited for the account of the Judiciary Development Fund, Supreme Court, Manila by the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court in authorized government depository bank or private bank owned or controlled by the Government to be specified by the Chief Justice. The income or interest earned shall likewise form part of the Fund. For this purpose, the depositary bank for Fund shall be the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).<br><br>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>The fact that Melchor tampered with several official receipts of the cash bond collections, even devising a way to further conceal his misdeed, demonstrated a serious depravity on his integrity. It exemplified gross dishonesty, which undermines the public’s faith in courts and in the administration of justice as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly, the said transgressions and Melchor’s blatant violation to comply with the aforementioned Court circulars designed to promote full accountability for public funds does not only amount to gross neglect; it also constitutes grave misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It should be emphasized that the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court requires strict compliance of the rules and regulations of the collection and accounting funds, thus:<br><br><blockquote>2.1.2.4 Sanctions<br><br>Strict observance of the rules and regulations on collection and accounting of funds is hereby enjoined. The Clerks of Court or Officers-in-Charge shall exercise close supervision over their respective duly authorized representatives to ensure strict compliance herewith, and shall be held administratively accountable for failure to do so. <b>Failure to comply with any of these rules and regulations shall mean the withholding of the salaries and allowances of those concerned until compliance thereof is duly effected, pursuant to Sec. 122 of Pres Decree No. 1445 dated June 11, 1978, without prejudice to such further disciplinary action the Court may take against them</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Melchor’s promotion as a judge during the pendency of this case cannot be considered by the Court either as a mitigating or an exculpatory circumstance to excuse him from any administrative liability. A judge is still bound by the same principle enshrined in Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution, which states that a public office is a public trust, and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. The demand for moral uprightness is more pronounced for the members and personnel of the Judiciary who are involved in the dispensation of justice. The conduct of court members and personnel must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum but must also be above suspicion, for any act of impropriety can seriously erode or diminish the people’s confidence in the Judiciary. As frontliners in the administration of justice, they should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, Melchor’s current position in the judiciary will not merit any leniency from the Court.<br><br>In the same vein, the Court does not agree with Melchor’s contention that the withholding of his salary as a judge was already penalty in itself. It was a mere precautionary measure and not in any way a form of penalty as he would still be compensated for actual service rendered.<br><br>From the foregoing, there is no doubt that Melchor is guilty of dishonesty, gross neglect of duty and gross misconduct. Under Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dishonesty, gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct are classified as grave offenses with the corresponding penalty of dismissal for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds respondent Judge Mario N. Melchor, Jr., former Clerk of Court VI, <b>GUILTY of GROSS DISHONESTY, GRAVE MISCONDUCT and GROSS NEGLECT OF DUTY.</b> Accordingly, he is <b>DISMISSED</b> from the service. All his retirement benefits, except accrued leave benefits, are forfeited and he is barred from re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>The Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, is <b>DIRECTED</b> to process and release the withheld salary and other benefits he may be entitled for his service as Municipal Trial Court judge until the promulgation of this decision.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta,
