Gina Benitez (“Benitez”) was caught sleeping with x x x respondent Reynante at the workers’ quarters, in violation of management rules.&nbsp; The couple immediately left their jobs, but returned a year later beseeching petitioners to accept them back.&nbsp; Petitioners took pity on them giving Reynante a job albeit there was no vacancy at that time, and allowing the couple to live in the workers’ quarters.&nbsp; When Reynante’s employment was terminated on 31 January 2000, Benitez went with him voluntarily and left her job.<br><br>Petitioners then claimed that x x x respondents-spouses Evelyn and Anacleto Bastan had a misunderstanding with their co-employees.&nbsp; They decided to leave their posts, despite the management’s pleas for them to stay.<br><br>Still and all, the NLRC remained unperturbed and dismissed the <i>Appeal</i> in the assailed <i>Decision</i> dated 28 December 2007.&nbsp; Petitioners moved for reconsideration thereof but obtained no favorable relief in the challenged <i>Resolution</i> dated 30 March 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i><b>Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission</b></i><br><br>In dismissing the petitioners’ Appeal, the NLRC held in its December 28, 2007 Decision that –<br><br><blockquote>After considering the arguments presented by the respondents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in their memorandum of appeal, it appears that the respondents failed to submit sufficient evidence to compel Us to reverse the findings of the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; There is no substantial proof presented that the money claims were paid to the complainants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The best evidence of such payment is the payroll, whereas in this case, respondents merely allege payment.<br><br>Moreover, respondents indirectly admit that they give less than the statutory benefits to the employees on the ground that the latter were provided facilities computed in the amount of [P]75.00 per day x x x and for advances and transportation expenses x x x.&nbsp; Article 97[f] of the Labor Code provides that wages include the fair and reasonable value of board and lodging or other facilities customarily provided by the employer to the employee.&nbsp; It is also well-settled that in deducting the value of facilities from the employees’ wages, three (3) requirements must first be complied with, to wit: 1) proof must be shown that such facilities are customarily furnished by the trade; 2) the provision of deductible facilities must be voluntarily accepted in writing by the employee; finally, 3) facilities must be charged at fair and reasonable value (Mabeza vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 118506, April 18, 1997).&nbsp; In this case, there is no showing that these requirements were complied with by the respondents before deductions were made from the employees’ wages.&nbsp; Respondents failed to prove that such deductions were voluntarily accepted in writing by the employees and that these were customarily furnished by the trade.&nbsp; As such, deduction [from] the salaries is erroneous.<br><br>Anent the issue of payment of backwages, the same is proper considering that the complainants were terminated without proof that their termination was with just cause and after observance of due process.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of merit, and the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated June 30, 2000 is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the above decision, but the NLRC denied the same via its March 30, 2009 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Respondents went up to the CA via an original Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> questioning the above pronouncements of the NLRC.&nbsp; On November 30, 2010, the CA issued the assailed Decision, decreeing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the <i>Decision</i> dated 28 December 2007 and <i>Resolution</i> dated 30 March 2009 of the National Labor Relations Commission are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that (1) the ruling that private respondents Ma. Gina Benitez and Demetrio Berdin, Jr. were illegally dismissed is VACATED; and (2) the awards of backwages and separation pay to private respondents Ma. Gina Benitez and Demetrio Berdin, Jr. are DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The CA held that contrary to petitioners’ submission in their Petition, there is no proof that herein respondent Joel Ducusin (Ducusin) – who petitioners claimed hatched the plan to harass them through the filing of labor complaints – abandoned his employment.&nbsp; On the contrary, Ducusin’s immediate filing of the labor complaint indicated that he did not abandon his employment; it characterizes him as one who deeply felt wronged by his employer.<br><br>With regard to respondents Ma. Gina Benitez (Benitez) and Charleston A. Reynante, however, the CA believed that based on the evidence, they voluntarily left their jobs in 1998 when they were caught by management having an illicit affair.&nbsp; This showed that they abandoned their employment, which does not entitle Benitez to an award of backwages and separation pay.<br><br>The CA further held that petitioners did not commit illegal dismissal with respect to respondent Demetrio L.

Macalinao</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>With respect to the awards on respondents’ money claims, petitioners maintain that they have paid what is due and owing to the respondents, and that the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA awarded more than what was being claimed. Petitioners direct the Court’s attention to pieces of documentary evidence attached to their Memorandum of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> with the NLRC – consisting of daily time records, cash vouchers, signed receipts for the payment of 13th month pay, SSS records, releases and quitclaims, and computation of monetary claims<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> – supposedly indicating that they have settled their pecuniary obligations to respondents.&nbsp; Petitioners claim that the CA failed to appreciate such evidence, which led the appellate court to an erroneous conclusion.<br><br>Petitioners thus pray for the reversal of the assailed dispositions, as well as a declaration that Ducusin was legally terminated and the deletion of the monetary awards in favor of respondents.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> respondents simply point out that petitioners do not present valid reasons that would warrant a reversal; that petitioners have not sufficiently shown that indeed, Ducusin abandoned his job; and that the CA is correct in finding that petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proving that respondents have been paid their monetary claims.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court affirms.<br><br>The petitioners would have this Court resolve issues which require a re-evaluation of the evidence; issues of fact relating to the dismissal of their employees – respondent Ducusin particularly – and the computation of monetary claims, which have been passed upon by the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA.<br><br>What must be realized, however, is that this Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; “[T]he jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases brought before it from the CA via Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is generally limited to reviewing errors of law.&nbsp; This Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; In the exercise of its power of review, the findings of fact of the CA are conclusive and binding and consequently, it is not our function to analyze or weigh evidence all over again.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; This principle applies with greater force in labor cases, where this Court has consistently held that findings of fact of the NLRC are accorded great respect and even finality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> especially if they coincide with those of the Labor Arbiter and are supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; “Judicial review by this Court does not extend to a reevaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the proper labor tribunal has based its determination.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Factual issues are beyond the scope of this Court’s authority to review on <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Moreover, “[f]actual findings of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise, are afforded great weight by the courts, and in the absence of substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are conclusive, and in the interest of stability of the governmental structure, should not be disturbed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Petition fails in light of the Labor Arbiter’s and the NLRC’s identical findings, which were affirmed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The consistent rebuff of petitioners’ position convinces this Court of the weakness of their arguments.&nbsp; This can only mean that their evidence – which is merely reiterated here for the fourth time – will not stand scrutiny by this Court, since it could not even convince the NLRC and CA to take a view contrary to that taken by the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>Finally, there exists serious doubt with respect to petitioners’ proffered evidence, considering that the relevant payroll and daily time records are missing as they were, according to petitioners, stolen.&nbsp; Setting aside for a moment the CA’s pronouncement that the “stolen records” angle is nothing but a lame excuse, it would nonetheless be difficult if not impossible to validate and reconcile petitioners’ documentary evidence and unilateral claims of payment, if the official payroll and daily time records are not taken into account.&nbsp; Without them, there could be no sufficient basis for this Court to overturn the assailed Decision; the Court can only rely on the findings of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA.<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>The purpose of a time record is to show an employee’s attendance in office for work and to be paid accordingly, taking into account the policy of “no work, no pay”</b>. A daily time record is primarily intended to prevent damage or loss to the employer, which could result in instances where it pays an employee for no work done; it is a mandatory requirement for inclusion in the payroll, and in the absence of an employment agreement, it constitutes evidence of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x&nbsp; The punching of time card is undoubtedly work related. It signifies and records the commencement of one’s work for the day.
