He was referred to a physical therapist for his subsequent debridement through hydrotherapy. On November 10, 2000, the attending physician, Dr. Natalio G.

They denied that the vessel’s incinerator exploded and claimed that respondent burned himself by pouring paint thinner on his overalls and thereafter set himself on fire. They averred that he was led to commit such act after he was caught last October 10, 2000 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; stealing the vessel’s supplies during a routine security inspection conducted by Captain Bodo Wirth (Captain Wirth) where respondent was informed that he was to be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> They also stated that just before they Based on the aforesaid statement, on October 10, 2000, while the vessel was docked in Hong Kong, Captain Wirth conducted a routine security inspection when he came across a large parcel which belonged to respondent lying on the crew passageway. Upon inspection, the box contained a television set, a day bed cover, several towels and some provisions, all belonging to the vessel. When asked why he was stealing the foregoing articles, respondent claimed that they were given to him as a present by the chief steward. However, when Captain Wirth asked the latter, he denied giving respondent the same.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a&nbsp; result,&nbsp; Captain&nbsp; Wirth informed respondent that&nbsp; his actions&nbsp; warranted his immediate dismissal. discovered respondent to be burning, the vessel’s engine room became flooded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> They ascribed the flooding incident to respondent, having been seen by fellow crew members standing at the railing around the portside seachest and looking at it<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and that when the bilge level alarm sounded, he was seen disappearing up to the boiler deck leaving small patches of water on the floor, on the steps, and on the deck where he had been.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In support thereof, petitioners submitted the report of the ship captain on the flooding as extracted from the vessel’s deck logbook<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> as well as the affidavits and statements executed by the vessel’s officers and crew members relative to the flooding and burning incidents. Based on the said affidavits and statements, the vessel’s bosun, Antonio Gile (Gile), attested that he saw respondent go to the paint room and there soak his hands in a can full of thinner. Respondent then proceeded to the incinerator door where he was set ablaze. Gile further pointed out that there was no fire in the incinerator at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Also, Chief Officer Antonino S. Bejada (Bejada) testified that prior to the burning incident, he had ordered an ordinary seaman who had been burning deck waste in the incinerator to extinguish the fire with water and close up the incinerator door because of bad weather conditions. Bejada then checked the incinerator after the burning incident and found unburnt cardboard cartons inside with no sign of explosion and that the steel plates surrounding it were cool to the touch. He also noticed that the respondent’s overalls had patches of green paint on the arms and body and smelled strongly of thinner.

Monterroyo filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> for disciplinary action against respondent before the POEA for his various infractions committed on board the vessel, namely: (a) act of dishonesty for stealing the vessel’s supplies on October 10, 2000; (b) act of sabotage committed on October 13, 2000; and (c) grave misconduct for inflicting the injury to himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><center><br><b>The LA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated April 15, 2003, the Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in favor of petitioners, dismissing respondent’s complaint for lack of merit. The LA held that respondent’s injury was self-inflicted and that no incinerator explosion occurred that would have caused the latter ’s injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The LA gave more credence to the corroborating testimonies of the petitioners’ witnesses that respondent’s botched attempts to sabotage the vessel and steal its supplies may have motivated him to inflict injuries to himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Lastly, the LA denied respondent’s claim for moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney’s fees since he failed to prove any evident bad faith or malice on petitioners’ part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b><center><br>The NLRC Ruling<br></center><br></b>On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated January 30, 2004, sustained the findings of the LA and held, inter alia, that while some of the statements and affidavits of the vessel’s officers and crew members were not notarized, the corroborating testimonial evidence must be taken as a whole. In this accord, it gave due credence to the&nbsp; questioned&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; absent&nbsp; any&nbsp; showing&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; were motivated&nbsp; by ill&nbsp; will. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Also,&nbsp; it&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; out&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent’s&nbsp; mental or physical fitness was not at issue since he was motivated to inflict injury to himself for reasons related to his impending discharge and not because of his disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Respondent&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; but&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was denied&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; dated&nbsp; March&nbsp; 31, 2004.&nbsp; Dissatisfied, he&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a petition for<i> certiorari </i>before the CA.<br><b><center><br>The CA Ruling<br></center></b><br>On&nbsp; October&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 2006,&nbsp; the&nbsp; CA&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; the&nbsp; assailed&nbsp; Decision, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> holding that grave abuse of discretion tainted the NLRC ruling.<br><br>It found no logical and causal connection between the act of pilferage as well as the act of causing the flooding in the engine room and the conclusion that respondent’s injury was self-inflicted. It added that it was contrary to human nature and experience for respondent to burn himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Further, the CA noted that the location of the burns on the different parts of respondent’s&nbsp; body&nbsp; was&nbsp; more&nbsp; consistent&nbsp; with&nbsp; respondent’s&nbsp; assertion&nbsp; that certain chemicals splashed all over his body rather than petitioners’ theory of self-inflicted&nbsp; injury. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; it&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; out&nbsp; that&nbsp; no&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; was presented to show that respondent had no business near the engine room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the same vein, it observed that the mere finding of a cigarette lighter was inadequate to justify the conclusion that he burned himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Consequently, for petitioners’ failure to discharge the burden of proving that respondent’s injury was directly attributable to him as required under Section 20 (D) of the POEA-SEC, the CA found that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion and, thus, held petitioners liable to pay respondent permanent total disability benefits in the amount of US$60,000.00, or its peso equivalent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent’s claims for moral and exemplary damages were denied for lack of basis but the CA awarded him attorney’s fees in the amount of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated June 25, 2007. Hence, this petition.<br><br><b><center><br>The Issue Before The Court<br></center></b><br>The essential issue in this case is whether or not the CA erred in finding that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when it denied respondent’s claim for disability benefits.<br><br><b><center><br>The Court’s Ruling<br></center></b><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br><b><i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary Matters: Framework of</i></b><b><i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review and Governing Rules</i></b><br><br>At the outset, the Court deems it proper to elucidate on the framework in which the review of this case had been conducted, in conjunction with the applicable governing rules to analyze its substantive merits.<br><br>The Court’s jurisdiction in cases brought before it from the CA via Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is generally limited to reviewing errors of law. The Court is not the proper venue to consider a factual issue as it is not a trier of facts. This rule, however, is not ironclad and a departure therefrom may be warranted where the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the NLRC and LA, as in this case. In this regard, there is therefore a need to review the records to determine which of them should be preferred as more conformable to evidentiary facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>With respect to the applicable rules, it is doctrinal that the entitlement of seamen on overseas work to disability benefits “is a matter governed, not only by medical findings, but by law and by contract. The material statutory provisions are Articles 191 to 193 under Chapter VI (Disability Benefits) of the Labor Code, in relation [to] Rule X of the Rules and Regulations Implementing Book IV of the Labor Code. By contract, the POEA-SEC, as provided under Department Order No. 4, series of 2000 of the Department of Labor and Employment, and the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement bind the seaman and his employer to each other.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the foregoing light, the Court observes that respondent executed his contract of employment on July 17, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> incorporating therein the terms and conditions of the 2000 POEA-SEC which took effect on June 25, 2000. However, since the implementation of the provisions of the foregoing 2000 POEA-SEC was temporarily suspended <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> by the Court on September 11, 2000, particularly Section 20, paragraphs (A), (B), and (D) thereof, and was lifted only on June 5, 2002, through POEA Memorandum Circular No. 2, series&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2002, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent’s&nbsp; entitlement&nbsp; to&nbsp; the disability&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; resolved&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 1996 POEA-SEC&nbsp; as&nbsp; it&nbsp; was,&nbsp; effectively,&nbsp; the&nbsp; governing&nbsp; circular&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time respondent’s employment contract was executed.<br><br>The prevailing rule under Section 20 (B) of the 1996 POEA-SEC on compensation and benefits for injury or illness was that an employer shall be liable for the injury or illness suffered by a seafarer during the term of his contract. There was no need to show that such injury was work-related except that it must be proven to have been contracted during the term of the contract. The rule, however, is not absolute and the employer may be exempt from liability if he can successfully prove that the cause of the seaman’s injury was directly attributable to his deliberate or willful act as provided under Section 20 (D) thereof, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; payable&nbsp; in&nbsp; respect&nbsp; of&nbsp; any&nbsp; injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to seafarer. </blockquote><br>Hence, the<i> onus probandi</i> falls on the petitioners herein to establish or substantiate their claim that the respondent’s injury was caused by his willful act with the requisite quantum of evidence.<br><br>In&nbsp;&nbsp; labor&nbsp;&nbsp; cases,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative&nbsp;&nbsp; proceedings,&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>only substantial&nbsp; evidence</b>&nbsp; or&nbsp; such&nbsp; relevant&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> </u><b><u>a&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion is required</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> To note, considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; <b>substantial&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; evidentiary&nbsp; threshold</b>,&nbsp; the Court, on exceptional cases, may assess the factual determinations made by the NLRC in a particular case. In <i>Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Serna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court expressed the following view:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, we do not re-examine conflicting evidence, re- evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the NLRC, an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field. Nor do we substitute our “own judgment for that of the tribunal in determining where the weight of evidence lies or what evidence is credible.” The factual findings of the NLRC, when affirmed by the CA, are generally conclusive on this Court.<br><br><b>Nevertheless, there are exceptional cases where we, in the exercise of our discretionary appellate jurisdiction <i>may</i> be urged to look into factual issues raised in a Rule 45 petition</b>. For instance, when the&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>persuasively alleges&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; insufficient&nbsp;&nbsp; or insubstantial evidence on record</b> to support the factual findings of the tribunal or court<i> a quo</i>, as Section 5, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court states in express terms that in cases filed before administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, <b> a&nbsp; fact&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; established&nbsp; only&nbsp; if&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by substantial evidence</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphases supplied; citations omitted) </blockquote> <br>The evident conflict between the NLRC’s and CA’s factual findings as shown in the records of this case prompts the Court to sift through their respective&nbsp; factual&nbsp; determinations&nbsp; if&nbsp; only&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reaching its disposition, keeping in mind&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter’s&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; should&nbsp; only&nbsp; meet&nbsp; the&nbsp; threshold&nbsp; of substantial evidence.<br><br><b><i>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application</i></b><br><br>In view of the above-discussed considerations and after a judicious scrutiny&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; on&nbsp; record,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; holds&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; CA&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in attributing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in affirming the LA’s dismissal of respondent’s complaint. This is based on the Court’s observation&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; NLRC&nbsp; had&nbsp; cogent&nbsp; legal&nbsp; bases&nbsp; to&nbsp; conclude&nbsp; that petitioners have successfully discharged the burden of proving by substantial evidence that respondent’s injury was directly attributable to himself. The reasons therefor are as follows:<br><br><i><b><u>First</u></b></i>, records bear out circumstances which all lead to the reasonable conclusion that respondent was responsible for the flooding and burning incidents.<br><br>Records show that the LA and NLRC gave credence to the corroborating testimonies of the crewmen pointing to respondent as the person who deliberately caused the flooding incident. In particular, respondent was seen alone in the vicinity of the portside seachest which cover was found to have been intentionally removed and thereby caused the flooding. He was also seen disappearing up to the boiler deck just when the bilge level alarm sounded with patches of water left on the floor plates and on the stairways. Respondent neither denied nor proffered any explanation on the foregoing claims especially when all of his fellow engine room staff, except him, responded to the alarm and helped pump out the water in the engine&nbsp; room. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; burning,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; successfully controvert Gile’s claim that he saw the former go to the paint room, soak his hands in a can full of thinner and proceed to the incinerator door where he was set ablaze. In fact, respondent’s burnt overalls conform to the aforesaid claim as it had green paint on the arms and body and smelled strongly of thinner, while the open paint tin can that was found in the vicinity contained solvent which had the same green color found on the overalls.<br><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, respondent’s version that the burning was caused by an accident is hardly supported by the evidence on record.<br><br>The purported explosion in the incinerator was belied by Gile who also claimed that there was no fire in the incinerator room at the time respondent&nbsp; got&nbsp; burned.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was&nbsp; corroborated&nbsp; by&nbsp; Bejada&nbsp; who&nbsp; testified having ordered an ordinary seaman that was burning deck waste in the incinerator early that day to extinguish the fire with water and close up the incinerator door because of bad weather conditions. Accordingly, an inspection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; incinerator&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; incident&nbsp; showed&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; were unburnt cardboard cartons found inside with no sign of explosion and the steel plates surrounding it were cool to the touch. Further, as aptly discerned by the LA, if there was really an incinerator explosion, then respondent’s injury would have been more serious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Respondent debunked Gile’s claim by merely asserting in his Answer and Rejoinder before the POEA that the latter could not have been in the room at the time he got burned as he was not the first person to rescue him and concluded that he could not have soaked his hands in a can full of thinner&nbsp; considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; extent&nbsp; of&nbsp; damage&nbsp; caused&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; hands. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; This argument is riddled with serious flaws: Gile could have been the second man in,&nbsp; and&nbsp; still&nbsp; personally&nbsp; know&nbsp; the&nbsp; matters&nbsp; he&nbsp; has&nbsp; alleged.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; that respondent soaked his hands in thinner is not denied by the fact that the greatest damage was not caused to it since the fire could have started at some part of his body considering that his overalls also had flammable chemicals. Reason also dictates that he could have extinguished the fire on his hands sooner than the other parts of his body. In any event, the medical records of respondent, particularly the report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56 ]</sup>issued by the Prince of Wales Hospital Burns Surgery, show that he suffered from “deep burn area” that was distributed over his left upper limb, right hand, left flank and both thighs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> To assert that respondent’s hands should have suffered the greatest damage is plainly argumentative and records are bereft of showing as to the exact degree of burn suffered for each part.<br><br>To add, Bejada’s statement that respondent’s burnt overalls had patches of green paint on the arms and body and strongly smelled of thinner conforms with Gile’s claim that he soaked his hands in a can of thinner before approaching the incinerator (thinner may be found in a paint room). Such fact further fortifies petitioners’ assertion that his injury was self-inflicted as a prudent man would not dispose of garbage in the incinerator under such condition.<br><br>And if only to placate other doubts, the CA’s finding that “some chemicals splashed [on respondent’s] body”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> should not automatically mean that the “splashing” was caused by pure accident. It is equally reasonable to conclude that the “splashing” – as may be inferred from both the LA’s and NLRC”s findings – was a by-product of respondent’s botched sabotage attempt.<br><br>While respondent contended that the affidavits and statements of the vessel’s officers and his fellow crew members should not be given probative value as they were biased, self-serving, and mere hearsay, he nonetheless failed to present any evidence to substantiate his own theory. Besides, as correctly pointed out by the NLRC, the corroborating affidavits and statements of the vessel’s officers and crew members must be taken as a whole and cannot just be perfunctorily dismissed as self-serving absent any showing that they were lying when they made the statements therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, petitioners’ theory that respondent’s burns were self-inflicted gains credence through the existence of motive.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court finds it important to examine the existence of motive in this case since no one actually saw what transpired in the incinerator&nbsp; room.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; this&nbsp; end,&nbsp; the&nbsp; confluence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; circumstances antecedent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; burning&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; examined&nbsp; in&nbsp; conjunction&nbsp; with&nbsp; the existing accounts of the crew members. That said, both the LA and the NLRC made a factual finding that prior to the burning incident, respondent was caught pilfering the vessel’s supplies for which he was told that he was to be relieved from his duties. This adequately supports the reasonable conclusion that respondent may have harbored a grudge against the captain and the chief steward who denied giving him the questioned items. At the very least, it was natural for him to brood over feelings of resentment considering his impending dismissal. These incidents shore up the theory that he was motivated to commit an act of sabotage which, however, backfired into his own burning.<br><br>In this relation, the Court observes that a definitive pronouncement on respondent’s mental unfitness need not be reached since the totality of the above-stated circumstances already figures into the rational inference that respondent’s burning was not a product of an impaired mental disposition but&nbsp; rather&nbsp; an&nbsp; incident&nbsp; which&nbsp; sprung&nbsp; from&nbsp; his&nbsp; own&nbsp; volition.&nbsp; Mental impairment connotes the lack of control over one’s action. If the actor is conscious of what he is doing, as respondent was in this case by sabotaging the ship, then a finding of mental unfitness is not needed.

The transfer of a labor case from </b></i><br><i><b>the quasi-judicial sphere to the</b></i><br><i><b>judicial sphere entails a specific</b></i><br><i><b>mode of limited review</b></i><br></blockquote><br>When a labor case decided by quasi-judicial tribunals - the Labor Arbiter (<i>LA</i>) and the National Labor Relations Commission (<i>NLRC</i>) - finds its&nbsp; way into&nbsp; the judicial sphere, the court must proceed and&nbsp; act on the petition on the basic premise that the assailed ruling is a <i><b>final and executory ruling</b></i>.&nbsp; This premise, in turn, is based on two facts: <i>first,</i> labor cases that reach the CA (and eventually the Supreme Court) are already rulings on the merits that finally dispose of the case; and, <i>second</i>, after the labor tribunals have rendered judgment, substantive law no longer provides any remedy of appeal to the losing party.<br><br>Notwithstanding&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of appeal,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggrieved&nbsp; party&nbsp; is&nbsp; not without any legal remedy. As the legal battle is transferred&nbsp; from the quasi­ judicial&nbsp; sphere&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; strictly&nbsp; judicial sphere,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggrieved&nbsp; party&nbsp; must contend&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; new&nbsp; avenue&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; legal&nbsp; advocacy&nbsp; becomes narrower.&nbsp; The&nbsp; review&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; is limited to&nbsp; <i><b>jurisdictional&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; under Rule&nbsp; 65 of the Rules&nbsp; of </b>Court (Rule 65)</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; As early as 1975, the Court had the occasion to state:<br><br><blockquote><b>While&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal does&nbsp; not lie</b>, it is available&nbsp; <b>whenever a&nbsp; jurisdictional issue is raised&nbsp; or one of grave&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of discretion amounting to a lack of excess thereof.</b> x x x This excerpt, from the opinion of Justice Aquino in <i>San Miguel Corporation v.

That contention is a flagrant error. &nbsp; 'It is generally understood that as to administrative agencies exercising quasi­ judicial or legislative power <b>there&nbsp; is an&nbsp; underlying power&nbsp; in the courts to&nbsp; scrutinize&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; acts&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp;&nbsp; agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; questions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law&nbsp;&nbsp; and jurisdiction even though no right&nbsp; of review&nbsp; is given&nbsp; by statute</b>' x x x.

In fact, a survey of the Court's&nbsp; rulings will not be beneficial in determining the scope and breadth of the Court's <b><i>supervisory power</i></b>&nbsp; under&nbsp; a&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 65&nbsp; petition&nbsp; as&nbsp; distinguished&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp; the Court's discretionary&nbsp; <i><b>review power</b></i> under a Rule 45 petition in labor cases.

Expressly&nbsp; stated&nbsp; under&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 45&nbsp; is that&nbsp; the&nbsp; review&nbsp; it provides is not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too, this mode of appeal limits the review to questions of law.<br><br>Obviously, the Court did not intend this discretion to be an unbridled discretion&nbsp;&nbsp; one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The&nbsp; approximate&nbsp;&nbsp; metes&nbsp; and&nbsp; bounds&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; express limitations under Rule 45 - that <b><i>only questions of law</i></b> may be raised and that the Court may entertain the petition and exceptionally undertake a review of factual questions <b><i>based on "sound&nbsp; judicial discretion"</i></b>- are, however, not clearly&nbsp; defined&nbsp; in&nbsp; <i>St. Martin</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; cases&nbsp; decided&nbsp; <i><b>before&nbsp; or after</b>&nbsp; St. Martin</i> almost uniformly hold that:<br><br><blockquote><b><u>The&nbsp; rule&nbsp; is that&nbsp; factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies&nbsp; such as&nbsp; the&nbsp; NLRC&nbsp; are&nbsp; generally accorded not&nbsp; only&nbsp; respect, but&nbsp; at&nbsp; times, even&nbsp; finality</u></b> because of the special&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; and expertise&nbsp; gained&nbsp; by these&nbsp; agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp; handling&nbsp;&nbsp; matters&nbsp;&nbsp; falling&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; their&nbsp; specialized jurisdiction. It is also settled that this Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally embark in the evaluation of evidence adduced during trial. <b><u>This&nbsp; rule,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; allows&nbsp; for&nbsp; exceptions.&nbsp; One&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; exceptions covers&nbsp; instances&nbsp; when&nbsp; the findings&nbsp; of fact of the trial court, or of the quasi-judicial agencies&nbsp; concerned, are&nbsp; conflicting&nbsp; or&nbsp; contradictory with those of the CA.

Notably, when one traces in jurisprudence the justification for&nbsp; the invoked&nbsp; exception,&nbsp; it will invariably point to cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; the Supreme Court departed from the rule - that the jurisdiction of the Court in cases brought to it from the CA is limited to the review of errors of law, as its&nbsp; findings&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact&nbsp; are&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; conclusive - when,&nbsp; among&nbsp; others,&nbsp; the findings of facts <b><i>by</i> the trial court and the appellate court</b> are conflicting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The <i><b>indiscriminate</b></i>&nbsp; adoption of this remedial law principle into labor cases stands on shaky legal grounds. To begin with, <b><i>certiorari</i> is different from&nbsp; appeal</b>.&nbsp; In an appellate proceeding, the original suit is continued on appeal in a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding, the<i> certiorari </i>petition is an original and independent action that was not part of the trial that had resulted in the rendition of the judgment or order complained of. The higher court uses its original jurisdiction in accordance with its power of control and supervision over the proceedings of lower courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Put more bluntly, when the Court undertakes a review of the factual findings&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; courts,&nbsp; it does so on the&nbsp; premise that&nbsp; the <i>recourse</i> to the CA is part of the <i>appellate process&nbsp; authorized by law</i>.&nbsp; Hence, when the trier of facts at the trial and appellate level reach divergent factual findings,&nbsp; even if the same pieces of evidence&nbsp; are before them, the Court is constrained to set aside the rule that only questions of law may be raised&nbsp; under&nbsp; a&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 45&nbsp; petition&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; a&nbsp; correct&nbsp; and&nbsp; just decision. The same situation does not apply in labor cases because statutory law does not provide for an appellate process, and thus, the mere existence of a conflict in the factual findings at any stage of the proceedings does not <b><i>by itself </i></b>warrant the Court to undertake an independent review.<br><br><b><i>c.&nbsp; The case of Montoya v.

Unfortunately, even its findings on these points are riddled with inconsistencies that the supposed causal connection the <i>ponencia</i> relied upon similarly suffers.<br><br>We must not lose sight of the fact that the core issue before the labor tribunals&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether&nbsp; Moradas'&nbsp; injury&nbsp; is&nbsp; self-inflicted.&nbsp; The&nbsp; issues&nbsp; as&nbsp; to whether Moradas stole the ship's properties and committed an act of sabotaging the ship are issues that are appropriately before the POEA Adjudication Office. The records show that sometime in February 2001 (or several weeks after Moradas, through counsel, sent a demand letter to the petitioners),&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; against Moradas for dishonesty and grave misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A finding by&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; body that&nbsp; indeed&nbsp; Moradas committed the&nbsp; acts&nbsp; imputed to&nbsp; him&nbsp; would&nbsp; have provided sufficient starting&nbsp; basis&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; logic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; <i>ponencia's</i>&nbsp; view that&nbsp; a causal&nbsp; connection existed. </b> Unfortunately, the petitioners, who have the burden of proving that the injury was self-inflicted, submitted nothing on this point.<br><br>While a reference to these incidents may be justified as circumstantial evidence to prove that Moradas' injury was self-inflicted,&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it highly disturbing that&nbsp; the <b><i>ponencia&nbsp; made&nbsp; a&nbsp; conclusive&nbsp; factual&nbsp; finding</i></b>&nbsp; that "Moradas was caught pilfering the ship's supplies"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; and effectively implied that he committed the act of sabotaging the ship, <b><i>notwithstanding</i> Moradas' categorical denial&nbsp; of these accusations, with an&nbsp; explanation of his own account&nbsp; of the&nbsp; facts - denials&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; never bothered&nbsp; to address in any of their pleadings.</b><br><br>On the other hand, I cannot also understand why Moradas' categorical denials&nbsp; were&nbsp; disregarded&nbsp; but&nbsp; the&nbsp; similar&nbsp; negative&nbsp; statements&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bosun Antonio Gile and Chief Officer Antonio Bejada (that there was no fire in the incinerator) were believed to defeat Moradas' claim that the burning was caused by the explosion.

The following day, he was admitted at the St. Luke's Medical Center under the care of the company-designated physician, Dr. Natalia G. Alegre. On November 22, 2000, Dr. Alegre found that Moradas' burns were already healing and <i>recommended&nbsp; his out-patient treatment</i>. However, on August 1, 2001,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Alegre&nbsp; reported&nbsp; that&nbsp; Moradas discontinued&nbsp; receiving medical treatment from him after April 7, 2001, the last time that Moradas went to him for medical treatment. On July 2001, Moradas filed his complaint with the LA.<br><br>Clearly, from the time Moradas was repatriated until the last time he underwent treatment, only 169 days had elapsed. While the 120-day period under&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 20(B)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; POEA-Standard&nbsp; Employment&nbsp; Contract&nbsp; and Article 192 of the Labor Code has already been exceeded, per Section 2, Rule X of the Rules and Regulations Implementing Book IV of the Labor Code, since no fit-to-work declaration or declaration of disability is made because Dr. Alegre required Moradas to undergo further medical treatment, Moradas'&nbsp; <i>temporary&nbsp; total</i>&nbsp; disability&nbsp; period&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; extended&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; a maximum of 240 days or until June 17, 2001. Until this date, the company­ designated physician can make a finding on a seafarer's&nbsp; fitness for further sea duties or degree of disability. However, for reasons known only to him, Moradas did not anymore submit himself for medical treatment after April 7, 2001. <b>His failure&nbsp; to do so is fatal to his cause of action for total and permanent disability&nbsp; benefits</b>. Moradas' case is very much similar to the seafarer&nbsp; in&nbsp; <i>Magsaysay&nbsp; Maritime&nbsp; Corporation,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; v. National&nbsp; Labor Relations Commission, etc., et al. (Magsaysay)</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In <i>Magsaysay</i>, the seafarer discontinued his therapy sessions even if it appears "to be yielding positive results" and demanded the payment of total and permanent disability benefits soon after the expiration of the 120-day period. In denying his claim, the Court capitalized on the absence of an assessment from the company-designated physician, thus:<br><br><blockquote>First. There was no assessment of the extent of Capoy's disability by the company-designated physician, as required by Section 20(8)(3) of the POEA-SEC, which provides:<br><center><br>x x x x<br></center><br><b><u>Considering that&nbsp; Caoov was still&nbsp; undergoing&nbsp; medical treatment, particularly through therapy sessions under the care of the company-designated&nbsp; specialists,&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvador&nbsp;&nbsp; (the&nbsp;&nbsp; lead&nbsp;&nbsp; company doctor) cannot&nbsp; be faulted for not issuing an assessment of Capoy's disability&nbsp; or&nbsp; fitness&nbsp; for&nbsp; work&nbsp; at&nbsp; that&nbsp; time.</u></b> In fact, as Dr. Salvador's progress report of March 17, 2006 showed that Capoy was expected to return on April 6, 2006 for re-evaluation by the orthopedic surgeon. This aspect of the POEA-SEC and Capoy's&nbsp; compliance totally escaped the labor tribunals and the CA.&nbsp; [emphasis and underscore ours]</blockquote><br>Applying <i>Vergara, Magsaysay</i> also squarely rejected the argument that a seafarer's disability for more than 120 days automatically entitles him to total and permanent disability, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>As matters stood on March 17, 2006, when Dr. Salvador issued her last progress report, 197 days from Capoy's&nbsp; repatriation on August 31, 2005, Capoy was legally under temporary total disability since the 240-day period under Section 2, Rule X of the Rules and Regulations implementing Book IV of the Labor Code had not yet lapsed. The LA, the NLRC and the CA, therefore, grossly misappreciated the facts and the applicable law when they ruled that because Capoy was unable to perform his&nbsp; work&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; fitter&nbsp; for&nbsp; more&nbsp; than&nbsp; 120&nbsp; days,&nbsp; he&nbsp; became&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to permanent total disability benefits. <b><u>The CA cited in support of its challenged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ruling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvador's&nbsp; failure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; make&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; disability assessment or a fit-to-work declaration for Capoy after 197 days from his repatriation. This&nbsp; is a&nbsp; misappreciation of the&nbsp; underlying reason for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; absence&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvador's&nbsp; assessment.&nbsp; There was no assessment&nbsp; yet because&nbsp; Capoy&nbsp; was still undergoing treatment and evaluation&nbsp; by the company doctors, especially the orthopedic surgeon, within&nbsp; the 240-day maximum&nbsp; period&nbsp; provided&nbsp; under&nbsp; the above-cited rule</u></b>. To reiterate, Capoy was supposed to see the orthopedic surgeon for re-evaluation, but he did not honor the appointment.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Capoy, needless to say, prevented&nbsp; Dr. Salvador&nbsp; from determining his fitness&nbsp; or unfitness&nbsp; for sea duty&nbsp; when&nbsp; he did&nbsp; not return&nbsp; on April 6,2006 for re-evaluation.&nbsp; [emphasis and underscore ours]</blockquote><br>As we did in <i>Magsaysay</i>, the Court must necessarily reject Moradas' claim for permanent total disability benefits. However, since it is undisputed that Moradas still needed medical treatment beyond the initial 120&nbsp; days from his repatriation, he is entitled, under the rules,<sup><font color="#ff0000">[39]</font></sup>&nbsp; to the income benefit for temporary total disability during the extended period from the time he was repatriated on October 20, 2000 up to the time he last underwent medical treatment on April 7, 2001 or for 169 days. This is the monetary benefit that must be paid to him.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, I vote to partially <b>GRANT</b> the petition.&nbsp; The October 31, 2006 decision and the June 25, 2007 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 84769 should be <b>MODIFIED</b> to reflect that respondent Alexander L. Moradas is entitled to the income benefit for temporary total disability during the extended period or for 169 days.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
