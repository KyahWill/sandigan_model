The issue on the validity of the foreclosure proceedings and sale was not raised in the complaint, thus, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Lastly, PNB contends that the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are deemed final and conclusive by this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Petitioner heirs filed a reply reiterating their arguments and submitting certified true copies of the property’s tax declarations to support their contentions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Thus, the issues before this court for resolution are:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>Whether a valid title can be derived from a void title;

The core of the issues presented requires a determination of whether PNB was in good faith and exercised due diligence in accepting the property mortgaged by Spouses Reynaldo Andres and Janette de Leon.&nbsp; These are questions of fact<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> that fall outside the ambit of this court’s power of review.<br><br>This court is not a trier of facts that routinely re-examines evidence presented.&nbsp; Factual findings by the Court of Appeals are, thus, generally considered binding and conclusive upon this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The rule against entertaining factual questions admits of exceptions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> but none are present in this case.&nbsp; This court finds no reason to overturn the findings of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner heirs submit that the trial court “did not rule categorically on the issue of good faith interposed by the respondent bank[; however], it ruled that since the mortgage was without object and cause, it was parenthetically void such that the defense of and protestation of good faith is thus rendered of no consequence.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; In support of their contention that PNB’s title was derived from a void title, petitioner heirs cited at length the trial court decision:<br><br><blockquote>A close examination of the said deed of partition will show that not all the children of the spouses Victor Andres and Filomena Ramos were parties nor signatories thereto.&nbsp; Specifically, only six of the nine children of said spouses executed the supposed extra-judicial partition which, in effect, preterited three others, namely: Sixto, Ofelia and Araceli.<br><br>The extra-judicial partition is thus vitiated by what appeared to have been a deliberate omission therein of the said three children.&nbsp; The obvious explanation to that is what is claimed by the plaintiff: that the deed was simulated to afford financial accommodation to their brother Roman.<br><br>More significantly, the deed very clearly provided that only one half of the subject property was covered by partition since the other half was recognized as the conjugal share of Victor Andres’ spouses [sic], Filomena Ramos.<br><br>Even assuming the validity of the partition as executed, only one-half of the subject property should have been transferred, by virtue thereof, to Roman Andres.<br><br>Insofar, therefore, as the Extra-Judicial Partition with Sale was made the basis for the transfer of TCT No. NT-7267 to TCT No. NT-57731, the same may not be characterized other than<i> as absolutely simulated or fictitious contract or document.&nbsp; As such, the transfer effected through it was void ab initio and, in legal contemplation, never existed.<br><br>By the same token, any subsequent transfer from the void TCT No. NT-57731, could not have had any valid and binding effect so as to constitute the transferee thereof as the legal owner of the property embraced and described therein.</i><br><br>Interestingly, even the manner defendant Andres effected the transfer of TCT No. NT-57731 to himself was legally flawed.<br><br>To be sure, the issuance of TCT No. NT-239548 in the name of defendant Reynaldo Andres was by way of a document styled as Self Adjudication of Sole Heir (Exh. “D”) executed by defendant Reynaldo Andres himself.&nbsp; In this document, he declared that Roman Andres died on October 12, 1968, and his mother died Lydia Echaus, on December 15, 1969; that they died with the subject property as their only property, that he is the only child and heir of the decedents and for that reason he declared the estate to be his inheritance and adjudicated the same unto himself extra-judicially pursuant to Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>It appears, however, that at the time the Self-Adjudication of Sole Heir was executed by defendant Reynaldo Andres, it is not true that his mother, Lydia Echaus, was already dead.&nbsp; In fact, up to the present she [is] still alive.&nbsp; Not only that, defendant Reynaldo Andres is not really the sole child of spouses Roman Andres and Lydia Echaus because they have other children, namely: Cynthia and Vienna who are both in the United States of America.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals ascertained good faith on the part of PNB.<br><br>Preliminarily, the Court of Appeals mentioned that it is “in quandary as to whether or not the appellant PNB indeed was able to present evidence for and on its own behalf [but a] close scrutiny of the records of this case would disclose that Gerardo Pestaño was presented as a witness for the defendant-PNB and his testimony was adopted by the defendants-spouses.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>It then found that PNB followed the standard practice of banks before approving a loan by sending representatives to inspect the property offered as collateral.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; PNB even investigated on “where and from whom the title . . . originated.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>According to the Court of Appeals, evidence disclosed that Spouses Reynaldo Andres and Janette de Leon submitted TCT No. (NT-239548) N-7725 as proof of their ownership.&nbsp; PNB’s property appraiser, Gerardo Pestaño, conducted an investigation and verified the status of the property with the Register of Deeds and Assessor's Office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>On August 8, 1995, Gerardo Pestaño went to the property and personally met with the borrowers, Spouses Reynaldo Andres and Janette de Leon, who told him they were living in the property.&nbsp; He appraised the residential building then being constructed.&nbsp; Upon Gerardo Pestaño’s request, Reynaldo Andres submitted the property’s tax declaration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Gerardo Pestaño also went to the Municipal Trial Court to check on any pending cases, particularly on estafa, filed against Spouses Reynaldo Andres and Janette de Leon.&nbsp; Upon verification from the Register of Deeds, he learned that all previous annotations on the titles have been cancelled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that there was nothing on the face of the titles that would excite any suspicion of an irregular issuance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; Reynaldo Andres’ parents had even previously mortgaged the property to a bank in 1965, and the property was accepted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals quoted <i>Cabuhat v. Court of Appeals</i> in holding that “when a mortgagee relies upon what appears on the face of a Torrens title and loans money in all good faith on the basis of the title in the name of the mortgagor, only thereafter to learn that the latter’s title was defective, being thus an innocent mortgagee for value, his or her right or lien upon the land mortgaged must be respected and protected, even if the mortgagor obtained her title thereto through fraud.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Petitioner heirs argued the inapplicability of <i>Cabuhat</i> to the instant case.&nbsp; They explained how <i>Cabuhat</i> involved a private individual mortgagee while respondent was a universal bank.&nbsp; They added that unlike in <i>Cabuhat</i>, good faith was not duly proven by PNB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Petitioner heirs then cited <i>Cruz v. Bancom Finance Corporation</i> for its holding that “[the bank] should not have simply relied on the face of the Certificate of Title to the property, as its ancillary function of investing funds required a greater degree of diligence. . . .”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The Civil Code is clear that only the absolute owner of a property can mortgage such property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp; The law also provides that absolutely simulated or fictitious contracts are void and inexistent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, these fictitious contracts convey no rights.<br><br>The trial court has declared as void all titles that originated from the contracts it found to be void, such as the extrajudicial partition with sale in favor of Roman Andres, and the “Self-Adjudication of Sole Heir” in favor of Reynaldo Andres.&nbsp; This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The issue now is whether a valid title in favor of PNB can be derived from these void titles.<br><br>This court reiterated the good faith doctrine that applies to innocent mortgagees for value in the 2012 case of <i>Philippine Banking Corporation v. Dy</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br><blockquote>While it is settled that a simulated deed of sale is null and void and therefore, does not convey any right that could ripen into a valid title, it has been equally ruled that, for reasons of public policy, <i>the subsequent nullification of title to a property is not a ground to annul the contractual right which may have been derived by a purchaser, mortgagee or other transferee who acted in good faith.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The doctrine protecting mortgagees and innocent purchasers in good faith emanates from the social interest embedded in the legal concept granting indefeasibility of titles.&nbsp; The burden of discovery of invalid transactions relating to the property covered by a title appearing regular on its face is shifted from the third party relying on the title to the co-owners or the predecessors of the title holder.&nbsp; Between the third party and the co-owners, it will be the latter that will be more intimately knowledgeable about the status of the property and its history.&nbsp; The costs of discovery of the basis of invalidity, thus, are better borne by them because it would naturally be lower.&nbsp; A reverse presumption will only increase costs for the economy, delay transactions, and, thus, achieve a less optimal welfare level for the entire society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The general rule allows every person dealing with registered land to rely on the face of the title when determining its absolute owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, cases like<i> Cabuhat</i> have held that “a mortgagee has a right to rely in good faith on the certificate of title of the mortgagor of the property given as security and in the absence of any sign that might arouse suspicion, has no obligation to undertake further investigation.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>&nbsp; The protection of innocent mortgagees for value finds support in the Land Registration Act:<br><br><blockquote>Then in <i>Penullar v. PNB,</i> this Court resolved a similar issue ruling that <i>Section 38 of the Land Registration Act </i>places an innocent mortgagee for value under the mantle of protection accorded to innocent purchasers for value.<br><br>Furthermore, <i>Section 39 of Act No. 496</i> provides that every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of registration, and every subsequent purchaser (or mortgagee) of registered land who takes a certificate of title for value in good faith, shall hold the same free of all encumbrance except those noted on said certificate. . . <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Section 38 of Act No. 496 in what is now Section 32 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 32. <i>Review of decree of registration; Innocent purchaser for value.</i> — The decree of registration shall not be reopened or revised by reason of absence, minority, or other disability of any person adversely affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments, subject, however, to the right of any person, including the government and the branches thereof, deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein by such adjudication or confirmation of title obtained by actual fraud, to file in the proper Court of First Instance a petition for reopening and review of the decree of registration not later than one year from and after the date of the entry of such decree of registration, but in no case shall such petition be entertained by the court where an innocent purchaser for value has acquired the land or an interest therein, whose rights may be prejudiced. Whenever the phrase "innocent purchaser for value" or an equivalent phrase occurs in this Decree, it shall be deemed to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee, or other encumbrancer for value.<br><br>Upon the expiration of said period of one year, the decree of registration and the certificate of title issued shall become incontrovertible.
