				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The dilemma of the appeal bond in labor cases is epochal, present whenever the amount of monetary award becomes debatably impedimental to the completion of remedies.&nbsp; Such instances exaggerate the ambivalence between rigidity and liberality in the application of the requirement that the bond must be equal to the arbiter’s award.&nbsp; The rule of reasonableness in the determination of the compliant amount of the bond has been formulated to allow the review of the arbiter’s award.&nbsp; However, that rule seemingly becomes inadequate when the award staggers belief but is, nonetheless, supported by the premises of the controversy.&nbsp; The enormity of the award cannot prevent the settlement of the dispute.&nbsp; The amount of award may vary case-to-case.&nbsp; But the law remains constant.<br><br>Before us are six (6) consolidated petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> pertaining to the P3,453,664,710.66 (P3.45 Billion) appeal bond, which, as mandated by Article 233 of the Labor Code, is equivalent to the monetary award adjudged by the labor arbiter in the cases.&nbsp; The first 5 petitions seek a relaxation of the rule while the last petition urges its strict interpretation.<br><br>Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 180147, 180148, 180149, 180150, and 180319 are Sara Lee Philippines, Inc. (SLPI), Aris Philippines, Inc. (Aris), Sara Lee Corporation (SLC), Atty. Cesar Cruz (Cruz), and Fashion Accessories Philippines, Inc. (FAPI), respectively and shall be collectively referred to as the “Corporations.”<br><br>SLPI is a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture and distribution of personal care products and is a subsidiary of SLC.<br><br>Aris is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of producing gloves and other apparel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>FAPI is a corporation engaged in the manufacture of knitted products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>SLC, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, is a stockholder of Aris.&nbsp; It exercised control over Aris, FAPI, and SLPI which were all its subsidiaries or affiliates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Cruz was the external counsel of Aris at the time of its closure.&nbsp; When Aris filed for its dissolution, Cruz became the Vice-President and Director of Aris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The petition docketed as G.R.

Macatlang allegedly represents the employees whose employment was terminated upon the closure of Aris.<br><br><center>I.<br></center><br>This controversy stemmed from a Notice of Permanent Closure filed by Aris on 4 September 1995 with the Department of Labor and Employment stating that it will permanently cease its operations effective 9 October 1995.&nbsp; All employees of Aris were duly informed.<br><br>Aris Philippines Workers Confederation of Filipino Workers (Union), which represents 5,984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> rank-and-file employees of Aris, staged a strike for violation of duty to bargain collectively,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> union busting and illegal closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After conciliation, the parties entered into an agreement whereby Aris undertook to pay its employees the benefits which accrued by virtue of the company’s closure, which settlement amounted to P419 Million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and an additional P15 Million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Benevolent Fund to the Union.<br><br>On 26 October 1995, FAPI was incorporated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; When said incorporation came to the knowledge of the affected employees, they all filed 63 separate complaints against Aris for illegal dismissal.&nbsp; The complaints were consolidated before the labor arbiter.&nbsp; Later amendments to the complaint included as respondents SLC, SLP, FAPI and Cruz, and Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al., is captioned as the complainant, represented in the suit by Emilinda D. Macatlang.&nbsp; The complaints alleged that FAPI is engaged in the manufacture and exportation of the same articles manufactured by Aris; that there was a mass transfer of Aris’ equipment and employees to FAPI’s plant in Muntinlupa, Rizal; that contractors of Aris continued as contractors of FAPI; and that the export quota of Aris was transferred to FAPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Essentially, the complainants insisted that FAPI was organized by the management of Aris to continue the same business of Aris, thereby intending to defeat their right to security of tenure.&nbsp; They likewise impleaded in their subsequent pleadings that SLC and SLP are the major stockholders of FAPI, and Cruz as Vice-President and Director of Aris.<br><br>Aris countered that it had complied with all the legal requirements for a valid closure of business operations; that it is not, in any way, connected with FAPI, which is a separate and distinct corporation; that the contracts of Aris with its contractors were already terminated; and that there is no truth to the claim that its export quota with Garments and Textile Export Board was transferred to FAPI because the export quota is non-transferable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 30 October 2004, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment finding the dismissal of 5,984 complainants as illegal and awarding them separation pay and other monetary benefits amounting to P3,453,664,710.86.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision read:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises all considered, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP); declaring that complainants were illegally dismissed; ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay them separation pay at one (1) month for every year of service; backwages from the time their compensation was withheld until the promulgation of this Decision[,] P5,000.00 moral damages and P5,000.00 exemplary damages for each of them, and eight percent (8%) attorney’s fee of the total monetary award, less the separation pay they received upon closure of API.<br><br>All other claims are hereby DISMISSED.<br><br>Attached and marked as Annexes “A” to “A-117” and shall form part of this decision are the lists of complainants and their respective monetary awards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon receipt of a copy of the aforesaid decision, the Corporations filed their Notice of Appeal with Motion to Reduce Appeal Bond and To Admit Reduced Amount with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).&nbsp; They asked the NLRC to reduce the appeal bond to P1 Million each on the grounds that it is impossible for any insurance company to cover such huge amount and that, in requiring them to post in full the appeal bond would be tantamount to denying them their right to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Aris claimed that it was already dissolved and undergoing liquidation.&nbsp; SLC added that it is not the employer of Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al</i>., and that the latter had already received from Aris their separation pay and other benefits amounting to P419,057,348.24, which covers practically more than 10% of the monetary award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; FAPI, for its part, claimed that its total assets would not be enough to answer for even a small portion of the award.&nbsp; To compel it to post a bond might result in complete stoppage of operations.&nbsp; FAPI also cited the possibility that the assailed decision once reviewed will be reversed and set aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The Corporations posted a total of P4.5 Million.<br><br>Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al., </i>opposed the motion by asserting that failure to comply with the bond requirement is a jurisdictional defect since an appeal may only be perfected upon posting of a cash bond equivalent to the monetary award provided by Article 223 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In light of the impossibility for any surety company to cover the appeal bond and the huge economic losses which the companies and their employees might suffer if the P3.45 Billion bond is sustained, the NLRC granted the reduction of the appeal bond.&nbsp; The NLRC issued an Order dated 31 March 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> directing the Corporations to post an additional P4.5 Million bond, bringing the total posted bond to P9 Million.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Order provides:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondents are hereby ordered to post bond, either in cash, surety or property, in the additional amount of FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P4,500,000.00) within an INEXTENDIBLE period of FIFTEEN (15) calendar days from receipt hereof.&nbsp; To the said extent, the Motion for Reduction is granted.<br><br>Failure to render strict compliance with the Order entered herein shall render the dismissal of the appeal and the decision sought for review, as final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al.</i>, filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 96363.&nbsp; They charged the NLRC with grave abuse of discretion in giving due course to the appeal of petitioners despite the gross insufficiency of the cash bond.&nbsp; They declared that the appeal bond must be equivalent to the amount of the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Another petition, this time by Pacita Abelardo, <i>et al.,</i> was also filed before the Court of Appeals and docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 95919.<br><br>The Corporations filed a Motion to Dismiss the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 95919 on the grounds of forum-shopping, absence of authorization from the employees for Emilinda D. Macatlang to file said petition, and for failure to state the material dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>While the case was pending, the NLRC issued a Resolution on 19 December 2006 setting aside the Decision of the labor arbiter and remanding the case to the “forum of origin for further proceedings.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In view of this related development, the Corporations filed their respective Manifestation and Motion dated 30 January 2007 praying for the dismissal of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> for being moot and academic.<br><br>On 26 March 2007, the Court of Appeals proceeded to reverse and set aside the 31 March 2006 NLRC Resolution and deemed it reasonable under the circumstances of the case to order the posting of an additional appeal bond of P1 Billion.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the March 31, 2006 Decision of the 2nd Division of the National Labor Relations Commission, in NLRC NCR CA No. 046685-05, which reduced the required Php 3.453 BILLION Pesos appeal bond to a paltry 9 Million Pesos, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one issued, to ensure availability of hard cash or reliable surety, on which victorious laborers could rely, DIRECTING private respondents to POST additional appeal bond in the amount of Php 1 BILLION Pesos, in cash or surety, within thirty (30) days from finality of this judgment, as pre-requisite to perfecting appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>All parties filed their Motion for Reconsideration but were later denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated 22 October 2007.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Six (6) petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Decision of the Court of Appeals were filed before this Court.&nbsp; They were docketed and entitled as follows: 1) G.R. No. 180147: <i>Sara Lee Philippines, Inc. v. Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al.;</i> 2) G.R. No. 180148: <i>Aris Philippines, Inc. v. Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al.;</i> 3) G.R. No. 180149: <i>Sara Lee Corporation v. Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al.;</i> 4) G.R. No. 180150: <i>Cesar C. Cruz v. Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al.;</i> 5) G.R. No. 180319: <i>Fashion Accessories Phils., Inc. v. Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al.;</i> and 6) G.R. No. 180685: <i>Emilinda D. Macatlang, et al. v. NLRC.</i>&nbsp; In Resolutions dated 28 January 2008 and 18 February 2008, this Court resolved to consolidate these six (6) cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Corporations argue that the Court of Appeals committed serious error in not dismissing Emilinda D. Macatlang,<i> et al.’s</i> petition due to the filing of two (2) separate petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, namely: <i>Emilinda Macatlang, et al. v. Aris Philippines </i>in CA-G.R. SP No. 96363 (Macatlang petition) and <i>Pacita S. Abelardo v. NLRC, Aris Philippines, et al.</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 95919 (Abelardo petition).&nbsp; These two petitions, the Corporations aver, raise identical causes of action, subject matters and issues, which are clearly violative of the rule against forum-shopping.&nbsp; Moreover, the petitioners in the Abelardo petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> consist of 411 employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> all of whom are also petitioners in the Macatlang petition.&nbsp; The Corporations question the authority of Emilinda D. Macatlang to file and sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping because <i>Resolusyon Bilang</i> 09-01-1998 (<i>Resolusyon</i>) dated 5 September 1998 did not make any specific reference or authority that Emilinda D. Macatlang can sign the verification and certification against forum shopping on behalf of the other complainants.&nbsp; The Corporations claim that the Macatlang’s petition failed to state the material dates, such as when the NLRC order and resolution were received and when the motion for reconsideration thereof was filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Corporations impute another error on the Court of Appeals when it did not dismiss the petition for being moot and academic despite the fact that on 19 December 2006, the NLRC had already set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; They defend the validity of the NLRC resolution in the absence of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Corporations assail the Court of Appeals in directing the posting of an additional appeal bond of P1 Billion.&nbsp; They contend that the Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that Macatlang, <i>et al., </i>had already received their separation pay of P419 Million and P15 Million Benevolent Fund which went to the union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also failed to exclude the amount awarded to complainants as damages which under the NLRC Rules have to be excluded.&nbsp; The Corporations seek a liberal interpretation to the requirement of posting of appeal bond in that the NLRC has the power and authority to set a reduced amount of appeal bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>SLPI also adds that their right to due process was allegedly violated for the following reasons: first, it was never impleaded in the complaints; second, the requirements of service of summons by publication were not complied with as admitted by the labor arbiter himself thereby making it defective; and third, there was no showing that there was prior resort to service of summons to the duly authorized officer of the company before summons by publication was made to SLPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>FAPI slams the Court of Appeals for touching on the merits of the case when the only issue brought to its attention is the NLRC’s ruling on the appeal bond.&nbsp; FAPI argues that the Court of Appeals has no basis in stating&nbsp; that: (1) there were 7,637 employees of Aris who were already laid off and became complainants when there are in fact only 5,984 employees of Aris involved in the illegal dismissal case; (2) that the P419 Million was not proven to have been paid to the complainants when as a matter of fact, records of the NLRC revealed that the amount was actually paid by Aris to its employees; and (3) that a dummy subsidiary referring to FAPI was formed when records disclose that the ownership, incorporators, officers, capitalization, place of business, and product manufactured by FAPI and Aris are different.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Emilinda D. Macatlang,<i> et al.,</i> in their petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> assert that the appeal of the Corporations had not been perfected in accordance with Article 223 of the Labor Code when they failed to post the amount equivalent to the monetary award in the judgment appealed from amounting to P3.45 Billion.&nbsp; Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al.</i>, submit that the P1 Billion bond is not equivalent to the monetary award of P3.45 Billion.&nbsp; More importantly, Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al.,</i> accused the Court of Appeals of extending the period of appeal by prescribing an additional amount to be paid within a reasonable period of time, which period it likewise determined, in contravention of Article 223 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al.,</i> expound that the filing of a bond outside the period of appeal, even with the filing of a motion to reduce bond, would not stop the running of the period of appeal.&nbsp; Emilinda D. Macatlang, <i>et al., </i>opine that the Court of Appeals has not been conferred the power to legislate hence it should have strictly followed Article 223 of the Labor Code, as the same was clear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In an Urgent Manifestation and Motion, the Corporations informed this Court of a Resolution dated 30 March 2009 by the Third Division of this Court entitled, <i>“Gabriel Fulido, et al. v. Aris Philippines, Inc.”</i> docketed as G.R. No. 185948 (<i>Fulido</i> case) denying the petition for review filed by complainants in that case.&nbsp; The Corporations intimate that the petitioners in the <i>Fulido</i> case are also former employees of Aris whose employments were terminated as a result of Aris’ permanent closure.&nbsp; Petitioners submit that Emilinda D. Macatlang,<i> et al</i>., and petitioners in the <i>Fulido</i> case filed illegal dismissal cases before the NLRC seeking identical reliefs.&nbsp; Considering the identity in essential facts and basic issues involved, petitioners argue that there is compelling reason to adopt and incorporate by reference the conclusion reached in the <i>Fulido</i> case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The issues raised in these consolidated cases can be summarized as follows:<br><br><ol><li>Whether the filing of two (2) petitions for <i>certiorari,</i> namely: the Macatlang petition and the Abelardo petition constitutes forum shopping.<br><br></li><li>Whether Emilinda D. Macatlang was duly authorized to sign the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping attached to the Macatlang petition.<br><br></li><li>Whether the petition should be dismissed for failure to state the material dates.<br><br></li><li>Whether the service of summons by publication on SLC is defective.<br><br></li><li>Whether the subsequent NLRC ruling on the merits during the pendency of the petition questioning an interlocutory order renders the instant petition moot and academic.<br><br></li><li>Whether the appeal bond may be reduced.<br></li></ol><br>Before we proceed to the gist of this controversy, we shall resolve the first 3 procedural issues first.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>The Corporations claim that the group of Macatlang committed forum shopping by filing two petitions before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Forum shopping is the act of a litigant who repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and on the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court, to increase his chances of obtaining a favorable decision if not in one court, then in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>What is pivotal in determining whether forum shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related cases and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different courts and/or administrative agencies upon the same issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Forum shopping exists when the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, and when a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.&nbsp; For <i>litis pendentia </i>to be a ground for the dismissal of an action, there must be: (a) identity of the parties or at least such as to represent the same interest in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same acts; and (c) the identity in the two cases should be such that the judgment which may be rendered in one would, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Macatlang petition was filed on 8 September 2006 while the Abelardo petition was filed 10 days later, or on 18 September 2006.&nbsp; Indeed, these two petitions assailed the same order and resolution of the NLRC in NLRC CA No. 046685-05, entitled<i> Emilinda Macatlang, et al. v. Aris Philippines, Inc., et al., </i>and sought for the dismissal of the Corporations’ appeal for non-perfection because of failure to post the required appeal bond.&nbsp; A judgment in either case would have, if principles are correctly applied, amounted to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<br><br>At first glance, it appears that there is also identity of parties in both petitions which is indicative of forum-shopping.&nbsp; The Macatlang petition consists of 5,984 dismissed employees of Aris while the Abelardo petition has 411 dismissed employees, all of which were already included as petitioners in the Macatlang petition.&nbsp; With respect to these 411 petitioners, they could be declared guilty of forum shopping when they filed the Abelardo petition despite the pendency of the Macatlang petition.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the Abelardo petition was dismissed by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution dated 17 November 2006 on the ground of a defective certification on non-forum shopping, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; The Abelardo petition appears to be defective as the petition itself was replete with procedural infirmities prompting the Court of Appeals to dismiss it outright.&nbsp; Instead of curing the defects in their petition, petitioners in Abelardo revealed that pertinent documents which should have been attached with their petition were actually submitted before the Sixteenth Division of the Court of Appeals where the Macatlang petition was pending.&nbsp; Evidently, petitioners in Abelardo have foreknowledge of an existing petition but nevertheless proceeded to file another petition and omitting to mention it in their certification on non-forum shopping, either intentionally or not.&nbsp; Clearly, the petitioners in the Abelardo petition committed forum shopping.<br><br>Now, should the act of these 411 employees prejudice the rights of the 5,573 other complainants in the Macatlang petition?&nbsp; The answer is no. Forum shopping happens when there is identity of the parties or at least such as to represent the same interest in both actions.&nbsp; We do not agree that the 411 petitioners of the Abelardo petition are representative of the interest of all petitioners in Macatlang petition.&nbsp; First, the number is barely sufficient to comprise the majority of petitioners in Macatlang petition.&nbsp; Second, it would be the height of injustice to dismiss the Macatlang petition which evidently enjoys the support of an overwhelming majority due to the mistake committed by petitioners in the Abelardo petition.&nbsp; In the absence of substantial similarity between the parties in Macatlang and Abelardo petitions, we find that the petitioners in Macatlang petition did not commit forum shopping.&nbsp; This view was implicitly shared by the Thirteenth Division of the Court of Appeals when it did not bother to address the issue of forum shopping raised by petitioners therein precisely because at the time it rendered the assailed decision, the Abelardo petition had already been summarily dismissed.<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>Next, the Corporations complain that Macatlang was not duly authorized to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which accompanied the main petition before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; They anchored their argument on <i>Resolusyon</i>, which reads in part:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li><i>Aming binigyan ng karapatan sina </i>ERNESTO R.

The Court observed that both parties did not know about the new rule yet.<br><br>It is presumed that an appeal bond is only necessary in cases where the labor arbiter’s decision or order contains a monetary award.&nbsp; Conversely, when the labor arbiter does not state the judgment award, posting of bond may be excused.<br><br>In <i>YBL,</i> the exact total amount due to the private respondents as separation pay was not stated which would have been the basis of the bond that is required to be filed by petitioners under the said law.<br><br>From an award of backwages and overtime pay by the labor arbiter in <i>Rada v.

Approximately, the amount to be received by an employee, exclusive of damages and attorney’s fees, is about P600,000.00.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter granted moral damages amounting to P10,000.00, and another P10,000.00 as exemplary damages.&nbsp; The total number of employees receiving P20,000.00 each for damages is 5,984, bringing the total amount of damages to P119,680,000.00.&nbsp; This amount should be deducted as well as the P419 Million unpaid commitment plus the P 9 Million already paid-up cash appeal bond from the actual amount to determine the amount on which to base the appeal bond.&nbsp; Thus, the total amount is P2.9 Billion.<br><br>We sustain the Court of Appeals in so far as it increases the amount of the required appeal bond.&nbsp; But we deem it reasonable to reduce the amount of the appeal bond to <b>P725 Million</b>.&nbsp; This directive already considers that the award if not illegal, is extraordinarily huge and that no insurance company would be willing to issue a bond for such big money.&nbsp; The amount of P725 Million is approximately 25% of the basis above calculated.&nbsp; It is a balancing of the constitutional obligation of the state to afford protection to labor which, specific to this case, is assurance that in case of affirmance of the award, recovery is not negated; and on the other end of the spectrum, the opportunity of the employer to appeal.<br><br>By reducing the amount of the appeal bond in this case, the employees would still be assured of at least substantial compensation, in case a judgment award is affirmed.&nbsp; On the other hand, management will not be effectively denied of its statutory privilege of appeal.<br><br><center>VIII.<br></center><br>The Corporations invoked the decision issued by the NLRC last 19 December 2006 which set aside the labor arbiter’s decision and ordered remand of the case to the forum of origin to have the instant petitions dismissed for being moot.<br><br>When the NLRC granted the motion to reduce the appeal bond and the Corporations posted the required additional bond, the appeal was deemed to have been perfected.&nbsp; The act of the NLRC in deciding the case was based on petitioner’s appeal of the labor arbiter’s ruling, which it deemed to have been perfected and therefore, ripe for decision.<br><br>Prudence however dictates that the NLRC should not have decided the case on its merits during the pendency of the instant petition.&nbsp; The very issue raised in the petitions determines whether or not the appeal by the Corporations has been perfected.&nbsp; Until its resolution, the NLRC should have held in abeyance the resolution of the case to prevent the case from being mooted.&nbsp; The NLRC decision was issued prematurely.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 96363 dated 26 March 2007 is <b>MODIFIED</b>.&nbsp; The Corporations are directed to post <b>P725 Million</b>, in cash or surety bond, within TEN (10) days from the receipt of this <b>DECISION</b>.&nbsp; The Resolution of the NLRC dated 19 December 2006 is <b>VACATED</b> for being premature and the NLRC is DIRECTED to act with dispatch to resolve the merits of the case upon perfection of the appeal.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo, Perez</i>, and<i> Perlas-Bernabe, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Due to the sheer number of complainants, the names of the 5,983 others were omitted but which could be found in the annexes of the Labor Arbiter’s decision.&nbsp; See <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
