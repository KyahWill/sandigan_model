The assailed Certificate of Authority is a notarized document and therefore, presumed to be valid and duly executed.&nbsp; Thus, Edna See’s reliance on the notarial acknowledgment found in the duly notarized Certificate of Authority presented by Carmelita is sufficient evidence of good faith. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>A determination of whether a party is an innocent purchaser in good faith and for value involves a factual issue beyond the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Generally, factual findings of lower courts are deemed conclusive and binding upon this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; No cogent reason exists to overturn the findings of both lower courts.<br><br>Petitioners raise that “actual possession of the property by a person other than the vendor should put the purchaser in inquiry and absen[t] such inquiry[,] he cannot be regarded as a bona fide purchaser against such possessors.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>As discussed by the Court of Appeals, respondent did conduct further inquiry by relying not only on the certificate of title, but also on Florentino’s waiver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Petitioners submit that respondent bought the property knowing that Florentino and Carmelita were married.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; They then invoke Civil Code and Family Code provisions on the nature of conjugal properties and the prohibition against donations between spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Respondent counters that Florentino and Carmelita were already American citizens when they executed the marital settlement agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; She even presented before the trial court Florentino’s special power of attorney executed on March 25, 1997 to prove Florentino’s citizenship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The trial court disregarded petitioners’ argument on the applicability of our civil laws on the validity of the sale since it already deemed respondent to be an innocent purchaser in good faith and for value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court added that since “[respondent] parted with a substantial amount of P4 Million, equity dictates that she shall have possession of the property[,] [n]onetheless, Florentino Leong shall get his one-half share of the purchase price.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals discussed that Florentino was estopped from questioning the transfer of the property since he already waived all his rights, title, and interests over the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; The court also found that the intercalated proviso in the marital settlement agreement violated the mutuality of contracts principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The question of whether Florentino and Carmelita were already American citizens at the time of the property’s sale to Edna — thus no longer covered by our laws relating to family rights and duties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> — involves a factual question outside the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>In any event, respondent exerted due diligence when she ascertained the authenticity of the documents attached to the deed of sale such as the marital settlement agreement with Florentino’s waiver of interest over the property.&nbsp; She did not rely solely on the title.&nbsp; She even went to the Registry of Deeds to verify the authenticity of the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; These further inquiries were considered by the lower courts in finding respondent to be an innocent purchaser in good faith and for value.<br><br>Lastly, an allegation of fraud must be substantiated.&nbsp; Rule 8, Section 5 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Fraud, mistake, condition of the mind. – <b>In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake must be stated with particularity</b></i>.&nbsp; Malice intent, knowledge or other condition of the mind of a person may be averred generally. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In petitioners’ memorandum before this court, they mentioned the rule of fraud as an exception to the indefeasibility of title principle, but failed to substantiate their allegation by immediately concluding as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners beg to disagree with the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court and the Honorable Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Respondent Edna See is not a buyer in good faith.&nbsp; The ruling that every person can rely on the correctness of the certificate of title and that the buyer need not go beyond the four corners of the title to determine the condition of the property is not absolute and admits of exception.&nbsp; As held in the case of Remegia Feliciano vs. Sps. Zaldivar, G.R. No. 162593, 2006 Sep 26 the principle of indefeasibilty of a Torrens title does not apply where fraud attended the issuance of the title. The Torrens title does not furnish a shield for fraud.&nbsp; As such, a title issued based on void documents may be annulled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis in the original removed)<br></blockquote><br>Even assuming the procurement of title was tainted with fraud and misrepresentation, “such defective title may still be the source of a completely legal and valid title in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Respondent, an innocent purchaser in good faith and for value with title in her name, has a better right to the property than Elena.&nbsp; Elena’s possession was neither adverse to nor in the concept of owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Article 428 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 428.&nbsp; The owner has the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing, without other limitations than those established by law.<br><br>The owner has also a right of action against the holder and possessor of the thing in order to recover it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Thus, respondent had every right to pursue her claims as she did.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court of Appeals’ decision in CA-G.R.
