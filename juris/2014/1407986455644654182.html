				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To protect one's daughter is one of the noblest roles of a father. A father who defies this role is afflicted with a dysfunctional character that borders on moral depravity. Even if this breach of trust deserves the highest penalties in our legal order, it will never compensate for the daughter's deepest scars and sorrows.<br><br>This resolves the appeal, through Section 13, paragraph (c), Rule 124 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M.

Rape: When And How Committed. - Rape is committed:<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Rape is qualified when "the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The elements of qualified rape are: "(1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) [done] by force and without consent; ... (4) the victim is under eighteen years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the trial court and Court of Appeals found that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of qualified rape. This court sees no reason to depart from the findings of the lower courts. As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, AAA's recollection of the heinous acts of her father was vivid and straightforward. She was able to positively identify the accused-appellant as her sexual assailant. Her testimony was given in a "categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and candid manner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>We recently held that "[i]t is doctrinally settled that factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of the rape victim, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>As to accused-appellant's argument that the absence of hymenal lacerations admits the possibility that there was never any sexual abuse, we find our disquisition in <i>People v. Araojo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> applicable:<br><blockquote>The absence of external signs or physical injuries on the complainant's body does not necessarily negate the commission of rape, hymenal laceration not being, to repeat, an element of the crime of rape. A healed or fresh laceration would of course be a compelling proof of defloration. [However,] the foremost consideration in the prosecution of rape is the victim's testimony and not the findings of the medico-legal officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>We also disagree with accused-appellant's argument that private complainant AAA's delay in reporting the alleged rape incidents, together with the prodding of AAA's grandmother, signals the falsity of the rape allegations. In <i>People v. Delos Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> this court ruled that:<br><blockquote>The failure to immediately report the dastardly acts to her family or to the authorities at the soonest possible time or her failure to immediately change her clothes is not enough reason to cast reasonable doubt on the guilt of [accused]. This Court has repeatedly held that delay in reporting rape incidents, in the face of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the victim. Further, it has been written that a rape victim's actions are oftentimes overwhelmed by fear rather than by reason. It is this fear, springing from the initial rape, that the perpetrator hopes to build a climate of extreme psychological terror, which would, he hopes, numb his victim into silence and submissiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>To this court's mind, there can be no greater source of fear or intimidation than your own father — one who, generally, has exercised authority over your person since birth. Delay brought by fear for one's life cannot be deemed unreasonable. This court has recognized the moral ascendancy and influence the father has over his child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In cases of qualified rape, moral ascendancy or influence supplants the element of violence or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It is not only an element of the crime, but it is also a factor in evaluating whether the delay in reporting the incident was unreasonable.<br><br>Moreover, "[n]ot even the most ungrateful and resentful daughter would push her own father to the wall as the fall guy in any crime unless the accusation against him is true."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, accused-appellant's argument that AAA was forced by her grandmother to fabricate the charges fails to sway this court.<br><br>This court has held before that "mere denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It is settled that the defense of alibi and denial cannot overcome the victim's positive and categorical testimony and identification of the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Presence of other family members is not a valid defense in rape cases since rape may be carried out in the same room where the family members are staying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>With all the elements of qualified rape duly alleged and proven, the Court of Appeals was correct in modifying the trial court's decision. Under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, the proper penalty to be imposed is death. However, with the effectivity of Republic Act No. 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the imposition of death was prohibited, and the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole should be imposed instead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The suspension of the death penalty in cases where the father rapes his daughter should not, however, be misinterpreted as reducing the heinous nature of this crime. No matter how high the penalty, our legal system cannot assuage the deepest injuries caused by the abuse of trust committed by the father.<br><br>A father is supposed to be a daughter's role model of a man. He is there to protect and comfort her. With the mother, a father's love will be every daughter's assurance that however harsh the world turns out to be, he will be there for her. Fathers should inspire courage and trust within their daughters.<br><br>That a father abuses this trust to gratify his selfish carnal desires is a dastardly act. It defiles not only his daughter's person. It extinguishes all hope the daughter may have of the value of family. It skews her understanding of the honor that may be inherent in all men.<br><br>This court will never countenance such repugnant acts.<br><br>In rape cases, the award of civil indemnity is mandatory upon proof of the commission of rape, whereas moral damages are automatically awarded without the need to prove mental and physical suffering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Exemplary damages are also imposed, as example for the public good and to protect minors from all forms of sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Gambao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we increased the amounts of indemnity and damages where the proper penalty for the crime committed by the accused is death but where it cannot be imposed because of the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> We imposed as a minimum the amounts of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (PI 00,000.00) as civil indemnity; One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as moral damages; and One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as exemplary damages.<br><br>In view of the depravity of the acts in this crime committed in this case — multiple rape of a minor by her father — we further increase the amounts awarded to private complainant, AAA. Hence, we modify the award of civil indemnity from Seventy-five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P150,000.00); moral damages from Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P150,000.00); and exemplary damages from Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00).<br><br>In addition, interest at the rate of 6% per annum should be imposed on all damages awarded from the date of the finality of this judgment until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals' decision dated November 8, 2012 finding the accused-appellant Oliver Buclao guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and sentencing him to reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole, for each count of rape, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The civil indemnity awarded is increased to P150,000.00, the moral damages to P150,000.00, and the exemplary damages to P100,000.00, for each of the two counts of rape.
