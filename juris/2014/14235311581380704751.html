Court of Appeals and Guido, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The case stemmed from a complaint, filed by the Republic of the Philippines, for declaration of nullity of Decree No. 6145, the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 23377, and all titles derived from the decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The Republic also prayed that the land covered by the decree be declared in its name, except those parcels of land validly acquired by third persons.&nbsp; According to the Republic, Decree No. 6145 was spurious and false and, in turn, the reconstituted TCT No. 23377, as well as the derivative titles, was invalid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that Decree No. 6145 and TCT No. 23377 were genuine and authentic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This court in <i>Republic</i> upheld the authenticity and validity of Decree No. 6145 and TCT No. 23377.&nbsp; However, in affirming respondent heirs’ title, this court recognized the waiver of certain parts of the land covered by TCT No. 23377 in favor of bona fide occupants.&nbsp; The court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, conscious of the resulting “largescale dispossession and social displacement of several hundreds of <i>bona fide</i> occupants and their families” which the Solicitor General pointed out, the private respondent agreed unanimously to accept the alternative prayer of the petitioner in their joint memorandum (pp. 624–636, Rollo). This agreement by private respondents takes the form of a waiver. Though a valid and clear right over the property exists in their favors, they seemingly have voluntarily abandoned the same in favor of: <i>1) those who possessed and actually occupied specific portions and obtained torrens certificates of titles, and 2) those who possessed certain specific portions for such lengths of time as to amount to full ownership.</i> The waiver, not being contrary to law, morals, good customs and good policy, is valid and binding on the private respondents.<br><br><i>However, with respect to the second set of possessors, whose alleged bona fide occupancy of specific portions of the property is not evidenced by Torrens Titles, it is imperative that their claims/occupancy be duly proven in an appropriate proceeding.</i><br><br>ACCORDINGLY, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 12933 is AFFIRMED subject to the herein declared superior rights of<i> bona fide</i> occupants with registered titles within the area covered by the questioned decree and <i>bona fide </i>occupants therein with length of possession which had ripened to ownership, the latter to be determined in an appropriate proceeding.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Citing the case above, the Land Registration Authority prayed the following before the trial court in its report and motion:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court to issue an order (1) directing the Register of Deeds of Rizal, Binangonan, Rizal to annotate on <b>TCT No. M-2106</b> the following memorandum:<br><blockquote><i>By virtue of the decision of the Court dated January 30, 2008 in Land Reg.

No. 84966, promulgated on November 21, 1991, entitled Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals and Antonina Guido, et al., (204 SCRA 160), afore-said [sic] lot is deemed excluded from this certificate of title.</i><br></blockquote>and (2) Authorizing this Authority to issue the corresponding decree of registration for the land embraced in plan <b>Psu-04-006561</b>, in accordance with the adjudication of the Honorable Court in its decision January 30, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis and italics in the original)</blockquote><br>According to Canlas, she falls under the second set of possessors described in <i>Republic</i> — bona fide occupants whose possession of specific portions for such lengths of time amounted to full ownership but whose occupancy must be duly proved in appropriate proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In sum, Canlas changed the theory of her case from an application for original registration of land, to a declaration of a right to an indefeasible registrable title of the land described in plan Psu-04-006561 and covered by TCT No. 23377.<br><br>Despite the change in Canlas’ theory, the main issues to be resolved are: 1) whether petitioner Luzviminda A. Canlas has proven open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the land described in plan Psu-04-006561; and 2) whether Psu-04-006561 is covered by TCT No. 23377 wherein she is one of the bona fide occupants whose possession and occupation ripened into an indefeasible right to title as pronounced in <i>Republic.</i><br><br>After considering the parties’ arguments and the records of this case, this court resolves to grant the petition.&nbsp; The assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are reversed and set aside.&nbsp; The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings with regard to the determination of whether Psu-04-006561 is covered by TCT No. 23377.<br><br>At the outset, the issue on sufficiency of evidence is factual in nature and is generally outside the province of this court’s review of petitions under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; However, exceptions are allowed when the findings of the trial court and Court of Appeals are conflicting with each other<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> or when the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> such as the case at bar.<br><br>Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> or the Property Registration Decree governs the applications for registration of title to land:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14. Who may apply. The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<br><br>(2) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provision of existing laws.<br><br>(3) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under the existing laws.<br><br>(4) Those who have acquired ownership of land in any other manner provided for by law.<br><br>Where the land is owned in common, all the co-owners shall file the application jointly.</blockquote><br>Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 proceeds from Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141 or The Public Land Act, as amended, which provides for the grant of the substantive right of title to land to qualified persons:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 48. The following-described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor under the Land Registration Act, to wit:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and, occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition or ownership, since June 12, 1945, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or force majeure. Those shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (As amended by P.D. 1073.)</blockquote><br>In land registration cases, the applicants’ legal basis is important in determining the required number of years or the reference point for possession or prescription.&nbsp; This court has delineated the differences in the modes of acquiring imperfect titles under Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.&nbsp; <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> extensively discussed the distinction between Section 14(1) and Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529.&nbsp; Thus, this court laid down rules to guide the public:<br><br><blockquote>(1) In connection with Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree, Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act recognizes and confirms that “those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945” have acquired ownership of, and registrable title to, such lands based on the length and quality of their possession.<br><br><blockquote>(a) Since Section 48(b) merely requires possession since 12 June 1945 and does not require that the lands should have been alienable and disposable during the entire period of possession, the possessor is entitled to secure judicial confirmation of his title thereto as soon as it is declared alienable and disposable, subject to the timeframe imposed by Section 47 of the Public Land Act.<br><br>(b) The right to register granted under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act is further confirmed by Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree.<br></blockquote><br>(2) In complying with Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree, consider that under the Civil Code, prescription is recognized as a mode of acquiring ownership of patrimonial property. However, public domain lands become only patrimonial property not only with a declaration that these are alienable or disposable. There must also be an express government manifestation that the property is already patrimonial or no longer retained for public service or the development of national wealth, under Article 422 of the Civil Code. And only when the property has become patrimonial can the prescriptive period for the acquisition of property of the public dominion begin to run.<br><br><blockquote>(a) Patrimonial property is private property of the government. The person [who] acquires ownership of patrimonial property by prescription under the Civil Code is entitled to secure registration thereof under Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree.<br><br>(b) There are two kinds of prescription by which patrimonial property may be acquired, one ordinary and [the] other extraordinary. Under ordinary acquisitive prescription, a person acquires ownership of a patrimonial property through possession for at least ten (10) years, in good faith and with just title. Under extraordinary acquisitive prescription, a person’s uninterrupted adverse possession of patrimonial property for at least thirty (30) years, regardless of good faith or just title, ripens into ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>In <i>Republic v. Gielczyk</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this court summarized and affirmed the differences between Section 14(1) and Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 as discussed in <i>Heirs of Malabanan</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic,</i> the Court further clarified the difference between Section 14(1) and Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529. The former refers to registration of title on the basis of possession, while the latter entitles the applicant to the registration of his property on the basis of prescription. Registration under the first mode is extended under the aegis of the P.D. No. 1529 and the Public Land Act (PLA) while under the second mode is made available both by P.D. No. 1529 and the Civil Code. Moreover, under Section 48(b) of the PLA, as amended by Republic Act No. 1472, the 30-year period is in relation to possession without regard to the Civil Code, while under Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529, the 30-year period involves extraordinary prescription under the Civil Code, particularly Article 1113 in relation to Article 1137.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals clarified under which paragraph of Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 the land was being registered.&nbsp; However, petitioner’s allegations in the application filed on August 22, 2006 established Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 as her legal basis. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>An applicant for land registration or judicial confirmation of incomplete or imperfect title under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 must prove the following requisites: “(1) that the subject land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain, and (2) that [the applicant has] been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the same under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Concomitantly, the burden to prove these requisites rests on the applicant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>With regard to the first requisite, it is undisputed that the land subject of registration is part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain.&nbsp; The trial court found the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ report sufficient to prove the existence of the first requisite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals’ decision was silent on this matter. Respondent failed to make objections on the issue as well.&nbsp; Thus, we do not see any reason to deviate from the findings of the lower courts.<br><br>As to the second requisite, petitioner claims that she “by herself, and through [her] predecessors-in-interest, had since June 12, 1945 or earlier[,] been in open[,] continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the . . . parcel of land.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals found that petitioner failed to prove with sufficient evidence her open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the land.&nbsp; Likewise, respondent argued that petitioner’s allegations of possession and occupation were mere conclusions and unsubstantiated.<br><br>Petitioner has sufficiently overcome the burden of proof required in a judicial confirmation of incomplete or imperfect title to land.<br><br>Contrary to respondent’s arguments, the trial court specifically found that petitioner’s possession and occupation, through her predecessors-in-interest, started earlier than June 12, 1945.&nbsp; The trial court found:<br><br><blockquote>Applicant’s evidence shows that she complied with the notice requirements (Exhibits “A” to [“]M,” inclusive of submarkings) and she was able to substantiate the allegations in her application (Exhibits “N” to “II,” inclusive of submarkings). <b><i>In a nutshell, applicant acquired the property by inheritance from Honorio and Gregorio S. Apran and she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in its continuous possession since 1900</i></b> (Exhibits “Q” to “HH,” inclusive of submarkings). . . . <i>The testimonies of the applicant and her witnesses proved that the applicant through her predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of an alienable and disposable parcel of land of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership for more than 30 years</i>. After considering the report and the evidence, we find that the applicant has sufficient title proper for registration, and we render judgment confirming it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis and italics supplied)</blockquote><br>Possession involves committing acts of dominion over a parcel of land in such a way that an owner would perform over his or her property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; In explaining the nature of the terms “possession and occupation” provided in law, this court has held that:<br><br><blockquote>The law speaks of <i>possession and occupation</i>. Since these words are separated by the conjunction and, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the other. Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession. When, therefore, the law adds the word <i>occupation</i>, it seeks to delimit the all encompassing effect of constructive possession. Taken together with the words open, continuous, exclusive and notorious, the word <i>occupation</i> serves to highlight the fact that for an applicant to qualify, his possession must not be a mere fiction. Actual possession of a land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Italics in the original)</blockquote><br>Moreover, to qualify as open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation, the possession must be of the following character:<br><br><blockquote>Possession is open when it is patent, visible, apparent, notorious and not clandestine.

Lands that are not clearly under private ownership are also presumed to belong to the State and, therefore, may not be alienated or disposed;<br><br>(2) The following are excepted from the general rule, to wit:<br><br>(a) Agricultural lands of the public domain are rendered alienable and disposable through any of the exclusive modes enumerated under Section 11 of the <i>Public Land Act.</i> If the mode is judicial confirmation of imperfect title under Section 48(b) of the <i>Public Land Act</i>, the agricultural land subject of the application needs only to be classified as alienable and disposable as of the time of the application, provided the applicant’s possession and occupation of the land dated back to June 12, 1945, or earlier. Thereby, a conclusive presumption that the applicant has performed all the conditions essential to a government grant arises, and the applicant becomes the owner of the land by virtue of an imperfect or incomplete title. By legal fiction, the land has already ceased to be part of the public domain and has become private property.<br><br>(b) Lands of the public domain subsequently classified or declared as no longer intended for public use or for the development of national wealth are removed from the sphere of public dominion and are considered converted into patrimonial lands or lands of private ownership that may be alienated or disposed through any of the modes of acquiring ownership under the <i>Civil Code</i>. If the mode of acquisition is prescription, whether ordinary or extraordinary, proof that the land has been already converted to private ownership prior to the requisite acquisitive prescriptive period is a condition sine qua non in observance of the law (Article 1113, Civil Code) that property of the State not patrimonial in character shall not be the object of prescription.” (Heirs of Mario Malabanan v.

The RTC should have tackled evidence of such nature with a disposition to incredulity, if not with an outright rejection.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The following were attached to petitioner’s application: a) Approved Plan; b) Technical Description; c) Surveyor’s Certificate; d) Tax Declaration; e) <i>Kasulatan ng Paghahati-hati ng Lupang Labas sa Hukuman ng Yumaong Honorio Apran na may Pagpapapaubaya sa Karapatan</i>; and f) Certification of Present Declared Owner and Present Value.

Jurisprudence is clear that the absence of oppositors in a land registration case does not automatically mean a meritorious case absent clear and convincing evidence of actual possession and occupation. However, petitioner has sufficiently overcome the burden of proof required in land registration cases, as discussed earlier.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In its decision promulgated on November 10, 2011, the Court of Appeals stated that it denied the appeal-in-intervention filed by the heirs of Lorenza F.
