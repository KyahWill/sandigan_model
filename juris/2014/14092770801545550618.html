Thus, it would be inequitable to base the amount of just compensation on the guidelines provided by PD 27 and EO 228 when the seizure of the subject land took place after the enactment of RA 6657<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> on June 15, 1988. The acquisition of the subject land having been initiated only in 1995, the LBP valuation using the formula under EO 228 was confiscatory, as just compensation should constitute the full and fair equivalent of the property when it is taken. Considering that the agrarian reform process remained incomplete as the payment of the just compensation for the subject land has yet to be made, and in view of the passage of RA 6657 in the interim, the CA upheld the RTC valuation as having been computed in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The motions for reconsideration filed by the DAR and the LBP were denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated June 12, 2008, hence, the instant petition by the DAR which was subsequently consolidated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> with the LBP’s petition in <b>G.R.

This means that PD 27 and EO 228 only apply when there are <i>gaps</i> in RA 6657; where RA 6657 is sufficient, PD 27 and EO 228 are superseded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>For purposes of determining just compensation, the fair market value of an expropriated property is determined by its <i>character </i>and its <i>price</i> at the time of <i>taking</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In addition, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>i.e</i>., (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land, (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties, (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property, and the income therefrom, (<i>d</i>) the owner's sworn valuation, (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations, (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors, (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (<i>h</i>) the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.<br><br>The Court has gone over the records and observed that the only factors considered by the RTC in determining the just compensation for the subject land were (<i>a</i>) the acquisition price of a 5.5825-ha. landholding situated in the same locality paid to the owner on November 17, 1997,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the market value of the subject land declared by the respondents, without a showing that the other factors under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, were even taken into account or, otherwise, found to be inapplicable, contrary to what the law requires. Consequently, the CA erred in upholding the RTC’s valuation as having been made in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended.<br><br>This, considering too that the records of <b>AGR. Case No. 1163-G</b> on <b>LBP’s petition for review</b>, docketed as G.R. Nos. 183298-99, had already been remanded to the RTC, the Court finds that there is a need to make a similar remand of <b>DAR’s present petition in this case also stemming from AGR. Case No. 1163-G to the same RTC</b> for the determination of just compensation in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended. Aside from the requirement and need to apply the factors under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, this course of action is also meant to avoid the possibility of any conflict or inconsistency with any eventual ruling in AGR. Case No. 1163-G. To this end, the RTC is hereby directed to observe the following guidelines in the remand of the case:<br><br><b><u>1.</u></b> <b><i>Just compensation must be valued at the time of taking</i></b>, or the time when the landowner was deprived of the use and benefit of his property, such as when title is transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Hence, the evidence to be presented by the parties before the trial court for the valuation of the subject land must be based on the <u>values prevalent on such time of taking for like agricultural lands</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><u>2.</u> <i>The evidence must conform with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its amendment by RA 9700</i></b>.

In the event that the respondents had already withdrawn the amount deposited by the LBP, the withdrawn amount should be deducted from the final land valuation to be paid by LBP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b><u>3</u>. <i>The Regional Trial Court may impose interest on the just compensation award as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In previous cases, the Court has allowed the grant of legal interest in expropriation cases where there is delay in the payment since the just compensation due to the landowners was deemed to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Legal interest shall be pegged at the rate of 12% interest per annum (p.a.). from the time of taking until June 30, 2013 only.

Heirs of Maximo Puyat</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he determination of just compensation is a judicial function; hence, courts cannot be unduly restricted in their determination thereof. To do so would deprive the courts of their judicial prerogatives and reduce them to the bureaucratic function of inputting data and arriving at the valuation. While the courts should be mindful of the different formulae created by the DAR in arriving at just compensation, they are not strictly bound to adhere thereto if the situations before them do not warrant it. <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i> thoroughly discusses this issue, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>“x x x [T]he basic formula and its alternatives–administratively determined (as it is not found in Republic Act No. 6657, but merely set forth in DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998)–although referred to and even applied by the courts in certain instances, does not and cannot strictly bind the courts. To insist that the formula must be applied with utmost rigidity whereby the valuation is drawn following a strict mathematical computation goes beyond the intent and spirit of the law. The suggested interpretation is strained and would render the law inutile. Statutory construction should not kill but give life to the law. As we have established in earlier jurisprudence, the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which is vested in the regional trial court acting as a SAC, and not in administrative agencies. The SAC, therefore, must still be able to reasonably exercise its judicial discretion in the evaluation of the factors for just compensation, which cannot be arbitrarily restricted by a formula dictated by the DAR, an administrative agency. Surely, DAR AO No. 5 did not intend to straightjacket the hands of the court in the computation of the land valuation. While it provides a formula, it could not have been its intention to shackle the courts into applying the formula in every instance. The court shall apply the formula after an evaluation of the three factors, or it may proceed to make its own computation based on the extended list in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which includes other factors[.]<br><br>x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> insofar as it seeks to sustain the valuation of the 21.2192-hectare portion of respondents' property made by the Land Bank of the Philippines.
