THUS, THE [CA] SHOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED THE FIRST AND SECOND RTC ORDERS.<br><br>2. THE RTC-MAKATI PROPERLY DENIED THE APPLICATION FOR SUBPOENA AS THERE WAS NO PROPER GROUND FOR GRANTING THE SAME.<br><br>B.

IN ANY CASE, THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS HAS NO MERIT AND WAS PROPERLY DENIED BY THE RTC-MAKATI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>Stripped of the non-essentials, the core issue is whether the CA erred in giving due course to the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, and in subsequently granting the same despite evident procedural lapses.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner assails the propriety of the CA’s reversal of the Orders of the RTC, positing that in filing the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, respondents failed to observe procedural rules. First, no motion for reconsideration of the Order dated November 29, 2002, denying respondents’ Motion to Suppress, was filed prior to the filing of the Petition for <i>Certiorari.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Second, more than 60-days had lapsed from the time respondents were notified of the denial of their Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated July 11, 2002, which denied their application for subpoena<i> duces tecum.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Third, respondents failed to indicate the date they received the Orders dated July 11, 2002 and October 10, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Given the foregoing procedural infirmities, petitioner contends the CA should not have entertained the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> much more granted affirmative relief.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, insist that their failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the Order dated November 29, 2002 is not fatal as the rule is subject to exceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In this case, respondents no longer filed a motion for reconsideration as they already moved in open court for a reconsideration of the denial of their Motion to Suppress but the RTC flatly denied the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As to the alleged non-compliance with the 60-day period, respondents brush aside the issue arguing that technical rules cannot prevent the CA from giving due course to a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, which it considers to be meritorious.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Petition has merit.<br><br>Assailed in the Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>filed before the CA are three Orders, to wit:<br><br>1) The Order dated July 11, 2002, denying respondents’ application for subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>;<br><br>2) The Order dated October 10, 2002, denying respondents’ Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated July 11, 2002; and<br><br>3) The Order dated November 29, 2002, denying respondents’ Motion to Suppress.<br><br>We shall first discuss the Orders dated July 11, 2002 and October 10, 2002.<br><br><b><i>The Petition for Certiorari should have<br>been filed within 60 days from notice of the<br>denial of the Motion for Reconsideration of<br>the assailed Order.</i></b><br><br>Section 4,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> should be instituted within 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution, or from the notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration of the judgment, order, or resolution being assailed. The 60-day period, however, is inextendible to avoid any unreasonable delay, which would violate the constitutional rights of parties to a speedy disposition of their cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, strict compliance of this rule is mandatory and imperative. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> But like all rules, the 60-day limitation may be relaxed “for the most persuasive of reasons,” which must be sufficiently shown by the party invoking liberality. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondents were notified of the denial of their Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated July 11, 2002, denying their application for subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>, on October 18, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Accordingly, they had until December 17, 2002 within which to file a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the CA. Records, however, show that it was only on January 20, 2003 that respondents filed their Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> to assail the Orders dated July 11, 2002 and October 10, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Instead of admitting that more than 60 days had lapsed, respondents kept silent about it in their Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>. When petitioner brought up the issue, respondents’ reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> was unresponsive. In fact, they did not even confirm or deny the alleged lapse of the 60-day period. Siding with respondent, the CA opted not to discuss the issue and resolved to reverse the Order dated July 11, 2002 on the ground that the granting of the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> was necessary in order for respondents to substantiate their Motion to Suppress.<br><br>The CA’s reasoning, however, even if true, does not excuse respondents from complying with the 60-day period rule, especially since they have not offered any plausible justification for their non-compliance. In fact, their adamant refusal to admit the obvious truth as well as their deliberate attempt to hide this procedural lapse cannot be ignored. Leniency is given only to those deserving of it. In this case, respondents are not entitled to any because they intentionally omitted to indicate in their Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> the date they were notified of the Order dated October 10, 2002 in order to mislead the CA. Besides, relaxing the rule would not only be unfair and unjust but would also be prejudicial to petitioner, who had every right to believe that the Orders dated July 11, 2002 and October 10, 2002 had attained finality and may no longer be altered, modified, or reversed. As we have said, the 60-day limitation may be relaxed only for the most persuasive reasons and only in meritorious cases, which must be sufficiently shown by the party invoking liberality. Such is not the situation in this case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find that the CA erred in giving due course to the Petition and in reversing the Orders dated July 11, 2002 and October 10, 2002, as they may no longer be disturbed, after having attained finality.<br><br><b><i>In the absence of a motion for <br>reconsideration, the Petition for<br> Certiorari should have been dismissed.</i></b><br><br>Jurisprudence consistently holds that the filing of a motion for reconsideration is a prerequisite to the institution of a petition for <i>certiorari.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Although this rule is subject to certain exceptions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> none of which is present in this case.<br><br>Respondents admit that they failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the Order dated November 29, 2002 prior to filing the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>. As an excuse, they alleged that their counsel verbally moved for a reconsideration of the denial of their Motion to Suppress, which the RTC flatly denied in open court. Such allegation, however, as aptly pointed out by petitioner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> is not supported by the evidence as the Order dated November 29, 2002 made no mention of such fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It is also unlikely for respondents’ counsel to have moved for a reconsideration of the said Order considering that, as stated in the Order, he appeared only after the hearings were over.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Besides, the lower court should first be informed of its supposed error and be allowed to correct or rectify the same through a re-examination of the legal and factual aspects of the case, which could only be done by filing a motion for reconsideration of the assailed order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> This respondents failed to do. Thus, in the absence of a motion for reconsideration, the CA erred in giving due course to the Petition and in reversing the Order dated November 29, 2002.<br><br>In closing, we must emphasize that while litigation is not a game of technicalities, this does not mean that procedural rules may be ignored at will or that their non-observance may be dismissed simply because it may prejudice a party’s substantial rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Mere invocations of substantial justice and liberality are not enough for the court to suspend procedural rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Again, except only for the most compelling or persuasive reasons, procedural rules must be followed to facilitate the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
