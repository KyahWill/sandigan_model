				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before this Court is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 04053 affirming the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. Q-04-129946 rendered by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 82 of Quezon City.&nbsp; The RTC Decision found Joy Alcala <i>y</i> Novilla (accused) guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (R.A. No. 9165), otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The accused was charged under the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> docketed as Criminal Case No. Q-04-129946 for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 30<sup>th</sup> day of September, 2004, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did, then and there, willfully (sic) and unlawfully sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as broker in the said transaction, zero point zero two (0.02) gram of white crystalline substance containing methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to said charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br>The factual findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the appellate court, are stated as follows:<br><br><blockquote><u>The Version of the Prosecution</u><br><br>Around 5 o’clock in the afternoon of September 30, 2004, a female informant came to the Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Force of the Central Police District, Station 11, Quezon City, to report the illegal drug activities of a certain alias Joy in the vicinity of Lantana St., Barangay Immaculate Conception, Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; Thereupon, P/Insp. Erwin Guevarra formed a buy-bust team composed of SPO1 Mario Abong, PO2 Anthony Pamiliar, PO3 Jose Castuciano, PO2 Jonathan Caranza and PO2 Erwin Bautista, who was designated as poseur buyer.&nbsp; The team was briefed on the details of the buy-bust operation against alias Joy and PO2 Bautista was given buy-bust money, a one hundred peso bill, which he marked with his initials “EB”.&nbsp; Thereafter, a pre-operation report was prepared.<br><br>Past 6:00 p.m. of the same day, the team arrived at the target area.&nbsp; The informant and Bautista sought alias Joy, who was later identified as appellant, Joy Alcala.&nbsp; The rest of the operatives followed at a distance and positioned themselves according to their plan.&nbsp; Along Lantana St., the informant saw and approached appellant.&nbsp; He introduced PO2 Bautista as a buyer of shabu.&nbsp; Then, appellant asked him, “<i>Iiskor kayo, magkano</i>?” PO2 Bautista replied “<i>piso lang</i>”, meaning P100.00 worth of shabu.&nbsp; Appellant took a small plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from the right front pocket of her pants and then asked for payment.&nbsp; PO2 Bautista handed her the marked money and then took the plastic sachet from appellant.&nbsp; Thereafter, PO2 Bautista lighted a cigarette, the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated.&nbsp; The other members of the team converged on the scene and arrested appellant.&nbsp; Appellant was asked to empty her pockets, after which, the buy bust money was recovered.<br><br>Appellant was brought to the police station.&nbsp; Thereat, the confiscated plastic sachet was marked by PO2 Bautista with the letters “EB-JA”.&nbsp; He then and turned it over to the duty desk officer, PO3 Castuciano, who prepared the standard request for laboratory examination.&nbsp; The specimen and the request were brought by PO2 Pamiliar to the PNP Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; After a qualitative examination conducted by forensic chemist, Victor Calub Drapete, it was reported that the contents of the plastic sachet EB-JA proved positive for the presence of methylamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug.<br><br><u>The Defense Version</u><br><br>On September 30, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> appellant accompanied her friend, alias Baba, to Police Station 11, purportedly, to talk to a very important person there.&nbsp; However, while they were in the station, she was arrested and ordered detained by the woman whom alias Baba talked to.&nbsp; She kept crying inside the detention cell but nobody helped her.&nbsp; She did not see her friend nor the woman anymore.&nbsp; Appellant vehemently denies the accusation against her and claims that she does not know the cause of her detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Ruling of the RTC</i></b><br></center><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of which is hereunder quoted as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused <b>JOY ALCALA y NOVILLA <i>guilty</i></b> beyond reasonable doubt of a violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.&nbsp; Accordingly, she is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of<b> LIFE IMPRISONMENT</b> and to pay a fine in the amount of<b> Five Hundred Thousand</b> (P500,000.00) <b>PESOS</b>.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Court is hereby directed to transmit to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency the dangerous drugs subject hereof for proper disposition and final disposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court concluded that the evidence presented by the prosecution sufficiently satisfied the quantum required for accused’s conviction.&nbsp; It found the testimonies of the police officers who participated in the buy-bust operation credible and reliable since absence of any showing of ill-motive on their part to concoct trumped-up charges, they enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, the denial of the accused was found to be unsubstantiated by any convincing and credible evidence.&nbsp; Hence, being considered as a negative, weak, and self-serving evidence, accused’s bare denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the prosecution’s witnesses and the physical evidence which supported said judgment of conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b><br></center><br>On intermediate appellate review, the CA affirmed the RTC’s Decision convicting the accused.&nbsp; It ruled that the prosecution was able to sufficiently bear out the statutory elements of the crime.&nbsp; The elements of the sale of illegal drugs between accused and PO2 Erwin Bautista (PO2 Bautista), as poseur-buyer, have been duly established by the prosecution, considering that there was actual delivery of the prohibited drug to the poseur-buyer and actual receipt by the seller of the marked money.&nbsp; These established factual findings consummated the buy-bust transaction between the entrapping police officers and the drug dealer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the appellate court held that failure to comply with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 will not render the arrest of the accused illegal, nor will it result to the inadmissibility in evidence of the illegal drugs seized in the course of the entrapment operation.&nbsp; What is of utmost relevance is the preservation of the integrity and maintenance of the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal drugs, for in the end, the same shall necessarily be the thrust that shall determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. The prosecution, therefore, must simply show that the seized item recovered from accused was the same item presented in court and found to be an illegal/prohibited drug.&nbsp; These were all established and proven beyond reasonable doubt in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In addition, the CA gave no credence to the defense of the accused of denial.&nbsp; It ruled that a denial is a weak defense which cannot prevail against the positive testimony of the police officers acting in the performance of their official duty, which appeared more credible and adequately supported by evidence on record.&nbsp; Thus, a denial which is unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence is not worthy of credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, it pointed out that any allegation of a violation of fundamental rights during custodial investigation is relevant and material only in cases where extrajudicial admission or confession extracted from the accused becomes the basis of their conviction.&nbsp; Since no such extrajudicial admission or confession was extracted from appellant during her custodial investigation in the present case, such argument was therefore unmeritorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Upon elevation of this case before this Court, the Office of the Solicitor General manifested that it will no longer file its supplemental brief and, instead, will adopt all the arguments in its brief filed before the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; While in the Supplemental Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> filed by accused through the Public Attorney’s Office, she raises the issue that the court<i> a quo</i> gravely erred in convicting the accused notwithstanding the prosecution’s failure to establish the chain of custody and integrity of the alleged seized illegal drugs for failure to comply with the mandatory procedures under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is her contention that the court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in convicting the accused despite the prosecution’s failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>Whether or not the RTC and the CA erred in finding that the evidence of the prosecution was sufficient to convict the accused of the alleged sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, in violation of Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Court finds no merit in the appeal.<br><br>We find no valid reason to depart from the time-honored doctrine that where the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, and in this case their testimonies as well, the findings of the trial court are not to be disturbed unless the consideration of certain facts of substance and value, which have been plainly overlooked, might affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Upon perusal of the records of the case, we see no reason to reverse or modify the findings of the RTC on the credibility of the testimony of the prosecution’s witnesses, less so in the present case, in which its findings were affirmed by the CA.&nbsp; It is worthy to mention that, in addition to the legal presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duty, the court <i>a quo</i> was in the best position to weigh the evidence presented during trial and ascertain the credibility of the police officers who testified as to the conduct of the buy-bust operation and in preserving the integrity of the seized illegal drug.<br><br>Nonetheless, for academic discussion, it has been consistently ruled that for the successful prosecution of offenses involving the illegal sale of drugs under Article II, Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165, the following elements must be proven: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, object and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, there is a need to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually sold and delivered a prohibited drug to another, and that the former indeed knew that what she had sold and delivered to the latter was a prohibited drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; To reiterate, what is material to the prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, plus the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Certainly, based on the evidence in record, the prosecution had indeed established that there was a buy-bust operation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> conducted, showing that accused-appellant sold and delivered the <i>shabu</i> for P100.00 to PO2 Bautista, the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; PO2 Bautista himself testified that there was an actual exchange of the marked-money and the prohibited drug.&nbsp; Likewise, accused was fully aware that what she was selling was illegal and prohibited when she asked PO2 Bautista <i>“iiskor kayo, magkano?</i>”&nbsp; Thereafter, the <i>corpus delicti </i>or the subject drug was seized, marked, and subsequently identified as a prohibited drug.&nbsp; Taken collectively, the illegal sale of dangerous drugs by accused-appellant was indeed established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>It cannot be overemphasized that in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, as amended, credence should be given to the narration of the incident by the prosecution witnesses especially when they are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; In this regard, the defense failed to show any ill motive or odious intent on the part of the police operatives to impute such a serious crime that would put in jeopardy the life and liberty of an innocent person, such as in the case of accused.&nbsp; Incidentally, if these were simply trumped-up charges against her, there remains a question of why no administrative charges were brought against the police officers.&nbsp; Moreover, in weighing the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of the defense, it is a well-settled rule that in the absence of palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the trial court’s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Again, in the absence of any showing that substantial or relevant facts bearing on the elements of the crime have been misapplied or overlooked, this Court can only accord full credence to such factual assessment of the trial court which had the distinct advantage of observing the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses during the trial.&nbsp; Absent any proof of motive to falsely charge an accused of such a grave offense, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses shall prevail over his/her bare allegation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, this Court has time and again adopted the chain of custody rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> a method of authenticating evidence which requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.&nbsp; This would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.&nbsp; These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>It is essential for the prosecution to prove that the prohibited drug confiscated or recovered from the suspect is the very same substance offered in court as exhibit.&nbsp; Its identity must be established with unwavering exactitude for it to lead to a finding of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>However, as correctly pointed out by the RTC and the CA, failure to strictly comply with the prescribed procedures in the inventory of seized drugs does not render an arrest of the accused illegal or the items seized/confiscated from her inadmissible.&nbsp; What is essential is “the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>From the point of view of jurisprudence, we are not beating any new path by holding that the failure to undertake the required photography and immediate marking of seized items may be excused by the unique circumstances of a case.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Resurreccion,</i> we already stated that “marking upon immediate confiscation" does not exclude the possibility that marking can be at the police station or office of the apprehending team.&nbsp; In the cases of <i>People v. Rusiana, People v. Hernandez,</i> and<i> People v. Gum-Oyen,</i> the apprehending team marked the confiscated items at the police station and not at the place of seizure. Nevertheless, we sustained the conviction because the evidence showed that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items seized had been preserved.&nbsp; To reiterate what we have held in past cases, <b>we are not always looking for the strict step-by-step adherence to the procedural requirements; what is important is to ensure the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would determine the guilt or innocence of the accused</b>.&nbsp; We succinctly explained this in <i>People v. Del Monte</i> when we held:<br><br><blockquote><b>We would like to add that non-compliance with Section 21 of said law, particularly the making of the inventory and the photographing of the drugs confiscated and/or seized, will not render the drugs inadmissible in evidence</b>.&nbsp; Under Section 3 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court, evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is not excluded by the law or these rules.&nbsp; For evidence to be inadmissible, there should be a law or rule which forbids its reception.&nbsp; If there is no such law or rule, the evidence must be admitted subject only to the evidentiary weight that will [be] accorded it by the courts. x x x<br><br><b>We do not find any provision or statement in said law or in any rule that will bring about the non-admissibility of the confiscated and/or seized drugs due to non-compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; The issue therefore, if there is non-compliance with said section, is not of admissibility, but of weight — evidentiary merit or probative value — to be given the evidence.</b> The weight to be given by the courts on said evidence depends on the circumstances obtaining in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>From the testimonies of the police officers in the case at bench, the prosecution established that they had custody of the drug seized from the accused from the moment she was arrested, during the time she was transported to the police station, and up to the time the drug was submitted to the crime laboratory for examination.&nbsp; The same witnesses also identified the seized drug with certainty when this was presented in court.&nbsp; With regard to the handling of the seized drugs, there are no conflicting testimonies or glaring inconsistencies that would cast doubt on the integrity thereof as evidence presented and scrutinized in court.&nbsp; It is therefore safe to conclude that, to the unprejudiced mind, the testimonies show without a doubt that the evidence seized from the accused at the time of the buy-bust operation was the same one tested, introduced, and testified to in court.&nbsp; This fact was further bolstered by the stipulations entered into between the parties as to the testimony of forensic chemist, P/Insp. Victor Drapete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, there is no question as to the integrity of the evidence against accused.<br><br>To reiterate, although this Court finds that the police officers did not strictly comply with the requirements of Article II, Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, such noncompliance did not affect the evidentiary weight of the drug seized from the accused, because the chain of custody of the evidence was shown to be unbroken under the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; As correctly found by the appellate court, the drug confiscated from the accused was properly accounted for and forthrightly submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory for its extensive examination.&nbsp; The CA further ruled that nothing invited the suspicion that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized articles were jeopardized.<br><br>In fine, considering the pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution, the denial of the accused fails.&nbsp; Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense.&nbsp; As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who testify clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R.
