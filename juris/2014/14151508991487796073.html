There was, according to the CA, breach of contract on the part of PNB that warranted the annulment and cancellation of the Supplement to REM covering the Greenhills property.&nbsp; Further, the CA rejected PNB’s claim that its refusal to release the balance of the last loan was due to the respondents’ failure to comply with the undertaking of bringing new investors with additional collaterals to secure the additional loan as such requirement was not categorically stated in the terms of the credit agreement.&nbsp; Also, such claim was belied by PNB’s own witness who testified that the reason for its refusal to release was simply the respondents’ failure to settle their amortization.<br><br>PNB filed a motion for reconsideration of the said decision, but the same was denied by the CA in its assailed Resolution, dated March 2, 2011.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues:</u></b><br></center><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> PNB submits the following issues for consideration:<br><br>Whether or not the CA decided in accordance with the applicable laws and jurisprudence when:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">it ruled that the <i>Supplement to Real Estate Mortgage,</i> dated 28 January 1992, lacked sufficient valuable consideration even when the loan proceeds secured by it under the <i>Third Amendment,</i> dated 03 November 1993, had been substantially released by PNB, and the <i>Credit Agreement</i>, dated 05 March 1991, as well as the <i>First and Second Amendments </i>thereto, dated 31 January 1992 and 28 October 1992, respectively, upon which the same<i> Supplement to Real Estate Mortgage </i>was similarly constituted as additional security, had all been duly executed and consummated;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">it ruled that PNB breached its contractual obligation when it supposedly failed to release the remaining balance of the approved loan in the amount of P39,503,088.84 to the respondents even when the latter had not had a single history of payment and did not need the entire amount for the purpose-specific loan grant under the <i>Credit Agreement </i>and its <i>Amendments;</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">upon a finding of breach of contractual obligation on the part of PNB due to its supposed unjustified release of a portion of the loan proceeds, it ruled for the annulment and cancellation of supplement to real mortgage (the accessory contract) yet ratiocinated that the Third Amendment (the principal contract) became unenforceable only to the extent of unreleased portion of the loan proceeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>PNB’s assignment of errors boils down to the sole issue of whether the CA erred in annulling the mortgage contract constituted over the Greenhills property of the respondents.<br><br>PNB contends that the Supplement to REM was supported by sufficient and valuable consideration because the loan proceeds secured by it under the Third Amendment had been substantially released to the respondents.&nbsp; It avers that had it not been for the additional collateral over the Greenhills property, PNB would not have made the respondents’ loan account current under the First Amendment.&nbsp; This consideration, according to it, must be deemed valuable and sufficient enough to uphold the validity of the Supplement to the REM.<br><br>PNB insists that there was no breach, substantial or otherwise, of its contractual obligation when it did not release the remaining balance of the approved loan to the respondents considering that the latter had no history of any payment either on interest or principal of the loan.&nbsp;

To secure this initial loan, ERDI mortgaged in favor of PNB its Paranaque properties together with the 20-storey condominium building to be erected thereon.<br><br>Thereafter or on January 31, 1992, ERDI and PNB entered into The First Amendment wherein the former obtained an additional loan of P40,000,000.00.&nbsp; As security for the additional loan, the respondents’ Greenhills property was mortgaged as evidenced by the Supplement to REM executed by the parties on January 28, 1992.&nbsp; The Second Amendment was likewise entered into by the parties for the purpose of extending the repayment dates of the loan and the additional loan.<br><br>On November 3, 1993, the Third Amendment was entered into by the parties wherein the respondents were granted a second additional loan of P55,000,000.00.<br><br>The agreement between PNB and the respondents was one of a loan. Under the law, a loan requires the delivery of money or any other consumable object by one party to another who acquires ownership thereof, on the condition that the same amount or quality shall be paid. Loan is a reciprocal obligation, as it arises from the same cause where one party is the creditor, and the other the debtor. The obligation of one party in a reciprocal obligation is dependent upon the obligation of the other, and the performance should ideally be simultaneous. This means that in a loan, the creditor should release the full loan amount and the debtor repays it when it becomes due and demandable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>PNB, not having released the balance of the last loan proceeds in accordance with the Third Amendment had no right to demand from the respondents compliance with their own obligation under the loan.&nbsp; Indeed, if a party in a reciprocal contract like a loan does not perform its obligation, the other party cannot be obliged to perform what is expected of them while the other's obligation remains unfulfilled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>When PNB and the respondents entered into the First, Second and Third Amendments on January 31, 1992, October 28, 1992 and November 3, 1993, respectively, they undertook reciprocal obligations.&nbsp; In reciprocal obligations, the obligation or promise of each party is the consideration for that of the other; and when one party has performed or is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, the other party who has not performed or is not ready and willing to perform incurs in delay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The promise of the respondents to pay was the consideration for the obligation of PNB to furnish the P40,000,000.00 additional loan under the First Amendment as well as the P55,000,000.00 the second additional loan under the Third Amendment.&nbsp; When the respondents executed the Supplement to REM covering their Greenhills property, they signified their willingness to pay the additional loans.&nbsp; It should be noted, as correctly found by the CA, that the Supplement to REM was constituted not only as security for the execution of the First Amendment but also in consideration of the Second and Third Amendments.&nbsp; The provisions of the Third Amendment read in part:<br><br><blockquote><center>SECTION 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; THE AMENDMENTS</center><br>xxx<br><br>2.05&nbsp; The full payment of the Loans and any and all sums payable by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes and the other documents contemplated hereby and the faithful compliance by the Borrower with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof and the Notes shall be secured by the following collaterals:<br><br>xxx<br><br>b) Existing real estate mortgage on a parcel of land with an area of 958 sq. m., more or less, together with the improvements thereon, situated in San Juan, Metro Manila, covered by TCT No. 29733 of the land records for Metro Manila (D-11) and registered in the name of Rosario M. Mendoza married to Eduardo Tajonera (the “Accommodation Mortgagors”), as evidenced by that Supplement to&nbsp; Real Estate Mortgage dated January 28, 1992 and acknowledged before Notary Public for the City of Manila, Rowena Fe N.

Philippine National Bank</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The said case finds no application inasmuch as the circumstances in that case are not in all fours with the present case.&nbsp; In Omengan case, there was no actual meeting of the minds with respect to the conditionally approved additional loan as the condition attached to the increase in borrowers’ credit line was not acknowledged and accepted by them.&nbsp; Hence, there being no perfected contract over the increase in credit line, it was held that no breach of contract could be attributed to PNB in not releasing the additional loan.&nbsp; In the present case, there was a perfected contract in so far as the Third Amendment was concerned.&nbsp; Thus, PNB’s action in not releasing the entire amount of the additional loan was not justified.<br><br>Still in the said case, at the time the original loan was approved, the title to the property offered as collateral appeared to pertain exclusively to Spouses Omengan.&nbsp; By the time the application for increase was considered, PNB had acquired information that the said property, although in the name of spouses petitioners was owned in co-ownership.&nbsp; The Court justified PNB’s act of withholding the release of the additional loan because it already had reason to suspect the spouses’ claim of exclusive ownership over the mortgaged collateral.&nbsp; In this case, the respondents were unquestionably the exclusive owners of the mortgaged property (Greenhills property) at the time the initial and the additional loans were approved.<br><br>For said reasons, the Court holds that PNB was indeed guilty of breach of contract of its reciprocal obligation under the credit agreements.<br><br>Considering that there was no sufficient valuable consideration in the execution of the Supplement to REM on the Third Amendment as the balance of the last approved additional loan in the amount of P39,503,088.54 remained unreleased, the cancellation of the Supplement to REM constituted over the respondents’ Greenhills property was in order.<br><br>It is true that loans are often secured by a mortgage constituted on real or personal property to protect the creditor's interest in case of the default of the debtor.&nbsp; By its nature, however, a mortgage remains an accessory contract dependent on the principal obligation, such that enforcement of the mortgage contract depends on whether or not there has been a violation of the principal obligation.&nbsp; While a creditor and a debtor could regulate the order in which they should comply with their reciprocal obligations, it is presupposed that in a loan the lender should perform its obligation – the release of the full loan amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In this case, to repeat, PNB did not fulfill its principal obligation under the Third Amendment by failing to release the amount of the last additional loan in full.&nbsp; Consequently, the Supplement to REM covering the Greenhills property became unenforceable, as the said property could not be entirely foreclosed to satisfy the respondents’ total debts to PNB.&nbsp; Moreover, the Supplement to REM was no longer necessary because PNB’s interest was amply protected as the loans had been sufficiently secured by the Paranaque properties.&nbsp; As aptly found by the RTC, the Paranaque properties together with the 20-storey condominium building to be erected thereon would have been sufficient security in the execution of the REM even without the Greenhills property as additional collateral.&nbsp; Thus, under the circumstances, PNB’s actuation in foreclosing the Greenhills property was legally unfounded.<br><br>Being a banking institution, PNB owes it to the respondents to observe the high standards of integrity and performance in all its transactions because its business is imbued with public interest. The high standards are also necessary to ensure public confidence in the banking system, for, according to <i>Philippine National Bank v. Pike</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "[t]he stability of banks largely depends on the confidence of the people in the honesty and efficiency of banks."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, PNB was duty bound to comply with the terms and stipulations under its credit agreements with the respondents, specifically the release of the amount of the additional loan in its entirety, lest it erodes public confidence.&nbsp; Yet, PNB failed in this regard.<br><br>Regarding the award of damages, the CA ruled that the RTC erred in awarding moral and exemplary damages for failure of the respondents to prove with convincing evidence malice or bad faith on the part of PNB.&nbsp; The Court finds no reason to overturn this finding.<br><br>Moral damages are explicitly authorized in breaches of contract when the defendant has acted fraudulently or in bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Exemplary damages, on the other hand, are intended to serve as an example or a correction for the public good.&nbsp; Courts may award them if the defendant is found to have acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Concededly, PNB was remiss in its obligation to release the balance of the additional loan it extended to the respondents.&nbsp; Nothing in the records or findings of the RTC and the CA, however, would show that PNB acted with a deliberate intent to maliciously cause damage or harm to the respondents.&nbsp; And, inasmuch as the respondents were also found to have been remiss in their obligation to pay their loan amortization, the CA was correct in deleting the award for moral and exemplary damages in favor of the respondents.<br><br>Finally, the Court sustains the award for attorney’s fees because the same is just and equitable under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Considering PNB’s failure to release the remaining balance of the approved loan, the Court agrees that the respondents were compelled to litigate for the purpose of recovering their property and to protect their interest, making the award of attorney’s fees proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The November 30, 2010 Decision and the March 2, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
