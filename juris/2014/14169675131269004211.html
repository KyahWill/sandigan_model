It was determined that the administrative claim filed on July 21, 1999 and the petition for review filed on January 9, 2001 fell within the two-year prescriptive period reckoned from January 21, 1999, the date when respondent filed its Quarterly VAT Return for the fourth quarter of taxable year 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The CIR moved for the reconsideration of the aforesaid CTA First Division Decision, but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated April 13, 2009.<br><br>Undaunted, the CIR elevated the case to the CTA <i>En Banc</i> on petition for review, docketed as C.T.A.

During the proceedings before the CA until this case was remanded to the CTA, [CIR] never questioned the period within which the respondent's judicial claim for refund was filed. When the CTA First Division partially granted respondent's judicial claim for refund, [the CIR] immediately filed his Motion for Reconsideration to which he neither mentioned nor raised the issue of prescription. More than eight years have lapsed before the [CIR] brought the issue of prescription and was questioned only now at the CTA <i>en banc</i> level after an unfavorable judgment was issued against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The CIR filed a motion for reconsideration but was likewise denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated October 22, 2009 for lack of merit, hence, the present petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The lone issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CIA <i>En Banc</i> correctly dismissed the petition for review on the ground that the issue of prescription was belatedly raised.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 112 of RA 8424,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which was in force at the time of the filing of respondent's claim for credit or refund of its creditable input tax, pertinently reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. -</i><br><br>(A) <i>Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. </i>- Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may,<b> within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made,</b> apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(D) Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. - In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and<br><br>(B) hereof.<br><br>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period</b>, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>It should be recalled that the CTA First Division declared in its September 17, 2008 Decision that the administrative claim filed on July 21, 1999 and the petition for review filed on January 9, 2001 fell within the two-year prescriptive period reckoned from January 21, 1999, the date when respondent filed its Quarterly VAT Return for the fourth quarter of taxable year 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The CIR argues, on the other hand, that the two-year period for filing both the administrative and judicial claims should be reckoned from the close of the fourth taxable quarter when the relevant sales were made, which fell on December 31, 1998. As such, respondent only had until December 31, 2000 to file both its administrative and judicial claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> While it filed its administrative claim on July 21, 1999 within the two-year prescriptive period, the same is not true with the petition for review that was filed with the CTA only on January 9, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> To support its contention, the CIR cited the case of <i>CIR v. Mir ant Pagbilao Corp.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Mirant).<br><br>To resolve the matter, the Court deems it fit to briefly discuss the doctrinal metamorphosis of the two-year prescriptive period provided under Section 112 (A) as above-cited.<br><br>In the case of <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Dev't. Corp. v. CIR</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (<i>Atlas</i>), which was promulgated on <u>June 8, 2007</u>, the two-year prescriptive period stated in Section 112 (A)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> was counted from the <b>date of payment of the output VAT</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> At that time, the output VAT must be paid at the time of filing of the quarterly tax returns, which meant within 20 days following the end of each quarter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, on <u>September 12, 2008</u>, the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine was abandoned in the case of <i>Mirant </i>which adopted the <i>verba legis</i> rule and counted the two-year prescriptive period from the "<b>close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made</b>" as expressly stated in the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> regardless when the input VAT was paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In the recent case of <i>CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[32]</sup></font><i> (San Roque)</i>, promulgated on <u>February 12, 2013</u>, the Court clarified that (<i>a</i>) the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine was effective only from its promulgation on June 8, 2007 until its abandonment on September 12, 2008 in <i>Mirant</i>, and (<i>b</i>) prior to the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, Section 112 (A) should be applied following the <i>verba legis</i> rule adopted in <i>Mirant</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Thus, applying Section 112 (A) strictly as worded, it may then be concluded that the administrative claim filed by respondent on July 21, 1999 was filed within the two-year prescriptive period reckoned from the close of the fourth taxable quarter falling on December 31, 1998, the last day of filing being December 31, 2000.<br><br>In fact, whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment (January 21, 1999) of the output VAT following <i>Atlas</i>, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made (December 31, 1998) pursuant to <i>Mirant</i>, the conclusion that the administrative claim was timely filed would equally stand.<br><br>The CIR insists, however, that both the administrative and judicial claims should fall within the two-year prescriptive period. This argument is untenable.<br><br>It should be pointed out that on <u>October 6, 2010</u>, the Court held in the case of <i>CIR v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (<i>Aichi</i>) that the phrase "within two (2) years x x x apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund" <b>refers to applications for refund/credit filed with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Court gave three (3) compelling reasons for this ruling in <i>San Roque</i>, namely:<br><br><blockquote><i>First</i>, Section 112(A) clearly, plainly, and unequivocally provides that the taxpayer "may, <b>within two (2) years</b> after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, <b>apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund</b> of the creditable input tax due or paid to such sales." In short, the law states that the taxpayer may apply with the Commissioner for a refund or credit <b>"within two (2) years," which means at anytime within two years</b>. Thus, the application for refund or credit may be filed by the taxpayer with the Commissioner on the last day of the two-year prescriptive period and it will still strictly comply with the law. The two-year prescriptive period is a grace period in favor of the taxpayer and he can avail of the full period before his right to apply for a tax refund or credit is barred by prescription.<br><br><i>Second</i>, Section 112(C) provides that the Commissioner shall decide the application for refund or credit "within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A)." The reference in Section 112(C) of the submission of documents "in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection A" means that the application in Section 112(A) is the administrative claim that the Commissioner must decide within the 120-day period. In short, the two-year prescriptive period in Section 112(A) refers to the period within which the taxpayer can file an administrative claim for tax refund or credit. <b>Stated otherwise, the two-year prescriptive period does not refer to the filing of the judicial claim with the CTA but to the filing of the administrative claim with the Commissioner.</b> x x x.<br><br><i>Third</i>, if the 30-day period, or any part of it, is required to fall within the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days), then the taxpayer must file his administrative claim for refund or credit within the first 610 days of the two-year prescriptive period. <b>Otherwise, the filing of the administrative claim beyond the first 610 days will result in the appeal to the CTA being filed beyond the two-year prescriptive period</b>. Thus, if the taxpayer files his administrative claim on the 611 day, the Commissioner, with his 120-day period, will have until the 731st day to decide the claim. If the Commissioner decides only on the 731st day, or does not decide at all, the taxpayer can no longer file his judicial claim with the CTA because the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days) has lapsed. The 30-day period granted by law to the taxpayer to file an appeal before the CTA becomes utterly useless, even if the taxpayer complied with the law by filing his administrative claim within the two-year prescriptive period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphases in the original)</blockquote><br>In fine, the taxpayer can file its <b><u>administrative claim</u></b> for refund or credit at <b>any time within the two-year prescriptive period</b>. If it files its claim on the last day of said period, it is still filed on time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The CIR will have 120 days from such filing to decide the claim. If the CIR decides the claim on the 120<sup>th</sup> day, or does not decide it on that day, <b>the taxpayer still has 30 days to file its judicial claim with the CTA</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> otherwise, the judicial claim would be, properly speaking, dismissed for being filed out of time and not, as the CTA <i>En Banc</i> puts it, prescribed.<br><br>It bears emphasis that Section 112 (D)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (now renumbered as Section 112[C]) of RA 8424, which is explicit on the <b>mandatory and jurisdictional nature</b> of the 120+30-day period, was already effective on January 1, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Hence, it is of no consequence that the <i>Aichi</i> and <i>San Roque</i> rulings were not yet in existence when respondent's administrative claim was filed in 1999, so as to rid itself of the said section's mandatory and jurisdictional application.<br><br>That being said, and notwithstanding the fact that respondent's administrative claim had been timely filed, the Court is nonetheless constrained to deny the averred tax refund or credit, as its judicial claim therefor was filed beyond the 120+30-day period, and, hence - as earlier stated - deemed to be filed out of time.<br><br>As the records would show, the CIR had 120 days from the filing of the administrative claim on July 21, 1999, or until November 18, 1999, to decide on respondent's application. Since the CIR did not act at all, <b>respondent had until December 18, 1999, the last day of the 30-day period, to file its judicial claim.</b> However, respondent filed its petition for review with the CTA <b>only on January 9, 2001 and, thus, was one (1) year and 22 days late</b>. As a consequence of the late filing of said petition, the CTA <b>did not properly acquire jurisdiction over the claim</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In this relation, it is significant to point out that the CTA, being a court of special jurisdiction, can take cognizance only of matters that are clearly within its jurisdiction. Section 7 of RA 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as amended by RA 9282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> specifically provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. Jurisdiction. — The CTA shall exercise:<br><blockquote>(a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;<br><br>(2) Inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, <b>where the National Internal Revenue Code provides a specific period of action, in which case the inaction shall be deemed a denial</b>;</blockquote>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>The inaction of the CIR on the claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, "deemed a denial" of such claim, and the failure of the taxpayer to file its judicial claim within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period shall <b>render the "deemed a denial" decision of the CIR final and inappealable</b>. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner <b>is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. <u>The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, respondent's failure to comply with the statutory conditions is fatal to its claim. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that the CIR, for his part, failed to raise the issue of non-compliance with the mandatory periods at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>In the case of <i>Nippon Express (Philippines) Corporation v. CIR,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court ruled that, <b>because the 120+30-day period is jurisdictional, the issue of whether the taxpayer complied with the said time frame may be broached at any stage, even on appeal. Well-settled is the rule that the question of jurisdiction over the subject matter <u>can be raised at any time during the proceedings</u></b>. Jurisdiction cannot be waived because it is conferred by law and is not dependent on the consent or objection or the acts or omissions of the parties or any one of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Therefore, respondent's contention on this score is of no moment.<br><br>Indeed, it has been pronounced time and again that taxes are the lifeblood of the government and, consequently, tax laws must be faithfully and strictly implemented as they are not intended to be liberally construed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Hence, with this in mind and in light of the foregoing considerations, the Court so holds that the CTA <i>En Banc</i> committed reversible error when it granted respondent's claim for refund or tax credit despite its non-compliance with the mandatory periods under Section 112 (D) (now renumbered as Section 112[C]) of RA 8424. Accordingly, the claim for refund/tax credit must be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
