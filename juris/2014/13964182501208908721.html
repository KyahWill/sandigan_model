As basis, the RTC cited Article 2079 of the Civil Code which provides that an extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor/surety extinguishes the guaranty/suretyship, and, in this relation, added that the bonding companies “should not be held liable as sureties for the extended period.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, TIDCORP and Balderrama filed separate appeals before the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> For its part, TIDCORP averred, among others, that Article 2079 of the Civil Code is only limited to contracts of guaranty, and, hence, should not apply to contracts of suretyship. Meanwhile, Balderrama theorized that the main contractor’s (<i>i.e.</i>, ELPCO) failure to pay ASPAC due to the war/political upheaval in Libya which further resulted in the latter’s inability to pay Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital had the effect of releasing him from his obligations under the Deeds of Undertaking.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated April 30, 2008, the CA upheld the RTC’s ruling that the moratorium request “had the effect of an extension granted to a debtor, which extension was without the consent of the guarantor, and thus released the surety companies from their respective liabilities under the issued surety bonds” pursuant to Article 2079 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> To this end, it noted that “the maturity of the foreign loans was extended to December 31, 1989 or up to December 31, 1994 as provided under Section 4.01 of the Restructuring Agreement,” and that “said extension is beyond the expiry date[s] of the surety bonds x x x and the maturity date of the principal obligations it purportedly secured, which extension was without [the bonding companies’] consent,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It further discredited TIDCORP’s contention that Article 2079 of the Civil Code is only limited to contracts of guaranty by citing the Court’s pronouncement on the provision’s applicability to suretyships in the case of <i>Security Bank and Trust Co., Inc. v. Cuenca</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (<i>Security Bank</i>).

CV No. 92818, entitled “<i>Trade &amp; Investment Corporation of the Phils., et al. v. Roblet Industrial Construction Corp. and Paramount Insurance Corp., et al</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue raised for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA erred in holding that the bonding companies’ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds have been extinguished by the payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital to TIDCORP under the Restructuring Agreement.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is granted.<br><br>A surety is considered in law as being the same party as the debtor in relation to whatever is adjudged touching the obligation of the latter, and their liabilities are interwoven as to be inseparable. Although the contract of a surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, his liability to the creditor is direct, primary and absolute; he becomes liable for the debt and duty of another although he possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does he receive any benefit therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The fundamental reason therefor is that a contract of suretyship effectively binds the surety as a solidary debtor. This is provided under Article 2047 of the Civil Code which states:<br><blockquote>Article 2047. By guaranty a person, called the guarantor, binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal debtor in case the latter should fail to do so.<br><br><b>If a person binds himself <u>solidarily with the principal debtor</u>, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book shall be observed. <u>In such case the contract is called a suretyship</u>.</b> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, since the surety is a solidary debtor, it is not necessary that the original debtor first failed to pay before the surety could be made liable; it is enough that a demand for payment is made by the creditor for the surety’s liability to attach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Article 1216 of the Civil Code provides that:<br><blockquote>Article 1216. The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected.<br></blockquote>Comparing a surety’s obligations with that of a guarantor, the Court, in the case of <i>Palmares v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> illumined that a surety is responsible for the debt’s payment at once if the principal debtor makes default, whereas a guarantor pays only if the principal debtor is unable to pay, <i>viz</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote><b><u>A surety is an insurer of the debt, whereas a guarantor is an insurer of the solvency of the debtor.</u></b> A suretyship is an undertaking that the debt shall be paid; a guaranty, an undertaking that the debtor shall pay. Stated differently, a surety promises to pay the principal’s debt if the principal will not pay, while a guarantor agrees that the creditor, after proceeding against the principal, may proceed against the guarantor if the principal is unable to pay. A surety binds himself to perform if the principal does not, without regard to his ability to do so. A guarantor, on the other hand, does not contract that the principal will pay, but simply that he is able to do so. In other words, <b><u>a surety undertakes directly for the payment and is so responsible at once if the principal debtor makes default, while a guarantor contracts to pay if, by the use of due diligence, the debt cannot be made out of the principal debtor</u></b>. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Despite these distinctions, the Court in <i>Cochingyan, Jr. v. R&amp;B Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and later in the case of <i>Security Bank</i>, held that Article 2079 of the Civil Code, which pertinently provides that “<b>[a]n extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guaranty,</b>” equally applies to both contracts of guaranty and suretyship. The rationale therefor was explained by the Court as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><blockquote>The theory behind Article 2079 is that <b><u>an extension of time given to the principal debtor by the creditor without the surety’s consent would deprive the surety of his right to pay the creditor and to be immediately subrogated to the creditor’s remedies against the principal debtor upon the maturity date</u></b>. The surety is said to be entitled to protect himself against the contingency of the principal debtor or the indemnitors becoming insolvent during the extended period. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Applying these principles, the Court finds that the payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital to TIDCORP under the Restructuring Agreement did not have the effect of extinguishing the bonding companies’ obligations to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds, notwithstanding the fact that said extensions were made without their consent. This is because Article 2079 of the Civil Code refers to a payment extension granted by the creditor to the principal debtor without the consent of the guarantor or surety. In this case, the Surety Bonds are suretyship contracts which secure the debt of ASPAC, the principal debtor, under the Deeds of Undertaking to pay TIDCORP, the creditor, the damages and liabilities it may incur under the Letters of Guarantee, within the bounds of the bonds’ respective coverage periods and amounts. No payment extension was, however, granted by TIDCORP in favor of ASPAC in this regard; hence, Article 2079 of the Civil Code should not be applied with respect to the bonding companies’ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds.<br><br>The payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital pertain to TIDCORP’s own debt under the Letters of Guarantee wherein it (TIDCORP) irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed full payment of ASPAC’s loan obligations to the banks in the event of its (ASPAC) default. In other words, the Letters of Guarantee secured ASPAC’s loan agreements to the banks. Under this arrangement, TIDCORP therefore acted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as a guarantor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> with ASPAC as the principal debtor, and the banks as creditors.<br><br>Proceeding from the foregoing discussion, it is quite clear that there are two sets of transactions that should be treated separately and distinctly from one another following the civil law principle of relativity of contracts “which provides that contracts can only bind the parties who entered into it, and it cannot favor or prejudice a third person, even if he is aware of such contract and has acted with knowledge thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Verily, as the Surety Bonds concern ASPAC’s debt to TIDCORP and not TIDCORP’s debt to the banks, the payments extensions (which conversely concern TIDCORP’s debt to the<br><br>banks and not ASPAC’s debt to TIDCORP) would not deprive the bonding companies of their right to pay their creditor (TIDCORP) and to be immediately subrogated to the latter’s remedies against the principal debtor (ASPAC) upon the maturity date. It must be stressed that these payment extensions did not modify the terms of the Letters of Guarantee but only provided for a new payment scheme covering TIDCORP’s liability to the banks. In fine, considering the inoperability of Article 2079 of the Civil Code in this case, the bonding companies’ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds – except those issued by Paramount and covered by its Compromise Agreement with TIDCORP – have not been extinguished. Since these obligations arose and have been duly demanded within the coverage periods of all the Surety Bonds,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> TIDCORP’s claim is hereby granted and the CA’s ruling on this score consequently reversed. Nevertheless, given that no appeal has been filed on Balderrama’s adjudged liability or on the award of attorney's fees, the CA's dispositions on these matters are now deemed as final and executory.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Eusebio Construction, Inc.</i> (478 Phil. 269, 286-287 [2004]) which involved a similar Letter of Guarantee issued by TIDCORP’s predecessor, the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corp, finding the same to be a contract of guaranty, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br>In determining petitioner’s status, it is necessary to read Letter of Guarantee No. 81- 194-F, which provides in part as follows:<br><blockquote>In consideration of your issuing the above performance guarantee/counter- guarantee, we hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, under our Ref. No. LG-81-194 F to pay you on your first written or telex demand Iraq Dinars Two Hundred Seventy One Thousand Eight Hundred Eight and fils six hundred ten (ID271,808/610) representing 100% of the performance bond required of V.P. EUSEBIO for the construction of the Physical Therapy Institute, Phase II, Baghdad, Iraq, plus interest and other incidental expenses related thereto.<br><br><b>In the event of default by V.P. EUSEBIO, we shall pay you 100% of the obligation unpaid</b> but in no case shall such amount exceed Iraq Dinars (ID) 271,808/610 plus interest and other incidental expenses….<br></blockquote>Guided by the abovementioned distinctions between a surety and a guaranty, as well as the factual milieu of this case, we find that the Court of Appeals and the trial court were correct in ruling that the petitioner is a guarantor and not a surety. That the guarantee issued by the petitioner is unconditional and irrevocable does not make the petitioner a surety. As a guaranty, it is still characterized by its subsidiary and conditional quality because it does not take effect until the fulfillment of the condition, namely, that the principal obligor should fail in his obligation at the time and in the form he bound himself. In other words, an unconditional guarantee is still subject to the condition that the principal debtor should default in his obligation first before resort to the guarantor could be had. A conditional guaranty, as opposed to an unconditional guaranty, is one which depends upon some extraneous event, beyond the mere default of the principal, and generally upon notice of the principal’s default and reasonable diligence in exhausting proper remedies against the principal.<br><br><b>It appearing that Letter of Guarantee No. 81-194-F merely stated that in the event of default by respondent VPECI the petitioner shall pay, the obligation assumed by the petitioner was simply that of an unconditional guaranty, not conditional guaranty. But as earlier ruled the fact that petitioner’s guaranty is unconditional does not make it a surety. Besides, surety is never presumed. A party should not be considered a surety where the contract itself stipulates that he is acting only as a guarantor. It is only when the guarantor binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor that the contract becomes one of suretyship.</b> (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <i>Integrated Packaging Corp. v.
