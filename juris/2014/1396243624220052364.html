Thus, services rendered to NPC by a VAT-registered entity are effectively zero-rated.&nbsp; In fact, the BIR itself approved the application for zero-rating on 29 December 2004, filed by petitioner for its sales to NPC covering January to October 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; As a consequence, petitioner claims for the refund of the alleged excess input tax attributable to its effectively zero-rated sales to NPC.<br><br>In <i>Panasonic Communications Imaging Corporation of the Philippines v.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue </i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (hereby collectively referred as San Roque), we are constrained to apply the dispositions therein to the facts herein which are similar.<br><br><b><i>Administrative Claim</i></b><br><br>Section 112(A) provides that after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, there is a two-year prescriptive period within which a VAT-registered person whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax.<br><br>Our VAT Law provides for a mechanism that would allow VAT-registered persons to recover the excess input taxes over the output taxes they had paid in relation to their sales.&nbsp; For the refund or credit of excess or unutilized input tax, Section 112 is the governing law.&nbsp; Given the distinctive nature of creditable input tax, the law under Section 112 (A) provides for a different reckoning point for the two-year prescriptive period, specifically for the refund or credit of that tax only.<br><br>We agree with petitioner that <i>Mirant</i> was not yet in existence when their administrative claim was filed in 2005; thus, it should not retroactively be applied to the instant case.<br><br>However, the fact remains that Section 112 is the controlling provision for the refund or credit of input tax during the time that petitioner filed its claim with which they ought to comply.&nbsp; It must be emphasized that the Court merely clarified in<i> Mirant </i>that Sections 204 and 229, which prescribed a different starting point for the two-year prescriptive limit for filing a claim for a refund or credit of excess input tax, were not applicable. Input tax is neither an erroneously paid nor an illegally collected internal revenue tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Section 112(A) is clear that for VAT-registered persons whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated, a claim for the refund or credit of creditable input tax that is due or paid, and that is attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, must be filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made. The reckoning frame would always be the end of the quarter when the pertinent sale or transactions were made, regardless of when the input VAT was paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Section 112(A), petitioner’s administrative claims were filed well within the two-year period from the close of the taxable quarter when the effectively zero-rated sales were made, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="CENTER"> <td width="27%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Period Covered</strong></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="22%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Close of the <br> Taxable <br> Quarter</strong></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="28%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Last day to File Administrative Claim</strong></div></td> <td width="23%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Date of Filing </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="CENTER">1st quarter 2005</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">31-Mar-05</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">31-Mar-07</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">30-Jun-05</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="CENTER">2nd quarter 2005</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">30-Jun-05</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">30-Jun-07</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">15-Sep-05</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="CENTER">3rd quarter 2005</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">30-Sep-05</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">30-Sep-07</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">28-Oct-05</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><b><i>Judicial Claim</i></b><br><br>Section 112(D) further provides that the CIR has to decide on an administrative claim within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support thereof.<br><br>Bearing in mind that the burden to prove entitlement to a tax refund is on the taxpayer, it is presumed that in order to discharge its burden, petitioner had attached complete supporting documents necessary to prove its entitlement to a refund in its application, absent any evidence to the contrary.<br><br>Thereafter, the taxpayer affected by the CIR’s decision or inaction may appeal to the CTA within 30 days from the receipt of the decision or from the expiration of the 120-day period within which the claim has not been acted upon.<br><br>Considering further that the 30-day period to appeal to the CTA is dependent on the 120-day period, compliance with both periods is jurisdictional.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Mindanao I Geothermal Partnership v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court has ruled thus:<br><br><blockquote>Notwithstanding a strict construction of any claim for tax exemption or refund,<b> the Court in San Roque recognized that BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 constitutes equitable estoppel in favor of taxpayers. BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 expressly states that the “taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review.</b>” This Court discussed BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 and its effect on taxpayers, thus:<br><blockquote>Taxpayers should not be prejudiced by an erroneous interpretation by the Commissioner, particularly on a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the Atlas doctrine by Mirant and Aichi is proof that the reckoning of the prescriptive periods for input VAT tax refund or credit is a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the Atlas doctrine did not result in Atlas, or other taxpayers similarly situated, being made to return the tax refund or credit they received or could have received under Atlas prior to its abandonment. This Court is applying Mirant and Aichi prospectively. Absent fraud, bad faith or misrepresentation, the reversal by this Court of a general interpretative rule issued by the Commissioner, like the reversal of a specific BIR ruling under Section 246, should also apply prospectively. x x x.</blockquote>x x x x<br><blockquote>Thus, the only issue is whether BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule applicable to all taxpayers or a specific ruling applicable only to a particular taxpayer. BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule because it was a response to a query made, not by a particular taxpayer, but by a government agency asked with processing tax refunds and credits, that is, the One Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Drawback Center of the Department of Finance. This government agency is also the addressee, or the entity responded to, in BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. Thus, while this government agency mentions in its query to the Commissioner the administrative claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., the agency was in fact asking the Commissioner what to do in cases like the tax claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., where the taxpayer did not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period.<br><br>Clearly, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule. Thus, all taxpayers can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on 10 December 2003 up to its reversal by this Court in Aichi on 6 October 2010, where this Court held that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In applying the foregoing to the instant case, we consider the following pertinent dates:<br><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Period Covered </strong></div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Administrative <br> Claim Filed</strong></div></td> <td width="16%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Expiration of<br>&nbsp; 120-days</strong></div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Last day to file<br>&nbsp; Judicial Claim</strong></div></td> <td width="19%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Judicial <br> Claim Filed</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">1st quarter 2005</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">30-Jun-05</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">28-Oct-05</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">27-Nov-05</div></td> <td rowspan="3"><div align="CENTER">18-Apr-07</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">2nd quarter 2005</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">15-Sep-05</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">13-Jan-06</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">13-Feb-06</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">3rd quarter 2005</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">28-Oct-05</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">26-Feb-06</div></td> <td valign="MIDDLE"><div align="CENTER">28-Mar-06</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>It must be emphasized that this is not a case of premature filing of a judicial claim. Although petitioner did not file its judicial claim with the CTA prior to the expiration of the 120-day waiting period, it failed to observe the 30-day prescriptive period to appeal to the CTA counted from the lapse of the 120-day period.<br><br>Petitioner is similarly situated as<i> Philex</i> in the same case, <i>San Roque</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> in which this Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philex’s case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim <b>long after</b> the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. <b>In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the Atlas case, Philex’s judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing</b>. Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the Atlas doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the Mirant and Aichi doctrines, Philex’s judicial claim was indisputably filed late.<br><br>The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. The <b>inaction</b> of the Commissioner on Philex’s claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, “deemed a denial” of Philex’s claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philex’s failure to do so rendered the “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise. Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences. (Emphases in the original)</blockquote><br>Likewise, while petitioner filed its administrative and judicial claims during the period of applicability of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, it cannot claim the benefit of the exception period as it did not file its judicial claim prematurely, but did so long after the lapse of the 30-day period following the expiration of the 120-day period.&nbsp; Again, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 allowed premature filing of a judicial claim, which means non-exhaustion of the 120-day period for the Commissioner to act on an administrative claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but not its late filing.<br><br>As this Court enunciated in <i>San Roque</i>, petitioner cannot rely on Atlas either, since the latter case was promulgated only on 8 June 2007.&nbsp; Moreover, the doctrine in <i>Atlas</i> which reckons the two-year period from the date of filing of the return and payment of the tax, does not interpret - expressly or impliedly - the 120+30 day periods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Simply stated, Atlas referred only to the reckoning of the prescriptive period for filing an administrative claim.<br><br>For failure of petitioner to comply with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional period, petitioner lost its right to claim a refund or credit of its alleged excess input VAT.<br><br>With regard to petitioner’s argument that <i>Aichi </i>should not be applied retroactively, we reiterate that even without that ruling, the law is explicit on the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30 day period.<br><br>Also devoid of merit is the applicability of the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> to the present case.&nbsp; According to this principle, if something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises. In that situation, a creditor-debtor relationship is created under a quasi-contract, whereby the payor becomes the creditor who then has the right to demand the return of payment made by mistake, and the person who has no right to receive the payment becomes obligated to return it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The quasi-contract of <i>solutio indebiti</i> is based on the ancient principle that no one shall enrich oneself unjustly at the expense of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>There is <i>solutio indebiti</i> when:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Payment is made when there exists no binding relation between the payor, who has no duty to pay, and the person who received the payment; and<br><br>(2) Payment is made through mistake, and not through liberality or some other cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Though the principle of<i> solutio indebiti </i>may be applicable to some instances of claims for a refund, the elements thereof are wanting in this case.<br><br><i>First</i>, there exists a binding relation between petitioner and the CIR, the former being a taxpayer obligated to pay VAT.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the payment of input tax was not made through mistake, since petitioner was legally obligated to pay for that liability.&nbsp; The entitlement to a refund or credit of excess input tax is solely based on the distinctive nature of the VAT system.&nbsp; At the time of payment of the input VAT, the amount paid was correct and proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Finally, equity, which has been aptly described as “a justice outside legality,” is applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law or judicial rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Section 112 is a positive rule that should preempt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that tax refunds or credits, just like tax exemptions, are strictly construed against the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The burden is on the taxpayer to show strict compliance with the conditions for the grant of the tax refund or credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Villarama, Jr.,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ</i>. concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 94-160.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 11-36; penned by Associate Justice Caesar A.
