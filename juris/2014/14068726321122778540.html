Tobias from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 28 August 2009 issued by the Special Third Division and from the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 9 February 2010 issued by the Special Former Special Third Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02838.<br><br><center><b>THE ANTECEDENT FACTS</b><br></center><br>Rodolfo P. Fernandez, Nelson E. Tobias, Frank R. Baay, Joel B. Uy, Eduardo D. Manuel and Nenita P. Manuel were charged with violation of Section 5, in relation to Section 26, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of June 2004 in the City of Mandaluyong, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any lawful authority, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one another, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver or distribute to a PDEA poseur-buyer one (1) kilo of white powder substance which was found positive to the test of cocaine, for an agreed amount of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00), Philippine Currency without the corresponding license or prescription, in violation of the above cited law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b>PROSECUTION’S VERSION</b></center><br>The prosecution presented eight witnesses, namely: (1) Police Inspector (P/Insp.) Antonietta Abillonar of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory; (2) Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) operatives, Senior Police Officer (SPO) 3 Pedro Barbero, (3) Police Senior Inspector (P S/Insp.) Prospero Bona; (4) Police Officer (PO) 2 Martin Francia; (5) PO1 Rogelio Hernando; (6) SPO1 Catalino Gonzales, Jr.; (7) PO1 Narciso Padua; and (8) P S/Insp. Sandra Decena Go of the PNP Crime Laboratory.<br><br>Their testimonies reveal that on 16 June 2004, PO1 Padua met with the accused Fernandez, a retired Makati City police at the latter’s house to negotiate Fernandez’s possible surrender of 150 kilos of cocaine in exchange for a monetary reward. The two were known to each other due to their past positions in the police force. Not satisfied with the monetary award being offered, Fernandez instead asked Padua to find a buyer of the cocaine. Pretending to have a buyer, Padua asked for samples. Hence, on the night of 20 June 2004, Fernandez called up to tell him to go to the office of the Eagles of Makati on 21 June 2004 to receive the samples. The samples given by Fernandez were delivered to Bona, who brought it to a forensic chemist at the crime laboratory for examination. They turned out to be cocaine. Bona then formed a buy-bust team composed of Barbero, Hernando, and Gonzales as back-ups and Padua as the poseur-buyer. Also prepared was boodle money consisting of cut newspapers and photocopies of P1,000 bills supposedly amounting to P2 million, which was to be used as buy-bust money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On the morning of 22 June 2004, the team went to the house of Fernandez on board two vehicles and parked 20 meters away.&nbsp; Padua alighted, took a taxi and proceeded to the house where Fernandez was waiting. The latter told him to wait because the person bringing the cocaine had not yet arrived. Twenty minutes after, a car with three persons on board stopped in front of the house and one of them, later identified as Tobias, alighted carrying a bag. Tobias, Fernandez and Padua went inside while the car, with the two remaining persons on board, left.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Inside the house, Tobias showed the cocaine and gave it to Padua, while the latter handed the boodle money to the former. After the exchange, Padua sent missed calls to the team through his cellphone, the prearranged signal that the sale had been consummated. The team rushed to the house and arrested Fernandez and Tobias. The boodle money was found in the latter’s possession. When interrogated, Tobias admitted that the two other persons in the car were Baay and Uy, who were waiting for him at the nearby McDonald’s restaurant. The police officers went to the restaurant and arrested both men. Upon further interrogation, Fernandez and Tobias told the police that the cocaine came from Cagayan Valley and was brought to Manila by the spouses Manuel, who at that time were staying at the house of Tobias in Fort Bonifacio. The police proceeded to the identified house and arrested the spouses. A forensic chemist examined the seized evidence which yielded a positive result for cocaine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>DEFENSE’S VERSION</b></center><br>Accused Fernandez<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> interposed the defense of denial. He asserted that he had invited Padua to help facilitate the licensing of the former’s firearm. Upon learning that Padua had been assigned to PDEA, Fernandez asked him about the reward money if someone surrendered cocaine to PDEA. Padua asked for a sample as he handed him a brochure, “Operation Private Eye,” in which the reward system for the surrender of drugs was spelled out. Fernandez supposedly relayed this information to Tobias and told the latter to bring samples. On 20 June 2004, Tobias said that he would arrive with the cocaine the next day. Fernandez then scheduled their meeting at his house on 21 June 2004. Padua arrived at 8:00 a.m., while Tobias and his friend “Mar” arrived an hour later. Allegedly, Fernandez asked if they brought the drugs, and Tobias answered in the affirmative. Meanwhile “Mar” brought out a wrapped item and gave it to Padua, who eventually left with the sample for testing. On the evening of the same day, Padua allegedly called up Fernandez and informed him that the item had been found positive for cocaine. The latter immediately told Tobias to bring the 150-kilo cocaine to be surrendered to Padua the following morning.<br><br>At 9:00 a.m. the following morning, Tobias arrived at the house of Fernandez. Padua, along with a companion, arrived looking for&nbsp; “Mar.”&nbsp; Upon learning that “Mar” was not around, Padua poked a&nbsp; gun at both Tobias and Fernandez, handcuffed them, and placed them under arrest. The other PDEA operatives arrived and searched the house for the drugs, but Fernandez argued that it was with “Mar” who had not arrived. Padua insisted that he should tell them where “Mar” was, but Fernandez did not know. The latter also claimed that there was no cocaine confiscated from his house on 22 June 2004.<br><br>Nelson Tobias<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>, on the other hand, claimed having known Padua for a long time, but denied having knowledge of the existence of the 150 kilos of cocaine. Tobias also testified that he had accompanied his friend,&nbsp; PO Marino Manuel, to Fernandez’s house. They were supposed to meet Fernandez and Padua.&nbsp; Tobias was eventually told that the substance was really cocaine, and that he should bring the remaining stuff to be surrendered the following morning. He told Marino Manuel about the meeting and both agreed to meet at the designated place. When Tobias met with Fernandez the following morning, Padua and the other operatives arrived. They immediately looked for Marino Manuel, but he failed to show up. Tobias and Fernandez were arrested. Tobias claimed that his wallet, wrist watch, driver’s license, firearm license, ATM card and .45 cal pistol were confiscated by the PDEA operatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After Tobias was arrested, he was brought inside a parked van and interrogated regarding his companions. He identified one of them as Joel Uy, whose name was in the phone book of the mobile phone confiscated from the former. The police officers then began contacting Joel Uy and asking about the whereabouts of Frank Baay. Thus, Tobias brought them to a McDonald’s branch along Boni Avenue, where they nabbed Baay and later, Joel Uy, whom they asked to return to that place. Thereafter they were all brought to the PDEA office in Quezon City, where they were investigated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Tobias admitted that he was a member of the Philippine Air Force, but that he had gone AWOL when he went to Japan to work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He denied that Padua showed him a belt bag containing money as payment for the cocaine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Frank Baay alleged that he was at the McDonald’s branch located at the corner of Boni and Barangka Streets to meet Joel Uy. The latter was supposed to give him the price quotation for a glass door and panel to be installed at the house of Baay’s neighbor. Around ten o’clock in the morning, Joel Uy arrived and invited Baay for a ride, as the former would just drop off a friend at a place nearby. When Baay boarded the car, he was introduced by Joel Uy to Nelson Tobias, the friend who later dropped off on Fabella St., after which they returned to McDonald’s. But after their brief conversation, Joey Uy left while Baay stayed behind to wait for a friend from whom Baay would borrow money to pay for the latter’s electric bills. While waiting for that friend, however, Baay was arrested by operatives from PDEA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>For his part, Joel Uy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> claimed to be a businessman engaged in contracting and installing glass windows, aluminum panels and aquariums. He admitted owning the green Mazda car driven by Nelson Tobias when the latter went to the house of Fernandez at No. 19 Fabella St., Mandaluyong City, at about ten o’clock in the morning of 22 June 2004. Joel Uy also admitted that he and Baay were also in that car driven by Tobias, who alighted upon reaching the destination. Joel Uy then took the wheels, made a U-turn and returned to McDonald’s to drop off Baay. The latter proceeded to Malate to meet Engineer Arnel Alarcon, Paul Peteros and Wilson Seguerra. While he was in Malate, Baay called and texted Joel Uy to ask him to come over. Past 2:00 p.m. the latter returned to McDonald’s to look for Baay. Someone whom he later identified as Padua poked a gun at him. Joel Uy testified later that Padua took his car key, cell phone, wrist watch and wallet, which had not been returned to him until now.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Finally, Eduardo Manuel<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> claimed that when he was arrested by Barbero, Bona and Hernando of PDEA, he was with his wife inside the house of Nelson Tobias in Fort Bonifacio.&nbsp; Prior to that date, he had known Tobias for four years, but met Fernandez, Baay and Uy only for the first time on that same date at the PDEA office. Earlier that day, he and his wife had just arrived at the house of Tobias from their hometown in Cagayan Valley. He was accompanying his wife, who was applying for a job. While he was resting in the living room, he heard someone knocking on the door. He opened it and three armed men entered introducing themselves as members of the police, whom he later identified as Hernando, Bona and Barbero. Then they poked him with their guns and searched the house looking for Marino Manuel. When Eduardo told them that Marino Manuel was his cousin, they got mad. They handcuffed him, brought him to the waiting car and left. Not long after, they decided to return to the house of Tobias because somebody said, “<i>Pare balikan natin ang babae dahil sigurado akong nanduon ang pera</i>.” Thus, they also took Eduardo’s wife, and the two of them were brought to the PDEA headquarters in Quezon City.<br><br><center><b>THE RULING OF THE RTC</b></center><br>The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 214 of Mandaluyong City, rendered its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated 16 February 2007, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; accused <b>Rodolfo Fernandez, Nelson Tobias, Joel Uy and Frank R.

His death resulted in the dismissal of his appeal on 27 June 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> insofar as he was concerned, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated 12 January 2011 issued by the Supreme Court Third Division. Henceforth, the appeal pertained only to Tobias and Baay.<br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Tobias claimed that the arresting officers failed to comply with the chain-of-custody requirement and to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drug. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> On the other hand, Baay claimed in his Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that the prosecution had failed to establish the identity of the cocaine, as well as the whereabouts and the identity of the boodle money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE RULING OF THE CA</b></center><br>The CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC.<br><br>For failure of co-accused-appellant Frank Baay to file a Petition before the Supreme Court from the CA Resolution dated 9 February 2010 denying his Motion for Reconsideration, the CA Decision became final and executory on 27 February 2009. In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 31 May 2010, Partial Entry of Judgment was ordered issued by the CA as far as he was concerned.<br><br>Hence, this appeal solely concerning Tobias on the issue of the police officers’ noncompliance with the chain-of-custody requirement. This issue, stated in his Brief and reiterated in his Supplemental Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> has been brought before this Court.<br><br><center><b>THIS COURT’S RULING</b></center><br>We sustain the conviction of accused-appellant Nelson Tobias.<br><br>As stated in the Information, the accused were charged not only with the sale of cocaine but also with the delivery and distribution thereof, which is committed by the mere delivery of the prohibited drug. The consideration therefor is of no moment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The law has defined “deliver” as “[a]ny act of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to another, personally or otherwise, and by any means, with or without consideration.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Upon a careful review of the records, we find that the elements of the crime as stated above were proven by the prosecution.<br><br>Padua clearly and convincingly testified that Fernandez had agreed to sell or deliver the cocaine to the former. This testimony, complemented by the testimonies of the other police officers, provided a clear picture of the transaction as well as the roles of Fernandez, Tobias, Baay and Uy. As observed by the trial court, Padua “testified in a clear, straightforward manner and despite the rigorous cross-examination by the defense counsels, did not waver or hesitate in his testimony, a clear proof that he was telling the truth.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The accused failed to destroy the credibility of the police officers. They failed to show a plausible reason or ill motive on the part of the arresting officers to falsely impute to them such a serious and unfounded charge. What the accused offered were merely denials and allegations of frame-up. But these allegations are invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor, for they can easily be concocted but are difficult to prove.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Further, their bare denials were not proven by convincing evidence. Hence, full faith and credit are accorded to the police officers, for they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner in the absence of proof to the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The accused, too, in their attempt to discredit the police officers’ testimonies, point to inconsistencies. In any event, we have time and again said that a few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details and not actually touching upon the central fact of the crime do not impair their credibility. Instead of weakening their testimonies, these inconsistencies tend to strengthen their credibility, because they discount the possibility of their being rehearsed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, in the present Petition, Tobias harps solely and exclusively on the absence of compliance with the chain-of-custody rule.<br><br>The rule on the chain of custody under R.A. 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> together with its implementing rules and regulations (IRR),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> expressly demands the identification of the persons who handled the confiscated items for the purpose of duly monitoring the authorized movements of the illegal drugs and/or drug paraphernalia from the time these items were seized from the accused until the time they were presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The rule also requires that the presentation and admission of the seized prohibited drug as an exhibit be preceded by evidence to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This requirement is essential to obviate the possibility of substitution, as well as to ensure that doubts regarding the identity of the evidence are removed. The rule is meant to ensure the monitoring and tracking of the movements and custody of the seized prohibited item - from the accused, to the police, to the forensic laboratory for examination, and finally to its presentation in evidence in court. Ideally, the custodial chain would include testimony about every link in the chain or movement of the illegal drug, from the moment it is seized until it is finally adduced in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It cannot be overemphasized, however, that testimony supporting a perfect chain is almost always impossible to obtain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We have held that the failure of the prosecution to show compliance with the procedural requirements provided in Section 21 of Article II of R.A. 9165 and its IRR is not fatal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As long as the chain of custody remains unbroken, the guilt of the accused will not be affected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>A careful scrutiny of the records reveals - through testimonial, documentary and object evidence - that the chain-of-custody requirement was not broken.<br><br>The trial court notes that when SPO1 Padua,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> who “testified in a clear, straightforward manner and despite the rigorous cross-examination by the defense counsels, did not waver or hesitate in his testimony,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; was asked how the evidence was preserved, he stated as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Immediately upon confiscation of the said evidence it was turned over to the possession of Captain Bona and delivered to the Philippine National Crime Laboratory for examination and the PNCL is the one who holding [sic] the cocaine, sir. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>P S/Insp.
