And since these benefits are unauthorized and irregular, these cannot ripen into a company practice or policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; As to the affidavits submitted by respondent, petitioner claims that these are self-serving declarations,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and thus, should not be given weight and credence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In addition, petitioner claims that the Memorandum dated August 16, 2005, which provides for the guidelines on the implementation of vacation and sick leave credits as well as vacation leave commutation, is valid because it is in full accord with existing policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i><br><br>Respondent belies the claims of petitioner and asserts that there are two retirement plans as the PERAA Retirement Plan, which has been implemented for more than 30 years, is different from the CBA Retirement Plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent further avers that it has always been a practice of petitioner to give two retirement benefits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and that this practice was established by substantial evidence as found by both the Voluntary Arbitrator and the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As to the Memorandum dated August 16, 2005, respondent asserts that it is arbitrary and contrary to the CBA and existing practices as it added qualifications or limitations which were not agreed upon by the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>The Non-Diminution Rule found in Article 100<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Labor Code explicitly prohibits employers from eliminating or reducing the benefits received by their employees.&nbsp; This rule, however, applies only if the benefit is based on an express policy, a written contract, or has ripened into a practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; To be considered a practice, it must be consistently and deliberately made by the employer over a long period of time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>An exception to the rule is when “the practice is due to error in the construction or application of a doubtful or difficult question of law.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The error, however, must be corrected immediately after its discovery;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> otherwise, the rule on Non-Diminution of Benefits would still apply.<br><br><b><i>The practice of giving two retirement<br>benefits to petitioner’s employees is <br>supported by substantial evidence.</i></b><br><br>In this case, respondent was able to present substantial evidence in the form of affidavits to support its claim that there are two retirement plans.&nbsp; Based on the affidavits, petitioner has been giving two retirement benefits as early as 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner, on the other hand, failed to present any evidence to refute the veracity of these affidavits.&nbsp; Petitioner’s contention that these affidavits are self-serving holds no water.&nbsp; The retired employees of petitioner have nothing to lose or gain in this case as they have already received their retirement benefits.&nbsp; Thus, they have no reason to perjure themselves.&nbsp; Obviously, the only reason they executed those affidavits is to bring out the truth.&nbsp; As we see it then, their affidavits, corroborated by the affidavits of incumbent employees, are more than sufficient to show that the granting of two retirement benefits to retiring employees had already ripened into a consistent and deliberate practice.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner’s assertion that there is only one retirement plan as the CBA Retirement Plan and the PERAA Plan are one and the same is not supported by any evidence.&nbsp; There is nothing in Article XVI of the CBA to indicate or even suggest that the “Plan” referred to in the CBA is the PERAA Plan.&nbsp; Besides, any doubt in the interpretation of the provisions of the CBA should be resolved in favor of respondent.&nbsp; In fact, petitioner’s assertion is negated by the announcement it made during the LMC Meeting on February 8, 2006 regarding its plan of implementing a “one-retirement plan.”&nbsp; For if it were true that petitioner was already implementing a one-retirement policy, there would have been no need for such announcement.&nbsp; Equally damaging is the letter-memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated May 11, 2006, entitled “Suggestions on the defenses we can introduce to justify the abolition of double retirement policy,” prepared by the petitioner’s legal counsel.&nbsp; These circumstances, taken together, bolster the finding that the two-retirement policy is a practice.&nbsp; Thus, petitioner cannot, without the consent of respondent, eliminate the two-retirement policy and implement a one-retirement policy as this would violate the rule on non-diminution of benefits.<br><br>As a last ditch effort to abolish the two-retirement policy, petitioner contends that such practice is illegal or unauthorized and that the benefits were erroneously given by the previous administration.&nbsp; No evidence, however, was presented by petitioner to substantiate its allegations.<br><br>Considering the foregoing disquisition, we agree with the findings of the Voluntary Arbitrator, as affirmed by the CA, that there is substantial evidence to prove that there is an existing practice of giving two retirement benefits, one under the PERAA Plan and another under the CBA Retirement Plan.<br><br><i>The Memorandum dated August 16, 2005 <br>is contrary to the existing CBA.</i><br><br>Neither do we find any reason to disturb the findings of the CA that the Memorandum dated August 16, 2005 is contrary to the existing CBA.<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 of Article XII of the CBA provide that all covered employees are entitled to 15 days sick leave and 15 days vacation leave with pay every year and that after the second year of service, all unused vacation leave shall be converted to cash and paid to the employee at the end of each school year, not later than August 30 of each year.<br><br>The Memorandum dated August 16, 2005, however, states that vacation and sick leave credits are not automatic as leave credits would be earned on a month-to-month basis.&nbsp; This, in effect, limits the available leave credits of an employee at the start of the school year.&nbsp; For example, for the first four months of the school year or from June to September, an employee is only entitled to five days vacation leave and five days sick leave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that the Memorandum dated August 16, 2005 imposes a limitation not agreed upon by the parties nor stated in the CBA, we agree with the CA that it must be struck down.<br><br>In closing, it may not be amiss to mention that when the provision of the CBA is clear, leaving no doubt on the intention of the parties, the literal meaning of the stipulation shall govern.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; However, if there is doubt in its interpretation, it should be resolved in favor of labor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as this is mandated by no less than the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp;
