If the tax payments are correct, the BIR need not make an assessment.<br><br>The self-assessing and voluntarily paying taxpayer, however, may later find that he or she has erroneously paid taxes.&nbsp; Erroneously paid taxes may come in the form of amounts that should not have been paid.&nbsp; Thus, a taxpayer may find that he or she has paid more than the amount that should have been paid under the law.&nbsp; Erroneously paid taxes may also come in the form of tax payments for the wrong category of tax.&nbsp; Thus, a taxpayer may find that he or she has paid a certain kind of tax that he or she is not subject to.<br><br>In these instances, the taxpayer may ask for a refund.&nbsp; If the BIR fails to act on the request for refund, the taxpayer may bring the matter to the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br>From the taxpayer’s self-assessment and tax payment up to his or her request for refund and the BIR’s inaction, the BIR’s participation is limited to the receipt of the taxpayer’s payment.&nbsp; The BIR does not make an assessment; the BIR issues no decision; and there is no dispute yet involved.<br><br>Since there is no BIR assessment yet, the Court of Tax Appeals may not determine the amount of taxes due from the taxpayer.&nbsp; There is also no decision yet to review.&nbsp; However, there was inaction on the part of the BIR.&nbsp; That inaction is within the Court of Tax Appeals’ jurisdiction.<br><br>In other words, the Court of Tax Appeals may acquire jurisdiction over cases even if they do not involve BIR assessments or decisions.<br><br>In this case, the Court of Tax Appeals’ jurisdiction was acquired because petitioner brought the case on appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals after the BIR had failed to act on petitioner’s claim for refund of erroneously paid taxes.&nbsp; The Court of Tax Appeals did not acquire jurisdiction as a result of a disputed assessment of a BIR decision.<br><br>Petitioner argued that the Court of Tax Appeals had no jurisdiction to subject it to 6% capital gains tax or other taxes at the first instance.&nbsp; The Court of Tax Appeals has no power to make an assessment.<br><br>As earlier established, the Court of Tax Appeals has no assessment powers.&nbsp; In stating that petitioner’s transactions are subject to capital gains tax, however, the Court of Tax Appeals was not making an assessment.&nbsp; It was merely determining the proper category of tax that petitioner should have paid, in view of its claim that it erroneously imposed upon itself and paid the 5% final tax imposed upon PEZA-registered enterprises.<br><br>The determination of the proper category of tax that petitioner should have paid is an incidental matter necessary for the resolution of the principal issue, which is whether petitioner was entitled to a refund. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The issue of petitioner’s claim for tax refund is intertwined with the issue of the proper taxes that are due from petitioner.&nbsp; A claim for tax refund carries the assumption that the tax returns filed were correct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; If the tax return filed was not proper, the correctness of the amount paid and, therefore, the claim for refund become questionable.&nbsp; In that case, the court must determine if a taxpayer claiming refund of erroneously paid taxes is more properly liable for taxes other than that paid.<br><br>In <i>South African Airways v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> South African Airways claimed for refund of its erroneously paid 2½% taxes on its gross Philippine billings.&nbsp; This court did not immediately grant South African’s claim for refund.&nbsp; This is because although this court found that South African Airways was not subject to the 2½% tax on its gross Philippine billings, this court also found that it was subject to 32% tax on its taxable income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner’s claim that it erroneously paid the 5% final tax is an admission that the quarterly tax return it filed in 2000 was improper.&nbsp; Hence, to determine if petitioner was entitled to the refund being claimed, the Court of Tax Appeals has the duty to determine if petitioner was indeed not liable for the 5% final tax and, instead, liable for taxes other than the 5% final tax.&nbsp; As in <i>South African Airways</i>, petitioner’s request for refund can neither be granted nor denied outright without such determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>If the taxpayer is found liable for taxes other than the erroneously paid 5% final tax, the amount of the taxpayer’s liability should be computed and deducted from the refundable amount.<br><br>Any liability in excess of the refundable amount, however, may not be collected in a case involving solely the issue of the taxpayer’s entitlement to refund.&nbsp; The question of tax deficiency is distinct and unrelated to the question of petitioner’s entitlement to refund.&nbsp; Tax deficiencies should be subject to assessment procedures and the rules of prescription.&nbsp; The court cannot be expected to perform the BIR’s duties whenever it fails to do so either through neglect or oversight.&nbsp; Neither can court processes be used as a tool to circumvent laws protecting the rights of taxpayers.<br><br><center><b>II<br>Petitioner’s entitlement to benefits given to PEZA-registered enterprises</b></center><br>Petitioner is not entitled to benefits given to PEZA-registered enterprises, including the 5% preferential tax rate under Republic Act No. 7916 or the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995.&nbsp; This is because it never began its operation.<br><br>Essentially, the purpose of Republic Act No. 7916 is to promote development and encourage investments and business activities that will generate employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Giving fiscal incentives to businesses is one of the means devised to achieve this purpose.&nbsp; It comes with the expectation that persons who will avail these incentives will contribute to the purpose’s achievement.&nbsp; Hence, to avail the fiscal incentives under Republic Act No. 7916, the law did not say that mere PEZA registration is sufficient.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7916 or The Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Fiscal Incentives</i>. — Business establishments <i>operating within the ECOZONES </i>shall be entitled to the fiscal incentives as provided for under Presidential Decree No. 66, the law creating the Export Processing Zone Authority, or those provided under Book VI of Executive Order No. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987.<br><br>Furthermore, tax credits for exporters using local materials as inputs shall enjoy the same benefits provided for in the Export Development Act of 1994.<br><br>SEC. 24. <i>Exemption from Taxes Under the National Internal Revenue Code.</i> — Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on<i> business establishments operating within the ECOZONE.</i> In lieu of paying taxes, five percent (5%) of the gross income earned by all businesses and enterprises within the ECOZONE shall be remitted to the national government.

A tax cannot be imposed without clear and express words for that purpose. Accordingly, the general rule of requiring adherence to the letter in construing statutes applies with peculiar strictness to tax laws and the provisions of a taxing act are not to be extended by implication. In answering the question of who is subject to tax statutes, it is basic that in case of doubt, such statutes are to be construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the subjects or citizens because burdens are not to be imposed nor presumed to be imposed beyond what statutes expressly and clearly import. As burdens, taxes should not be unduly exacted nor assumed beyond the plain meaning of the tax laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Capital gains of individuals and corporations from the sale of real properties are taxed differently.<br><br>Individuals are taxed on capital gains from sale of all real properties located in the Philippines and classified as capital assets.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 24. Income Tax Rates.</b><br><br>. . . .<br><br>(D) Capital Gains from Sale of Real Property. –<br><blockquote>(1) In General. - The provisions of Section 39(B) notwithstanding, a final tax of six percent (6%) based on the gross selling price or current fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, is hereby imposed upon <i>capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of real property located in the Philippines, classified as capital assets</i>, including pacto de retro sales and other forms of conditional sales, by individuals, including estates and trusts: Provided, That the tax liability, if any, on gains from sales or other dispositions of real property to the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or to government-owned or controlled corporations shall be determined either under Section 24 (A) or under this Subsection, at the option of the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>For corporations, the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 treats the sale of land and buildings, and the sale of machineries and equipment, differently.&nbsp; Domestic corporations are imposed a 6% capital gains tax only on the presumed gain realized from the sale of lands and/or buildings.&nbsp; The National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 does not impose the 6% capital gains tax on the gains realized from the sale of machineries and equipment. Section 27(D)(5) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 27. Rates of Income tax on Domestic Corporations. -</b><br><br>. . . .<br><br>(D) Rates of Tax on Certain Passive Incomes. -<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(5) Capital Gains Realized from the Sale, Exchange or Disposition of Lands and/or Buildings. - A final tax of six percent (6%) is hereby imposed <i>on the gain presumed to have been realized on the sale, exchange or disposition of lands and/or buildings</i> which are not actually used in the business of a corporation and are treated as capital assets, based on the gross selling price of fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, of such lands and/or buildings. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Therefore, only the presumed gain from the sale of petitioner’s land and/or building may be subjected to the 6% capital gains tax.&nbsp; The income from the sale of petitioner’s machineries and equipment is subject to the provisions on normal corporate income tax.<br><br>To determine, therefore, if petitioner is entitled to refund, the amount of capital gains tax for the sold land and/or building of petitioner and the amount of corporate income tax for the sale of petitioner’s machineries and equipment should be deducted from the total final tax paid.<br><br>Petitioner indicated, however, in its March 1, 2001 income tax return for the 11-month period ending on November 30, 2000 that it suffered a net loss of P2,233,464,538.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; This declaration was made under the pain of perjury. Section 267 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 267. Declaration under Penalties of Perjury</b>. - Any declaration, return and other statement required under this Code, shall, in lieu of an oath, contain a written statement that they are made under the penalties of perjury. Any person who willfully files a declaration, return or statement containing information which is not true and correct as to every material matter shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties prescribed for perjury under the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote><br>Moreover, Rule 131, Section 3(ff) of the Rules of Court provides for the presumption that the law has been obeyed unless contradicted or overcome by other evidence, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Disputable presumptions</i>.— The following presumptions are satisfactory if uncontradicted, but may be contradicted and overcome by other evidence:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(ff) That the law has been obeyed;<br></blockquote><br>The BIR did not make a deficiency assessment for this declaration.&nbsp; Neither did the BIR dispute this statement in its pleadings filed before this court.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no reason to doubt the truth that petitioner indeed suffered a net loss in 2000.<br><br>Since petitioner had not started its operations, it was also not subject to the minimum corporate income tax of 2% on gross income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, petitioner is not liable for any income tax.<br><br><center><b>IV<br>Prescription</b><br></center><br>Section 203 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 provides that as a general rule, the BIR has three (3) years from the last day prescribed by law for the filing of a return to make an assessment.&nbsp; If the return is filed beyond the last day prescribed by law for filing, the three-year period shall run from the actual date of filing.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 203. Period of Limitation Upon Assessment and Collection.</b> - Except as provided in Section 222, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed within three (3) years after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period: Provided, That in a case where a return is filed beyond the period prescribed by law, the three (3)-year period shall be counted from the day the return was filed. For purposes of this Section, a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day.</blockquote><br>This court said that the prescriptive period to make an assessment of internal revenue taxes is provided “primarily to safeguard the interests of taxpayers from unreasonable investigation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>This court explained in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. FMF Development Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the reason behind the provisions on prescriptive periods for tax assessments:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, the government must assess internal revenue taxes on time so as not to extend indefinitely the period of assessment and deprive the taxpayer of the assurance that it will no longer be subjected to further investigation for taxes after the expiration of reasonable period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br>Rules derogating taxpayers’ right against prolonged and unscrupulous investigations are strictly construed against the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he law on prescription should be interpreted in a way conducive to bringing about the beneficent purpose of affording protection to the taxpayer within the contemplation of the Commission which recommended the approval of the law. To the Government, its tax officers are obliged to act promptly in the making of assessment so that taxpayers, after the lapse of the period of prescription, would have a feeling of security against unscrupulous tax agents who will always try to find an excuse to inspect the books of taxpayers, not to determine the latter’s real liability, but to take advantage of a possible opportunity to harass even law-abiding businessmen. Without such legal defense, taxpayers would be open season to harassment by unscrupulous tax agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Moreover, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
