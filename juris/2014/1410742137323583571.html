SP No. 128187 on the ground that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment that petitioner filed is not the proper remedy, as it had other available remedies to question the Orders of the RTC Caloocan.&nbsp; Citing <i>Estate of the late Mercedes Jacob v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the CA, stated that where the land subject of the case was already registered in the name of the buyer in the auction sale, the proper remedy to annul said transfer was to file an action for reconveyance on the ground of fraud.&nbsp; The CA added that the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> petitioner had earlier filed but later withdrew showed that other remedies were available to petitioner.&nbsp; The CA, likewise, denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Petitioner questions the dismissal by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 128187, and contends that:<br><br><blockquote>a. Under the particular factual circumstances surrounding this case, a petition for annulment of judgment is the only and appropriate remedy of petitioner to question the Orders of the RTC Caloocan, which allowed private respondent to consolidate ownership and take possession of the property covered by TCT No. 33341; and<br><br>b. All the requisite elements for the filing of a petition for annulment of judgment on the grounds of extrinsic fraud, lack of jurisdiction, and want of due process, are present in this case.</blockquote><br>We grant the Petition.<br><br>We first tackle the procedural issue.&nbsp; Based on the records of this case, it is undisputed that the Order of the RTC Caloocan dated 31 August 2011 became final and executory on 11 October 2011, when the latter issued an Entry of Judgment for the same.&nbsp; The general rule is that a final and executory judgment can no longer be disturbed, altered, or modified in any respect, and that nothing further can be done but to execute it.&nbsp; A final and executory decision may, however, be invalidated via a Petition for Relief or a Petition to Annul the same under Rules 38 or 47, respectively, of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Under Rule 38, when a judgment or final order is entered, or any other proceeding is thereafter taken against a party in any court through fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, he may file a petition in such court and in the same case praying that the judgment, order or proceeding be set aside.&nbsp; The verified petition must be filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, final order, or other proceeding to be set aside, and not more than six (6) months after such judgment or final order was entered.&nbsp; However, it is uncontested that petitioner learned about the proceedings in LRC-Case No. C-5748 more than six (6) months after the Order dated 31 August 2011 had become final and executory on 11 October 2011.&nbsp; Thus, this remedy under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court was clearly unavailing.<br><br>Thus, the only remedy left to petitioner in this case is a petition for annulment of judgment under Rule 47, which it, in fact, filed.<br><br>The principle we laid down in <i>Estate of the late Mercedes Jacob v. Court of Appeals</i> is not applicable.&nbsp; We disagree with the reasoning of the CA and respondents that petitioner in this particular case should have filed either an action for reconveyance or annulment of the auction sale, because to do so would have required the court hearing the action to modify or interfere with the judgment or order of another co-equal court, especially in this case where the said judgment or order had attained finality.&nbsp; Well-entrenched in our jurisdiction is the doctrine that a court has no power to do so, as that action may lead to confusion and seriously hinder the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>We have repeatedly ruled that a Petition for Annulment of Judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court is a remedy granted only under exceptional circumstances where a party, without fault on his part, has failed to avail of the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies.&nbsp; The same petition is not available as a substitute for a remedy which was lost due to the party’s own neglect in promptly availing of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> There is here no attempted substitution; annulment of judgment is the only remedy available to petitioner.<br><br>Regarding the previous filing of a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 such is of no moment as petitioner timely withdrew the same before any relief could be afforded by the CA.<br><br>We now proceed to the substantive and more pressing issue.&nbsp; We agree with the position of petitioner that all the requisite elements for the filing of a petition for annulment of judgment on the grounds of extrinsic fraud, lack of jurisdiction, and want of due process, are present in this case.<br><br>It should be stressed that petitioner instituted the case before the CA precisely to seek relief from the declaration of nullity of TCT No. 33341, which had been issued without first giving petitioner an opportunity to be heard.<br><br>In <i>Castigador v. Nicolas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> we had the occasion to state that:<br><br><blockquote>The petition filed with the CA contained the following allegations, among others: (1) the auction sale of the land is null and void for lack of actual and personal notice to herein petitioner; (2) the RTC did not comply with the procedure prescribed in Section 71, Presidential Decree No. 1529 requiring notice by the Register of Deeds to the registered owner as to the issuance of a certificate of sale; and (3) petitioner was not afforded due process when she was not notified of the proceedings instituted by respondent for the cancellation of her title.&nbsp; The petition need not categorically state the exact words extrinsic fraud; rather, the allegations in the petition should be so crafted to easily point out the ground on which it was based.&nbsp; The allegations in the petition filed with the CA sufficiently identify the ground upon which the petition was based - extrinsic fraud. Fraud is extrinsic where it prevents a party from having a trial or from presenting his entire case to the court, or where it operates upon matters pertaining not to the judgment itself but to the manner in which it is procured.&nbsp; The overriding consideration when extrinsic fraud is alleged is that the fraudulent scheme of the prevailing litigant prevented a party from having his day in court.&nbsp; The allegations clearly charged the RTC and respondent with depriving petitioner of the opportunity to oppose the auction sale and the cancellation of her title and ventilate her side.&nbsp; This allegation, if true, constitutes extrinsic fraud.<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner not only puts in question the complete lack of due process in the conduct of the auction sale and the proceedings before the RTC Caloocan, but the absolute lack of basis for the declaration by the Office of the City Treasurer that it had been delinquent in the payment of real property taxes due on its property, particularly Lot 13-B-1.<br><br>Technicalities aside, we are particularly alarmed by the material allegations and serious charges brought up by petitioner in its pleadings, which go into the very core of the action for annulment of judgment and, more importantly, which <i>none</i> of the respondents dispute.<br><br><b>Petitioner fully paid its real estate taxes due on Lot 13-B-1.</b><br><br>Petitioner confronts respondents with copies of its Real Property Tax Receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> issued by the Office of the City Treasurer of the City of Caloocan spanning the period from 2000 to 2012, as well as the Payment History<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> from 1995 to 2011 evidencing full payment of real property taxes due on its land, whose assessed value was adjusted in 2005 to P8,697,870.00.<br><br>Petitioner likewise confronts respondents with the Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated 19 September 2011 issued by the Office of the City Treasurer of Caloocan, through its OIC Land Tax Division, respondent Yam, certifying that the real property taxes due on Lots 1-A and 13-B-1, with an assessed value of P8,697,870.00, up to the 4th quarter of 2011, and previous years, have been duly paid by petitioner.<br><br>We note that respondents, particularly respondents Garma and Yam, the City Treasurer and the OIC Land Tax Division, have been inexplicably silent as regards all that petitioner presented for our consideration.<br><br><b>Multiple Tax Declarations refer to one and the same property.</b><br><br>Petitioner alleges and brings to our attention the matter that it religiously paid in full its real property taxes due on its land, Lots Nos. 1-A and 13-B-1, with an assessed value of P8,697,870.00, under a single tax declaration issued by the Office of the City Assessor of Caloocan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> no. D12-109-00012-C under Property Index No. 113-12-109-01-013, as certified by the OIC City Assessor, respondent Anthony L. Pulmano (respondent Pulmano).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The alleged delinquency of petitioner in its real property taxes and the basis for the auction sale stemmed from the supposed non-payment of real property taxes due on Lot 13-B-1, with an assessed value of P4,866,350.00 covered by another tax declaration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> D12-109-00013-C under Property Index No. 113-12-109-01-014.<br><br>Shortly before private respondent took over the property of petitioner in 2012, the Office of the City Assessor, through respondent Pulmano, issued yet another tax declaration, no. 12-109-00153-12-C under Property Index No. 113-12-109-01-013, this time covering only Lot No. 1-A, with an assessed value of P3,831,520.00.&nbsp; This new issuance cancelled petitioner’s original Tax Declaration No. D12-109-00012-C under Property Index No. 113-12-109-01-013, which previously covered both Lots Nos. 1-A and 13-B-1.<br><br>As petitioner duly points out,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> a simple mathematical application would show that if the assessed values in the 2nd and 3rd tax declarations were added,&nbsp; P4,866,350.00 and P3,831,520.00, the same would amount to P8,697,870.00, the assessed value of the property as indicated in the original tax declaration.<br><br>Therefore, if all the tax declarations issued by respondent Pulmano refer to one and the same property of petitioner, and the latter fully paid all its realty taxes due on the same, then it would follow that the finding of delinquency did not have any basis.<br><br>We note that respondent Pulmano, much like respondents Garma and Yam, has been inexplicably silent as regards the foregoing.<br><br><b>Private respondent took possession of both Lots Nos. 1-A and 13-B-1.</b><br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing serious anomalies attending the delinquency sale, petitioner, again, confronts respondents, particularly public respondents Judge Oscar P.
