SP No. 105576 declaring respondent Rosalinda M. Torres to have been constructively dismissed and awarding her separation pay.&nbsp; The challenged Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>The facts are as follow:<br><br>Petitioner Chiang Kai Shek College is a private educational institution that offers elementary to college education to the public.&nbsp; Individual petitioner Carmelita Espino is the Vice-President of the school.&nbsp; Respondent had been employed as a grade school teacher of the school from July 1970 until 31 May 2003.&nbsp; The manner of her severance from employment is the matter at hand.<br><br>Respondent was accused of leaking a copy of a special quiz given to Grade 5 students of <i>HEKASI</i> (<i>HEKASI</i> 5).&nbsp; <i>HEKASI </i>stands for <i>Heograpiya, Kasaysayan at Sibika</i> (Geography, History and Civics).&nbsp; Petitioners came to know about the leakage from one of the teachers of <i>HEKASI </i>5, Aileen Benabese (Ms. Benabese).&nbsp; Ms. Benabese narrated that after giving a special quiz, she borrowed the book of one of her students, Aileen Regine M. Anduyan (Aileen), for the purpose of making an answer key.&nbsp; When she opened Aileen’s book, a piece of paper fell.&nbsp; Said paper turned out to be a copy of the same quiz she had just given and the same already contained answers.<br><br>Ms. Benabese informed the school’s Assistant Supervisor Mrs. Gloria Caneda (Mrs. Caneda) about the incident.&nbsp; Mrs. Caneda conferred with Assistant Supervisor Encarnacion Koo (Mrs. Koo), who was in charge of the HEKASI area, and Supervisor Luningning Tibi (Ms. Tibi).&nbsp; Mrs. Koo confronted respondent, who had initially denied leaking the test paper but later on admitted that she gave the test paper to Mrs. Teresita Anduyan (Mrs. Anduyan), her co-teacher and the mother of Aileen.&nbsp; Respondent and Mrs. Anduyan were both directed to submit their written statement on the incident.<br><br>Respondent explained that she was busy checking the writing workbook when somebody handed her the special quiz for <i>HEKASI</i> 5, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Yesterday morning, before the bell rings, I was busy checking the writing workbook when somebody handed me the special quiz for Hekasi 5.&nbsp; I placed them on the table and continued with what I’m doing.&nbsp; Mrs. Anduyan got one paper and read it.&nbsp; When I finished checking the books I got the papers and went upstairs forgetting about the paper Mrs. Anduyan got.<br><br>Then, this morning (July 30), Mrs. Koo confronted me about the two answered test papers of Aileen Anduyan, I knew one of them was the paper Mrs. Anduyan borrowed from me.&nbsp; I admitted it to Mrs. Koo and I was so sorry and apolog[e]tic for any carelessness and for what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Mrs. Anduyan, in her statement dated 17 August 2002, denied that she took the test paper from petitioner without the latter’s permission:<br><br><blockquote>Last July 29, 2000 it happened in the Faculty Rm.<br><br>This event was not intensional [sic] it just happened. I just asked Mrs. Torres to look for the special quiz in Hekasi, but she gave it to me and I let my daughter to [sic] see the test paper and she answered it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>On 5 August 2002, Mrs. Koo, Mrs. Caneda and Ms. Tibi executed a written statement stating that when confronted by Mrs. Koo, respondent initially denied leaking a copy of the quiz but later on admitted to doing the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In three (3) separate Letters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Mrs. Koo, Mrs. Caneda and Ms. Tibi stated that respondent admitted to Mrs. Koo that she leaked the special quiz and directed respondent and Mrs. Anduyan to give their comment.<br><br>Mrs. Anduyan, in her Comment dated 19 August 2002, denied that she asked for the special quiz from respondent and that the latter forgot about the paper that she allegedly took.&nbsp; Mrs. Anduyan stated:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <i>Doon po sa salita ni Gng. Gloria Caneda na ayon kay Gng</i>. Rosalinda Torres “I asked for the special quiz # 1 in Hekasi 5” <i>ay wala pong katotohanan.&nbsp; Tulad din po ng sinabi ni Gng.</i> Rosalinda Torres “She went upstairs forgetting about the paper that I got”<i> ay hindi po rin totoo.</i><br><br><i>Sa katunayan, ito po ang tunay na nangyari noong Hulyo 29, 2002 ng umaga sa Faculty Room.&nbsp; Totoo pong nagche-check ng Writing Book si Gng.

Torres<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners acceded to the request and suspended respondent and Mrs. Anduyan effective 16 September to October 2002.&nbsp; The duo was directed to report to work on 4 November 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Respondent continued her employment from 4 November 2002 until the end of the school year on 26 March 2003.<br><br>On 14 February 2003 however, respondent’s counsel sent a letter to petitioners containing the following demands:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">To pay backwages to Mrs. Torres for the period of 16 September 2002 to 31 October 2002 at the rate of her current salary of Sixteen Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Five Pesos (P16,335.00) or the total amount of at least TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO PESOS and 50/100 (P24,502.50); </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">To pay Mrs. Torres her September bonus given by the Alumni Association that was released last September 2002 during the Teacher’s Recognition Day in the amount of at least THREE THOUSAND PESOS (P3,000.00);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">To pay Mrs. Torres her “Teacher’s Day Gift” given by the Students’ Council of the Elementary Department that was released last September 2002 during the Teachers’ Recognition Day in the amount of at least SIX HUNDRED PESOS (P600.00);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">To cease and desist from calling for our client’s resignation at the end of School Year 2002-2003 or on 31 May 2003</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Moral damages in the amount of at least TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P250,000.00); and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(6)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Exemplary damages in the amount of at least TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P250,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Petitioners, through counsel, wrote to respondent’s counsel asserting that respondent was being terminated but the latter requested that “she be suspended instead on condition that she will tender her voluntary resignation at the end of the school year.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 10 June 2003, respondent filed a complaint for constructive dismissal and illegal suspension with the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; She also sought payment of unpaid salary, backwages, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, separation pay, retirement benefits, damages and attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In her Position Paper, respondent alleged that she was forced and pressured to submit the written request for a change of penalty and commitment to resign at the end of the school year.&nbsp; She was threatened by the school management with immediate dismissal from service if she did not submit the written statement.&nbsp; She claimed that she was not formally charged with any offense and she was not served a copy of the notice of the school’s decision to terminate her services.<br><br>Petitioners insisted that respondent voluntarily resigned.&nbsp; Petitioners averred that respondent was accorded her right to due process prior to her termination.&nbsp; A formal investigation was conducted during which respondent was given the opportunity to defend herself and confront her accusers.<br><br>On 3 February 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Labor Arbiter Eduardo J. Carpio dismissed respondent’s complaint for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter deemed respondent’s suspension coupled with petitioner’s allowance of respondent’s resignation at the end of the school year as generous acts considering the offense committed.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter held that there was no constructive dismissal because respondent was not coerced nor pressured to write her resignation letter.<br><br>On appeal, the Second Division of the NLRC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> affirming the Labor Arbiter’s findings but ordering petitioners to pay respondent separation pay equivalent to one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service on the grounds of equity and social justice.<br><br>Respondent elevated the case to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; On 29 May 2009, the Court of Appeals reversed the NLRC Decision and Resolution.&nbsp; The dispositive portion provides:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated July 26, 2007 of the NLRC and Resolution dated July 1, 2008 in NLRC NCR CA No. 039879-04 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Declaring petitioner Rosalinda M. Torres to have been constructively dismissed;<br></li><li>Ordering private respondents to pay petitioner her separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service with a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year, full backwages and other privileges and benefits, or their monetary equivalent, computed from the time of her dismissal on June 1, 2003 until her retirement or the finality of this Decision, whichever comes first;<br></li><li>Retirement benefits pursuant to the school’s Retirement Plan;<br></li><li>Moral and Exemplary damages in the amount of P10,000.00 each; and<br></li><li>10% of the total award as Attorney’s fees.</li></ol>The case is hereby ordered remanded to the Labor Arbiter for computation of the foregoing monetary awards due the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that petitioner did not voluntarily resign but was constructively dismissed.&nbsp; The appellate court cited respondent’s years in service; her consistent denials of the accusations against her; her alleged resignation letter which did not contain any reason for her resignation; and the unsigned memorandum of termination which militate against the voluntariness of resignation.&nbsp; The appellate court also foreclosed any interpretation that respondent was validly dismissed for a just cause because respondent was already meted the penalty of suspension without pay and forfeiture of her bonuses.&nbsp; The appellate court found it unjust to penalize respondent twice for the same offense.<br><br>Petitioners moved for reconsideration but it was denied in a Resolution issued on 2 September 2009.<br><br>We are called upon to determine whether or not in this case the school’s act of imposing the penalty of suspension instead of immediate dismissal from service at the behest of the erring employee, in exchange for the employee’s resignation at the end of the school year, constitutes constructive dismissal.<br><br>There is before us a reassertion by the parties of their positions taken below.<br><br>Petitioners point out that in respondent’s handwritten letter dated 5 September 2002, she offered to voluntarily resign at the end of the school year, provided that her punishment be changed from termination to suspension. Petitioners claim that respondent, who was faced with immediate termination of her employment, bargained for a better exit. Petitioners deny forcing, coercing or pressuring respondent into writing said letter.<br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, averred that individual petitioner forced her to write the written request for a change of the action on the charges against her, from dismissal to suspension and eventual resignation.&nbsp; Respondent reiterates that she never intended to resign but due to intense pressure from individual petitioner who threatened that she will not receive her monetary benefits, she was pressured to write the alleged resignation letter.<br><br>Resignation is the voluntary act of an employee who is in a situation where one believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed for the favor of employment, and opts to leave rather than stay employed.&nbsp; It is a formal pronouncement or relinquishment of an office, with the intention of relinquishing the office accompanied by the act of relinquishment.&nbsp; As the intent to relinquish must concur with the overt act of relinquishment, the acts of the employee before and after the alleged resignation must be considered in determining whether, he or she, in fact, intended to sever his or her employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Respondent had admitted to leaking a copy of the <i>HEKASI</i> 5 special quiz.&nbsp; She reluctantly made the admission and apologized to Mrs. Koo when the latter confronted her.&nbsp; She admitted during the 28 August 2002 hearing of executing two (2) contradictory statements.&nbsp; On 30 August 2002, the Investigating Committee found respondent guilty of leaking a copy of the special quiz.&nbsp; Based on this infraction alone, Chiang Kai Shek College would have been justified to validly terminate respondent from service.&nbsp; As Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio emphasized, academic dishonesty is the worst offense a teacher can make because teachers caught committing academic dishonesty lose their credibility as educators and cease to be role models for their students.&nbsp; More so that under Chiang Kai Shek College Faculty Manual, leaking and selling of test questions is classified as a grave offense punishable by dismissal/termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On 5 September 2002, respondent was verbally informed by Mrs. Caneda, Mrs. Carmelita Espino and Ms. Tibi that she was being dismissed from service.&nbsp; Before the Investigating Committee could formalize respondent’s dismissal, respondent handwrote a letter requesting that the penalty be lowered from dismissal to suspension in exchange for respondent’s resignation at the end of the school year.<br><br>We do not find anything irregular with respondent’s handwritten letter.&nbsp; The letter came about because respondent was faced with an imminent dismissal and opted for an honorable severance from employment.&nbsp; That respondent voluntarily resigned is a logical conclusion.&nbsp; Justice Arturo D. Brion correctly observed that respondent’s infraction and the inevitable and justifiable consequence of that infraction, <i>i.e.</i>, termination of employment, induced her to resign or promise to resign by the end of the school year.<br><br>Given the indications of voluntary resignation, we rule that there is no constructive dismissal in this case.&nbsp; There is constructive dismissal when there is cessation of work, because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay and other benefits. Aptly called a dismissal in disguise or an act amounting to dismissal but made to appear as if it were not, constructive dismissal may, likewise, exist if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him except to forego his continued employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; There was here no discrimination committed by petitioners.&nbsp; While respondent did not tender her resignation wholeheartedly, circumstances of her own making did not give her any other option. With due process, she was found to have committed the grave offense of leaking test questions.&nbsp; Dismissal from employment was the justified equivalent penalty.&nbsp; Having realized that, she asked for, and was granted, not just a deferred imposition of, but also an acceptable cover for the penalty.<br><br>Respondent’s profession, the gravity of her infraction, and the fact that she waited until the close of the school year to challenge her impending resignation demonstrate that respondent had bargained for a graceful exit and is now trying to renege on her obligation.&nbsp; Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio accordingly noted that petitioners should not be punished for being compassionate and granting respondent’s request for a lower penalty.&nbsp; Put differently, respondent should not be rewarded for reneging on her promise to resign at the end of the school year.&nbsp; Otherwise, employers placed in similar situations would no longer extend compassion to employees.&nbsp; Compromise agreements, like that in the instant case, which lean towards desired liberality that favor labor, would be discouraged.<br><br>Based on the foregoing disquisition, we reverse.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The 29 May 2009 Decision and 2 September 2009 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
