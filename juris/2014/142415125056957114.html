				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Regardless of the type of action — whether it is <i>in personam, in rem</i> or <i>quasi in rem</i> — the preferred mode of service of summons is personal service.&nbsp; To avail themselves of substituted service, courts must rely on a detailed enumeration of the sheriff’s actions and a showing that the defendant cannot be served despite diligent and reasonable efforts.&nbsp; The sheriff’s return, which contains these details, is entitled to a presumption of regularity, and on this basis, the court may allow substituted service.&nbsp; Should the sheriff’s return be wanting of these details, substituted service will be irregular if no other evidence of the efforts to serve summons was presented.<br><br>Failure to serve summons will mean that the court failed to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.&nbsp; However, the filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration is tantamount to voluntary appearance.<br><br>This Rule 45 petition seeks the review of the Court of Appeals July 7, 2010 decision in CA G.R.

Therefore, the Regional Trial Court decision had become final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court also ruled that the reckoning period for filing the motion for new trial cannot be De Pedro’s counsel’s receipt of the decision.&nbsp;

It is not the “thing” that is the party to an <i>in rem</i> action; only legal or natural persons may be parties even in <i>in rem</i> actions.&nbsp; “Against the thing” means that resolution of the case affects interests of others whether direct or indirect.&nbsp; It also assumes that the interests — in the form of rights or duties — attach to the thing which is the subject matter of litigation.&nbsp; In actions <i>in rem</i>, our procedure assumes an active vinculum over those with interests to the thing subject of litigation.<br><br>Due process requires that those with interest to the thing in litigation be notified and given an opportunity to defend those interests.&nbsp; Courts, as guardians of constitutional rights, cannot be expected to deny persons their due process rights while at the same time be considered as acting within their jurisdiction.<br><br>Violation of due process rights is a jurisdictional defect.&nbsp;
