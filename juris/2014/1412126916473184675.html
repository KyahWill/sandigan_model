She alleged that on May 11, 2001, she was informed that her services were to be terminated effective May 31, 2001, pursuant to GCHS’ retirement plan which gives the school the option to retire a teacher who has rendered at least 20 years of service, regardless of age, with a retirement pay of one-half (½) month for every year of service. At that time, Filipinas was only 58 years old and still physically fit to work. She pleaded with GCHS to allow her to continue teaching but her services were terminated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> contrary to the provisions of Republic Act No. (RA) 7641,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> otherwise known as the “Retirement Pay Law.”<br><br>For their part, GCHS denied that they illegally dismissed Filipinas. They asserted that the latter was considered retired on May 31, 1997 after having rendered 20 years of service pursuant to GCHS’ retirement plan and that she was duly advised that her retirement benefits in the amount of P136,210.00 based on her salary at the time of retirement, i.e., P13,621.00, had been deposited to the trustee-bank in her name. Nonetheless, her services were retained on a yearly basis until May 11, 2001 when she was informed that her year-to-year contract would no longer be renewed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b>The LA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated March 26, 2002, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the illegal dismissal complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>The LA found that GCHS has a retirement plan for its faculty and non-faculty members which pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE X<br>RETIREMENT DATES<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Normal Retirement Date </i>– For qualified members of the Plans, the normal retirement date shall be the last day of the month during which he attains age sixty (60) regardless of length of service or upon completion of 20 years of service <b>unless extended at the option of the School.

The said law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> states that “an employee’s retirement benefits under any collective bargaining [agreement (CBA)] and other agreements shall not be less than those provided” under the same – that is, at least one-half (½) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year – and that “[u]nless the parties provide for broader inclusions, the term <u>one-half (½) month salary</u> shall mean fifteen (15) days plus one-twelfth (1/12) of the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and the cash equivalent of not more than five (5) days of service incentive leaves.”<br><br>The foregoing provision is applicable where (a) there is no CBA or other applicable agreement providing for retirement benefits to employees, or (b) there is a CBA or other applicable agreement providing for retirement benefits but it is below the requirement set by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Verily, the determining factor in choosing which retirement scheme to apply is still superiority in terms of benefits provided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the present case, GCHS has a retirement plan for its faculty and non-faculty members, which gives it the option to retire a teacher who has rendered at least 20 years of service, regardless of age, with a retirement pay of one-half (½) month for every year of service. Considering, however, that GCHS computed Filipinas’ retirement pay without including one-twelfth (1/12) of her 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and the cash equivalent of her five (5) days SIL, both the NLRC and the CA correctly ruled that Filipinas’ retirement benefits should be computed in accordance with Article 287 of the Labor Code, as amended by RA 7641, being the more beneficent retirement scheme. They differ, however, in the resulting benefit differentials due to divergent interpretations of the term “one-half (½) month salary” as used under the law.<br><br>The Court, in the case of <i>Elegir v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> has recently affirmed that <b>“<i>one-half (½) month salary means <u>22.5 days</u></i>:&nbsp; <u>15 days plus 2.5 days representing one-twelfth (1/12) of the 13th month pay and the remaining 5 days for [SIL]</u>.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court sees no reason to depart from this interpretation. GCHS’ argument<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> therefore that the 5 days SIL should be likewise pro-rated to their 1/12 equivalent must fail.<br><br>Section 5.2, Rule II<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the Implementing Rules of Book VI of the Labor Code, as amended, promulgated to implement RA 7641, further clarifies what comprises the “½ month salary” due a retiring employee, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE II<br>Retirement Benefits</center><br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 5.<b> Retirement Benefits.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>5.2 <i>Components of One-half (½) Month Salary.</i> — For the purpose of determining the minimum retirement pay due an employee under this Rule, the term “one-half month salary” shall include all the following:<br><br>(a)<b> Fifteen (15) days salary of the employee based on his latest salary rate</b>. As used herein, the term “salary” includes all remunerations paid by an employer to his employees for services rendered during normal working days and hours, whether such payments are fixed or ascertained on a time, task, piece or commission basis, or other method of calculating the same, and includes the fair and reasonable value, as determined by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, of food, lodging or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer to his employees. The term does not include cost of living allowance, profit-sharing payments and other monetary benefits which are not considered as part of or integrated into the regular salary of the employees.<br><br>(b) <b>The cash equivalent of not more than five (5) days of service incentive leave;</b><br><br>(c) <b>One-twelfth of the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay</b> due the employee.<br><br>(d) All other benefits that the employer and employee may agree upon that should be included in the computation of the employee’s retirement pay.<br><br>x x x x (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The foregoing rules are, thus, clear that the <b>whole 5 days of SIL</b> are included in the computation of a retiring employees’ pay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as correctly ruled by the CA.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court finds that the award of <b>legal interest </b>at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i> on the amount of P68,150.00 representing the retirement pay differentials due Filipinas <b>should be reckoned from the rendition of the LA’s Decision on March 26, 2002</b> and <b><u>not</u></b> from the filing of the illegal dismissal complaint as ordered by the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> in accordance with the ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Eastern Shipping). Unlike in <i>MLQU v. NLRC</i>, where the retired teachers sued for the payment of the deficiency in their retirement benefits, Filipinas’ complaint was for illegal (constructive) dismissal, and <b><u>the obligation to provide retirement pay was only determined upon the rendition of the LA’s Decision</u></b>, which also found the same to be deficient vis-à-vis those provided under RA 7641. As such, it is only from the date of the LA’s Decision that GCHS’ obligation to pay Filipinas her retirement pay differentials may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained and its payment legally adjudged to be due, although the actual base for the computation of legal interest shall be on the amount finally adjudged. As held in the <i>Eastern Shipping</i> case:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><blockquote>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the <i>discretion of the court </i>at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i>. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) <b>but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).
