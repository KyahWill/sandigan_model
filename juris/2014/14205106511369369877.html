Respondent also signed a Final Pay Computation evidencing payment of the said amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>This notwithstanding, Ortiz, on February 27, 2007, filed a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for illegal dismissal against Michelin ASC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-02-01810-07, claiming, among others, that: (a) he was not aware that Michelin ASC had an impending redundancy program; (b) he was promised a separation package in the amount of 2.5 months' salary for every year of service; and (c) he, was, however, offered a lesser package upon his termination but was forced to accept the same since he had a family to support and was then 53 years old.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The LA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated November 27, 2007, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the illegal dismissal complaint, holding that Michelin ASC complied with the statutory requirements of a valid redundancy program and that the same was conducted in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In this relation, the LA pointed out that Ortiz executed a quitclaim in favor of Michelin ASC and had received the total of P2,225,561.66, which amount was more than what the law provides as separation pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Furthermore, the LA did not sustain Ortiz's claim regarding the separation package amounting to 2.5 months' salary for every year of service, considering the Affidavit<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[22]</sup></font>&nbsp; executed by Michelin ASC's Senior Legal Counsel, Angeline Khoo, denying the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Unconvinced, Ortiz appealed before the NLRC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the NLRC</b><br></center><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated March 24, 2008, the NLRC dismissed Ortiz's appeal for not having been duly perfected, observing that his <b>Memorandum of Appeal was <u>not accompanied by a certificate of non-forum shopping</u> in violation of Section 4</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <b>Rule VI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (NLRC Rules).<br><br>Ortiz moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated June 24, 2008, considering that his motion was filed out of time. In particular, the NLRC observed that Ortiz himself admitted that he received a copy of the resolution sought to be reconsidered on April 14, 2008. However, <b><u>his motion for reconsideration was only filed on May 7, 2008</u>, hence, <u>beyond the 10-day reglementary period to perfect the same</u>, in violation of the mandatory requirement under Section 15,</b><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[30]</sup></font><b> Rule VII of the NLRC Rules.</b><br><br>Dissatisfied, Ortiz filed a <b><u>second motion for reconsideration</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> on July 14, 2008, to which Michelin ASC was required to comment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated September 22, 2008, the NLRC did not give due course to the <b><u>second motion for reconsideration</u> for being in violation also of Section 15</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <b>Rule VII of the NLRC Rules</b>, or the prohibition against second motions for reconsideration.<br><br><b><center>The Proceedings Before the CA<br></center></b><br>Undeterred, Ortiz, on December 12, 2008, filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> before the CA assailing the LA Decision and the NLRC's March 24, 2008, June 24, 2008, and September 22, 2008 Resolutions.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated December 19, 2008, the CA dismissed Ortiz's petition for having been <u>filed out of time</u>, remarking that a second motion for reconsideration before the NLRC was not allowed. The CA also dismissed the petition on the ground that <u>a relevant pleading was not attached to it</u>, <i>i.e</i>., Ortiz's reply.<br><br>Ortiz filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated January 9, 2009,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to which Michelin ASC was required to comment.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[38]</sup></font><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated June 2, 2009, the CA reversed its earlier December 19, 2008 Resolution, and annulled the NLRC's March 24, 2008, June 24, 2008, and September 22, 2008 Resolutions, thus directing the NLRC to give due course to Ortiz's appeal. Mainly, the CA ruled that there was <i>prima facie </i>merit in Ortiz's contention and found it fitting to relax the procedural rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Michelin ASC moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated September 29, 2008, hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue before the Court is whether or not the CA properly granted Ortiz's petition for <i>certiorari</i> and annulled the NLRC Resolutions.<br><br><b><center>The Court's Ruling<br></center></b><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>To justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon them. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a <b><i><u>capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction</u></i></b>. To be considered "grave," the discretionary authority must be exercised <b>in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be <i><u>so patent and sross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law</u></i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>After evaluating the relevant antecedents of this case, the Court comes to the conclusion that no grave abuse of discretion, in the sense above-described, was committed by the NLRC in dismissing Ortiz's appeal. As seen from the preceding factual narration, it is clear that the NLRC - in due observance of its own procedural rules - had amply justified its dismissal of Ortiz's appeal in view of his numerous procedural infractions, namely: (<i>a</i>) his failure to attach to his Memorandum of Appeal a certificate of non-forum shopping in violation of Section 4, Rule VI of the NLRC Rules;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (<i>b</i>) his filing of a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC's March 24, 2008 Resolution beyond the 10 day reglementary period in violation of Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC Rules;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and (c) his filing of a second motion for reconsideration in violation of Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Of significant consideration is Ortiz's violation of the mandatory requirement on the timely filing of a motion for reconsideration, which thus rendered the NLRC's initial March 24, 2008 Resolution <b><u>final and executory</u></b>. <i>Silva v. NLRC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> instructs:<br><br><blockquote>Time and again, this Court has been emphatic in ruling that the seasonable filing of a motion for reconsideration within the 10-day reglementary period following the receipt by a party of any order, resolution or decision of the NLRC, is a <b>mandatory requirement</b> to forestall <b>the finality</b> of such order, resolution or decision. The statutory base for this is found in Article 223<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[48]</sup></font> of the Labor Code and Section 14, Rule VII<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[49]</sup></font> of the New Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>"A definitive final judgment [- such as the NLRC's March 24, 2008 Resolution -] however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Settled is the rule that "<b><u>[a] decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable</u></b>. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Hence, by the foregoing consideration alone, the CA should have dismissed Ortiz's <i>certiorari</i> petition. But this is not all.<br><br>To compound his mistakes, Ortiz even filed a <b>second motion for reconsideration</b>, which is a prohibited pleading under the NLRC Rules. As a prohibited pleading, the filing of said motion <b>could not have tolled the running of the 60-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> </b>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. Thus, since the NLRC's June 24, 2008 Resolution assailed by Ortiz's second motion for reconsideration was received by him on July 8, 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> while his petition for certiorari before the CA was filed <b>more than 60 days thereafter</b>, or on December 12, 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> his <i>certiorari </i>petition should have been dismissed outright for having been filed out of time.<br><br>Therefore, for all these reasons, the Court reverses the CA Decision and reinstates the NLRC Resolutions dismissing Ortiz's appeal. Accordingly, it is now unnecessary to delve on the other ancillary issues raised in the petition of Michelin ASC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
