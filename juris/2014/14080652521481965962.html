Sps. Banal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> commences with the LBP determining the value of the lands under the land reform program. Using the LBP’s valuation, the DAR makes an offer to the landowner through a notice of coverage and acquisition pursuant to Section 16(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of RA 6657. If the landowner accepts the offer, the LBP shall pay him the purchase price of the land after he executes and delivers a deed of transfer and surrenders the certificate of title in favor of the government. In case the landowner rejects the offer, the DAR adjudicator conducts summary administrative proceedings to determine the compensation for the land by requiring the landowner, the LBP, and other interested parties to submit evidence in this relation. A party who disagrees with the decision of the DAR adjudicator may bring the matter to the Regional Trial Court designated as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC) for final determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the LBP avers that the DAR has not forwarded to it the corresponding claim folder which is purportedly a mandatory requirement in order that the payment for the acquired lands may be disbursed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that the subject portion had already been expropriated considering (<i>a</i>) the DAR’s admission that it had already valued the same under PD 27 and EO 228,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the issuance of EPs and/or CLTs to some of the tenants-beneficiaries,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> thereby dispossessing the Gacias Heirs of their property without just compensation. Certainly, the Gacias Heirs’ entitlement to just compensation for the taking of their property cannot be disregarded by the mere absence of the claim folders asserted in this case, as otherwise, the Court would be abetting the perpetration of a grave injustice against them,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> occasioned by the undue delay and unjustified failure of the DAR to forward to the LBP the said folders even after the taking of the subject portion and the issuance of the EPs and/or CLTs to some of the tenants-beneficiaries.<br><br>It bears noting, however, that the portions conveyed by Sps. Gacias to their children were previously declared by the DAR Secretary to be within the coverage of the OLT Program under PD 27, holding that the said conveyances were ineffectual for failure to comply with the requisites of DAR Memorandum dated May 7, 1982.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Corollarily, the subject portion was placed under the OLT Program under the name of the original owner, and the RTC, in an Order dated July 22, 2000, directed the DAR Provincial Agrarian Reform Office of Sorsogon, Sorsogon to forward the claim folder of <b>Sabiniano Gacias</b> to the LBP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>While the LBP is charged<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> with the initial responsibility of determining the value of lands placed under the land reform program and the compensation to be paid for their taking,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> guided by the records/ documents contained in the claim folders,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> it must be emphasized that its valuation is considered only as an initial determination, which is not conclusive. Verily, it is the Regional Trial Court, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, that should make the final determination of just compensation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and which has the final say on what the amount of just compensation will be<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> pursuant to the well-settled rule that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This rule notwithstanding, a review of the records, nonetheless, impels the Court to order <b><i>the remand of the case</i></b> to the RTC considering the failure of both the RTC and the CA to consider the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, in determining the just compensation for the subject portion.<br><br>Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> For purposes of determining just compensation, the fair market value of an expropriated property is determined by its <i>character </i>and its<i> price</i> at the time of<i> taking.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In addition, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <i>i.e</i>., (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land, (b) the current value of like properties, (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property and the income therefrom, (<i>d</i>) the owner’s sworn valuation, (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations, (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors, (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (<i>h</i>) the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.<br><br>The Court has gone over the records and observed that none of the aforementioned factors were even considered and found inapplicable by the RTC and the CA. As such, the Court is led to conclude that the valuation arrived at was not in accordance with the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, thus, necessitating the remand as aforementioned. To this end, the RTC is hereby directed to observe the following guidelines in the remand of the case:<br><br><b><u>1</u>. <i>Compensation must be valued at the time of taking</i></b>, or the time when the landowner was deprived of the use and benefit of his property, such as when title is transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Hence, the evidence to be presented by the parties before the trial court for the valuation of the subject portion must be based on the <u>values prevalent at such time of taking for like agricultural lands.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><b><u>2</u>. <i>The evidence must conform with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its amendment by RA 9700</i></b>. It bears pointing out that while Congress passed RA 9700 on July 1, 2009,<i> further</i> amending certain provisions of RA 6657, as amended, among them, Section 17, and declaring “(t)hat all previously acquired lands wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners shall be completed and finally resolved pursuant to Section 17 of [RA 6657], as amended,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the law should not be retroactively applied to pending claims/cases.<br><br>With this in mind, the Court, cognizant of the fact that the instant consolidated petitions for review on <i>certiorari </i>were filed in August 2008, or long before the passage of RA 9700, finds that <b>Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its further amendment by RA No. 9700, should control the challenged valuation</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><b><u>3.</u> <i>The Regional Trial Court may impose interest on the just compensation as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case and based on prevailing jurisprudence</i>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In previous cases, the Court has allowed the grant of legal interest in expropriation cases where there is delay in the payment since the just compensation due to the landowners was deemed to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Legal interest shall be pegged at the rate of 12% p.a. from the time of taking until June 30, 2013 only. Thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due the landowners shall earn interest at the new legal rate of 6% p.a. in line with the amendment introduced by BSP-MB Circular No. 799,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> series of 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><u><b>4.</b></u> The Regional Trial Court is reminded, however, that while it should take into account the different formula created by the DAR in arriving at the just compensation for the subject portion, <b><i>it is not strictly bound thereto if the situations before it do not warrant their application</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As held in <i>LBP v. Heirs of Maximo Puyat</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he determination of just compensation is a judicial function; hence, courts cannot be unduly restricted in their determination thereof. To do so would deprive the courts of their judicial prerogatives and reduce them to the bureaucratic function of inputting data and arriving at the valuation. While the courts should be mindful of the different formulae created by the DAR in arriving at just compensation, they are not strictly bound to adhere thereto if the situations before them do not warrant it. Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals thoroughly discusses this issue, to wit:<br><blockquote>“x x x [T]he basic formula and its alternatives–administratively determined (as it is not found in Republic Act No. 6657, but merely set forth in DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998)–although referred to and even applied by the courts in certain instances, does not and cannot strictly bind the courts. To insist that the formula must be applied with utmost rigidity whereby the valuation is drawn following a strict mathematical computation goes beyond the intent and spirit of the law. The suggested interpretation is strained and would render the law inutile. Statutory construction should not kill but give life to the law. As we have established in earlier jurisprudence, the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which is vested in the regional trial court acting as a SAC, and not in administrative agencies. The SAC, therefore, must still be able to reasonably exercise its judicial discretion in the evaluation of the factors for just compensation, which cannot be arbitrarily restricted by a formula dictated by the DAR, an administrative agency. Surely, DAR AO No. 5 did not intend to straightjacket the hands of the court in the computation of the land valuation. While it provides a formula, it could not have been its intention to shackle the courts into applying the formula in every instance. The court shall apply the formula after an evaluation of the three factors, or it may proceed to make its own computation based on the extended list in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which includes other factors[.] x x x.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the consolidated petitions are <b>GRANTED</b>.
