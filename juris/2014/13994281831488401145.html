The Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Regional Trial Court of Makati’s decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 4, 2006.<br><br>The facts as established from the pleadings of the parties are as follows:<br><br>On March 9, 1995, Lui Enterprises, Inc. and Zuellig Pharma Corporation entered into a 10-year contract of lease<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> over a parcel of land located in Barrio Tigatto, Buhangin, Davao City. The parcel of land was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-166476 and was registered under Eli L. Lui.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 2003, Zuellig Pharma received a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> from the Philippine Bank of Communications. Claiming to be the new owner of the leased property, the bank asked Zuellig Pharma to pay rent directly to it. Attached to the letter was a copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 336962 under the name of the Philippine Bank of Communications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Transfer Certificate of Title No. 336962 was derived from Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-166476.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Zuellig Pharma promptly informed Lui Enterprises of the Philippine Bank of Communications’ claim. On January 28, 2003, Lui Enterprises wrote to Zuellig Pharma and insisted on its right to collect the leased property’s rent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Due to the conflicting claims of Lui Enterprises and the Philippine Bank of Communications over the rental payments, Zuellig Pharma filed a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for interpleader with the Regional Trial Court of Makati. In its complaint, Zuellig Pharma alleged that it already consigned in court P604,024.35 as rental payments. Zuellig Pharma prayed that it be allowed to consign in court its succeeding monthly rental payments and that Lui Enterprises and the Philippine Bank of Communications be ordered to litigate their conflicting claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Philippine Bank of Communications filed its answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to the complaint. On the other hand, Lui Enterprises filed a motion to dismiss<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on the ground that Zuellig Pharma’s alleged representative did not have authority to file the complaint for interpleader on behalf of the corporation. Under the secretary’s certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated May 6, 2003 attached to the complaint, Atty. Ana L.A. Peralta was only authorized to “initiate and represent [Zuellig Pharma] in the civil proceedings for consignation of rental payments to be filed against Lui Enterprises, Inc. and/or [the Philippine Bank of Communications].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>According to Lui Enterprises, an earlier filed nullification of deed of dation in payment case pending with the Regional Trial Court of Davao barred the filing of the interpleader case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Lui Enterprises filed this nullification case against the Philippine Bank of Communications with respect to several properties it dationed to the bank in payment of its obligations. The property leased by Zuellig Pharma was among those allegedly dationed to the Philippine Bank of Communications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the nullification of deed of dation in payment case, Lui Enterprises raised the issue of which corporation had the better right over the rental payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Lui Enterprises argued that the same issue was involved in the interpleader case. To avoid possible conflicting decisions of the Davao trial court and the Makati trial court on the same issue, Lui Enterprises argued that the subsequently filed interpleader case be dismissed.<br><br>To support its argument, Lui Enterprises cited a writ of preliminary injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated July 2, 2003 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Davao, ordering Lui Enterprises and the Philippine Bank of Communications “[to maintain] status quo”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> with respect to the rent. By virtue of the writ of preliminary injunction, Lui Enterprises argued that it should continue collecting the rental payments from its lessees until the nullification of deed of dation in payment case was resolved. The writ of preliminary injunction dated July 2, 2003 reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, on June 30, 2003, the Court issued an Order, a portion of which is quoted:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, let a Writ of Preliminary Injunction issue, restraining and enjoining [the Philippine Bank of Communications], its agents or [representative], the Office of the Clerk of Court-Sheriff and all persons acting on their behalf, from conducting auction sale on the properties of [Lui Enterprises] in EJF-REM Case No. 6272-03 scheduled on July 3, 2003 at 10:00 a.m. at the Hall of Justice, Ecoland, Davao City, until the final termination of the case, upon plaintiff [sic] filing of a bond in the amount of P1,000,000.00 to answer for damages that the enjoined parties may sustain by reason of the injunction if the Court should finally decide that applicant is not entitled thereto.</blockquote>WHEREAS, that plaintiff posted a bond of P1,000,000.00 duly approved by this Court.<br><br>IT IS HEREBY ORDERED by the undersigned Judge that, until further orders, [the Philippine Bank of Communications] and all [its] attorneys, representatives, agents and any other persons assisting [the bank], are directed to restrain from conducting auction sale on the Properties of [Lui Enterprises] in EJF-REM Case No. 6272-03 scheduled on July 3, 2003 at 10:00 a.m. at the Hall of Justice, Ecoland, Davao City, until the final termination of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Zuellig Pharma filed its opposition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the motion to dismiss. It argued that the motion to dismiss should be denied for having been filed late. Under Rule 16, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to dismiss should be filed within the required time given to file an answer to the complaint, which is 15 days from service of summons on the defendant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Summons was served on Lui Enterprises on July 4, 2003. It had until July 19, 2003 to file a motion to dismiss, but Lui Enterprises filed the motion only on July 23, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As to Lui Enterprises’ claim that the interpleader case was filed without authority, Zuellig Pharma argued that an action interpleader “is a necessary consequence of the action for consignation.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Zuellig Pharma consigned its rental payments because of “the clearly conflicting claims of [Lui Enterprises] and [the Philippine Bank of Communications].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Since Atty. Ana L.A. Peralta was authorized to file a consignation case, this authority necessarily included an authority to file the interpleader case.<br><br>Nevertheless, Zuellig Pharma filed in court the secretary’s certificate dated August 28, 2003,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which expressly stated that Atty. Ana L.A. Peralta was authorized to file a consignation and interpleader case on behalf of Zuellig Pharma.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>With respect to the nullification of deed of dation in payment case, Zuellig Pharma argued that its pendency did not bar the filing of the interpleader case. It was not a party to the nullification case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As to the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court of Davao, Zuellig Pharma argued that the writ only pertained to properties owned by Lui Enterprises. Under the writ of preliminary injunction, the Regional Trial Court of Davao enjoined the July 3, 2003 auction sale of Lui Enterprises’ properties, the proceeds of which were supposed to satisfy its obligations to the Philippine Bank of Communications. As early as April 21, 2001, however, the Philippine Bank of Communications already owned the leased property as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 336962. Thus, the writ of preliminary injunction did not apply to the leased property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Considering that Lui Enterprises filed its motion to dismiss beyond the 15-day period to file an answer, Zuellig Pharma moved that Lui Enterprises be declared in default.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In its compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated September 15, 2003, the Philippine Bank of Communications “[joined Zuellig Pharma] in moving to declare [Lui Enterprises] in default, and in [moving for] the denial of [Lui Enterprises’] motion to dismiss.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court of Makati found that Lui Enterprises failed to file its motion to dismiss within the reglementary period. Thus, in its order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated October 6, 2003, the trial court denied Lui Enterprises’ motion to dismiss and declared it in default.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Lui Enterprises did not move for the reconsideration of the order dated October 6, 2003. Thus, the Makati trial court heard the interpleader case without Lui Enterprises’ participation.<br><br>Despite having been declared in default, Lui Enterprises filed the manifestation with prayer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated April 15, 2004. It manifested that the Regional Trial Court of Davao allegedly issued the order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated April 1, 2004, ordering all of Lui Enterprises’ lessees to “observe status quo with regard to the rental payments”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and continue remitting their rental payments to Lui Enterprises while the nullification of deed of dation in payment case was being resolved. The order dated April 1, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>ORDER<br></center><br>Posed for Resolution is the Motion for Amendment of Order filed by [Lui Enterprises] on September 23, 2003 seeking for the preservation of status quo on the payment/remittance of rentals to [it] and the disposal/construction of the properties subject matter of this case.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As elsewhere stated, [the Philippine Bank of Communications] did not oppose the instant motion up to the present. In fact, during the hearing held on March 15, 2004, [the bank’s] counsel manifested in open court that except for the rentals due from [Zuellig Pharma] which are the subject of a consignation suit before a Makati Court, the other rental payments are continuously received by [Lui Enterprises].<br><br>There being no objection from [the Philippine Bank of Communications], and in order to protect the right of [Lui Enterprises] respecting the subject of the action during the pendency of this case, this Court, in the exercise of its discretion hereby grants the motion.<br><br>Accordingly, consistent with the order of this Court dated June 30, 2003, the parties are hereby directed to further observe status quo with regard to the rental payments owing or due from the lessees of the properties subject of the first set of deeds of dacion and that the defendants are enjoined from disposing of the properties located at Green Heights Village, Davao City until the case is finally resolved.</blockquote><br>With the order dated April 1, 2004 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Davao as basis, Lui Enterprises argued that Zuellig Pharma must remit its rental payments to it and prayed that the interpleader case be dismissed.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court of Makati only noted the manifestation with prayer dated April 15, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It was only on October 21, 2004, or one year after the issuance of the order of default, that Lui Enterprises filed a motion to set aside order of default<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> in the Makati trial court on the ground of excusable negligence. Lui Enterprises argued that its failure to file a motion to dismiss on time “was caused by the negligence of [Lui Enterprises’] former counsel.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This negligence was allegedly excusable because “[Lui Enterprises] was prejudiced and prevented from fairly presenting [its] case.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>For its allegedly meritorious defense, Lui Enterprises argued that the earlier filed nullification of deed of dation in payment case barred the filing of the interpleader case. The two actions allegedly involved the same parties and the same issue of which corporation had the better right over the rental payments. To prevent “the possibility of two courts x x x rendering conflicting rulings [on the same issue],”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Lui Enterprises argued that the subsequently filed interpleader case be dismissed.<br><br>Zuellig Pharma filed its opposition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> to the motion to set aside order of default. It argued that a counsel’s failure to file a timely answer was inexcusable negligence which bound his client.<br><br>Further, Zuellig Pharma argued that the pending case for nullification of deed of dation in payment “[did] not preclude [Zuellig Pharma] from seeking the relief prayed for in the [interpleader case].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>While the motion to set aside order of default was still pending for resolution, Lui Enterprises filed the manifestation and motion to dismiss<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated April 21, 2005 in the Makati trial court. It manifested that the Davao trial court issued another order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated April 18, 2005 in the nullification of deed of dation in payment case. In this order, the Davao trial court directed the Philippine Bank of Communications to inform Zuellig Pharma to pay rent to Lui Enterprises while the Davao trial court’s order dated April 1, 2004 was subsisting. The order dated April 18, 2005 of the Davao trial court reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>ORDER<br></center><br>Plaintiffs move for execution or implementation of the Order dated September 14, 2004. In substance, [Lui Enterprises] seek[s] to compel the remittance in their favor of the rentals from [Zuellig Pharma], one of the lessees alluded to in the September 14, 2004 Order whose rental payments “must be remitted to and collected by [Lui Enterprises].” [The Philippine Bank of Communications] did not submit any opposition.<br><br>It appears from the records that sometime in February 2003, after being threatened with a lawsuit coming from [the Philippine Bank of Communications], [Zuellig Pharma] stopped remitting its rentals to [Lui Enterprises] and instead, has reportedly deposited the monthly rentals before a Makati court for consignation.<br><br>As aptly raised by the plaintiffs, a possible impasse may insist should the Makati Court’s ruling be contrary to or in conflict with the status quo order issued by this Court. To preclude this spectacle, Zuellig Pharma should accordingly be advised with the import of the Order dated September 14, 2004, the salient portion of which is quoted:<br><blockquote>x x x prior to the institution of the instant case and by agreement of the parties, plaintiffs were given as they did exercise the right to collect, receive and enjoy rental payments x x x.<br><br>Since the April 1, 2004 status quo order was a necessary implement of the writ of preliminary injunction issued on June 30, 2003, it follows that plaintiff's right to collect and receive rental payments which he enjoyed prior to the filing of this case, must be respected and protected and maintained until the case is resolved. As such, all rentals due from the above-enumerated lessees must be remitted to and collected by the Plaintiffs.<br><br>Status quo simply means the last actual peaceable uncontested status that preceded the actual controversy. (Searth Commodities Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 207 SCRA 622).</blockquote>As such, the [Philippine Bank of Communications] [is] hereby directed to forthwith inform [Zuellig Pharma] of the April 1, 2004 status quo order and the succeeding September 14, 2004 Order, and consequently, for the said lessee to remit all rentals due from February 23, 2003 and onwards to [Lui Enterprises] in the meanwhile that the status quo order is subsisting.</blockquote><br>In its manifestation and motion to dismiss, Lui Enterprises reiterated its prayer for the dismissal of the interpleader case to prevent “the possibility of [the Regional Trial Court, Branch 143, Makati City] and [the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, Davao City] rendering conflicting rulings [on the same issue of which corporation has the better right to the rental payments].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Without resolving the motion to set aside order of default, the Makati trial court denied the manifestation with motion to dismiss dated April 21, 2005 on the ground that Lui Enterprises already lost its standing in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Lui Enterprises did not file any motion for reconsideration of the denial of the manifestation and motion to dismiss dated April 21, 2005.<br><br>In its decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated July 4, 2006, the Regional Trial Court of Makati ruled that Lui Enterprises “[was] barred from any claim in respect of the [rental payments]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> since it was declared in default. Thus, according to the trial court, there was no issue as to which corporation had the better right over the rental payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The trial court awarded the total consigned amount of P6,681,327.30 to the Philippine Bank of Communications and ordered Lui Enterprises to pay Zuellig Pharma P50,000.00 in attorney’s fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Lui Enterprises appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found Lui Enterprises’ appellant’s brief insufficient. Under Rule 44, Section 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, an appellant’s brief must contain a subject index, page references to the record, table of cases, textbooks and statutes cited, and the statement of issues, among others. However, Lui Enterprises’ appellant’s brief did not contain these requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>As to the denial of Lui Enterprises’ motion to dismiss, the Court of Appeals sustained the trial court. The Court of Appeals found that Lui Enterprises filed its motion to dismiss four days late.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>With respect to Lui Enterprises’ motion to set aside order of default, the Court of Appeals found that Lui Enterprises failed to show the excusable negligence that prevented it from filing its motion to dismiss on time. On its allegedly meritorious defense, the Court of Appeals ruled that the nullification of deed of dation in payment case did not bar the filing of the interpleader case, with Zuellig Pharma not being a party to the nullification case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>On the award of attorney’s fees, the Court of Appeals sustained the trial court since “Zuellig Pharma x x x was constrained to file the action for interpleader with consignation in order to protect its interests x x x.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Thus, in its decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> promulgated on May 24, 2010, the Court of Appeals dismissed Lui Enterprises’ appeal and affirmed in toto the Regional Trial Court of Makati’s decision.<br><br>Lui Enterprises filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals denied Lui Enterprises’ motion for reconsideration in its resolution promulgated on August 13, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Hence, this petition.<br><br>In this petition for review on certiorari,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Lui Enterprises argued that the Court of Appeals applied “the rules of procedure strictly”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and dismissed its appeal on technicalities.

The nullification of deed of dation in payment case and the interpleader case allegedly involved the same issue of which corporation had the better right to the rent. To avoid conflicting rulings on the same issue, Lui Enterprises argued that the subsequently filed interpleader case be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>No attorney’s fees should have been awarded to Zuellig Pharma as argued by Lui Enterprises. Zuellig Pharma filed the interpleader case despite its knowledge of the nullification of deed of dation in payment case filed in the Davao trial court where the same issue of which corporation had the better right over the rental payments was being litigated. Thus, Zuellig Pharma filed the interpleader case in bad faith for which it was not entitled to attorney’s fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Philippine Bank of Communications filed its comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> on the petition for review on certiorari.
