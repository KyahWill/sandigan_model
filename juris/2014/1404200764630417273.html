				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In late 2001 the Traders Royal Bank (TRB) proposed to sell to petitioner Bank of Commerce (Bancommerce) for P10.4 billion its banking business consisting of specified assets and liabilities. Bancommerce agreed subject to prior Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP’s) approval of their Purchase and Assumption (P &amp; A) Agreement. On November 8, 2001 the BSP approved that agreement subject to the condition that Bancommerce and TRB would set up an escrow fund of P50 million with another bank to cover TRB liabilities for contingent claims that may subsequently be adjudged against it, which liabilities were excluded from the purchase.<br><br>Specifically, the BSP Monetary Board Min. No. 58 (MB Res. 58) decided as follows:<br><br><blockquote>1. To approve the revised terms sheet as finalized on September 21, 2001 granting certain incentives pursuant to Circular No. 237, series of 2000 to serve as a basis for the final Purchase and Assumption (P &amp; A) Agreement between the Bank of Commerce (BOC) and Traders Royal Bank (TRB); subject to inclusion of the following provision in the P &amp; A:<br><br><blockquote>The parties to the P &amp; A had considered other potential liabilities against TRB, and to address these claims, the parties have agreed to set up an escrow fund amounting to Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00) in cash to be invested in government securities to answer for any such claim that shall be judicially established, which fund shall be kept for 15 years in the trust department of any other bank acceptable to the BSP. Any deviation therefrom shall require prior approval from the Monetary Board.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Following the above approval, on November 9, 2001 Bancommerce entered into a P &amp; A Agreement with TRB and acquired its specified assets and liabilities, excluding liabilities arising from judicial actions which were to be covered by the BSP-mandated escrow of P50 million.<br><br>To comply with the BSP mandate, on December 6, 2001 TRB placed P50 million in escrow with Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (Metrobank) to answer for those claims and liabilities that were excluded from the P &amp; A Agreement and remained with TRB. Accordingly, the BSP finally approved such agreement on July 3, 2002.<br><br>Shortly after or on October 10, 2002, acting in G.R. 138510, <i>Traders Royal Bank v. Radio Philippines Network (RPN), Inc.,</i> this Court ordered TRB to pay respondents RPN, Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, and Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (collectively, RPN, et al.) actual damages of P9,790,716.87 plus 12% legal interest and some amounts. Based on this decision, RPN, et al. filed a motion for execution against TRB before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City. But rather than pursue a levy in execution of the corresponding amounts on escrow with Metrobank, RPN, et al. filed a Supplemental Motion for Execution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> where they described TRB as “now Bank of Commerce” based on the assumption that TRB had been merged into Bancommerce.<br><br>On February 20, 2004, having learned of the supplemental application for execution, Bancommerce filed its Special Appearance with Opposition to the same<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> questioning the jurisdiction of the RTC over Bancommerce and denying that there was a merger between TRB and Bancommerce. On August 15, 2005 the RTC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> granting and issuing the writ of execution to cover any and all assets of TRB, “including those subject of the merger/consolidation in the guise of a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Bank of Commerce, and/or against the Escrow Fund established by TRB and Bank of Commerce with the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company.”<br><br>This prompted Bancommerce to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP 91258 assailing the RTC’s Order. On December 8, 2009 the CA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> denied the petition. The CA pointed out that the Decision of the RTC was clear in that Bancommerce was not being made to answer for the liabilities of TRB, but rather the assets or properties of TRB under its possession and custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In the same Decision, the CA modified the Decision of the RTC by deleting the phrase that the P &amp; A Agreement between TRB and Bancommerce is a farce or “a mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation between TRB and BANCOM.” The CA Decision partly reads:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>We are not prepared though, unlike the respondent Judge, to declare the PSA between TRB and BANCOM as a farce or “a mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation” of the parties to the PSA. There is just a dearth of conclusive evidence to support such a finding, at least at this point. Consequently, the statement in the dispositive portion of the assailed August 15, 2005 Order referring to a merger/consolidation between TRB and BANCOM is deleted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, the herein consolidated Petitions are DENIED. The assailed Orders dated August 15, 2005 and February 22, 2006 of the respondent Judge, are AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the pronouncement of respondent Judge in the August 15, 2005 Order that the PSA between TRB and BANCOM is a farce or “a mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation between TRB and BANCOM” is DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On January 8, 2010 RPN, <i>et al.</i> filed with the RTC a motion to cause the issuance of an alias writ of execution against Bancommerce based on the CA Decision. The RTC granted<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the motion on February 19, 2010 on the premise that the CA Decision allowed it to execute on the assets that Bancommerce acquired from TRB under their P &amp; A Agreement.<br><br>On March 10, 2010 Bancommerce sought reconsideration of the RTC Order considering that the December 8, 2009 CA Decision actually declared that no merger existed between TRB and Bancommerce. But, since the RTC had already issued the alias writ on March 9, 2010 Bancommerce filed on March 16, 2010 a motion to quash the same, followed by supplemental motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on April 29, 2010.<br><br>On August 18, 2010 the RTC issued the assailed Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> denying Bancommerce pleas and, among others, directing the release to the Sheriff of Bancommerce’s “garnished monies and shares of stock or their monetary equivalent” and for the sheriff to pay 25% of the amount “to the respondents’ counsel representing his attorney’s fees and P200,000.00 representing his appearance fees and litigation expenses” and the balance to be paid to the respondents after deducting court dues.<br><br>Aggrieved, Bancommerce immediately elevated the RTC Order to the CA <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 to assail the Orders dated February 19, 2010 and August 18, 2010. On November 26, 2010 the CA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dismissed the petition outright for the supposed failure of Bancommerce to file a motion for reconsideration of the assailed order. The CA denied Bancommerce’s motion for reconsideration on February 9, 2011, prompting it to come to this Court.<br><br>The issues this case presents are:<br><br>1. Whether or not the CA gravely erred in holding that Bancommerce had no valid excuse in failing to file the required motion for reconsideration of the assailed RTC Order before coming to the CA; and<br><br>2. Whether or not the CA gravely erred in failing to rule that the RTC’s Order of execution against Bancommerce was a nullity because the CA Decision of December 8, 2009 in CA-G.R. SP 91258 held that TRB had not been merged into Bancommerce as to make the latter liable for TRB’s judgment debts.<br><br><i>Direct filing of the petition for<br> certiorari by Bancommerce&nbsp; </i><br><br>Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that a petition for <i>certiorari </i>may only be filed when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the course of law. Since a motion for reconsideration is generally regarded as a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, the failure to first take recourse to is usually regarded as fatal omission.<br><br>But Bancommerce invoked certain recognized exceptions to the rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It had to forego the filing of the required motion for reconsideration of the assailed RTC Order because a) there was an urgent necessity for the CA to resolve the questions it raised and any further delay would prejudice its interests; b) under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would have been useless; c) Bancommerce had been deprived of its right to due process when the RTC issued the challenged order <i>ex parte,</i> depriving it of an opportunity to object; and d) the issues raised were purely of law.<br><br>In this case, the records amply show that Bancommerce’s action fell within the recognized exceptions to the need to file a motion for reconsideration before filing a petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br><u>First</u>. The filing of a motion for reconsideration would be redundant since actually the RTC’s August 18, 2010 Order amounts to a denial of Bancommerce motion for reconsideration of the February 19, 2010 Order which granted the application for the issuance of the alias writ. Significantly, the alias writ of execution itself, the quashal of which was sought by Bancommerce two times (via a motion to quash the writ and a supplemental motion to quash the writ) derived its existence from the RTC’s February 19, 2010 Order. Another motion for reconsideration would have been superfluous. The RTC had not budge on those issues in the preceding incidents. There was no point in repeatedly asking it to reconsider.<br><br><u>Second</u>. An urgent necessity for the immediate resolution of the case by the CA existed because any further delay would have greatly prejudiced Bancommerce. The Sheriff had been resolute and relentless in trying to execute the judgment and dispose of the levied assets of Bancommerce. Indeed, on April 22, 2010 the Sheriff started garnishing Bancommerce’s deposits in other banks, including those in Banco de Oro-Salcedo-Legaspi Branch and in the Bank of the Philippine Islands Ayala Paseo Branch.<br><br>Further, the Sheriff forcibly levied on Bancommerce’s Lipa Branch cash on hand amounting to P1,520,000.00 and deposited the same with the Landbank. He also seized the bank’s computers, printers, and monitors, causing the temporary cessation of its banking operations in that branch and putting the bank in an unwarranted danger of a run. Clearly, Bancommerce had valid justifications for skipping the technical requirement of a motion for reconsideration.<br><br><i>Merger and De Facto Merger</i><br><br>Merger is a re-organization of two or more corporations that results in their consolidating into a single corporation, which is one of the constituent corporations, one disappearing or dissolving and the other surviving. To put it another way, merger is the absorption of one or more corporations by another existing corporation, which retains its identity and takes over the rights, privileges, franchises, properties, claims, liabilities and obligations of the absorbed corporation(s). The absorbing corporation continues its existence while the life or lives of the other corporation(s) is or are terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Corporation Code requires the following steps for merger or consolidation:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The board of each corporation draws up a plan of merger or consolidation. Such plan must include any amendment, if necessary, to the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation, or in case of consolidation, all the statements required in the articles of incorporation of a corporation.<br><br>(2) Submission of plan to stockholders or members of each corporation for approval. A meeting must be called and at least two (2) weeks’ notice must be sent to all stockholders or members, personally or by registered mail. A summary of the plan must be attached to the notice. Vote of two-thirds of the members or of stockholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock will be needed. Appraisal rights, when proper, must be respected.<br><br>(3) Execution of the formal agreement, referred to as the articles of merger o[r] consolidation, by the corporate officers of each constituent corporation. These take the place of the articles of incorporation of the consolidated corporation, or amend the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation.<br><br>(4) Submission of said articles of merger or consolidation to the SEC for approval.<br><br>(5) If necessary, the SEC shall set a hearing, notifying all corporations concerned at least two weeks before.<br><br>(6) Issuance of certificate of merger or consolidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Indubitably, it is clear that no merger took place between Bancommerce and TRB as the requirements and procedures for a merger were absent. A merger does not become effective upon the mere agreement of the constituent corporations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> All the requirements specified in the law must be complied with in order for merger to take effect. Section 79 of the Corporation Code further provides that the merger shall be effective only upon the issuance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a certificate of merger.<br><br>Here, Bancommerce and TRB remained separate corporations with distinct corporate personalities. What happened is that TRB sold and Bancommerce purchased identified recorded assets of TRB in consideration of Bancommerce’s assumption of identified recorded liabilities of TRB including booked contingent accounts. There is no law that prohibits this kind of transaction especially when it is done openly and with appropriate government approval. Indeed, the dissenting opinions of Justices Jose Catral Mendoza and Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen are of the same opinion. In strict sense, no merger or consolidation took place as the records do not show any plan or articles of merger or consolidation. More importantly, the SEC did not issue any certificate of merger or consolidation.<br><br>The dissenting opinion of Justice Mendoza finds, however, that a “<i>de facto</i>” merger existed between TRB and Bancommerce considering that (1) the P &amp; A Agreement between them involved substantially all the assets and liabilities of TRB; (2) in an <i>Ex Parte </i>Petition for Issuance of Writ of Possession filed in a case, Bancommerce qualified TRB, the petitioner, with the words “now known as Bancommerce;” and (3) the BSP issued a Circular Letter (series of 2002) advising all banks and non-bank financial intermediaries that the banking activities and transaction of TRB and Bancommerce were consolidated and that the latter continued the operations of the former.<br><br>The idea of a <i>de facto</i> merger came about because, prior to the present Corporation Code, no law authorized the merger or consolidation of Philippine Corporations, except insurance companies, railway corporations, and public utilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> And, except in the case of insurance corporations, no procedure existed for bringing about a merger.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Still, the Supreme Court held in <i>Reyes v. Blouse</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that authority to merge or consolidate can be derived from Section 28½ (now Section 40) of the former Corporation Law which provides, among others, that a corporation may “sell, exchange, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets” if the board of directors is so authorized by the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the voting power. The words “or otherwise dispose of,” according to the Supreme Court, is very broad and in a sense, covers a merger or consolidation.<br><br>But the facts in <i>Reyes </i>show that the Board of Directors of the Corporation being dissolved clearly intended to be merged into the other corporations. Said this Court:<br><br><blockquote>It is apparent that the purpose of the resolution is not to dissolve the [company] but merely to transfer its assets to a new corporation in exchange for its corporation stock. This intent is clearly deducible from the provision that the [company] will not be dissolved but will continue existing until its stockholders decide to dissolve the same. This comes squarely within the purview of Section 28½ of the corporation law which provides, among others, that a corporation may sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of all its property and assets, including its good will, upon such terms and conditions as its Board of Directors may deem expedient when authorized by the affirmative vote of the shareholders holding at least 2/3 of the voting power. [The phrase] “or otherwise dispose of” is very broad and in a sense covers a merger or consolidation.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>In his book, Philippine Corporate Law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Dean Cesar Villanueva explained that under the Corporation Code, “a<i> de facto</i> merger can be pursued by one corporation <b>acquiring all or substantially all of the properties of another corporation in exchange of shares of stock of the acquiring corporation.</b> The acquiring corporation would end up with the business enterprise of the target corporation; whereas, the target corporation would end up with basically its only remaining assets being the shares of stock of the acquiring corporation.” (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>No <i>de facto</i> merger took place in the present case simply because the TRB owners did not get in exchange for the bank’s assets and liabilities an equivalent value in Bancommerce shares of stock. Bancommerce and TRB agreed with BSP approval to exclude from the sale the TRB’s contingent judicial liabilities, including those owing to RPN, <i>et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) treated the transaction between the two banks purely as a sale of specified assets and liabilities when it rendered its opinion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> on the tax consequences of the transaction given that there is a difference in tax treatment between a sale and a merger or consolidation.<br><br>Indubitably, since the transaction between TRB and Bancommerce was neither a merger nor a<i> de facto</i> merger but a mere “sale of assets with assumption of liabilities,” the next question before the Court is whether or not the RTC could regard Bancommerce as RPN, <i>et al.’</i>s judgment debtor.<br><br>It is pointed out that under common law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> if one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor if it has acted in good faith and has paid adequate consideration for the assets, except: (1) where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations; (3) where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation; and (4) where the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape liability for such debts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>But, in the first place, common law has no application in this jurisdiction where existing statutes governing the situation are in place. Secondly, none of the cited exceptions apply to this case.<br><br>1. Bancommerce agreed to assume those liabilities of TRB that are specified in their P &amp; A Agreement. That agreement specifically excluded TRB’s contingent liabilities that the latter might have arising from pending litigations in court, including the claims of respondent RPN, et al. The pertinent provision of the P &amp; A provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article II<br><br>CONSIDERATION: ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES</center><br>In consideration of the sale of identified recorded assets and properties covered by this Agreement, BANCOMMERCE shall assume identified recorded TRB’s liabilities including booked contingent liabilities as listed and referred to in its Consolidated Statement of Condition as of August 31, 2001, in the total amount of PESOS: TEN BILLION FOUR HUNDRED ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND (P10,410,436,000.00), provided that the liabilities so assumed <u>shall not include</u>:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2. <u>Items in litigation, both actual and prospective</u>, against TRB which include but not limited to the following:<br><blockquote>2.1 Claims of sugar planters for alleged undervaluation of sugar export sales x x x;<br><br>2.2 Claims of the Republic of the Philippines for peso-denominated certificates supposed to have been placed by the Marcos family with TRB;<br><br>2.3 Other liabilities not included in said Consolidated Statement of Condition; and<br><br>2.4 Liabilities accruing after the effectivity date of this Agreement that were not incurred in the ordinary course of business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>2. As already pointed out above, the sale did not amount to merger or <i>de facto</i> merger of Bancommerce and TRB since the elements required of both were not present.<br><br>3. The evidence in this case fails to show that Bancommerce was a mere continuation of TRB. TRB retained its separate and distinct identity after the purchase. Although it subsequently changed its name to Traders Royal Holding’s, Inc. such change did not result in its dissolution. “The changing of the name of a corporation is no more than creation of a corporation than the changing of the name of a natural person is the begetting of a natural person. The act, in both cases, would seem to be what the language which we use to designate it imports—a change of name and not a change of being.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As such, Bancommerce and TRB remained separate corporations.<br><br>4. To protect contingent claims, the BSP directed Bancommerce and TRB to put up P50 million in escrow with another bank. It was the BSP, not Bancommerce that fixed the amount of the escrow. Consequently, it cannot be said that the latter bank acted in bad faith with respect to the excluded liabilities. They did not enter into the P &amp; A Agreement to enable TRB to escape from its liability to creditors with pending court cases.<br><br>Further, even without the escrow, TRB continued to be liable to its creditors although under its new name. Parenthetically, the P &amp; A Agreement shows that Bancommerce acquired greater amount of TRB liabilities than assets. Article II of the P &amp; A Agreement shows that Bancommerce assumed total liabilities of P10,401,436,000.00 while it received total assets of only P10,262,154,000.00. This proves the arms-length quality of the transaction.<br><br>The dissenting opinion of Justice Mendoza cites certain instances indicating the existence of a <i>de facto</i> merger in this case. One of these is the fact that the P &amp; A Agreement involved substantially all the assets and liabilities of TRB. But while this is true, such fact alone would not prove the existence of a <i>de facto</i> merger because a corporation “does not really lose its juridical entity”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on account of such sale. Actually, the law allows a corporation to “sell, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties and assets including its goodwill” to another corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This is not merger because it recognizes the separate existence of the two corporations that transact the sale.<br><br>The dissenting opinion of Justice Mendoza claims that another proof of a <i>de facto </i>merger is that in a case, Bancommerce qualified TRB in its Ex Parte Petition for Issuance of Writ of Possession with the words “now known as Bancommerce.” But paragraph 3 of the <i>Ex Parte</i> Petition shows the context in which such qualification was made. It reads:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><blockquote>3. On November 09, 2001, Bank of Commerce and Traders Royal Bank executed and signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement. The account of the mortgagor was among those acquired under the agreement. Photocopy of the agreement is hereto attached as Annex “A.”</blockquote><br>It is thus clear that the phrase “now known as Bank of Commerce” used in the petition served only to indicate that Bancommerce is now the former property owner’s creditor that filed the petition for writ of possession as a result of the P &amp; A Agreement. It does not indicate a merger.<br><br>Lastly, the dissenting opinion of Justice Mendoza cited the Circular Letter (series of 2002) issued by the BSP advising all banks and non-bank financial intermediaries that the banking activities and transaction of TRB and Bancommerce were consolidated and that the latter continued the operations of the former as an indication of a <i>de facto</i> merger. The Circular Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>CIRCULAR LETTER<br>(series of 2002)</center><br><br>TO: ALL BANK AND NON-BANK<br>FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES<br><br>The Securities and Exchange Commission approved on August 15, 2002 the Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Traders Royal Bank on the deletion of the term “banks” and “banking” from the corporate name and purpose, pursuant to the purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of Traders Royal Bank by Bank of Commerce. Accordingly, the bank franchise of Traders Royal Bank has been automatically revoked and Traders Royal Bank has ceased to operate as a banking entity.<br><br>Effective July 3, 2002, the banking activities and transactions of Bank of Commerce and Traders Royal Bank have been consolidated and the former has carried their operations since then.<br><br>For your information and guidance.<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><div align="center"><div align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sgd.)<br></div><div align="right">ALBERTO V. REYES<br></div><div align="right">Deputy Governor</div></div></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br>Indeed, what was “consolidated” per the above letter was the banking activities and transactions of Bancommerce and TRB, not their corporate existence. The BSP did not remotely suggest a merger of the two corporations. What controls the relationship between those corporations cannot be the BSP letter circular, which had been issued without their participation, but the terms of their P &amp; A Agreement that the BSP approved through its Monetary Board.<br><br>Also, in a letter dated November 2, 2005 Atty. Juan De Zuñiga, Jr., Assistant Governor and General Counsel of the BSP, clarified to the RTC the use of the word “merger” in their January 29, 2003 letter. According to him, the word “merger” was used “in a very loose sense x x x and merely repeated, for convenience” the term used by the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It further stated that “Atty. Villanueva did not issue any legal pronouncement in the said letter, which is merely transmittal in nature. Thus it cannot, by any stretch of construction, be considered as binding on the BSP. What is binding to the BSP is MB Res. 58 referring to the aforementioned transaction between TRB and Bancommerce as a purchase and assumption agreement.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Since there had been no merger, Bancommerce cannot be considered as TRB’s successor-in-interest and against which the Court’s Decision of October 10, 2002 in G.R. 138510 may be enforced. Bancommerce did not hold the former TRBs assets in trust for it as to subject them to garnishment for the satisfaction of the latter’s liabilities to RPN, et al. Bancommerce bought and acquired those assets and thus, became their absolute owner.<br><br><i>The CA Decision in<br>CA-G.R. SP 91258</i><br><br>According to the dissenting opinion of Justice Mendoza, the CA Decision dated December 8, 2009 did not reverse the RTC’s Order causing the issuance of a writ of execution against Bancommerce to enforce the judgment against TRB. It also argues that the CA did not find grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part when it issued its August 15, 2005 Order granting the issuance of a writ of execution. In fact, it affirmed that order. Moreover, it argued that the CA’s modification of the RTC Order merely deleted an opinion there expressed and not reversed such order.<br><br>But it should be the substance of the CA’s modification of the RTC Order that should control, not some technical flaws that are taken out of context. Clearly, the RTC’s basis for holding Bancommerce liable to TRB was its finding that TRB had been merged into Bancommerce, making the latter liable for TRB’s debts to RPN,<i> et al</i>. The CA clearly annulled such finding in its December 8, 2009 Decision in CA-G.R. SP 91258, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the herein consolidated Petitions are DENIED. The assailed Orders dated August 15, 2005 and February 22, 2006 of the respondent Judge, are AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the pronouncement of respondent Judge in the August 15, 2005 Order that the PSA between TRB and BANCOM is a farce or “a mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation between TRB and BANCOM” is DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the CA was careful in its decision to restrict the enforcement of the writ of execution only to “TRB’s properties found in Bancommerce’s possession.” Indeed, the CA clearly said in its decision that it was not Bancommerce that the RTC Order was being made to answer for TRB’s judgment credit but “the assets/properties of TRB in the hands of BANCOM.” The CA then went on to state that it is not prepared, unlike the RTC, to declare the P &amp; A Agreement but a farce or a “mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation.” Thus, the CA deleted the RTC’s reliance on such supposed merger or consolidation between the two as a basis for its questioned order.<br><br>The enforcement, therefore, of the decision in the main case should not include the assets and properties that Bancommerce acquired from TRB.

This rule is so elementary and basic that it is enshrined in the first section of the Bill of Rights of our Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <b>No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law</b>, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, the Rules of Court, in obvious fidelity to the imperatives of due process guarantee, permits only the execution of judgments against the <b><u>judgment obligor</u></b> and his properties, as plainly provided in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 8. Issuance, form, and contents of a writ of execution. – The writ of execution shall: (1) issue in the name of the Republic of the Philippines from the court which granted the motion; (2) state the name of the court, <b><u>the case number and title</u></b>, the dispositive part of the subject judgment or order; and (3) require the sheriff or other proper officer to whom it is directed to <b><u>enforce the writ according to its terms, in the manner hereinafter provided</u></b>:<br><br>(a) If the execution be against the property of the judgment obligor, to satisfy the judgment, with interest, <b>out of the real or personal property of <u>such judgment obligor</u></b>;<br><br>(b) <b>If it be against real or personal property</b> in the hand of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants, or trustees, <b><u>of the judgment obligor</u></b>, to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of such property;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SECTION 9. Execution of judgments for money, how enforced. – (a) Immediate payment on demand. – The officers shall enforce an execution of a judgment for money <b><u>by demanding from the judgment obligor</u></b> the immediate payment of the full amount stated in the writ of execution and all lawful fees. <b><u>The judgment obligor shall pay</u></b> in cash, certified bank check payable to the judgment obligee, or any other form of payment acceptable to the latter, the amount of the judgment debt under proper receipt directly to the judgment obligee or his authorized representative if present at the time of payment. x x x<br><br>If the judgment obligee or his authorized representative is not present to receive payment, <b><u>the judgment obligor</u> shall deliver the aforesaid payment to the executing sheriff</b>. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Satisfaction by levy. <b>If the judgment obligor cannot pay</b> all or part of the obligation in cash, certified bank check or other mode of payment acceptable to the judgment obligee, the officer shall levy upon the properties of the judgment obligor of every kind and nature whatsoever which may be disposed of for value and otherwise exempt from execution x x x.<br><br>(c) Garnishment of debts and credits. – <b>The officer may levy on debts due the <u>judgment obligor</u></b> and other credits, including bank deposits, financial interests, royalties, commissions and other personal property not capable of manual delivery in the possession or control of third parties. x x x (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, this Court has ruled that execution may issue only upon a person who is a party to the action, and not against one who did not have his day in court. In <i>Atilano v. Asaali,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> We held thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by a judgment rendered by the court. Execution of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and not against one who, not being a party thereto, did not have his day in court. Due process dictates that a court decision can only bind a party to the litigation and not against innocent third parties.</blockquote><br>At present, it is plain from the foregoing recitation of facts that petitioner Bancom was never a party to the original case. It was not the respondent, not the judgment obligor, and not the person found by this Court liable to pay for any indebtedness to the private respondents. To hold Bancom liable upon execution for a liability charged against another existing entity is the height of injustice.<br><br>It is best to recall that Bancom was dragged into this affray <b><u>after</u></b> the Decision of this Court in G.R. No. 138510 attained finality when private respondents conveniently, but without much of an explanation, inserted the bracketed phrase “now Bank of Commerce” after TRB’s name on the caption of its motion for execution. Needless to state, this is not the lawful manner under the Rules of Court in impleading a person to a case. Jurisdiction over the person still requires the existence of a coercive process issued by the court to such party or its voluntary submission to the court. Neither had been done in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Note that Bancom made its entry to the case but by way of special appearance precisely to question the trial court’s jurisdiction over its person. Thus, without any summons issued by the trial court, jurisdiction over Bancom’s person had never been obtained by the trial court in this case. Any pronouncement against it is void for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>What is more, with respect to the liability owing to private respondents, what had attained finality and had been rendered executory is the judgment of this Court declaring TRB liable to private respondents. By the principle of the finality of judgment, this is what the trial court should have executed. Nothing more.<br><br>In the execution of final and executory judgments, the trial court is bound by the terms of the decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, to order the execution against a non-party to an already concluded action is beyond the powers of the trial court and ergo illegal.<br><br>It needs to be emphasized that once a judgment becomes final and executory, that judgment may not be amended. Upon finality of the judgment, however, the courts lose the jurisdiction to amend, modify or alter the same. The judgment can neither be amended nor altered after it has become final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This is the <b><u>principle of immutability of final judgment</u></b>, which We emphasized in <i>Fermin v. Esteves</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The generally accepted principle is that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by a judgment rendered by the court. Execution of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and not against one who, not being a party in the case, did not have his day in court. Due process requires that a court decision can only bind a party to the litigation and not against one who did not have his day in court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Court recognizes the finality of the trial court’s Decision in Civil Case No. 925-R x x x. Since petitioners are not parties to Civil Case No. 925-R, respondent has to file the proper action against petitioners to enforce his property rights within the bounds of the law and our rules. Petitioner’s right to possession, if any, should be threshed out in a proper court proceeding.</blockquote><br>Private respondents had impudently tried to circumvent the above principle by the simple expedience of changing the caption of its motion for execution. This simply cannot, and should not, be allowed.<br><br>It is now up to this Court to correct the procedural misstep taken by the trial court when it allowed the crafty inclusion of a non-party to a final judgment that led to a breach of a constitutional rule on due process. This Court is duty-bound to ensure that the execution of a final decision is made within the confines of its pronouncements. In <i>QBE Insurance v. Laviña,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court admonished the respondent for issuing a writ of execution beyond the bounds of the decision and against a stranger to a case, viz:<br><br><blockquote>It must be noted that <b>QBE Insurance was not a party to Civil Case No. 68287 wherein the writ of execution was issued.</b> Neither was it included in the Writ of Execution issued by Judge Laviña.<br><br>Generally accepted is the principle that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by judgment rendered by the court. In the same <u>manner an execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court</u>. In <i>Lorenzana v. Cayetano</i>, http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2007/october2007/RTJ-06-1971.htm - _ftn16 this Court held that only real parties-in-interest in an action are bound by judgment therein and by writs of execution and demolition issued pursuant thereto.<br><br>Indeed, a judgment cannot bind persons who are not parties to the action. It is elementary that strangers to a case are not bound by the judgment rendered by the court and such judgment is not available as an adjudication either against or in favor of such other person. A decision of a court will not operate to divest the rights of a person who has not and has never been a party to a litigation, either as plaintiff or as defendant. <b><u>Verily, execution of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and not against one who, not being a party to the action, has not yet had his day in court.

Nor may it go beyond the terms of the judgment which is sought to be executed. <b><u>Where the execution is not in harmony with the judgment which gives it life and exceeds it, it has pro tanto no validity. To maintain otherwise would be to ignore the constitutional provision against depriving a person of his property without due process of law.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, to repeat for added emphasis, this Court found <b><u>TRB</u></b> liable to private respondents. Now, <b><u>TRB still exists</u></b>, albeit as <b><u>Royal Traders Holding Co. Inc</u></b>. There is, therefore, no rhyme or reason for looking elsewhere for the satisfaction of its liability.<br><br>It should be noted, however, that the said PSA was executed by TRB and Bancom in November 2001, more than <b>a year before</b> the finality of this Court’s judgment against TRB. The private respondents had all the opportunity to apprise this Court of the existence of such PSA and the consequences it may have. Private respondents also had more than adequate time to annotate its claim on the properties of TRB that were the subject of the PSA. It did neither of these things. Instead, after the execution of the PSA, its approval by the BSP and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), and the finality of the judgment against TRB, the private respondents simply inserted the phrase “Traders Royal Bank (TRB) [now Bank of Commerce]” on the caption of its motion for execution. Even this phrase is not accurate.<br><br><i>First</i>, as stated before, Traders Royal Bank still exists and is now known as Royal Traders Holding Co. Inc., not Bank of Commerce. <i>Second</i>, the terms of the PSA do not justify a finding that TRB is “now Bank of Commerce.” It is clear from the provisions of the PSA that “BANCOMMERCE and TRB shall continue to exist as separate corporations with distinct personalities.” <i>Third,</i> <b>the still standing rule is that where one corporation sells or transfers its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transfer</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> A corporation has a personality separate and distinct from any other legal entity. Being separate entities, neither the properties nor liabilities of one can be considered the properties or liabilities of the other.<br><br>Indeed, the rule against the transfer of liabilities to the purchaser corporation does not apply when any of the following conditions exists: (1) the purchaser corporation expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the debts, (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations, (3) when the corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation, and (4) where the transaction is fraudulently entered into in order to escape liability for those debts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Even if this Court is inclined to verify the existence of these circumstances (in violation of the principle of immutability of judgments, in disregard of the trial court’s want of jurisdiction over Bancom, and contrary to the principle that this Court is not a trier of facts), a closer look will reveal that none of these exceptional circumstances is availing.<br><br>The absence of the first circumstance, the supposed assumption of debts made by Bancom, can readily be verified from the terms of the PSA concluded by TRB and Bancom. Unlike in <i>Caltex (Phils.), Inc. v. PNOC Shipping &amp; Transport Corp</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> where the agreement entered by PNOC Shipping &amp; Transport Corporation (PSTC) with LUSTEVECO “specifically mentions the case between LUSTEVECO and Caltex, docketed as AC-G.R. CV No. 62613, then pending before the IAC,” under the PSA, Bancom categorically assumed only <b><u>identified</u></b> and <b><u>limited</u></b> liabilities. Among those clearly <b>excluded from the assumed liabilities are “[i]tems in litigation, both actual and prospective, against TRB</b>.” At the time of the execution of the PSA, the liability of TRB to private respondents was the subject of an actual litigation. It is, therefore, excluded from the liabilities assumed by Bancom. At best, it is more plausible to conclude that the liability owing to private respondents is covered by the escrow fund set up by TRB with Metrobank.<br><br>To find the existence of a<i> de facto </i>merger, this Court must at least ascertain the presence of the most essential element of a merger apart from compliance with the legalities set forth under the law: the dissolution of the separate judicial personality of the target corporation in fact, if not in law. It bears to stress that while this Court has recognized the existence of a <i>de facto </i>merger in this jurisdiction resulting from the transfer of assets and assumption of the liabilities of one corporation by another, the recognition had been made through the rubric of piercing the veil of corporate fiction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> i.e., control over both corporations is lodged in the same person/s and that control is used to commit fraud or wrong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is usually done by the transfer of all the assets of a corporation in exchange for the stocks of another corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In this case, there is no indication, and the private respondents adduced no proof, that TRB and Bancom are subject to the same control and that their corporate personalities are mere instruments in committing a wrong. In fact, private respondents did not allege grounds, or ask the courts to declare the need for piercing the separate corporate veils of TRB and Bancom.<br><br>It is axiomatic that he who alleges an affirmative event, like the existence of the supposed merger in this case, must show proof in support thereof. Here, the burden to explain and to prove or disprove the existence of the merger should be with private respondents. If a shift of the burden of proof is at all justified, the shift should be taken against TRB, not Bancom, as it was TRB that advanced the existence of this supposed “supervening event” and it is TRB that will in effect be exonerated from satisfying the judgment against it.<br><br>In <i>Pacific Mills, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court directed the party alleging a supervening event that may affect the execution of a judgment to prove the same by sufficient evidence:<br><br><blockquote>There can be no question that the supervening events cited by petitioner would certainly affect the computation of the award in the decision of the NLRC. It is the duty of the NLRC to consider the same and inquire into the correctness of the execution, as such supervening events may affect such execution.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The questioned orders of the National Labor Relations Commission dated May 5, 1989 and June 20, 1989 are both set aside. <u>The said Commissioner is directed to immediately give petitioner its day in court to present its evidence on the supervening events that would affect the award and thereafter to immediately recompute the award for private respondents on the basis of the judgment which should be promptly satisfied.

(emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As neither private respondents nor TRB proffered any evidence or alleged any ground to justify the application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veils as conduit to finding a <i>de facto</i> merger between TRB and Bancom, there is no basis to justify doing so.<br><br>In fact, in Our November 13, 2013 Decision in G.R. No. 180529 entitled <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of Commerce</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> where the same PSA between TRB and Bancom had been scrutinized to resolve the issue of whether Bancom can be held liable for the liabilities of TRB, sustaining the findings of the BIR and Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), this Court categorically ruled in the negative, viz:<br><br><blockquote>As the CTA En Banc stated in its Amended Decision, the issue boils down to whether or not BOC is liable for the deficiency DST of TRB for taxable year 1999.<br><br>[T]he CTA 1st Division’s Resolution in Traders Royal Bank, explicitly addressed the issue of merger between BOC and TRB. The CTA 1st Division, relying on the provisions in both the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Tax Code, determined that the agreement did not result in a merger, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, when the CTA En Banc took into consideration the above ruling in its Amended Decision, it necessarily affirmed the findings of the CTA 1st Division and found them to be correct. <b>This Court likewise finds the foregoing ruling to be correct. <u>The CTA 1st Division was spot on when it interpreted the Purchase and Sale Agreement to be just that and not a merger</u>.</b><br><br><b>The Purchase and Sale Agreement, the document that is supposed to have tied BOC and TRB together, was replete with provisions that clearly stated the intent of the parties and the purpose of its execution,</b> viz:<br><br>1. Article I of the Purchase and Sale Agreement set the terms of the assets sold to BOC, while Article II was about the consideration for those assets. Moreover, it was explicitly stated that liabilities not included in the Consolidated Statement of Condition were excluded from the liabilities BOC was to assume, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Moreover, the second whereas clause, which served as the premise for the subsequent terms in the agreement, stated that <b><u>the sale of TRB’s assets to BOC were in consideration of BOC’s assumption of some of TRB’s liabilities</u></b>, viz:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The clear terms of the above agreement did not escape the CIR itself when it issued BIR Ruling No. 10-2006, wherein it was concluded that <b><u>the Purchase and Sale Agreement did not result in a merger between BOC and TRB</u></b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A perusal of BIR Ruling No. 10-2006 will show <b><u>that the CIR ruled on the issue of merger without any reference to TRB’s subject tax liabilities</u></b>. The relevant portions of such ruling are quoted below:<br><br><b>One distinctive characteristic for a merger to exist under the second part of [Section 40(C)(b) of the 1997 NIRC] is that, it is not enough for a corporation to acquire all or substantially <u>all the properties of another corporation but it is also necessary that such acquisition is solely for stock of the absorbing corporation</u></b>. Stated differently, the acquiring corporation will issue a block of shares equal to the net asset value transferred, which stocks are in turn distributed to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in proportion to the respective share.<br><br>After a careful perusal of the facts presented as well as the details of the instant case, it is observed by this Office that <b><u>the transaction was purely concerning acquisition and assumption by [BOC] of the recorded liabilities of TRB. The [Purchase and Sale] Agreement did not mention with respect to the issuance of shares of stock of [BOC] in favor of the stockholders of TRB. Such transaction is absent of the requisite of a stock transfer and same belies the existence of a merger</u></b>. As such, this Office considers the Agreement between [BOC] and TRB as one of “a sale of assets with an assumption of liabilities rather than ‘merger’.”<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Clearly, <b>the CIR, in BIR Ruling No. 10-2006, ruled on the issue of merger without taking into consideration TRB’s pending tax deficiencies. The ruling was based on the Purchase and Sale Agreement, factual evidence on the status of both companies, and the Tax Code provision on merger</b>. The CIR’s knowledge then of TRB’s tax deficiencies would not be material as to affect the CIR’s ruling. <b><u>The resolution of the issue on merger depended on the agreement between TRB and BOC, as detailed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement</u></b>, and not contingent on TRB’s tax liabilities.</blockquote><br>In <i>Chinese Young Men’s Christian Association of The Philippine Islands Doing Business Under The Name Of Manila Downtown YMCA v. Remington Steel Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court explained the concept of stare decisis et non quieta movere, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Under the doctrine, when the Supreme Court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where facts are substantially the same.<br><br>The doctrine of stare decisis is based upon the legal principle or rule involved and not upon judgment which results therefrom. In this particular sense stare decisis differs from res judicata which is based upon the judgment.<br><br>The doctrine of stare decisis is one of policy grounded on the necessity for securing certainty and stability of judicial decisions, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Time and again, the court has held that it is a very desirable and necessary judicial practice that when a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. <i>Stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>. Stand by the decisions and disturb not what is settled. <i>Stare decisis</i> simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of<i> stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue.</blockquote></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, the issue of existence of merger, whether <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto,</i> between TRB and Bancom under the PSA is now foreclosed. As the issue in G.R. No. 180529 is substantially similar, if not identical, to the issue in the present case, Our ruling therein bars, following the stare decisis rule, any attempt to re-litigate the issue already decided therein.<br><br>The third exception to the rule on the non-accountability of a purchasing corporation is similarly non-existent in the present case. Once again, TRB still exists albeit under a different name––RTH. Bancom could not, therefore, be considered to have continued TRB when TRB still exists as RTH. It is axiomatic that as a corporation is imbued with legal personality, it has the right of succession and it incurs its own liabilities and is legally responsible for payment of its obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As to the fourth exception, We need only recall that the PSA had been given the stamp of approval by both the BSP and the BIR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as a valid agreement that We cannot plausibly conclude that the same had been entered to defraud creditors. More importantly, by the very terms of the PSA, the transfer of the assets from TRB to Bancom had not been exchanged for assets of equal or more value. Rather, <b>the transfer of assets had been executed precisely in exchange for the assumption of identified debts and liabilities and <u>not</u> to escape liability</b>. That by itself negates the existence of the fourth exception, i.e., the PSA had been entered into to escape the payment of debts.<br><br>Considering the absence of any of the recognized circumstances that would justify the execution of a final judgment against a non-party to the case, it is my considered view that the CA should have exercised its sound judicial discretion when it dismissed petitioner’s certiorari action. The appellate court should have carefully weighed the issues presented and grievances presented by petitioner vis-à-vis the supposed procedural defect of its petition. The CA should have ruled in the interest of substantial justice and petitioner’s constitutionally-guaranteed right to due process and relaxed the general rule requiring the filing of a motion for reconsideration in order to prevent an apparent mockery of justice in this case.<br><br>In fact, the CA need not have resorted to the exceptions to the rule requiring the filing of a motion for reconsideration because <b>petitioner did file a motion for reconsideration</b>. A scrutiny of the records will immediately reveal that the petition for certiorari interposed with the appellate court principally questioned the February 19, 2010 order of the trial court, which granted the private respondents’ ex-parte urgent motion for the issuance of an alias writ of execution. Before filing a petition for certiorari immediately assailing this order, Bancom filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, which was in turn denied by the trial court’s August 18, 2010 Order. There was, therefore, no need for Bancom to file yet another motion for reconsideration before it can lodge a petition for certiorari with the appellate court.<br><br>For all the foregoing, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition, <b>SET ASIDE</b> the November 26, 2010 and February 9, 2011 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals, and <b>NULLIFY</b> the Alias Writ of Execution issued by the Regional Trial Court as mandated in its February 19, 2010 and August 18, 2010 Orders.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 79-92.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 80-81; emphasis supplied.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 253-266, Certificate of Filing of Amended Articles of Incorporation dated August 15, 2002.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 111-115, Supplemental Motion for Execution dated January 20, 2004; emphasis supplied.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 116-118.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 119-127.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 127.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 98-109.

It was then they discovered that the three (3) manager’s checks (Nos. 30652, 30650 and 30796) intended as payment for their taxes were never delivered nor paid to the BIR by Mrs. Vera. Instead, the checks were presented for payment by unknown persons to defendant Security Bank and Trust Company (SBTC), Taytay Branch, as shown by the bank's routing symbol transit number (BRSTN 01140027) or clearing code stamped on the reverse sides of the checks.<br><br>Meanwhile, for failure of the plaintiffs to settle their obligations, the BIR issued warrants of levy, distraint and garnishment against them.

The "plain," "speedy" and "adequate remedy" referred to in Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is a <i>motion for reconsideration </i>of the questioned order or resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It means that unless a motion for reconsideration has been filed, immediate resort to a petition for certiorari will not lie because there is still an adequate remedy available to the aggrieved party.<br><br>The Court is consistent in ruling that a motion for reconsideration is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the filing of a petition for certiorari. The said mandatory and jurisdictional procedure<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> is meant to give the lower court or tribunal the opportunity to correct its assigned errors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Failure to file the motion before availing oneself of the special civil action for certiorari is a fatal infirmity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Though the rule is mandatory, the Court recognizes exceptional circumstances which may justify the dispensing of a prior motion for reconsideration.

The Court, in<i> Republic v. Pantranco North Express, Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> reiterated its long-standing ruling that:<br><br><blockquote>It must be emphasized that<b> a writ of certiorari is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, never issued except in the exercise of judicial discretion.</b> Hence, he who seeks a writ of certiorari must apply for it only in the manner and strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and the Rules. Petitioner may not arrogate to himself the determination of whether a motion for reconsideration is necessary or not. To dispense with the requirement of filing a motion for reconsideration, petitioner must show a concrete, compelling, and valid reason for doing so, which petitioner failed to do. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Therefore, the CA did not commit any reversible error when it outrightly dismissed Bancommerce's petition for certiorari for non-filing of a prior motion for reconsideration of the assailed August 18, 2010 Order of the RTC. As correctly ruled by the CA, Bancommerce could not arrogate to itself the determination of whether a motion for reconsideration was necessary or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It needed to expressly, clearly and satisfactorily prove that its claim fell under any of the recognized exceptions. To dispense with the requirement, there had to be a concrete, compelling and valid reason excusing it from compliance therewith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Despite the same, the CA resolved the petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration by covering its merits and consequently refused to grant it, taking into account the fact that as of that time, 6 years had already elapsed since the Court’s decision became final and executory, without it having been executed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>B] <u>Substantive Issue</u></b><br><br><i><u>Existence of Merger<br></u></i><br>Bancommerce insists that it has not merged with TRB. It avers that the BIR issued a ruling stating that its office considered the PSA between Bancommerce and TRB as “a sale of assets with an assumption of liabilities” rather than a “merger.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Further, it points out that the December 8, 2009 CA decision ordered the deletion in the RTC decision of the statement that the PSA was a farce and a mere tool to effectuate a merger. The specific words in the dispositive portion of the said decision state:<br><br><blockquote>x x x the pronouncement of respondent Judge in the August 15, 2005 Order that the PSA between TRB and BANCOM is a farce or “a mere tool to effectuate a merger and/or consolidation between TRB and BANCOM” is<b> <i>DELETED.</i></b></blockquote><br>Bancommerce is of the view that, with the deletion of the abovementioned phrase, the CA, in effect, overturned the RTC. Thus, Bancommerce concludes that the writ of execution issued by the RTC could not be enforced against it.<br><br>It also banks on the opinion of the Commission of Internal Revenue (CIR), which it claims is entitled to respect,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as stated in <i>Protectors Services, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which, in part, reads:<br><br><blockquote>These rulings were made by the CIR in the exercise of his power to "make judgments or opinions in connection with the implementation of the provisions of the internal revenue code." The opinions and rulings of officials of the government called upon to execute or implement administrative laws, command respect and weight.<br></blockquote><br>In a letter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated October 6, 2006, the CIR replied to the letter of Bancommerce requesting for a ruling on its taxability relative to the PSA with TRB. The CIR then ruled that the PSA was one of sale of assets with assumption of liabilities rather than a merger. It stated that “the transaction between TRB and Bancommerce is not a merger within the contemplation of Section 40(C)(6)(b) of the Tax Code of 1997.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It should be noted, however, that the judgment or opinion was issued only for purposes of determining the tax liability of Bancommerce. It did not, in any way, conclusively rule that, the transaction between TRB and Bancommerce, by virtue of the PSA, was a sale. In fact, the CIR ruling itself expressly stated that:<br><br><blockquote>This ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, <b>if upon investigation,</b> it will be disclosed that the <b>facts</b> are <b>different,</b> then this ruling shall be considered null and <b>void.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>Bancommerce, therefore, cannot rely on the CIR ruling in arguing that there was no merger. The determination of whether or not the transaction was a sale is not within the competence of the CIR. It is ultimately the courts which have jurisdiction over actions involving such issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The question now is: was there a merger between TRB and Bancommerce?<br><br>A merger is “a combination of two things, especially companies, into one.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Merriam Webster Dictionary defines it as “the absorption by a corporation of one or more others.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Under the Philippine Law, “two or more corporations may merge into a single corporation which shall be one of the constituent corporations or may consolidate into a new single corporation which shall be the consolidated corporation.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>There are, however, requirements and procedures to follow before a merger takes place. The steps necessary to accomplish a merger or consolidation, as provided for in Sections 76, 77, 78, and 79 of the Corporation Code, are:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The board of each corporation draws up a plan of merger or consolidation. Such plan must include any amendment, if necessary, to the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation, or in case of consolidation, all the statements required in the articles of incorporation of a corporation.<br><br>(2) Submission of plan to stockholders or members of each corporation for approval. A meeting must be called and at least two (2) weeks’ notice must be sent to all stockholders or members, personally or by registered mail. A summary of the plan must be attached to the notice. Vote of two-thirds of the members or of stockholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock will be needed. Appraisal rights, when proper, must be respected.<br><br>(3) Execution of the formal agreement, referred to as the articles of merger or consolidation, by the corporate officers of each constituent corporation. These take the place of the articles of incorporation of the consolidated corporation, or amend the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation.<br><br>(4) Submission of said articles of merger or consolidation to the SEC for approval.<br><br>(5) If necessary, the SEC shall set a hearing, notifying all corporations concerned at least two weeks before.<br><br>(6) Issuance of certificate of merger or consolidation. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>Only after these requirements have been complied with and a certificate of merger or consolidation has been issued by the SEC shall the merger or consolidation be effective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing, I submit that, in a strict sense, no merger or consolidation took place. Records do not show any plan or articles of merger or consolidation. More importantly, there was no issuance by the SEC of any certificate of merger or consolidation in favor of Bancommerce. What TRB and Bancommerce executed was a “Purchase and Sale Agreement.” There can be no issuance of a merger certificate by virtue of a sale agreement. If only for those facts alone, indeed, TRB and Bancommerce did not merge or consolidate.<br><br>It is incumbent, however, to reflect and analyze why the RTC found the existence of a merger while the CA opined that there was “just a dearth of conclusive evidence to support such a finding.”<br><br>After a careful scrutiny of the records, the surrounding circumstances in the case show that, in effect, although without an outright declaration of such, a “<i>de facto</i>” merger existed between TRB and Bancommerce.<br><br><i>First</i>, the PSA involved substantially all the assets and liabilities of TRB. The PSA clearly included TRB's banking goodwill, its bank premises, its licenses to operate its head office and branches, its leasehold rights, patents, trademarks or copyrights used in connection with its business or products.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, in one of the cases it initiated with respect to the rights and interests of TRB, an Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of Writ of Possession, before the <b>same RTC, Branch 98</b>, Bancommerce qualified TRB with the words <b>“now known as Bancommerce.”</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Justice and fair play dictate that Bancommerce is estopped from denying that it did identify TRB as such. Nobody but Bancommerce itself inserted the description. It would be unfair to allow Bancommerce to avail of such description or qualification when it would be to its advantage, and to disavow it when it would be no longer convenient.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the BSP, through its Deputy Governor Alberto V. Reyes, even issued the Circular Letter (Series of 2002) advising all banks and non-bank financial intermediaries that the <b>banking activities</b> and <b>transactions</b> of TRB and Bancommerce were <b>consolidated</b> and that the latter <b>continued</b> the <b>operations of the former</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Section 40 of the Corporation Code laid out the procedure and requirements when a corporation sells or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets. It provides that a sale or other disposition shall be deemed to cover substantially all the corporate property and assets,<b> if thereby the corporation would be rendered incapable of continuing the business or accomplishing the purposes for which it was incorporated</b>. The sale or disposition of all of substantially all of the corporate assets <i>may have the effect of a merger or consolidation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Corollarily, Section 40 will not apply if the sale was necessary in the usual and regular course of business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The facts obtaining in the case, however, clearly showed that the sale was not in pursuance of the usual and regular banking business of TRB. The sale, in fact, rendered TRB incapable of carrying out the purpose of its organization. While there may be no merger/consolidation in its strictest sense, it is my studied opinion that the <b>end result of the affair</b> that took place between TRB and Bancommerce amounted to a merger of assets where the existence of TRB as a banking entity ceased while that of Bancommerce continued. Essentially, Bancommerce is continuing the operations of the former.<br><br><i><u>Enforcement of Writ of Execution</u></i><br><br>Bancommerce contends that it is not the judgment debtor, but TRB, and that it was only arbitrarily dragged into the execution proceedings. Such being the case, execution may not be enforced against it.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> fails to persuade.<br><br>It has been established that the existence of TRB as a banking entity ceased by virtue of the PSA. It cannot be denied either that Bancommerce has continued its operations as early as July 2002. Thus, even though Bancommerce was not a party in the main case, the writ of execution may be enforced against it. It has been the consistent ruling of the Court that although it is true that a writ of execution can only be issued against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court, one who is privy or a successor-in-interest of the judgment debtor can be reached by the order of execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The specific words in the two cases read:<br><br><blockquote>No man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger. <b>Strangers</b> to a case are not bound by judgment rendered by the court. In the same manner, an execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. Only real parties in an action are bound by judgment therein and by writs of execution and demolition issued pursuant thereto. However, <b>one who is a <u>privy</u> to the judgment debtor can be reached by an order of execution</b> . . . [Emphases and underscoring supplied]</blockquote><br>Further, attention is directed to the pronouncement of the CA in its December 8, 2009 Decision that the RTC order was so worded that it was not Bancommerce itself “that was being made to answer <i>but the assets/properties of TRB in the hands of BANCOM.</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The CA made it crystal clear that <b>Bancommerce was not being made liable for TRB's obligations.</b><br><br>This is so because when the RTC issued a <i>subpoena duces tecum,</i> it required Bancommerce to merely bring the <b>list of assumed identified assets and liabilities of TRB under the PSA</b>. Bancommerce, instead of complying with the order, filed a motion to quash the subpoena on the specious ground that the respondent networks <i>failed to show the relevancy</i> of the said list. As correctly ruled by the CA, had Bancommerce just complied with the subpoena, it could have cleared the issue of whether TRB's liability to the respondent networks was not among those that Bancommerce assumed under the PSA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> <b>From Bancommerce’s adamant refusal to comply with the order of the trial court, a presumption arises that a disclosure of the identified assets and liabilities would be prejudicial to its interests.</b> The RTC, thus, cannot be faulted for granting and issuing the writ of execution.<br><br>More importantly, it cannot be argued that the assets and properties of TRB, which were transferred to Bancommerce, ceased to be such under the terms of the BSP-approved PSA between them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> There was nothing in the PSA which provided that said assets and properties of TRB would cease to exist. <b>Assets do not simply evaporate</b>. In case of transfers, they remain part and parcel of the assets of the transferee, whether commingled or not. In other words, they represent a certain percentage of the transferee’s assets.<br><br>It is to be emphasized that the October 10, 2002 Decision of the Court in <i>Traders Royal Bank v. RPN</i>, which was the subject of the RTC Order of Execution, dated August 15, 2005, was already final and executory. The CA even reiterated such fact in its December 8, 2009 decision affirming with modification the said RTC order, which likewise became final and executory.<br><br>Bancommerce cannot insist that TRB’s assets in its custody and possession cannot be the subject of an execution on the flimsy excuse that it is not a party. Granting that there has been no <i>de facto</i> merger or consolidation, the undeniable fact is that Bancommerce has TRB’s assets, commingled or not, and the rules provide that <b>these can be reached by levy or garnishment</b>. The Rules of Court, moreover, do not require that the garnishee be served with summons or impleaded in the case in order to make him liable. In the case of <i>Perla Compania de Seguros v. H. Ramolete</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> it was clearly written:<br><br><blockquote>In order that the trial court may validly acquire jurisdiction to bind the person of the garnishee, it is not necessary that summons be served upon him. The garnishee need not be impleaded as a party to the case. <b>All that is necessary</b> for the trial court lawfully to bind the person of the garnishee or any person who has in his possession credits belonging to the judgment debtor is <b>service</b> upon him of the <b>writ of garnishment</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>Further, Section 19, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 19. <i>Transfer of interest.</i> – In case of any transfer of interest, <b>the action may be continued by or against the original party</b>, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.</blockquote><br>Bancommerce became TRB’s successor-in-interest. The PSA clearly led to a transfer of interest from TRB to Bancommerce. As previously mentioned, Bancommerce acquired assets from TRB, which conveyance was effected while the case was pending and which transaction appears not to have been made known to TRB’s creditors. These properties can still be reached by execution to satisfy the judgment in favor of the respondent networks. The Court, in <i>NPC Drivers and Mechanics Association v. NPC,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> explained that:<br><br><blockquote>On PSALM’s contention that since it was not a party to the case and that the petitioners are not its employees, the properties that it acquired from NPC cannot be levied, is untenable. The issue here is about PSALM’s assets that were acquired from NPC. As explained above, PSALM took ownership over most of NPC’s assets. There was indeed a <b>transfer of interest</b> over these assets – from NPC to PSALM – by operation of law. These properties may be used to satisfy our judgment. This being the case, petitioners may go after such properties. The fact that PSALM is a non-party to the case will not prevent the levying of the said properties, including their fruits and proceeds. However, PSALM should not be denied due process. The levying of said properties and their fruits/proceeds, if still needed in case NPC’s properties are insufficient to satisfy our judgment, is without prejudice to PSALM’s participation in said proceedings. Its participation therein is necessary to prevent the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC. Such a proceeding is to be conducted in the proper forum where petitioners may take the appropriate action.<br><br><blockquote>Section 19, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure reads:<br><br>Sec. 19. <i>Transfer of interest. –</i> In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.</blockquote>Under this section, the Court may, upon motion, direct the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. In petitioners’ Manifestation with Urgent Omnibus Motions dated 9 February 2009, they <b>prayed that the properties acquired by PSALM from NPC be also levied/garnished. We consider this prayer to be tantamount to a motion to join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case in so far as to the properties, and any income arising therefrom, that PSALM acquired from NPC</b>. It is in this light that we order the Clerk of Court of this division to implead or join PSALM as a party-respondent in this case. As above-explained, PSALM shall not be denied due process for it can participate in the proper forum by preventing the levying of properties other than that it had acquired from NPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Also, the Court, in <i>Col. Francisco dela Merced v. GSIS,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> reiterated the principle that a final judgment against a party is binding on his privies and successors-in-interest. It went on further saying that:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Cabresos v. Judge Tiro</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Court upheld the respondent judge’s issuance of an alias writ of execution against the successors-in-interest of the losing litigant <b>despite the fact that these successors-in-interest were <u>not mentioned</u> in the judgment and were <u>never parties to the case</u></b>. The Court explained that an action is <b>binding on the <u>privies</u></b> of the litigants even if such privies are not literally parties to the action. Their inclusion in the writ of execution does not vary or exceed the terms of the judgment.</blockquote><br>Moreover, granting that Bancommerce is not a party in the case between TRB and the respondent networks, the sale between TRB and Bancommerce should and must not, in any way, prejudice any creditors of the former. In the case cited by Justice Leonen in his separate dissenting opinion, <i>Caltex (Philippines), Inc. vs. PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> it was ruled:<br><br><blockquote><b>While the Corporation Code allows the transfer of all or substantially all the properties and assets of a corporation, the transfer should not prejudice the creditors of the assignor. The only way the transfer can proceed without prejudice to the creditors is to hold the assignee liable for the obligations of the assignor</b>. The acquisition by the assignee of all or substantially all of the assets of the assignor necessarily includes the assumption of the assignor's liabilities, unless the creditors who did not consent to the transfer choose to rescind the transfer on the ground of fraud. <b>To allow an assignor to transfer all its business, properties and assets without the consent of its creditors and without requiring the assignee to assume the assignor's obligations will defraud the creditors. The assignment will place the assignor's assets beyond the reach of its creditors</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i><u>Royal Traders Holding Co., Inc.</u></i></b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> stressed that TRB still exists, albeit a change of name into Royal Traders Holding Co., Inc. <i>(RTHCI)</i>. Granting that it is so and that RTHCI has identifiable assets, which claim does not clearly appear on record as all of TRB’s assets have been transferred to Bancommerce, respondent networks can still proceed against the assets of TRB in Bancommerce or in the hands of other entities. The rule is that “(e)very prevailing party to a suit enjoys the corollary right to the fruits of the judgment and, thus, court rules provide a procedure to ensure that every favorable judgment is fully satisfied. This procedure can be found in Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court on execution of judgment. The said Rule provides that in the event that the judgment obligor cannot pay the monetary judgment in cash, the court, through the sheriff, <b><u>may levy or attach properties belonging to the judgment obligor</u></b> to secure the judgment.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Section 9(b), Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9(b) <i>Satisfaction by levy</i>. - If the judgment obligor cannot pay all or part of the obligation in cash, certified bank check or other mode of payment acceptable to the judgment obligee, <b>the officer shall levy upon the properties of the judgment obligor of every kind and nature whatsoever which may be disposed of for value</b> and not otherwise exempt from execution giving the latter the option to immediately choose which property or part thereof may be levied upon, sufficient to satisfy the judgment. If the judgment obligor does not exercise the option, the officer shall first levy on the personal properties, if any, and then on the real properties if the personal properties are insufficient to answer for the judgment.<br><br>The sheriff shall sell only a sufficient portion of the personal or real property of the judgment obligor which has been levied upon.<br><br>When there is more property of the judgment obligor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees, he must sell only so much of the personal or real property as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees.</blockquote><br>“The option under Section 9(b), Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court is granted to a judgment obligor before the sheriff levies its properties and not after.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> “(T)he sheriff is required to first demand of the judgment obligor the immediate payment of the full amount stated in the writ of execution before a levy can be made. The sheriff shall demand such payment either in cash, certified bank check or any other mode of payment acceptable to the judgment obligee. If the judgment obligor cannot pay by these methods immediately or at once, he can exercise his option to choose which of his properties can be levied upon.<b> If he does not exercise this option immediately or when he is absent or cannot be located, he <u>waives</u> such right</b>, and the sheriff can now first levy his personal properties, if any, and then the real properties if the personal properties are insufficient to answer for the judgment.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In this case, as the records show, Bancommerce (<b>TRB is “now known as Bancommerce”</b>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> refuses to cooperate and disclose TRB’s assets in its possession, erroneously asserting that it is a stranger. In this situation,<b> as transferee of all the rights and assets of TRB,</b> Bancommerce is deemed to have waived that right and the choice shall be exercised by the judgment obligees, which in this case are the respondent networks. In this connection, it must be remembered that the PSA involved substantially <b><u>all the assets and liabilities of TRB</u></b>. The PSA clearly <b><u>included</u></b> TRB's <b><u>banking goodwill, its bank premises, its licenses to operate its head office and branches, its leasehold rights, patents, trademarks or copyrights used in connection with its business or products.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Under the PSA, Bancommerce is the entity continuing the original banking business of TRB. It is not RTHCI. It is simply unacceptable that TRB merely changed its name to RTHCI. The changing of name was due to the fact that the nature and purpose for which TRB was originally incorporated already ceased. It must be stressed that the BSP even issued the Circular Letter (Series of 2002) advising all banks and non-bank financial intermediaries that the <b>banking activities</b> and <b>transactions</b> of TRB and Bancommerce were <b>consolidated</b> and that the latter <b>continued</b> the <b>operations of the former</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>For said reason, the writ of execution can be enforced against it.

In fact, it <b>affirmed</b> the said order of the trial court. The modification made by the CA was <b>a mere deletion of an opinion</b> and <b>not a reversal</b> of the RTC ruling. Otherwise, the CA could have so expressly stated in no uncertain terms. The deletion of the said pronouncement did not affect the RTC order of execution against any and all assets of TRB found anywhere in the Philippines, including those subject of the PSA.<br><br><b><i><u>Justice Denied</u></i></b><br><br>Bancommerce has done nothing but forestall the execution of a final and executory decision by incessantly carping that it is a stranger to the case.

Villanueva, Philippine Corporate Law 679-680, 682, 692-693 (2010) for its discussion on the three levels of Corporate Acquisitions and Transfers, namely: (1) pure assets-only transfer; (2) transfer of the business enterprise; and (3) equity transfer. It discussed that in a pure assets-only transfer, “the purchaser is only interested in the ‘raw’ assets and properties of the business, perhaps to be used to establish its own business enterprise or to be used for its on-going business enterprise.” In a transfer of business enterprise, “[t]he purchaser’s primary interest is to obtain the ‘earning capability’ of the venture.” An equity transfer is when “[t]he purchaser takes control and ownership of the business by purchasing the controlling shareholdings of the corporate owner.” In this case, “[t]he control of the business enterprise is therefore indirect [as] the corporate owner remains the direct owner of the business, and what the purchaser has actually purchased is the ability to elect the members of the Board of Directors of the corporation which runs the business.”<br><br>For the first and third type, the transferee shall not be liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor except where the transferee expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts. The second type, the transfer of business enterprise, makes the transferee liable for the transferor’s liabilities.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Corporation Code, sec. 40; emphasis supplied.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> 530 Phil. 149 (2006) [Per J.
