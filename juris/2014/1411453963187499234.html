Likewise we sustain NLRC’s finding in regard to the reimbursement of her fare, which is squarely based on the law; as well as the award of attorney’s fees.<br><br>But we do find it necessary to remand the instant case to the public respondent for further proceedings, for the purpose of addressing the validity or propriety of petitioner’s third-party complaint against the transferee agent or the Pacific Manpower &amp; Management Services, Inc. and Lea G. Manabat. We should emphasize that as far as the decision of the NLRC on the claims of Joy Cabiles, is concerned, the same is hereby affirmed with finality, and we hold petitioner liable thereon, but without prejudice to further hearings on its third party complaint against Pacific for reimbursement.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed Resolutions are hereby partly <b>AFFIRMED</b> in accordance with the foregoing discussion, but subject to the caveat embodied in the last sentence.

We find for respondent.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Sameer Overseas Placement Agency failed to show that there was just cause for causing Joy’s dismissal. The employer, Wacoal, also failed to accord her due process of law.<br><br>Indeed, employers have the prerogative to impose productivity and quality standards at work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> They may also impose reasonable rules to ensure that the employees comply with these standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Failure to comply may be a just cause for their dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Certainly, employers cannot be compelled to retain the services of an employee who is guilty of acts that are inimical to the interest of the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> While the law acknowledges the plight and vulnerability of workers, it does not “authorize the oppression or self-destruction of the employer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Management prerogative is recognized in law and in our jurisprudence.<br><br>This prerogative, however, should not be abused. It is “tempered with the employee’s right to security of tenure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Workers are entitled to substantive and procedural due process before termination. They may not be removed from employment without a valid or just cause as determined by law and without going through the proper procedure.<br><br>Security of tenure for labor is guaranteed by our Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Employees are not stripped of their security of tenure when they move to work in a different jurisdiction. With respect to the rights of overseas Filipino workers, we follow the principle of <i>lex loci contractus</i>.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Triple Eight Integrated Services, Inc. v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this court noted:<br><br><blockquote><i>Petitioner likewise attempts to sidestep the medical certificate requirement by contending that since Osdana was working in Saudi Arabia, her employment was subject to the laws of the host country</i>. Apparently, petitioner hopes to make it appear that the labor laws of Saudi Arabia do not require any certification by a competent public health authority in the dismissal of employees due to illness.<br><br>Again, petitioner’s argument is without merit.<br><br>First, established is the rule that <b><i>lex loci contractus (the law of the place where the contract is made) governs in this jurisdiction. There is no question that the contract of employment in this case was perfected here in the Philippines. Therefore, the Labor Code, its implementing rules and regulations, and other laws affecting labor apply in this case</i></b>. Furthermore, settled is the rule that the courts of the forum will not enforce any foreign claim obnoxious to the forum’s public policy. Here in the Philippines, employment agreements are more than contractual in nature. The Constitution itself, in Article XIII, Section 3, guarantees the special protection of workers, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.<br><br>It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote><br>This public policy should be borne in mind in this case because to allow foreign employers to determine for and by themselves whether an overseas contract worker may be dismissed on the ground of illness would encourage illegal or arbitrary pre-termination of employment contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Even with respect to fundamental procedural rights, this court emphasized in <i>PCL Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners admit that they did not inform private respondent in writing of the charges against him and that they failed to conduct a formal investigation to give him opportunity to air his side. <i>However, petitioners contend that the twin requirements of notice and hearing applies strictly only when the employment is within the Philippines and that these need not be strictly observed in cases of international maritime or overseas employment.</i><br><br>The Court does not agree. <b><i>The provisions of the Constitution as well as the Labor Code which afford protection to labor apply to Filipino employees whether working within the Philippines or abroad. Moreover, the principle of lex loci contractus (the law of the place where the contract is made) governs in this jurisdiction</i></b>. In the present case, it is not disputed that the Contract of Employment entered into by and between petitioners and private respondent was executed here in the Philippines with the approval of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). Hence, the Labor Code together with its implementing rules and regulations and other laws affecting labor apply in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>By our laws, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) may only be terminated for a just or authorized cause and after compliance with procedural due process requirements.<br><br>Article 282 of the Labor Code enumerates the just causes of termination by the employer. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 282. Termination by employer. An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<br><br>(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<br><br>(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;<br><br>(c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;<br><br>(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representatives; and<br><br>(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing.</blockquote><br>Petitioner’s allegation that respondent was inefficient in her work and negligent in her duties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> may, therefore, constitute a just cause for termination under Article 282(b), but only if petitioner was able to prove it.<br><br>The burden of proving that there is just cause for termination is on the employer. “The employer must affirmatively show rationally adequate evidence that the dismissal was for a justifiable cause.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Failure to show that there was valid or just cause for termination would necessarily mean that the dismissal was illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>To show that dismissal resulting from inefficiency in work is valid, it must be shown that: 1) the employer has set standards of conduct and workmanship against which the employee will be judged; 2) the standards of conduct and workmanship must have been communicated to the employee; and 3) the communication was made at a reasonable time prior to the employee’s performance assessment.<br><br>This is similar to the law and jurisprudence on probationary employees, which allow termination of the employee only when there is “just cause or when [the probationary employee] fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his [or her] engagement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>However, we do not see why the application of that ruling should be limited to probationary employment. That rule is basic to the idea of security of tenure and due process, which are guaranteed to all employees, whether their employment is probationary or regular.<br><br>The pre-determined standards that the employer sets are the bases for determining the probationary employee’s fitness, propriety, efficiency, and qualifications as a regular employee. Due process requires that the probationary employee be informed of such standards at the time of his or her engagement so he or she can adjust his or her character or workmanship accordingly. Proper adjustment to fit the standards upon which the employee’s qualifications will be evaluated will increase one’s chances of being positively assessed for regularization by his or her employer.<br><br>Assessing an employee’s work performance does not stop after regularization. The employer, on a regular basis, determines if an employee is still qualified and efficient, based on work standards. Based on that determination, and after complying with the due process requirements of notice and hearing, the employer may exercise its management prerogative of terminating the employee found unqualified.<br><br>The regular employee must constantly attempt to prove to his or her employer that he or she meets all the standards for employment. This time, however, the standards to be met are set for the purpose of retaining employment or promotion. The employee cannot be expected to meet any standard of character or workmanship if such standards were not communicated to him or her. Courts should remain vigilant on allegations of the employer’s failure to communicate work standards that would govern one’s employment “if [these are] to discharge in good faith [their] duty to adjudicate.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner merely alleged that respondent failed to comply with her foreign employer’s work requirements and was inefficient in her work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> <i>No evidence was shown to support such allegations. Petitioner did not even bother to specify what requirements were not met, what efficiency standards were violated, or what particular acts of respondent constituted inefficiency.</i><br><br><i>There was also no showing that respondent was sufficiently informed of the standards against which her work efficiency and performance were judged. <b>The parties’ conflict as to the position held by respondent showed that even the matter as basic as the job title was not clear</b>.</i><br><br>The bare allegations of petitioner are not sufficient to support a claim that there is just cause for termination. There is no proof that respondent was legally terminated.<br><br><b>Petitioner failed to comply with<br>the due process requirements </b><br><br>Respondent’s dismissal less than one year from hiring and her repatriation on the same day show not only failure on the part of petitioner to comply with the requirement of the existence of just cause for termination. They patently show that the employers did not comply with the due process requirement.<br><br>A valid dismissal requires both a valid cause and adherence to the valid procedure of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The employer is required to give the charged employee at least two written notices before termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> One of the written notices must inform the employee of the particular acts that may cause his or her dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The other notice must “[inform] the employee of the employer’s decision.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Aside from the notice requirement, the employee must also be given “an opportunity to be heard.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Petitioner failed to comply with the twin notices and hearing requirements. Respondent started working on June 26, 1997. She was told that she was terminated on July 14, 1997 effective on the same day and barely a month from her first workday. She was also repatriated on the same day that she was informed of her termination. The abruptness of the termination negated any finding that she was properly notified and given the opportunity to be heard. Her constitutional right to due process of law was violated.<br><br><div align="center">II<br></div><br>Respondent Joy Cabiles, having been illegally dismissed, is entitled to her salary for the unexpired portion of the employment contract that was violated together with attorney’s fees and reimbursement of amounts withheld from her salary.<br><br>Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, states that overseas workers who were terminated without just, valid, or authorized cause “shall be entitled to the full reimbursement of his placement fee with interest of twelve (12%) per annum, plus his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.”<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 10.

This is analogous to cases where there are millions of Filipinos working abroad who are bound to suffer from the lack of protection because of the restoration of an identical clause in a provision previously declared as unconstitutional.<br><br>In the hierarchy of laws, the Constitution is supreme. No branch or office of the government may exercise its powers in any manner inconsistent with the Constitution, regardless of the existence of any law that supports such exercise. The Constitution cannot be trumped by any other law. All laws must be read in light of the Constitution. Any law that is inconsistent with it is a nullity.<br><br>Thus, when a law or a provision of law is null because it is inconsistent with the Constitution, the nullity cannot be cured by reincorporation or reenactment of the same or a similar law or provision. A law or provision of law that was already declared unconstitutional remains as such unless circumstances have so changed as to warrant a reverse conclusion.<br><br>We are not convinced by the pleadings submitted by the parties that the situation has so changed so as to cause us to reverse binding precedent.<br><br>Likewise, there are special reasons of judicial efficiency and economy that attend to these cases.<br><br>The new law puts our overseas workers in the same vulnerable position as they were prior to <i>Serrano</i>.

This means that they cannot be dismissed before the end of their contract terms without due process. If they were illegally dismissed, the workers’ right to security of tenure is violated.<br><br>The rights violated when, say, a fixed-period local worker is illegally terminated are neither greater than nor less than the rights violated when a fixed-period overseas worker is illegally terminated. It is state policy to protect the rights of workers without qualification as to the place of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> In both cases, the workers are deprived of their expected salary, which they could have earned had they not been illegally dismissed.

On the other hand, foreign employers are more incentivized by the reinstated clause to enter into contracts of at least a year because it gives them more flexibility to violate our overseas workers’ rights. Their liability for arbitrarily terminating overseas workers is decreased at the expense of the workers whose rights they violated. Meanwhile, these overseas workers who are impressed with an expectation of a stable job overseas for the longer contract period disregard other opportunities only to be terminated earlier. They are left with claims that are less than what others in the same situation would receive. The reinstated clause, therefore, creates a situation where the law meant to protect them makes violation of rights easier and simply benign to the violator.<br><br>As Justice Brion said in his concurring opinion in Serrano:<br><br><blockquote>Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 affects these well-laid rules and measures, and in fact provides a hidden twist affecting the principal/employer’s liability. While intended as an incentive accruing to recruitment/manning agencies, <i>the law, as worded, simply limits the OFWs’ recovery in wrongful dismissal situations. Thus, it redounds to the benefit of whoever may be liable, including the principal/employer – the direct employer primarily liable for the wrongful dismissal</i>. In this sense, Section 10 – read as a grant of incentives to recruitment/manning agencies – oversteps what it aims to do by effectively limiting what is otherwise the full liability of the foreign principals/employers. <i>Section 10, in short, really operates to benefit the wrong party and allows that party, without justifiable reason, to mitigate its liability for wrongful dismissals</i>. Because of this hidden twist, the limitation of liability under Section 10 cannot be an “appropriate” incentive, to borrow the term that R.A. No. 8042 itself uses to describe the incentive it envisions under its purpose clause.<br><br>What worsens the situation is the chosen mode of granting the incentive: instead of a grant that, to encourage greater efforts at recruitment, is directly related to extra efforts undertaken, the law simply limits their liability for the wrongful dismissals of already deployed OFWs. This is effectively a legally-imposed partial condonation of their liability to OFWs, justified solely by the law’s intent to encourage greater deployment efforts. Thus, the incentive, from a more practical and realistic view, is really part of a scheme to sell Filipino overseas labor <i>at a bargain</i> for purposes solely of attracting the market. . . .<br><br>The so-called incentive is rendered particularly odious by its effect on the OFWs — <i>the benefits accruing to the recruitment/manning agencies and their principals are taken from the pockets of the OFWs</i> to whom the full salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract rightfully belong. Thus, the principals/employers and the recruitment/manning agencies even profit from their violation of the security of tenure that an employment contract embodies. Conversely, lesser protection is afforded the OFW, not only because of the lessened recovery afforded him or her by operation of law, but also because this same lessened recovery renders a wrongful dismissal easier and less onerous to undertake; the lesser cost of dismissing a Filipino will always be a consideration a foreign employer will take into account in termination of employment decisions. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></blockquote><br>Further, “[t]here can never be a justification for any form of government action that alleviates the burden of one sector, but imposes the same burden on another sector, especially when the favored sector is composed of private businesses such as placement agencies, while the disadvantaged sector is composed of OFWs whose protection no less than the Constitution commands. The idea that private business interest can be elevated to the level of a compelling state interest is odious.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>Along the same line, we held that the reinstated clause violates due process rights.

Gallery Frames</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br><blockquote>II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% <i>per annum</i> to be computed from default, <i>i.e</i>., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br><br></li><li>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the <i>discretion of the court</i> at the rate of 6%<i> per annum</i>. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br></li><li>When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% <i>per annum </i>from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.</li></ol></blockquote><br>And, in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup></blockquote><br>Circular No. 799 is applicable only in loans and forbearance of money, goods, or credits, and in judgments when there is no stipulation on the applicable interest rate. Further, it is only applicable if the judgment did not become final and executory before July 1, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>We add that Circular No. 799 is not applicable when there is a law that states otherwise. While the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has the power to set or limit interest rates,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> these interest rates do not apply when the law provides that a different interest rate shall be applied. “[A] Central Bank Circular cannot repeal a law. Only a law can repeal another law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>For example, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042 provides that unlawfully terminated overseas workers are entitled to the reimbursement of his or her placement fee with an interest of 12% per annum. Since Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas circulars cannot repeal Republic Act No. 8042, the issuance of Circular No. 799 does not have the effect of changing the interest on awards for reimbursement of placement fees from 12% to 6%. This is despite Section 1 of Circular No. 799, which provides that the 6% interest rate applies even to judgments.<br><br>Moreover, laws are deemed incorporated in contracts. “The contracting parties need not repeat them. They do not even have to be referred to. Every contract, thus, contains not only what has been explicitly stipulated, but the statutory provisions that have any bearing on the matter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> There is, therefore, an implied stipulation in contracts between the placement agency and the overseas worker that in case the overseas worker is adjudged as entitled to reimbursement of his or her placement fees, the amount shall be subject to a 12% interest per annum. This implied stipulation has the effect of removing awards for reimbursement of placement fees from Circular No. 799’s coverage.<br><br>The same cannot be said for awards of salary for the unexpired portion of the employment contract under Republic Act No. 8042. These awards are covered by Circular No. 799 because the law does not provide for a specific interest rate that should apply.<br><br>In sum, if judgment did not become final and executory before July 1, 2013 and there was no stipulation in the contract providing for a different interest rate, other money claims under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042 shall be subject to the 6% interest per annum in accordance with Circular No. 799.<br><br>This means that respondent is also entitled to an interest of 6% per annum on her money claims from the finality of this judgment.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Finally, we clarify the liabilities of Wacoal as principal and petitioner as the employment agency that facilitated respondent’s overseas employment.<br><br>Section 10 of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 provides that the foreign employer and the local employment agency are jointly and severally liable for money claims including claims arising out of an employer-employee relationship and/or damages. This section also provides that the performance bond filed by the local agency shall be answerable for such money claims or damages if they were awarded to the employee.<br><br>This provision is in line with the state’s policy of affording protection to labor and alleviating workers’ plight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>In overseas employment, the filing of money claims against the foreign employer is attended by practical and legal complications. The distance of the foreign employer alone makes it difficult for an overseas worker to reach it and make it liable for violations of the Labor Code. There are also possible conflict of laws, jurisdictional issues, and procedural rules that may be raised to frustrate an overseas worker’s attempt to advance his or her claims.<br><br>It may be argued, for instance, that the foreign employer must be impleaded in the complaint as an indispensable party without which no final determination can be had of an action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>The provision on joint and several liability in the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 assures overseas workers that their rights will not be frustrated with these complications.<br><br>The fundamental effect of joint and several liability is that “each of the debtors is liable for the entire obligation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> A final determination may, therefore, be achieved even if only one of the joint and several debtors are impleaded in an action. Hence, in the case of overseas employment, either the local agency or the foreign employer may be sued for all claims arising from the foreign employer’s labor law violations. This way, the overseas workers are assured that someone — the foreign employer’s local agent — may be made to answer for violations that the foreign employer may have committed.<br><br>The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 ensures that overseas workers have recourse in law despite the circumstances of their employment. By providing that the liability of the foreign employer may be “enforced to the full extent”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> against the local agent, the overseas worker is assured of immediate and sufficient payment of what is due them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>Corollary to the assurance of immediate recourse in law, the provision on joint and several liability in the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 shifts the burden of going after the foreign employer from the overseas worker to the local employment agency. However, it must be emphasized that the local agency that is held to answer for the overseas worker’s money claims is not left without remedy. The law does not preclude it from going after the foreign employer for reimbursement of whatever payment it has made to the employee to answer for the money claims against the foreign employer.<br><br>A further implication of making local agencies jointly and severally liable with the foreign employer is that an additional layer of protection is afforded to overseas workers. Local agencies, which are businesses by nature, are inoculated with interest in being always on the lookout against foreign employers that tend to violate labor law. Lest they risk their reputation or finances, local agencies must already have mechanisms for guarding against unscrupulous foreign employers even at the level prior to overseas employment applications.<br><br>With the present state of the pleadings, it is not possible to determine whether there was indeed a transfer of obligations from petitioner to Pacific. This should not be an obstacle for the respondent overseas worker to proceed with the enforcement of this judgment. Petitioner is possessed with the resources to determine the proper legal remedies to enforce its rights against Pacific, if any.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>Many times, this court has spoken on what Filipinos may encounter as they travel into the farthest and most difficult reaches of our planet to provide for their families.

While these workers may indeed have relatively little defense against exploitation while they are abroad, that disadvantage must not continue to burden them when they return to their own territory to voice their muted complaint.

No. 10022,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> is unconstitutional in so far as it provides that:<br><br><blockquote><i>In case of termination of overseas employment without just, valid or authorized cause as defined by law or contract, the workers shall be entitled to the full reimbursement of his placement fee with interest of twelve (12%) per annum, <b>plus his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less</b>.&nbsp; [Emphasis and italics ours]</i><br></blockquote><br>My conclusion on the constitutionality of the above-quoted clause (<i>subject clause</i>) of Section 10, R.A. No. 8042, however, proceeds from a different reason and constitutional basis.&nbsp; I maintain the view that <b>the subject clause should be struck down for violation of the constitutional provisions in favor of labor, under Section 3, Article XIII, and of the substantive aspect of the due process clause, under Section 1, Article III.</b><br><br>Thus, <i>I take </i><b>exception</b> to the <i>ponencia’s</i> full adoption of the ruling in <i>Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc., et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to the extent that it applies the strict scrutiny standard in invoking the equal protection guarantee.&nbsp; To my mind, the circumstances of this case do not justify the <i>ponencia’s </i>approach of extending and expanding the use of the strict scrutiny standard in invalidating the subject clause (as reinstated in R.A. No. 8042 by R.A. No. 10022).&nbsp; The conclusion that the subject clause created a “suspect” classification is simply misplaced.<br><br>The approach, sadly, only unnecessarily shifted the burden to the government to prove: (1) a compelling state interest; and (2) that the legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve the intended result.&nbsp; It also <b>unnecessarily undermines the presumed constitutionality of statutes and of the respect that the Court accords to the acts of a co-equal branch</b>.&nbsp; The differential or rational basis scrutiny, <i>i.e., </i>where the challenged classification needs only be shown to be rationally related to serving a legitimate state interest, <u>would have undoubtedly served the purpose without bringing these unnecessary implications.</u><br><br>As I maintain the same view and legal reasoning, and if only to emphasize my position in the present case, I quote below portions of my Concurring Opinion in<i> Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc., et al. (Serrano Opinion)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> rejecting the validity of using the strict scrutiny standard to test the validity of the subject clause under the equal protection guarantee.&nbsp; I invoke the same legal reasoning as basis, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of my stance in the present case.<br><br><blockquote>A suspect classification is one where distinctions are made based on the most invidious bases for classification that violate the most basic human rights, <i>i.e</i>., on the basis of race, national origin, alien status,&nbsp; religious affiliation, and to a certain extent, sex and sexual orientation.&nbsp; With a suspect classification, the scrutiny of the classification is raised to its highest level: the ordinary presumption of constitutionality is reversed and government carries the burden of proving that its challenged policy is constitutional.&nbsp; To withstand strict scrutiny, the government must show that its policy is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest; if this is proven, the state must then demonstrate that the legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve the intended result.<br><br>In the present case, <i>I do not see the slightest indication that Congress actually intended to classify OFWs </i>– between and among themselves, and in relation with local workers – when it adopted the disputed portion of Section 10.&nbsp; <i>The congressional intent was to merely grant recruitment and manning agencies an incentive and thereby encourage them into greater deployment efforts,</i> although, as discussed above, the incentive really works for the foreign principals’ benefit at the expense of the OFWs.<br><br>Even assuming that a classification resulted from the law, the classification should not immediately be characterized as a suspect classification that would invite the application of the strict scrutiny standard.&nbsp; <b><i>The disputed portion of Section 10 does not, on its face, restrict or curtail the civil and human rights of any single group of OFWs.&nbsp; At best, the disputed portion limits the monetary award for wrongful termination of employment – a tort situation affecting an OFW’s economic interest</i></b><i>.&nbsp; This characterization and the unintended classification that unwittingly results from the incentive scheme under Section 10, to my mind, render a strict scrutiny disproportionate to the circumstances</i> to which it is applied.<br><br>I believe, too, that <b><i>we should tread lightly in further expanding the concept of suspect classification after we have done so in Central Bank, where we held that classifications that result in prejudice to persons accorded special protection by the Constitution</i></b> requires a stricter judicial scrutiny. The use of a suspect classification label cannot depend solely on whether the Constitution has accorded special protection to a specified sector.&nbsp; <u>While the Constitution specially mentions labor as a sector that needs special protection, the involvement of or relationship to labor, by itself, cannot automatically trigger a suspect classification and the accompanying strict scrutiny</u>; <i>much should depend on the circumstances of the case, on the impact of the illegal differential treatment on the sector involved, on the needed protection, and on the impact of recognizing a suspect classification on future situations</i>.&nbsp; In other words, we should carefully calibrate our moves when faced with an equal protection situation so that we do not <i>misappreciate</i> the essence of what a suspect classification is, and thereby lessen its jurisprudential impact and value.&nbsp; Reserving this approach to the worst cases of unacceptable classification and discrimination highlights the importance of striking at these types of unequal treatment and is a lesson that will not be lost on all concerned, particularly the larger public.&nbsp; There is the added reason, too, that the reverse onus that a strict scrutiny brings directly strikes, in the most glaring manner, at the regularity of the performance of functions of a co-equal branch of government; inter-government harmony and courtesy demand that we reserve this type of treatment to the worst violations of the Constitution.<br><br>Incidentally,<b><i> I believe that we can arrive at the same conclusion and similarly strike down the disputed Section 10 by using the lowest level of scrutiny, thereby rendering the use of the strict scrutiny unnecessary</i></b>. Given the OSG’s positions, the resulting differential treatment the law fosters between Philippine-based workers and OFWs in illegal dismissal situations does not rest on substantial distinctions that are germane to the purpose of the law.&nbsp; No reasonable basis for classification exists since the distinctions the OSG pointed out do not justify the different treatment of OFWs and Philippine-based workers, specifically, why one class should be excepted from the consequences of illegal termination under the Labor Code, while the other is not.<br><br>To be sure, the difference in work locations and working conditions that the OSG pointed out are not valid grounds for distinctions that should matter in the enforcement of employment contracts.&nbsp; Whether in the Philippines or elsewhere, the integrity of contracts – be they labor, commercial or political – is a zealously guarded value that we in the Philippines should not demean by allowing a breach of OFW contracts easy to undertake.&nbsp; This is true whatever may be the duration or character of employment; employment contracts, whatever their term and conditions may be subject only to their consistency with the law, must be respected during the whole contracted term and under the conditions agreed upon.<br><br>Significantly, the OSG could not even point to any reason other than the protection of recruitment agencies and the expansion of the Philippine overseas program as justification for the limitation of liability that has effectively distinguished OFWs from locally-based workers.&nbsp; These reasons, unfortunately, are not on the same plane as protection to labor in our constitutional hierarchy of values.&nbsp; Even RA 8042 repeats that “<i>the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and national development.</i>”&nbsp; Under RA 8042’s own terms, <i>the overseas employment program exists only for OFW protection.&nbsp; Thus viewed, the expansion of the Philippine overseas deployment program and the need for incentives to achieve results are simply not valid reasons to justify a classification</i>, particularly when the incentive is in the form of oppressive and confiscatory limitation of liability detrimental to labor.&nbsp; No valid basis for classification thus exists to justify the differential treatment that resulted from the disputed Section 10.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In this regard, I likewise reiterate my reasons and explanation for striking down the subject clause on the ground that<b> it violates the constitutional provisions in favor of labor and the substantive aspect of the due process clause.</b><br><br>For proper perspective, I quote below the pertinent constitutional provision that secures a special status and treatment in favor of labor.<br><br><blockquote><center>Article XIII<br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br></center><br>Section 18.&nbsp; The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.<br><br>It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.<br><br>The State shall promote the principle of shared responsibility between workers and employers and the preferential use of voluntary modes in settling disputes, including conciliation, and shall enforce their mutual compliance therewith to foster industrial peace.<br><br>The State shall regulate the relations between workers and employers, recognizing the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns to investments, and to expansion and growth.</blockquote><br>This constitutional protection afforded to labor articulates in clearer and more concrete terms the constitutional policy under Section 18, Article II that declares and affirms <i>labor as a primary social economic force aimed at protecting the rights of workers and promoting their welfare.</i><br><br>On the other hand, R.A. No. 8042 provides, among others:<br><br><blockquote>(b) The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.&nbsp; Towards this end, the State shall provide adequate and timely social, economic and legal services to Filipino migrant workers.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>(e)&nbsp; Free access to the courts and quasi-judicial bodies and adequate legal assistance shall not be denied to any person by reason of poverty.&nbsp; In this regard, it is imperative that an effective mechanism be instituted to ensure that the rights and interests of distressed overseas Filipinos, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular, documented or undocumented, are adequately protected and safeguarded.</blockquote><br>Under these terms, R.A. No. 8042 is discernibly a piece of social legislation that the State enacted in the exercise of its police power, precisely to give teeth and arms to the constitutional provisions on labor under its aim to “<b><i>establish a higher standard of protection and promotion of the welfare of migrant worker, their families and of overseas Filipinos in distress.</i></b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Otherwise stated, it draws power and life from the constitutional provisions that it seeks to concretize and implement.<br><br>As I pointed out in my <i>Serrano Opinion, “the express policy declarations of R.A. No. 8042 show that its purposes are reiterations of the very same policies enshrined in the Constitution x x x [They] patently characterize R.A. No. 8042 as a direct implementation of the constitutional objectives on Filipino overseas work so that it must be read and understood in terms of these policy objectives.&nbsp; Under this interpretative guide, <u>any provision in R.A. No. 8042 inimical to the interest of an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) cannot have any place in the law.</u>”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> [Underscoring supplied]<br><br>Note also (again, as I reflected in my <i>Serrano Opinion</i>) that while R.A. No. 8042 acknowledges that the State shall <i>“promote full employment,</i>” it likewise provides that “<i>the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and national development.&nbsp; The existence of overseas employment program rests solely on the assurance that the dignity and fundamental human rights and freedom of Filipino citizens shall not, at any time, be compromised and violated.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The Act, however, concludes its Declaration of Policies by stating that <u><i>“<b>[n]onetheless</b>, the deployment of Filipino overseas workers, whether land-based or sea-based, by local service contractors and manning agencies employing them shall be encouraged.&nbsp; Appropriate incentives may be extended to them.</i></u>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; [Underscoring supplied]<br><br>Thus, the Act recognizes that to encourage greater deployment efforts, <b>“incentives” can be given, BUT, to service contractors and manning agencies ONLY</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Contractors’ and agencies’ principals, i.e., the foreign employers in whose behalf the contractors and agencies recruit OFWs are not among those to whom incentives can be given as they are not mentioned at all in the Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Of particular importance to the present case is Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 which governs the OFWs’ money claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Pursuant to its terms, the Act obviously protects the OFW as against the employer and the recruitment agency in cases of unlawful termination of service.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it limits the liability to the “<i>reimbursement of the placement fee and interest, and the <u>payment of his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.</u></i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>This limitation is a step backward as it imposes a cap on the liability of the foreign principal/employer and the contractor/recruitment agency even as it earlier declared their liability joint and solidary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; To be an “appropriate incentive,” this limitation of liability can only be justified under the terms of the law, <i>i.e.</i>, “<b>the incentive must necessarily relate to the law’s purpose with reasonable expectation that it would serve this purpose; it must also accrue to its intended beneficiaries (the recruitment/placement agencies), and not to parties to whom the reason for the grant does not apply.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Viewed in this light, the subject clause can only pass constitutional muster if it shows: (1) a lawful purpose; and (2) lawful means to achieve the lawful purpose.<br><br>On the<i> lawful purpose requirement,</i> the policy of extending incentives to local service contractors and manning agencies to encourage greater efforts at securing work for OFWs is, undeniably, constitutionally valid.&nbsp; <b>There is nothing inherently unconstitutional in providing such incentives for not only are local service contractors and manning agencies significant stakeholders in the government’s overseas employment program;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Constitution itself also expressly recognizes “<i>the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right to reasonable returns on investments, and expansion and growth</i>.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; [Underscoring supplied]<br><br>On the <i>lawful means requirement, i.e.</i>, whether the means employed to achieve the purpose of encouraging recruitment efforts (through the incentive granted of limiting the liability of recruitment/manning agencies for illegal dismissals) is reasonable, the subject clause obviously fails.<br><br><i>First,</i> as I pointed out in my <i>Serrano Opinion,</i> Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 provides measures that collectively protect OFWs, <i>i.e.,</i> by ensuring the integrity of their contracts; by establishing the responsible parties; and by providing the mechanisms for their enforcement that imposes direct and primary liability to the foreign principal employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Yet, Section 10 presents a hidden twist affecting the principal/employer’s liability.&nbsp; As worded, the Act “<i>simply limits the OFWs’ recovery in wrongful dismissal situations.&nbsp; Thus, it redounds to the benefit of whoever may be liable, including the principal/employer – the direct employer primarily liable for the wrongful dismissal.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>From this perspective, Section 10 actually limits what is otherwise the foreign principal/employer’s full liability under the Act and exceeds what the Act intended – to grant incentives to recruitment/manning agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; “<b><i>Section 10, in short, really operates to benefit the wrong party and allows that party, without justifiable reason, to mitigate its liability for wrongful dismissals</i></b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied]&nbsp; “Because of this hidden twist, the limitation of liability under <b>Section 10 cannot be an “appropriate” incentive.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> [Underscoring supplied]<br><br><i>Second</i>, the chosen mode of granting the incentive,<i> i.e</i>., <b>the liability limitation for wrongful dismissals of already deployed OFWs, effectively imposed, with legal sanction, a partial condonation of the foreign principal/employer’s liability to OFWs</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The incentive, therefore, “from a more practical and realistic view, is really part of a scheme to sell Filipino overseas labor <i>at a bargain</i> for purposes solely of attracting the market,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> a scheme that sadly reduces our OFWs to mere cash cows.<br><br>And <i>third</i>, <b>the “incentive scheme” effectively benefits the recruitment/manning agencies and foreign principal/employer at the expense of the OFWs from whom the salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract are taken and to whom these salaries rightfully belong.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In effect, “the principals/employers and the recruitment/manning agencies profit from their violation of the security of tenure that an employment contract embodies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; The OFWs, on the other hand, are afforded lesser protection because: (1) they are afforded reduced recovery by operation of law; (2) the reduced recovery renders wrongful dismissal situations more alluring, easier to facilitate and less onerous to undertake which foreign employers will most certainly consider in termination of employment decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>These inimical effects obviously will remain as long as the subject clause remains in Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042, this time as reinstated by R.A. No. 10022.&nbsp; The “inherently oppressive, arbitrary, confiscatory and inimical provision [under Section 10 of R.A.
