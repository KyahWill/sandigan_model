He added that despite being examined by the company-designated physician, he continued to suffer episodes of severe chest pain, difficulty in breathing and other discomforts related to his illness; that his health has not improved, and was instead deteriorating, which thus led him to consult an independent physician (Dr. Vicaldo); that Dr. Vicaldo declared him unfit to work as seaman in any capacity and that his illness was work-related; that despite the lapse of more than six months, the company-designated physician has failed to make a finding regarding his condition, which thus entitles him to permanent total disability benefits; that his just claim for disability benefits was denied by petitioners, which forced him to file the labor complaint; and that he should thus be paid US$60,000.00 disability benefits with interest, 120 days illness allowance based on his salary of US$390.00 or the amount of US$1,560.00 with interest, P500,000.00 damages, and attorney’s fees of 10% of the recoverable amount.<br><br>Petitioners, on the other hand, stated and argued in their Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that respondent filed a labor complaint even before the company-designated physician, Dr. Cruz, could complete his examination and treatment of respondent’s condition, which thus prompted them to deny his claim for disability benefits; that the independent physician Dr. Vicaldo examined respondent only once on February 16, 2006, and thus could not have arrived at a competent diagnosis of respondent’s condition; that in the absence of a competent diagnosis and substantial evidence, respondent’s claim for benefits cannot stand; that respondent’s illness is not work-related, and that his lifestyle caused, or was a contributing factor to, his illness; that contrary to respondent’s claim, the latter has been paid his illness allowance in full; that respondent’s medical expenses are being shouldered by them; and that respondent is not entitled to damages and attorney’s fees as a result of prematurely filing the labor case.

Thus, it held:<br><br><blockquote>Medical studies show that atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is commonly referred to as a “hardening” or “furring” of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries. It develops from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), colloquially called “bad cholesterol”. It typically begins in early adolescence and is usually found in most major arteries, yet is asymptomatic and not detected by most diagnostic methods during life. Some risk factors for atherosclerosis are: advanced age, having diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, dysliporproteinemia or unhealthy patterns of serum proteins carrying fats and cholesterol, male sex, tobacco smoking, having high blood pressure, being obese, a sedentary lifestyle, having close relatives who have had some complication[s] of atherosclerosis, elevated serum level of triglycerides, elevated serum insulin levels, stress or symptoms of clinical depression and hyperthyroidism x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> filed with the CA, respondent sought a reversal of the NLRC Decision, arguing that the latter committed grave abuse of discretion and gross error in declaring that his illness was not work-related and in subsequently denying his claims.<br><br>On April 20, 2010, the CA issued the assailed Decision containing the following decretal portion:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant petition is GRANTED.

The CA held further that as early as September 2005, respondent was declared unfit for duty by a company-designated physician in Tianjin, China, and later on, after tests were conducted, respondent was diagnosed with coronary artery atherosclerosis and severe three-vessel coronary artery disease; thus, respondent suffered a serious occupational disease that prevented his further deployment as seaman.<br><br>The CA added that respondent’s illness was work-related, and can be attributed to the conditions he was working under as able seaman; he was exposed and subjected to stress and pressures at work which, after six months, resulted in his experiencing chest pain, fatigue and difficulty in breathing – and eventually, a diagnosis of coronary heart disease.<br><br>The CA noted further that even during the pendency of the labor case before the Labor Arbiter, Dr. Cruz did not render a final assessment of respondent’s condition; as a result, the diagnosis of the company-designated physician in Gangyou Hospital in Tianjin, China that respondent was unfit for duty has not been overturned. Thus, the CA concluded that since Dr. Cruz failed to make a definite assessment of respondent’s fitness or disability within the statutory 240-day period – and even thereafter, there can be no other conclusion than that respondent suffered permanent total disability.<br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> but the CA denied the same in its July 21, 2010 Resolution.

The POEA-SEC cannot be presumed to contain all the possible injuries that render a seafarer unfit for further sea duties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Just the same, in several cases, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, as well as other heart ailments were held to be compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Likewise, petitioners failed to refute respondent’s allegations in his Position Paper that in the performance of his duties as Able Seaman, he inhaled, was exposed to, and came into direct contact with various injurious and harmful chemicals, dust, fumes/ emissions, and other irritant agents; that he performed strenuous tasks such as lifting, pulling, pushing and/or moving equipment and materials on board the ship; that he was constantly exposed to varying temperatures of extreme hot and cold as the ship crossed ocean boundaries; that he was exposed as well to harsh weather conditions; that in most instances, he was required to perform overtime work; and that the work of an Able Seaman is both physically and mentally stressful. It does not require much imagination to realize or conclude that these tasks could very well cause the illness that respondent, then already 47 years old, suffered from six months into his employment contract with petitioners. The following pronouncement in a recent case very well applies to respondent:<br><br><blockquote>x x x His constant exposure to hazards such as chemicals and the varying temperature, like the heat in the kitchen of the vessel and the coldness outside, coupled by stressful tasks in his employment caused, or at least aggravated, his illness. It is already recognized that any kind of work or labor produces stress and strain normally resulting in wear and tear of the human body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>Notably, it is “a matter of judicial notice that an overseas worker, having to ward off homesickness by reason of being physically separated from his family for the entire duration of his contract, bears a great degree of emotional strain while making an effort to perform his work well. The strain is even greater in the case of a seaman who is constantly subjected to the perils of the sea while at work abroad and away from his family.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b><i>Assessment by company-designated physician</i></b><br><br>The company-designated physician must arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer’s fitness to work or permanent disability within the period of 120 or 240 days, pursuant to Article 192 (c)(1) of the Labor Code and Rule X, Section 2 of the AREC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> If he fails to do so and the seafarer’s medical condition remains unresolved, the latter shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled.<br><br>Respondent was repatriated on September 18, 2005. He was further examined by the company-designated physician Dr. Cruz on September 21, 23 and 30, 2005; October 6, 2005; February 2, 13 and 17, 2006; March 6 and 20, 2006; and on April 19, 2006. And beginning from the February 2, 2006 medical report, respondent was diagnosed by Dr. Cruz with severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease, and was scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery on February 24, 2006. After surgery, respondent continued his treatment with Dr. Cruz, who on the other hand continued to diagnose respondent with severe coronary artery disease even on respondent’s last consultation on April 19, 2006.<br><br>Concededly, the period September 18, 2005 to April 19, 2006 is less than the statutory 240-day – or 8-month – period. Nonetheless, it is impossible to expect that by May 19, 2006, or on the last day of the statutory 240-day period, respondent would be declared fit to work when just recently – or on February 24, 2006 – he underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; by then, respondent would not have sufficiently recovered. In other words, it became evident as early as April 19, 2006 that respondent was permanently and totally disabled, unfit to return to work as seafarer and earn therefrom, given his delicate post-operative condition; a definitive assessment by Dr. Cruz before May 19, 2006 was unnecessary. Respondent would to all intents and purposes still be unfit for sea-duty. Even then, with Dr. Cruz’s failure to issue a definite assessment of respondent’s condition on May 19, 2006, or the last day of the statutory 240-day period, respondent was thus deemed totally and permanently disabled pursuant to Article 192 (c)(1) of the Labor Code and Rule X, Section 2 of the AREC.<br><br><b><i>Premature labor complaint</i></b><br><br>Neither may it be argued by the petitioners that respondent’s filing of the labor complaint on February 10, 2006 should affect the outcome of the case. It is difficult to blame respondent for deciding to sue, considering that he has been diagnosed by no less than three separate physicians – Drs. Dizon, Vicaldo, and Cruz – with severe three-vessel coronary artery disease which required bypass procedure. Respondent may have been acting under a sense of extreme urgency given the life-threatening nature of his illness. The filing of the labor complaint may have been designed to pressure petitioners into taking action to address his condition, or to recover expenses should he decide to proceed with the bypass procedure on his own. Either way, the Court cannot subscribe to the view that there was a premature resort to litigation since respondent was still undergoing treatment for his illness and the company-designated physician has not completed treatment and made a definite assessment of his condition.<br><br>Indeed, it may even be said that with Dr. Cruz’s February 2, 2006 diagnosis that respondent was suffering from severe three-vessel coronary artery disease which required immediate bypass graft procedure or surgery, respondent believed himself permanently and totally disabled which thus led him to demand disability benefits and thereafter file the labor case when petitioners ignored his demand.<br><br><b><i>Attorney’s fees</i></b><br><br>On the issue of attorney’s fees, while petitioners have not been shown to act in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy respondent’s demands, it is nonetheless true as a matter of law and it has been held in the past that where an employee is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his right and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award at the time of actual payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
