CV No. 86712 where just compensation was fixed at P1,000.00 per square meter only for the affected area of 1,591.91 square meters, and not for the whole of respondents’ respective lots. It argued that the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712 resolved only the issue of whether respondents should be paid the full market value of the affected 1,595.91-square meter area or just a 10% easement fee therefor; it did not decide whether NPC should pay just compensation for the entire area of 7,015 square meters.<br><br>On September 24, 2009, the Batangas City RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> denying NPC’s Urgent Omnibus Motion, declaring that –<br><br><blockquote>The cases cited by plaintiff are not in point. These cases involved either the construction and maintenance of electric transmission lines x x x or the widening of road component x x x. None of the cited cases involved underground natural gas pipelines, as in this case. It does not take an expert to be able to infer that there is a world of difference on the probable effects of the two (2) kinds of projects on the properties upon which these are imposed. In the case of transmission lines, the NPC imposes a limitation on the property owner’s use of their property in that below said transmission lines no plant higher than three (3) meters is planted. In the case of underground pipelines, similar, if not more burdensome restrictions, are imposed for the reason that the ground under which the natural gas pipelines are located could not be cultivated in view of the dangers that might result from accidental injury or damage to the pipelines. Moreover, there is the possible inestimable damage that an unpredictable natural disaster such as an earthquake of tectonic origin, the precise date and time of occurrence of which are yet beyond the powers of man to accurately foretell, could inflict on the underground natural gas pipelines and consequently, on all things, living and non-living, that exist in the vicinity of the defendants’ properties.<br><br>Moreover, the ruling that just compensation should be paid for the entire area of the owner’s property and not just the affected portion thereof is not without precedent. In NPC vs. Court of Appeals (436 SCRA 195, 201 [August 12, 2001]), the Supreme Court [noted] that “Pobre’s property suffered permanent injury because of the noise, water, air, and land pollution generated by NPC’s geothermal plants[; t]he construction and operation of the geothermal plants drastically changed the topography of the property making it no longer viable as a resort-subdivision[; and t]he chemicals emitted by the geothermal plants damaged the natural resources in the property and endangered the lives of the residents. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that “NPC did not only take the 8,311.60 square meter portion of the property but also the remaining area of the 68,969 square-meter property. NPC had rendered Pobre’s entire property useless as a resort-subdivision. The property has become useful only to NPC. NPC must therefore take Pobre’s entire property and pay for it. x x x<br><br>In the case at bar, it was not disputed that the subject properties are agricultural lands. In order to be useful to its owners, such agricultural lands must be cultivated to yield a harvest of agricultural produce. But when such lands are burdened with an easement even of the non-apparent kind, but which to all intents and purposes restrict, nay, preclude the very activity that would render it useful to its owners because the existence of such easement poses an undeniable danger to the life and limb of the occupants, then such lands cease to be useful to the property owners and useful only to the entity that imposed the easement upon the land. The Honorable Court of Appeals recognized this fact when it declared that:<br><br><blockquote>“At bar, it cannot be gainsaid that the construction of underground pipeline is a simple case of mere passage of gas pipeline. It will surely cause damage and prejudice to the agricultural potentials of appellees’ property. Deep excavation will have to be done whereby plants and trees will be uprooted. A possible leakage could certainly do harm and adversely restrict the agricultural and economic activity of the land. This is not to mention that it will create an environmental health hazard dangerous to the occupant’s life and limb.<br><br>Hence, defendants-appellees are entitled for [sic] just compensation to the full market value of their property not just ten percent of it.<br><br>Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The measure is not the taker’s gain, but the owner’s loss.” x x x<br></blockquote>Thus, the argument of defendant heirs of Santos Comia is well taken that as to them, the entire area of their property, and not just the affected portion thereof, had become useless to them. It is [useful only] to plaintiff NPC. The same holds true for the entire property owned by defendant Felicisimo Tarcelo. Therefore, NPC must pay for the full market value of the entire properties owned by defendant Felicisimo Tarcelo and defendant heirs of Santos Comia.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Omnibus Motion is DENIED.

CV No. 86712 in which just compensation was fixed at P1,000.00 per square meter only for the affected area of 1,595.91 square meters, and not for the whole of respondents’ respective lots. It reiterated that since the trial court’s dispositions were irregular and inconsistent with the Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712, justice dictated that the technical rules on motions should give way to considerations of equity; that in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712, the only question that had to be resolved was whether NPC should pay the full market value of the 1,595.91-square meter affected area or merely a 10% easement fee for the use thereof – and not whether it should pay for the entire 7,015 square meters owned by respondents. Finally, it maintained that the inclusion of the whole property instead of only the affected portions thereof would render the execution process in Civil Case No. 5785 unjust and inequitable.<br><br>On January 20, 2011, the CA rendered the assailed Decision containing the following decretal portion:<br><br><blockquote><i>WHEREFORE</i>, the instant petition for certiorari is <i>DENIED.</i> Accordingly, the assailed Orders of the public respondent Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, in Civil Case No. 5785, STAND.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The CA held that there was nothing in the November 7, 2005 Decision of the Batangas City RTC to indicate that NPC was being ordered to pay just compensation only for the 1,595.91-square meter portion of respondents’ properties; on the contrary, the trial court held that –<br><br><blockquote>Based on the foregoing, <b>the court fixes the just compensation for the subject properties</b> situated in Brgy.

It added that the trial court’s citation of <i>National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> strengthened the view that the trial court intended for respondents to be paid compensation for the whole of their properties, as it was held in said cited case that just compensation should be “neither more nor less than the monetary equivalent of the land;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the trial court’s judgment may be clarified by referring to other portions thereof, and not by reading them separately from the whole decision – in other words, the “decision should be taken as a whole and considered in its entirety to get the true meaning and intent of any particular portion thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The CA noted that even in the June 26, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R.

In the decretal portion of its Decision, it thus held as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, plaintiff National Power Corporation is ordered to pay the defendants the amount of P1,000.00 per square meter.<br><br>Upon payment of just compensation to the defendants, subject to the deductions of the sums due the Government for unpaid real estate taxes and other imposts, <b>the plaintiff shall have a lawful <u>right to enter, take possession and acquire</u> easement of right-of-way over <u>the portions of the properties</u></b> together with the improvements sought to be expropriated for the purpose stated, free from any and all liens and encumbrances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The CA therefore patently erred in declaring in its assailed Decision that there is nothing in the November 7, 2005 Decision of the Batangas City RTC to indicate that NPC was being ordered to pay just compensation only for the 1,595.91-square meter portion of respondents’ properties. On the contrary, the evidence is quite clear that NPC has been made liable precisely to such extent only, and not more.<br><br>The Court likewise observes that contrary to the CA’s appreciation, the June 26, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712 did not particularly declare that NPC should pay for the <b>entire </b>area of respondents’ properties. It merely stated that respondents should be compensated for the full and fair market value of their property and not merely paid a 10% easement fee therefor; it did not resolve the issue of whether NPC should pay just compensation for the entire area of 7,015 square meters. It simply said that NPC should pay for the full per-square meter value of the affected portions, and not just a fraction thereof (or 10%). There could be no other interpretation of the June 26, 2007 pronouncement in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712 when the CA stated therein that –<br><br><blockquote>At bar, it cannot be gainsaid that the construction of underground pipeline is a simple case of mere passage of gas pipeline. It will surely cause damage and prejudice to the agricultural potentials of appellees’ property. Deep excavation will have to be done whereby plants and trees will be uprooted. A possible leakage could certainly do harm and adversely restrict the agricultural and economic activity of the land. This is not to mention that it will create an environmental health hazard dangerous to the occupant’s life and limb.<br><br>Hence, <u>defendants-appellees are entitled for (sic) just compensation to (sic) the <i><b>full </b></i>market value of their property not just ten percent (10%) of it</u>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Taking all the consideration [sic] of the subject property, <u>Commissioners Taupa and Nuique placed the value of the property at P475.00 per square meter</u> based on the Land Bank valuation and Cuervo Appraisers, Inc. and the Provincial/City Appraisal Committees of Batangas, Laguna and Lipa City, while <u>Commissioner Atienza valued the property at P1,120 per square meter</u>, based on the average value per findings of the Committee composed of the City Assessor, City Treasurer, City Engineer under Resolution No. 9-99 dated June 18, 1999 that the subject property will cost P1,000.00 to P1,300.00 per square meter, and the opinion value of her Team’s survey and Report which revealed that the prevailing price of agricultural land in Tabangao-Ambulong, Batangas City is NINE HUNDRED THIRTY PESOS (P930.00) per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>NPC is thus correct in its observation that the issue of whether it should be made to pay for the whole 7,015-square meter area was not at all raised. Besides, in arriving at its judgment, the CA took into full consideration the Commissioners’ Reports, which recommended the payment of just compensation only for the affected portions of respondents’ properties; if it believed otherwise, the appellate court would have so indicated, and it would have taken exception to the said reports and arrived at its own independent consideration of the case.<br><br>It has always been the rule that “[t]he only portion of the decision that may be the subject of execution is that which is ordained or decreed in the dispositive portion. Whatever may be found in the body of the decision can only be considered as part of the reasons or conclusions of the court and serve only as guides to determine the <i>ratio decidendi.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> “[W]here there is a conflict between the dispositive portion of the decision and the body thereof, the dispositive portion controls irrespective of what appears in the body of the decision. While the body of the decision, order or resolution might create some ambiguity in the manner of the court’s reasoning preponderates, it is the dispositive portion thereof that finally invests rights upon the parties, sets conditions for the exercise of those rights, and imposes corresponding duties or obligation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, with the decretal portion of the trial court’s November 7, 2005 Decision particularly stating that NPC shall have the lawful right to enter, take possession and acquire easement of right-of-way over the affected portions of respondents’ properties upon the payment of just compensation, any order executing the trial court’s Decision should be based on such dispositive portion. “An order of execution is based on the disposition, not on the body, of the decision.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Execution must therefore conform to that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Since there is a disparity between the dispositive portion of the trial court’s November 7, 2005 Decision as affirmed with modification by the final and executory June 26, 2007 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712 – which decreed that respondents be paid just compensation only for the affected portions of their properties, totaling <b>1,595.91 square meters</b> – and the Notice of Garnishment – for the satisfaction of the amount of P5,594,462.50 representing just compensation for the <b>whole 7,015 square meters</b> – the latter must be declared null and void.<br><br><blockquote>It is a settled general principle that a writ of execution must conform substantially to every essential particular of the judgment promulgated. Execution not in harmony with the judgment is bereft of validity. It must conform, more particularly, to that ordained or decreed in the dispositive portion of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>In the same manner, the Batangas City RTC’s September 24, 2009 and October 23, 2009 Orders are hereby declared null and void in regard only to the Notice of Garnishment, as it countermands the decretal portion of the November 7, 2005 Decision and completely changes the tenor thereof by holding NPC liable to pay for the value of the whole of respondents’ properties; all proceedings held for the purpose of amending or altering the dispositive portion of the trial court’s November 7, 2005 Decision, as affirmed with modification by the CA’s final and executory June 26, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 86712, are null and void for lack of jurisdiction. This is exactly what the Court said in one case:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, petitioner is correct in saying that impleading her for the purpose of execution is tantamount to modifying a decision that had long become final and executory. The <i>fallo</i> of the 1997 Decision by the NLRC only held “respondents Pro Agency Manila Inc., and Abdul Rahman Al Mahwes to jointly and severally pay complainants x x x.” By holding her liable despite not being ordained as such by the decision, both the CA and NLRC violated the doctrine on immutability of judgments.<br><br>In <i>PH Credit Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>, we stressed that “respondent’s [petitioner’s] obligation is based on the judgment rendered by the trial court. The dispositive portion or the fallo is its decisive resolution and is thus the subject of execution. x x x. Hence the execution must conform with that which is ordained or decreed in the dispositive portion of the decision.”<br><br>In <i>INIMACO v. NLRC</i>, we also held thus:<br><blockquote>None of the parties in the case before the Labor Arbiter appealed the Decision dated March 10, 1987, hence the same became final and executory. It was, therefore, removed from the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter or the NLRC to further alter or amend it. <b>Thus, the proceedings held for the purpose of amending or altering the dispositive portion of the said decision are null and void for lack of jurisdiction</b>. Also, the Alias Writ of Execution is null and void because it varied the tenor of the judgment in that it sought to enforce the final judgment against ‘‘Antonio Gonzales/Industrial Management Development Corp. (INIMACO) and/or Filipinas Carbon and Mining Corp. and Gerardo Sicat, which makes the liability solidary.</blockquote><b>In other words, “[o]nce a decision or order becomes final and executory, it is removed from the power or jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to further alter or amend it. It thereby becomes immutable and unalterable and any amendment or alteration which substantially affects a final and executory judgment is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, including the entire proceedings held for that purpose. An order of execution which varies the tenor of the judgment or exceeds the terms thereof is a nullity.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The failure of NPC to include a notice of hearing in its Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court’s September 24, 2009 Order has been rendered irrelevant considering our pronouncement that the said Order is null and void on the matter covering the Notice of Garnishment. “A void judgment or order has no legal and binding effect, force or efficacy for any purpose. In contemplation of law, it is non-existent. Such judgment or order may be resisted in any action or proceeding whenever it is involved. It is not even necessary to take any steps to vacate or avoid a void judgment or final order; it may simply be ignored.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
