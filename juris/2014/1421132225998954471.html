The Ombudsman held that their report was necessary for the issuance of a certification for the disbursement of funds therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Ombudsman cleared respondents from liability on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, reasoning that “mere signature on a voucher or certification is not enough” to establish any conspiracy among them which would warrant their conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Relying on the doctrine enunciated in the case of <i>Arias v.

Thus, the Court is constrained to confine its analysis only to what has been alleged therein.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br><b><u><center>I.<br></center></u></b><br>The present Constitution and RA 6770,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> otherwise known as the “Ombudsman Act of 1989,” have endowed the Office of the Ombudsman with wide latitude, in the exercise of its investigatory and prosecutorial powers, to pass upon criminal complaints involving public officials and employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Hence, as a general rule, the Court does not interfere with the Ombudsman’s findings and respects the initiative and independence inherent in its office, which “beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The foregoing principle does not, however, apply when the Ombudsman’s ruling is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, subjecting the same to <i>certiorari </i>correction. Among other instances, the Ombudsman may be deemed to have gravely abused its discretion when it unjustifiably fails to take essential facts and evidence into consideration in the determination of probable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It may also be committed when the Ombudsman patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence. Indeed, any decision, order or resolution of a tribunal tantamount to overruling a judicial pronouncement of the highest Court is unmistakably grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Legally classified, such misdeeds fall squarely within the concept of grave abuse of discretion which is defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment on the part of the public officer concerned, which is equivalent to an excess or lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Applying these principles to this case, the Court finds that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when it disregarded the CoA Memo and patently misapplied existing jurisprudence – particularly, the Arias case – in ruling that there was no probable cause <b>for the crime of Violation of Section 3 (e),</b> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <b>RA 3019</b>. Accordingly, respondents should be indicted for such. However, the same does not hold true for the other crimes of Technical Malversation and Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents for reasons that will be hereinafter discussed.<br><br><center><b><u>II.</u></b><br></center><br>Probable cause, for the purpose of filing a criminal information, exists when the facts are sufficient to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof.&nbsp; To engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, and to determine if the suspect is probably guilty of the same, the elements of the crime charged should, in all reasonable likelihood, be present. This is based on the principle that every crime is defined by its elements, without which there should be, at the most, no criminal offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The elements of the crime of Violation of Section 3 (e),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> RA 3019 are as follows: (<i><b><u>a</u></b></i>) the offender must be a p<b>ublic officer discharging administrative</b>, judicial, or official <b>functions;</b> (<i><u><b>b</b></u></i>) he must have acted with <b>manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence;</b> and (<b><i><u>c</u></i></b>) his action caused <b>any undue injury to any party</b>, including the government, or <b>gave any private party unwarranted benefits</b>, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Considering the findings contained in the CoA Memo, which the Ombudsman, however, disregarded, it is quite clear that all the foregoing elements are, in all reasonable likelihood, present with respect to respondents’ participation in this case.<br><br>Respondents, who were all public officers at the time of the alleged commission of the crime – particularly, as provincial officials of Bataan discharging administrative functions (<b><u>first element</u></b>) – apparently acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith – or, at the very least, gross inexcusable negligence – when they issued the pertinent documents and certifications that led to the diversion of public funds to a project that had no proper allotment, i.e., the mini-theater project (<b><u>second element</u></b>). The absence of such allotment not only renders invalid the release of funds therefor but also taints the legality of the project’s appropriation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> as well as the Province’s contract with V.F. Construction. As the CoA Memo pertinently explains:<br><br><blockquote>Four contracted infrastructure projects and a financial assistance extended to [the] barangay by your administration amounting to P5,404,000 and P100,000, respectively, were found devoid of valid appropriations. Of the amounts, P4,992,750 was already paid while the remaining balance of P511,250 was lodged to Accounts Payable. <b><u>The non-existence of valid appropriations rendered the contracts void and the payments illegal.</u></b><br><br>The <b>said projects were among the 19 provided with appropriations totalling P14,005,000</b> in the [P]rovince’s 2003 Closing Budgets embodied under Ordinance No. A-6 and approved by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in its Resolution No. 54 on February 23, 2004.<br><br>The validity of the appropriations and the subsequent transactions were not considered in audit due to lack of legal basis, to wit:<br><br>a. <b><u>No sources of funds for the P14.005M appropriation rendering it invalid</u></b><br><br>The P43,487,527.16 computed source/available balance for the P14,005,000 appropriation was already used as the beginning available balance in the computation of the Estimated Revenues and Receipts considered in the earlier approved CY 2004 Annual General Fund Budget contained in Appropriation Ordinance No. 2 and passed under S.P. Resolution No. 6 on January 12, 2004 (Please see Annex A [with the heading “<b>Supplemental</b> Appropriations of P14,005,000. CY 2003 Closing Budget]). <b>Sec. 321 of RA 7160 provides, among others, that:</b><br><br><b><i><u>“No ordinance providing for a supplemental budget shall be enacted, except when supported by funds actually available as certified by the local treasurer or by new revenue sources.”</u></i></b><br><br>b. <b><u>Non-release of allotments for the P14.005 M appropriation</u></b><br><br>Allotment is the <b>authorization</b> issued by the Local Chief Executive (LCE) to a department/office of the LGU, which <b>allows it to incur obligations</b>, for specified amounts, within the appropriation ordinance. (<b>Sec. 08, Manual on the NGAS for LGUs, Volume I</b>).<br><br>As verified from the Accounting and Budget offices, <b><u>no allotments were released for the projects, hence the incurrence of the obligations were not authorized</u></b>. In spite of this, the amount of P14,005,000 was taken up among the continuing appropriations/allotments in CY 2004. Also, Allotment and Obligation Slips (ALOBS) which serve as the LGU commitments to pay were certified for eight of the projects in the amount of P7,816,000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>To be clear, the nineteen (19) projects mentioned in the CoA Memo were listed under “Annex B”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> thereof entitled “Schedule of Contracted Projects and Financial Assistance Out of Invalid Appropriations, CY 2004,” all of which had <b>no allotments</b> issued. <b>First and foremost on the list is the construction of the mini-theater project</b>. A similar CoA memorandum, AOM No. 2004-26<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated September 6, 2004, which was also ignored by the Ombudsman, contains the same audit results with regard to the <b>lack of a valid allotment</b> for the project. Thus, absent compliance with this basic requirement, the authorizations made by respondents in relation to the project were therefore <i>prima facie</i> tainted with illegality, amounting to either manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or, at the very least, to gross inexcusable negligence. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that respondents – being the Province’s accountable officers at that time – had knowledge of the procedure on allotments and appropriations. Knowledge of basic procedure is part and parcel of respondents’ shared fiscal responsibility under Section 305 (l) of RA 7160, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Section 305. <i>Fundamental Principles</i>. - The financial affairs, transactions, and operations of local government units shall be governed by the following fundamental principles:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(l) Fiscal responsibility shall be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the local government units; x x x.</blockquote><br>Hence, unless the CoA’s findings are substantially rebutted, the allotment’s absence should have roused respondents’ suspicions, as regards the project’s legality, and, in consequence, prevented them from approving the disbursements therefor. This is especially true for Roman, who, as the Local Chief Executive of the Province at that time, was primarily charged with the issuance of allotments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> As such, he was in the position to know if the allotment requirement had, in the first place, been complied with, given that it was a pre-requisite before the project could have been contracted.<br><br>In addition, the Court observes the same degree of negligence on the part of respondents in seemingly attesting to the project’s 100% completion when such was not the case. The erroneous certification rendered the disbursements made by the Province suspect as V.F. Construction had still to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Province and yet were able to receive full payment.<br><br>Considering that the illegal diversion of public funds for the mini-theater project would undermine the execution of other projects legitimately supported by proper allotments, it is quite obvious that undue injury on the part of the Province and its residents would be caused. Likewise, considering that V.F. Construction had already received full payment for a project that had yet to be completed, it also appears that a private party was given unwarranted benefits by respondents in the discharge of their functions (<b><u>third element</u></b>).<br><br>Thus, with the elements of the crime of Violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019 herein ostensibly present, the Court hereby holds that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed said charge against respondents.<br><br>That the Ombudsman had not, in any manner, mentioned the two (2) CoA AOMs,<i> i.e.,</i> AOM Nos. 2005-004-100 (2004) (<i>i.e.,</i> the CoA Memo) and 2004-26, in its ruling leads the Court to believe that it deliberately failed to consider the same. As the Court sees it, these are significant pieces of evidence which should not have been casually ignored. This stems from a becoming respect which all government agencies should accord to the CoA’s findings. Verily, being the constitutionally-mandated audit arm of the government, the CoA is vested with broad powers over all accounts pertaining to government revenue and expenditures and the uses of public funds and property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As held in the case of <i>Belgica v. Ochoa, Jr.:</i> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[I]t is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created, such as the CoA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. It is only when the CoA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></blockquote><br>With the weight accorded to the CoA’s findings, the Ombudsman should have, at the very least, explained its reasons as to why the two (2) CoA AOMs had no bearing in this case. However, no such explanation was herein made. As such, the Court holds that the Ombudsman committed&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion in this respect.<br><br>Palpable too is the Ombudsman’s grave abuse of discretion by its misplaced reliance on the <i>Arias</i> doctrine.<br><br>The factual circumstances which led to the Court’s ruling in Arias were such that there was nothing else in the documents presented before the head of office therein that would have required the detailed examination of each paper or document, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed records, inspected documents, received procedures, and questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly-sized office could personally do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the impossible. All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the auditor is not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of the bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, inquire whether the correct amount of food was served, and otherwise personally look into the reimbursement voucher’s accuracy, propriety, and sufficiency. <b>There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail</b>. Any executive head of even small government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Simply put, when a matter is irregular on the document’s face, so much so that a detailed examination becomes warranted, the <i>Arias</i> doctrine is unavailing.<br><br>Here, it cannot be denied that the absence of an allotment for the project already rendered all related documents/transactions irregular on their face. By this fact alone, respondents ought to have known that something was amiss. To echo the CoA Memo, Section 321 of RA 7160 provides, among others, that “[n]o ordinance providing for a <b>supplemental budget </b>shall be enacted, except when supported by <b>funds actually available</b> as certified by the local treasurer or by new revenue sources.” Section 8, Chapter 3 of the Manual on the NGAS for LGUs, Volume I further defines an “[a]llotment [as] the <b>authorization</b> issued by the Local Chief Executive (LCE) to a department/office of the LGU, which<b> allows it to incur obligations,</b> for specified amounts, within the appropriation ordinance.” Since the mini-theater project was an appropriation made in a supplemental budget, then there should have been funds certified to be actually available for such appropriation to even be made. However, as the CoA found, no such funds were certified as available. Likewise, the project had no supporting allotment, which means that there was basically no authority for the provincial officials, <i>i.e., </i>respondents, to even incur the obligations under the V.F. Construction contract, much more for them to disburse the funds in connection therewith. Section 344 of RA 7160 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 344. <i>Certification on, and Approval of, Vouchers</i>. - No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. x x x.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>With these apparent irregularities, it is quite perplexing how the Ombudsman could have applied the <i>Arias</i> doctrine in support of its ruling, especially with respect to the charge of Violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019. Thus, by patently misapplying existing jurisprudence, the Court finds that the Ombudsman also committed a grave abuse of discretion on this score and its ruling, in these aspects, must be reversed and set aside. In fine, the Ombudsman is ordered to file in the proper court the necessary Information against respondents for violating Section 3 (e), RA 3019.<br><br>That being said, the Court proceeds to discuss the other charges contained in Garcia’s petition.<br><br><center><b><u>III.</u></b></center><br>As earlier stated, Garcia, in his petition, also seeks that respondents be indicted for the crimes of <b>Technical Malversation, and Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents</b>. However, unlike the charge for the crime of Violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019, the Court is unable to render the same disposition.<br><br>First, while Garcia insists upon the sufficiency of his evidence to indict respondents for Technical Malversation, the Court cannot pass upon this issue, considering that the Complaint-Affidavit filed before the Ombudsman originally charged respondents not with Technical Malversation under Article 220<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the RPC, but with Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents, defined and penalized under Article 217,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> in relation to Article 171<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the RPC, a complex crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> It bears stressing that the elements of Malversation of Public Funds are distinctly different from those of Technical Malversation. In the crime of <b>Malversation of Public Funds</b>, the offender misappropriates public funds for his own <b><u>personal use</u></b> or allows any other person to take such public funds for the latter’s <b><u>personal use</u></b>. On the other hand, in <b>Technical Malversation,</b> the public officer applies public funds under his administration <b><u>not for his or another’s personal use</u>, but to a <u>public use</u> other than that for which the fund was appropriated by law or ordinance.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Technical Malversation does not include, or is not necessarily included in the crime of Malversation of Public Funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Since the acts supposedly committed by respondents constituting the crime of Technical Malversation were not alleged in the Complaint-Affidavit and the crime for which respondents raised their respective defenses was not Technical Malversation, the petition must perforce be denied on this score. Otherwise, the Court would be sanctioning a violation of respondents’ constitutionally-guaranteed right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them, so as to deny them a reasonable opportunity to suitably prepare their defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Finally, with respect to the charge of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents, the Court observes that there lies no evidence which would give a <i>prima facie </i>indication that the funds disbursed for the project were misappropriated for any personal use. The CoA Memo shows that the Province’s funds were used for a public purpose, i.e., the mini-theater project, albeit without any allotment issued therefor. Garcia also fails to convince the Court that the Province’s funds were diverted to some personal purpose. Failing in which, the Court cannot pronounce that the Ombudsman committed a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing such charge.<br><br>As it stands, Garcia’s petition is granted only in part as respondents should be indicted for the lone crime of Violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019 for the reasons above-discussed. It must, however, be clarified that the dismissal of the charge of Technical Malversation is without prejudice to its proper re-filing unless barred by prescription, considering that such dismissal was based merely on procedural grounds and is not, in any way, tantamount to an acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. The Resolution dated May 30, 2006 and the Order dated October 9, 2009 of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-L-C-05-0084-A, insofar as they dismissed the criminal charge against respondents Leonardo B. Roman, Romeo L. Mendiola, Pastor P. Vichuaco, Aurora J. Tiambeng, and Numeriano G. Medina (respondents), for Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents, are <b>AFFIRMED</b>. However, the said Resolution and Order, insofar as they dismissed the criminal charge against respondents for violation of Section 3 (e), Republic Act No. (RA) 3019 or the “Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act” are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The Ombudsman is <b>ORDERED</b> to file in the proper court the necessary Information for violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019 against respondents. Finally, for reasons herein discussed, the criminal charge against respondents for Technical Malversation is <b>DISMISSED</b>, without prejudice to its proper re-filing.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Leonardo-De Castro</i>, and <i>Perez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1870 dated November 4, 2014.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 3-34.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 38-51.
