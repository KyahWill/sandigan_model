Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc. (Aichi)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the CIR contended that since the judicial claim for refund/credit in Case No. 8082 was filed only 107 days from the filing of the administrative claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> it should be dismissed for being prematurely filed for petitioner’s failure to comply with the 120-day period prescribed under Section 112 (D) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CTA Division Ruling</b></center><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated January 20, 2011, the CTA Division granted the CIR’s motion to dismiss, and accordingly, dismissed CTA Case No. 8082 for being prematurely filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It agreed with the CIR’s contention and held that pursuant to jurisprudence laid down in Aichi, the expiration of the 120-day period is crucial before a taxpayer may file a judicial claim for refund before the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The CTA Division then concluded that petitioner’s premature filing of its judicial claim for refund/credit warrants a dismissal inasmuch as the CTA acquired no jurisdiction over the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated March 15, 2011.

Also citing <i>Aichi</i>, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> held that compliance with the 120-day period stated in Section 112 (D) of the NIRC is a mandatory and judicial requisite in the filing of a judicial claim for refund/credit of input VAT before the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Hence, petitioner’s non-compliance therewith is fatal to its refund/credit claim in Case No. 8082, and as such, the CTA Division correctly dismissed the same on the ground of prematurity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated November 29, 2012, hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CTA <i>En Banc </i>correctly affirmed the CTA Division’s dismissal of petitioner’s judicial claim for refund/credit of input VAT in CTA Case No. 8082 for being prematurely filed.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 112 of the NIRC, as amended by RA 9337,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. –<br><br>(A) <i>Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales</i>. – any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <b><u>within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made</u></b>, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(C)<i> Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made</i>. – In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b><u>within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents</u></b> in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.<br><br>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, <b><u>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.</u></b><br><br>x x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In the <i>Aichi</i> case cited by both the CTA Division and the CTA<i> En Banc</i>, the Court held that the observance of the 120-day period is a mandatory and jurisdictional requisite to the filing of a judicial claim for refund/credit of input VAT before the CTA. Consequently, its non-observance would lead to the dismissal of the judicial claim on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. <i>Aichi </i>also clarified that the two (2)-year prescriptive period applies only to administrative claims and not to judicial claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Succinctly put, once the administrative claim is filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period, the claimant must wait for the 120-day period to end and, thereafter, he is given a 30-day period to file his judicial claim before the CTA, even if said 120-day and 30-day periods would exceed the aforementioned two (2)-year prescriptive period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>However, in <i>CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation (San Roque)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court recognized an exception to the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period. It ruled that BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 dated December 10, 2003 provided a valid claim for equitable estoppel under Section 246<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the NIRC. In essence, the aforesaid BIR Ruling stated that the “taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Recently, in <i>Taganito Mining Corporation v. CIR</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court reconciled the pronouncements in the <i>Aichi</i> and <i>San Roque </i>cases in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>Reconciling the pronouncements in the Aichi and San Roque cases, the rule must therefore be that <b><u>during the period December 10, 2003</u></b> (when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued) <b><u>to October 6, 2010</u></b> (when the Aichi case was promulgated), <b><u>taxpayers-claimants need not observe the 120-day period</u></b> before it could file a judicial claim for refund of excess input VAT before the CTA. <b><u>Before and after the aforementioned period (i.e., December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010), the observance of the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional to the filing of such claim.</u></b> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, records disclose that petitioner filed its administrative and judicial claims for refund/credit of its input VAT in CTA Case No. 8082 on December 28, 2009 and March 30, 2010, respectively, or during the period when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was in place, i.e., from December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010. As such, it need not wait for the expiration of the 120-day period before filing its judicial claim before the CTA, and hence, is deemed timely filed. In view of the foregoing, both the CTA Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred in dismissing outright petitioner’s claim on the ground of prematurity.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Court is not inclined to grant outright petitioner’s claim for refund/credit of input VAT in CTA Case No. 8082 in the amount of ?1,624,603.33 representing unutilized input VAT for the first quarter of 2008. This is because the determination of petitioner’s entitlement to such claim would necessarily involve questions of fact, which are not reviewable and cannot be passed upon by the Court in the exercise of its power of review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In addition, the CTA Division, as affirmed by the CTA <i>En Banc,</i> dismissed the judicial claim on a preliminary procedural technicality. Hence, the Court deems it prudent to remand the case to the CTA Division for resolution of the instant case on the merits.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated July 5, 2012 and the Resolution dated November 29, 2012 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) <i>En Banc</i> in CTA EB Case No. 750 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
