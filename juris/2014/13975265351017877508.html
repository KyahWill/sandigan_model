Elena Santos; that petitioners’ liability has not been established since no delivery receipts, invoices and statements of account were presented during trial to show delivery of paint and construction materials; that respondent was unable to present the original of the Acknowledgment, which puts the Decision of the trial court – declaring that the original thereof was presented and authenticated by respondent – in serious doubt; and that there is no evidentiary basis to hold petitioners liable for P1,456,000.00.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated August 8, 2006, the trial court denied petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b><i>The Assailed Court of Appeals Decision</i></b><br><br>Petitioners interposed an appeal with the CA.&nbsp; Docketed as CA-G.R.

And with this admission of liability, the Acknowledgment which was duly authenticated and formally offered in evidence was sufficient to establish their liability, and no further proof in the form of receipts and statements of account was required.&nbsp; The appellate court stated that Fernando’s categorical admission of liability as contained in the Acknowledgment as well as petitioners’ admissions in their Answer sufficed.&nbsp; It held further that respondent was competent to testify on the Acknowledgment as she was a signatory therein.<br><br>The CA likewise held that since they failed to oppose the Acknowledgment in the court below as a result of their having waived their right to present evidence, petitioners cannot now belatedly question the document.&nbsp; Moreover, their claim of a lesser liability in the amount of P600,000.00 remained to be plain unsubstantiated allegations as a result of their failure to refute respondent’s evidence and present their own.<br><br>Finally, the CA held that petitioners were not deprived of due process during trial; on the contrary, they were afforded sufficient opportunity to participate in the proceedings by way of constant strict reminders by the court and several continuances, but they failed to take part in the proceedings.<br><br>Petitioners moved to reconsider, but in the second assailed May 23, 2008 disposition, the appellate court stood its ground.&nbsp; Thus, the instant Petition seeking a reversal of the assailed CA dispositions and the dismissal of the Complaint in Civil Case No. 9954.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br><br>Petitioners now raise the following issues for the Court’s resolution:<br><br><blockquote>IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, THE ARGUMENT IN PETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION THAT RESPONDENT FAILED TO PRODUCE AND PRESENT THE ORIGINAL COPY OF THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT RECEIPT EXHIBIT “A” WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF THE BEST EVIDENCE RULE, WAS NOT ACTED UPON AND CONSIDERED “REHASH”.<br><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> FOUND THE NEED FOR RECEIPTS OF STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT TO BE PRESENTED REFLECTING THE ACTUAL OBLIGATION OF PETITIONERS IN ITS DECISION DATED JULY 20, 2004 AND THUS SET ASIDE AND REMANDED TO THE COURT A QUO THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS BUT THE SAME WAS COUNTERMANDED IN THE ASSAILED DECISION.<br><br>CONTRARY TO THE FINDINGS OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, PETITIONERS DID NOT ADMIT IN THEIR ANSWER THAT THEY ARE INDEBTED TO RESPONDENT IN THE AMOUNT OF P1,456,000.00.<br><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS FAILED TO RULE ON THE ABSENCE OF ANY RECORD OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE HELD ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2005.<br><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS SHOULD HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED TACKLING THE ISSUE OF PRESUMPTIONS, INFERENCES, AND MISCONCEPTION OF FACTS USED BY THE COURT A QUO [IN ARRIVING AT] ITS FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS.<br><br>PETITIONERS WERE NOT DULY NOTIFIED OF THE NOVEMBER 8, 2005 HEARING IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 4 AND 5 [OF RULE 15] OF THE RULES OF COURT WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS FAILED TO RULE.<br><br>PETITIONERS HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR DAY IN COURT WHEN THEY WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND THE CASE SUBMITTED FOR DECISION, THE CONTRARY RULING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS NOTWITHSTANDING.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioners’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners, in their Petition and Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> assert that during the proceedings below, only a photocopy of the Acknowledgment was presented and identified by respondent even as the original was not lost, the same having been made part of the record of the case when respondent’s evidence was first presented ex parte.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; For this reason, they argue that the photocopy presented and offered in evidence is inadmissible and could not be the basis for arriving at a finding of liability on their part, pursuant to the best evidence rule.<br><br>Petitioners further point out that in the first CA disposition, specifically in CA-G.R. CV No. 71187, the appellate court’s Thirteenth Division ruled that in establishing petitioners’ pecuniary liability, receipts and statements of account reflecting the actual amount of their obligation and interest thereon were necessary.&nbsp; Later on, in CA-G.R. CV No. 87935, the same division of the CA made a complete turnaround, declaring that receipts and statements of account were no longer necessary.&nbsp; For petitioners, this retraction by the CA was irregular.<br><br>Petitioners add that the pre-trial conference in Civil Case No. 9954 is a sham, as there are no records to show that it was ever conducted.&nbsp; Consequently, this irregularity renders the proceedings below – including the assailed judgment – null and void.&nbsp; They add that the trial court irregularly proceeded to receive respondent’s evidence <i>ex parte</i> on November 8, 2005 despite lack of notice of hearing.<br><br>Next, petitioners point out inconsistencies and erroneous assumptions made by the appellate court which formed the basis of its decision, such as Ma. Elena’s undue inclusion in the judgment of liability, when it is evident from the Acknowledgment that it was executed and signed by Fernando alone.<br><br>Finally, petitioners submit that in denying a continuance of the March 20, 2006 hearing and declaring them to have waived their right to present evidence, the trial court deprived them of their day in court.<br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> respondent counters that the Petition presents no valid cause for the Court’s exercise of its power of review; that the issues raised therein have been duly taken up and conclusively resolved by the CA; that with the finality of the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 93889, petitioners may no longer raise any issue pertaining to the Acknowledgment, the genuineness and due execution of which they are considered to have admitted; and that with the resolution by the CA of the issues revived in the Petition, petitioners are guilty of forum shopping.<br><br>Respondent adds that petitioners are bound by the proceedings taken during the pre-trial conference, and may not pretend to be ignorant of the hearing dates agreed upon and set by the trial court.&nbsp; Respondent argues that petitioners may not claim to be oblivious of the pre-trial conference itself, since their representative was present all throughout the proceedings, and a pre-trial order was issued thereafter which contained the matters taken up during pre-trial and the hearing dates scheduled by the court.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court denies the Petition.<br><br>Respondent’s failure to present the original copy of the Acknowledgment during the taking of her testimony for the second time, and the presentation of a mere photocopy thereof at said hearing, does not materially affect the outcome of the case.&nbsp; It was a mere procedural inadvertence that could have been cured and did not affect petitioners’ cause in any manner.&nbsp; As conceded by them and as held by the CA, the original exists and was made part of the records of the case when respondent’s evidence was first taken.&nbsp; Though respondent now claims that she had lost the original, the CA proclaimed that the document resides in the record.&nbsp; This would explain then why respondent cannot find it in her possession; it is with the court as an exhibit.&nbsp; Besides, it evidently appears that there is no question raised on the authenticity and contents of the photocopy that was presented and identified in court; petitioners merely insist that the photocopy is inadmissible as a result of respondent’s failure to present the original, which they nevertheless admit to exist and is found and included in the record of the case.<br><br>While it is a basic rule of evidence that the original copy prevails over a mere photocopy,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> there is no harm if in a case, both the original and a photocopy thereof are authenticated, identified and formally offered in evidence by the party proponent.<br><br>More to the point is the fact that petitioners failed to deny specifically under oath the genuineness and due execution of the Acknowledgment in their Answer.&nbsp; The effect of this is that the genuineness and due execution of the Acknowledgment is deemed admitted.&nbsp; “By the admission of the genuineness and due execution [of such document] is meant that the party whose signature it bears admits that he signed it or that it was signed by another for him with his authority; that at the time it was signed it was in words and figures exactly as set out in the pleading of the party relying upon it; that the document was delivered; and that any formal requisites required by law, such as a seal, an acknowledgment, or revenue stamp, which it lacks, are waived by him.&nbsp; Hence, such defenses as that the signature is a forgery x x x; or that it was unauthorized x x x; or that the party charged signed the instrument in some other capacity than that alleged in the pleading setting it out x x x; or that it was never delivered x x x, are cut off by the admission of its genuineness and due execution.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>“There is no need for proof of execution and authenticity with respect to documents the genuineness and due execution of which are admitted by the adverse party.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; With the consequent admission engendered by petitioners’ failure to properly deny the Acknowledgment in their Answer, coupled with its proper authentication, identification and offer by the respondent, not to mention petitioners’ admissions in paragraphs 4 to 6 of their Answer that they are indeed indebted to respondent, the Court believes that judgment may be had solely on the document, and there is no need to present receipts and other documents to prove the claimed indebtedness. The Acknowledgment, just as an ordinary acknowledgment receipt, is “valid and binding between the parties who executed it, as a document evidencing the loan agreement they had entered into.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The absence of rebutting evidence occasioned by petitioners’ waiver of their right to present evidence renders the Acknowledgment as the best evidence of the transactions between the parties and the consequential indebtedness incurred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, the effect of the admission is such that “a <i>prima facie</i> case is made for the plaintiff which dispenses with the necessity of evidence on his part and entitles him to a judgment on the pleadings unless a special defense of new matter, such as payment, is interposed by the defendant.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>However, as correctly argued by petitioners, only Fernando may be held liable for the judgment amount of P1,456,000.00, since Ma. Elena was not a signatory to the Acknowledgment.&nbsp; She may be held liable only to the extent of P600,000.00, as admitted by her and Fernando in paragraph 5 of their Answer; no case against her may be proved over and beyond such amount, in the absence of her signature and an acknowledgment of liability in the Acknowledgment.&nbsp; The rule that the genuineness and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted, unless the adverse party specifically denies them under oath, applies only to parties to the document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As for petitioners’ claim that in CA-G.R. CV No. 87935, the same division of the CA made a complete turnaround from its original pronouncement in CA-G.R. CV No. 71187 – thus doing away with the requirement of presenting receipts and statements of account which it originally required in the latter case, the Court finds no irregularity in this.&nbsp; The admission of liability resulting from petitioners’ admission of indebtedness in their Answer and other pleadings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> their failure to specifically deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of the Acknowledgment, as well as their waiver of their right to present evidence – all these did away with the necessity of producing receipts and statements of account which would otherwise be required under normal circumstances.<br><br>On the claim that they were denied their day in court, the Court notes that despite reminders and admonitions by the trial court, petitioners caused several continuances of trial, which understandably prompted the trial court to finally deny their March 15, 2006 motion to reset the scheduled March 20 hearing and declare a waiver of their right to present evidence.&nbsp; Thus, as found by the CA,<br><br><blockquote><ul><li>In its September 26, 2005 Pre-Trial Order, the trial court fixed the hearing dates with a firm declaration that the same “shall be strictly followed and all postponements made by the parties shall be deducted from such party’s allotted time to present evidence.</li><li>When plaintiff-appellee finished her presentation of evidence ahead of schedule, the appellants were again advised of their schedule for presentation of evidence – i.e., December 6 and 13, 2005 and January 9 and 23 and February 6, 2006.&nbsp; Despite said schedule, the appellants failed to appear in court.</li><li>On January 9, 2006, the lower court reiterated the scheduled hearing set on January 26, 2006 and included February 20, 2006 as an additional hearing date.</li><li>Instead of presenting their evidence, the appellants filed a Demurrer to Evidence on January 17, 2006 which, however, was denied by the trial court in its Order dated January 26, 2006.</li><li>On February 20, 2006, the trial court again allowed another hearing date – March 20, 2006 – to afford the appellants added opportunity to present their evidence.<br></li></ul>The foregoing clearly show that not only were appellants given an opportunity to be heard, an added mileage in due process was extended to them by the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners submit further that the trial court’s subsequent denial of their motion for continuance of the March 20, 2006 hearing was improper.&nbsp; Yet again, the Court does not subscribe to this view.&nbsp; Petitioners filed their motion to reset the March 20, 2006 previously scheduled hearing, but the trial court did not act on the motion.&nbsp; Instead of attending the March 20, 2006 hearing, petitioners’ counsel proceeded to absent himself and attended the supposed hearing of another case.&nbsp; This was improper.&nbsp; As we have held before,<br><br><blockquote>[A] party moving for postponement should be in court on the day set for trial if the motion is not acted upon favorably before that day. He has no right to rely either on the liberality of the court or on the generosity of the adverse party. x x x<br><br>[A]n attorney retained in a case the trial of which is set for a date on which he knows he cannot appear because of his engagement in another trial set previously on the same date, has no right to presume that the court will necessarily grant him continuance. The most ethical thing for him to do in such a situation is to inform the prospective client of all the facts so that the latter may retain another attorney, If the client, having full knowledge of all the facts, still retain[s] the attorney, he assumes the risk himself and cannot complain of the consequences if the postponement is denied and finds himself without attorney to represent him at the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The grant or denial of a motion for postponement rests on the court’s sound discretion; it is a matter of privilege, not a right. “A movant for postponement should not assume beforehand that his motion will be granted. The grant or denial of a motion for postponement is a matter that is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Indeed, an order declaring a party to have waived the right to present evidence for performing dilatory actions upholds the trial court's duty to ensure that trial proceeds despite the deliberate delay and refusal to proceed on the part of one party.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On the other questions raised by petitioners, specifically that the pre-trial conference is a sham for lack of records of the proceedings, and that the November 8, 2005 hearing where respondent’s evidence was taken ex parte was irregular for lack of a notice of hearing – the Court finds them to be without merit.&nbsp; It is evident that a pre-trial conference was held, and that petitioners’ representative was present therein; moreover, the proceedings were covered by the required pre-trial order, which may itself be considered a record of the pre-trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; In said order, the November 8, 2005 pre-scheduled hearing was particularly specified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, from the very start, petitioners knew of the November 8 hearing; if they failed to attend, no fault may be attributed to the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The September 27, 2007 Decision and May 23, 2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
