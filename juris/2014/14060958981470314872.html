Clearly, the claim of petitioner for the TCC can proceed only upon compliance with the jurisdictional requirement.<br><br>Section 7 of RA No. 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which was thereafter amended by RA No. 9282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> clearly defined the appellate jurisdiction of the CTA:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 7. <i>Jurisdiction.</i></b> - The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided.<br><blockquote>(1) <b>Decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving</b> disputed assessments, <b>refunds of internal revenue taxes</b>, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Relative thereto, Section 11 of the same law prescribes how the said appeal should be taken, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 11. <i>Who may appeal;

The relevant portions of the discussion pertinent to the focal issue in the present case are quoted hereunder as follows:<br><br><blockquote>To repeat, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax refund exemption, is construed strictly against the taxpayer.&nbsp; One of the conditions for a judicial claim of refund or credit under the VAT System is <b>compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods.&nbsp; Thus, strict compliance with the 120+30 day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper, whether before, during, or after the effectivity of the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, except for the period from the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003 to 6 October 2010 when the <i>Aichi</i> doctrine was adopted, which again reinstated the 120+30 day periods as mandatory and jurisdictional</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership v.

The 120-day period may extend beyond the two-year period from the filing of the administrative claim if the claim is filed in the later part of the two-year period.&nbsp; <b>If the 120-day period expires without any decision from the CIR, then the administrative claim may be considered to be denied by inaction.</b><br><br>(3) <b>A judicial claim must be filed with the CTA within 30 days from the receipt of the CIR’s decision denying the administrative claim or from the expiration of the 120-day period without any action from the CIR.</b><br><br>(4) <b>All taxpayers, however, can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on 10 December 2003 up to its reversal by this Court in <i>Aichi</i> on 6 October 2010, as an exception to the mandatory and jurisdictional 120+30 day periods.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Certainly, it is evident from the foregoing jurisprudential pronouncements that a taxpayer-claimant only had a limited period of thirty (30) days from the expiration of the 120-day period of inaction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) to file its judicial claim with the CTA, with the exception of claims made during the effectivity of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 (from 10 December 2003 to 5 October 2010).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp;

Since petitioner’s judicial claim for the aforementioned quarters for taxable year 2002 was filed before the CTA only on 30 March 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which was way beyond the mandatory 120+30 days to seek judicial recourse, such non-compliance with the mandatory period of thirty (30) days is fatal to its refund claim on the ground of prescription.<br><br>Distinctly, in its attempt to justify the timeliness of its judicial claim covering taxable year 2002, petitioner made it appear in its Letter dated 25 March 2004 that there has been an amendment on its administrative claim covering taxable year 2002.&nbsp; It explained:<br><br><blockquote>We wish to make it clear that this letter, insofar as the 2002 claim is concerned, amends the original claim for refund or issuance of TCC filed on February 24, 2003.&nbsp; <b>Please note that the difference between the amount claimed in the original administrative claim filed (P6,751,751.65) and that claimed in this letter (P6,845,224.42) is in view of the fact that the original claim merely took into consideration the amount which, at that time, could be supported by the “Summary Name of Suppliers, Invoices and Official Receipts”. As abovementioned, the amount for 2002 subject of the instant claim is based on the figures reflected in the VAT returns filed for 2002</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>However, we are not persuaded by such allegation considering that while there was a supposed difference in the amounts being claimed for refund in the Letter of Request for VAT Claim dated 24 February 2003 and in the Letter dated 25 March 2004, a scrutiny of the subject letters reveals that both rely on the figures reflected in the VAT returns filed for 2002.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner’s assertion, the Transmittal Receipt attached to the 24 February 2003 Letter visibly shows that it has simultaneously submitted various documents in support of its 2002 claim, including a copy of the VAT return for 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, this Court cannot consider the subsequent Letter dated 25 March 2004 to have amended the previous one covering its refund claim for taxable year 2002.&nbsp; For this reason, failure of petitioner to observe the 30-day period under Section 112 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, through its belated filing of the Petition for Review before the CTA warrants a dismissal with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>On the other hand, this Court has allowed the amendment of petitioner’s refund claim covering taxable year 2003 contained in the 25 March 2004 Letter since there was a statement therein that there were amended quarterly VAT returns filed on 12 March 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Such undisputed factual allegation is considered a valid justification in amending its earlier administrative letter dated 15 March 2004.&nbsp; The aforesaid rationalization is not without any legal basis as can be gleaned from the declaration in the<i> San Roque</i> case, wherein the High Court considered the administrative claims for refund of San Roque properly amended by reason of the amended quarterly VAT returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; As a result, the 120+30 day prescriptive periods to seek judicial recourse for petitioner’s refund claim involving taxable year 2003 shall commence only on 25 March 2004, and not on 15 March 2004.<br><br><i>Parenthetically, even if it is shown that petitioner did not strictly comply with the mandatory 120+30 day prescriptive periods<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under Section 112 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, its administrative claim covering taxable year 2003 falls within the effectivity of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 (10 December 2003 to 5 October 2010), being an exception thereto.&nbsp; Hence, there is no more need for petitioner to wait for the 120-day period to expire before it can file its appropriate judicial claim before the CTA.&nbsp; Accordingly, the CTA indeed acquired jurisdiction over petitioner’s refund claim for taxable year 2003.</i><br><br>It must be emphasized that jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of an action is fundamental for a court to act on a given controversy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and is conferred only by law and not by the consent or waiver upon a court which, otherwise, would have no jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of an action.&nbsp; Lack of jurisdiction of the court over an action or the subject matter of an action cannot be cured by the silence, acquiescence, or even by express consent of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; If the court has no jurisdiction over the nature of an action, its only jurisdiction is to dismiss the case.&nbsp; The court could not decide the case on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Having ruled on the jurisdictional aspect of this case, we next discuss the significance of strict compliance with the invoicing requirements under existing laws and prevailing jurisprudence in order to be entitled to a refund claim of excess and/or unutilized input VAT.<br><br>This is not novel.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the High Court already ruled on the significance of imprinting the word “zero-rated” for zero-rated sales covered by its receipts or invoices, pursuant to Section 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in<i> Panasonic Communications Imaging Corporation of the Philippines v.

It already required the printing of the word “zero-rated” on the invoices covering zero-rated sales</b>.&nbsp; When R.A. 9337 amended the 1997 NIRC on November 1, 2005, it made this particular revenue regulation a part of the tax code.&nbsp; This conversion from regulation to law did not diminish the binding force of such regulation with respect to acts committed prior to the enactment of that law.<br><br>Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 proceeds from the rule-making authority granted to the Secretary of Finance under Section 245 of the 1977 NIRC (Presidential Decree 1158) for the efficient enforcement of the tax code and of course its amendments.&nbsp; The requirement is reasonable and is in accord with the efficient collection of VAT from the covered sales of goods and services.&nbsp; As aptly explained by the CTA’s First Division, <b>the appearance of the word “zero-rated” on the face of invoices covering zero-rated sales prevents buyers from falsely claiming input VAT from their purchases when no VAT was actually paid.&nbsp; If, absent such word, a successful claim for input VAT is made, the government would be refunding money it did not collect.</b><br><br>Further, the printing of the word “zero-rated” on the invoice helps segregate sales that are subject to 10% (now 12%) VAT from those sales that are zero-rated.&nbsp; Unable to submit the proper invoices, petitioner Panasonic has been unable to substantiate its claim for refund.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This Court held that, since the “BIR authority to print” is <i>not</i> one of the items required to be indicated on the invoices or receipts, the BIR erred in denying the claim for refund.&nbsp; Here, however, <b>the ground for denial of petitioner Panasonic’s claim for tax refund—the absence of the word ‘zero-rated’ on its invoices—is one which is specifically and precisely included in the above enumeration.&nbsp; Consequently, the BIR correctly denied Panasonic’s claim for tax refund</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>For emphasis, the settled rule is that absence or non-printing of the word “zero-rated” in petitioner’s invoices is fatal to its claim for the refund and/or tax credit representing its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales.<br><br>Equally essential herein, Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, categorically provides that a VAT-registered entity, like petitioner, shall issue a duly registered VAT invoice or official receipt, which must contain “a statement that the seller is a VAT-registered person.”&nbsp; Therefore, as correctly articulated by the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, compliance with the aforesaid invoicing requirements is mandatory.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>It bears stressing that the law and regulations are explicit in emphasizing strict compliance with the invoicing requirements because for the same transactions the output VAT of the seller becomes the input VAT of the purchaser.&nbsp; Pursuant to <i>Sections 106(D)(1) and 108(C) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended</i>, in relation to <i>Section 110 of the same Code,</i> the output or input tax on the sale or purchase of goods is determined by the total amount indicated in the invoice, while the output or input tax on the sale or purchases of services is determined by the total amount indicated in the official receipt.&nbsp; Since petitioner is engaged in the sale of goods, specifically, canned tuna and canned pet food (<i>Joint Stipulation of Facts and Issues, par. 3</i>), its output tax, if any, will be determined by the total amount indicated in the invoices.&nbsp; <b>Thus, as required by <i>Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended</i>, petitioner’s sales invoices must indicate that it is a VAT-registered person, which in this case was not complied with by petitioner</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>At this juncture, and to settle strictness in compliance, we go to the textbook lesson that if the language of the law is clear, explicit and unequivocal, it admits no room for interpretation but merely application.&nbsp; A statute clear and unambiguous on its face need not be interpreted; stated otherwise, the rule is that only statutes with an ambiguous or doubtful meaning may be the subject of statutory construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The provisions of Sections 113 and 237 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and Section 4.108-1 of RR No. 7-95, are clear in enumerating the invoicing requirements necessary to be shown in order to qualify as duly registered receipts or sales or commercial invoices issued by VAT-registered entities, such as petitioner herein, for the purpose of claiming for refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to any zero-rated or effectively zero-rates sales.&nbsp; Absent compliance, the unavoidable result is immediate denial of the claim.<br><br>By way of reiteration, the CTA has no jurisdiction over petitioner’s judicial appeal covering its refund claim for taxable year 2002 on the ground of prescription, consistent with the ruling in the <i>San Roque</i> case.&nbsp; While as to its refund claim for taxable year 2003, the same shall likewise be denied for failure of petitioner to comply with the mandatory invoicing requirements provided for under Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and Section 4.108-1 of RR No. 7-95.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp;
