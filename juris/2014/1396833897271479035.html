Petitioners claimed, however, that such issuances were made “without [their] knowledge and despite their vehement protest and opposition.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On January 12, 1998, petitioners filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> before the Regional Office of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), docketed as Administrative Case No. A-0604-0014-98, asking for: (<i>a</i>) the resolution of the earlier petition dated March 31, 1980; (<i>b</i>) the exemption of the subject lands from the coverage of the OLT Program; and (<i>c</i>) the affirmation of petitioners’ right to retain seven (7) has. as provided under PD 27, which they requested way back in December 1975, but to no avail. Significantly, petitioners admitted in their petition that the subject sale was not registered and thus, the titles to the subject lands were not transferred to their names. This was supposedly due to the fact that the lands were tenanted, and that the Minister of Agrarian Reform refused to issue the required certification for purposes of registration.<br><br><center><b>The DAR Regional Director Ruling</b></center><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated August 16, 1999, the DAR Regional Director declared that ownership over the subject lands remained with Sps.

Hence, the sale did not bind the tenants concerned, and no retention rights were transferred to petitioners. Accordingly, the DAR Regional Director denied the petitions for exemption and retention, and affirmed the placing of the subject lands under the OLT Program of the government pursuant to PD 27, as well as the issuance of EPs in favor of the tenants.<br><br>Petitioners moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated December 6, 1999, prompting their appeal before the DAR Secretary, docketed as Adm.

However, in line with LOI 474, the DAR Secretary directed the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer to determine if petitioners own other agricultural lands of more than seven (7) has. or lands used for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban purposes from which they derive adequate income to support themselves and their families.<br><br>Some of the tenants and/or their relatives – namely, herein respondents Ma. Luz Choresca Galinato, Ernesto Choresca, Teofilo Amado, Lorna Parian Medianero, Rebecca Porcal and Vivencio Ordoyo (respondents) – filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which was initially denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> but subsequently granted by the DAR Secretary in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated September 25, 2003 (September 25, 2003 Order).<br><br>In granting the motion and reversing his earlier decision, the DAR Secretary held that the tenants must be shown to have acquired actual knowledge of the subject sale prior to October 21, 1972 in order to grant validity thereto. <b>However, it appears from the date of the earliest receipts evidencing the rental payments to petitioners that the tenants knew of the said sale only in 1977.</b> As such, petitioners never became valid owners of the subject lands,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> thus warranting the denial of their petitions for exemption and retention.<br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners elevated the matter to the OP.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the OP</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated December 30, 2003 (December 30, 2003 Decision), the OP affirmed the findings and conclusions of the DAR Secretary which thereby prompted petitioners to file a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> wherein they proffered a new argument, particularly, that when their father, Perfecto Vales (Perfecto), died on September 8, 1985, they acquired ownership of the subject lands by intestate succession, including the right of retention as owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Finding merit in the argument, the OP, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated April 6, 2004 (April 6, 2004 Resolution), reversed its earlier ruling, holding that upon the demise of Perfecto, his heirs, including herein petitioners, became co-owners of the subject lands by intestate succession with the inherent right to apply for exemption/retention. Considering, however, that the subject lands were conjugal in nature, Perfecto’s half of the entire 20.3168 hectare area was transferred by intestacy to petitioners and their mother, giving each heir about 2.5 has., which was within the seven-hectare (7-hectare) retention limit under PD 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Consequently, the OP exempted the <i>pro-indiviso</i> shares of petitioners in the subject lands and ordered the cancellation of the EPs covering the same.<br><br>On respondents’ motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the OP modified its April 6, 2004 Resolution in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated August 19, 2004 (August 19, 2004 Order), declaring that petitioners should be considered as only one landowner with respect to their undivided portions and not as separate landowners pursuant to Article 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of DAR Memorandum dated January 9, 1973 (January 9, 1973 DAR Memorandum). Consequently, it excluded from the coverage of the OLT Program only a 7-hectare portion of the subject lands as petitioners’ collective retention area and maintained the OLT Program coverage of the remaining portion.<br><br>Both petitioners and respondents filed their respective motions for reconsideration which were denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated September 5, 2005. The OP reinstated its initial December 30, 2003 Decision, holding that the non-registration of the subject sale and the tenants’ lack of actual knowledge thereof prior to October 21, 1972 rendered the transfer as invalid and non-binding on third persons. The subject lands, thus, remained under the ownership of Sps. Vales for purposes of determining OLT Program coverage. Considering, however, that Sps. Vales’ aggregate landholding consists of 58.606 has., which exceeded the 24-hectare landholding limit under PD 27, they were therefore disqualified to avail of any retention rights under the said law, without prejudice to the availment of the retention rights granted under the new law, Republic Act No. (RA) 6657,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988.”<br><br>Feeling aggrieved, petitioners filed an appeal before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated July 25, 2007, the CA denied petitioners’ appeal, holding that since their predecessors-in-interest (i.e., Sps. Vales) were not entitled to exemption and retention under PD 27 given that their aggregate landholdings consist of 58.606 has., neither could petitioners avail of said rights under RA 6657. In this relation, the CA noted that while PD 27 allows a covered landowner to retain not more than seven (7) has. of his land, if his aggregate landholdings do not exceed 24 has., on the other hand, under LOI 474, where his aggregate landholdings exceed 24 has., the entire landholding inclusive of the seven (7) has. or less of tenanted rice or corn lands will be covered without any right of retention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Accordingly, the CA pronounced that the new retention rights under RA 6657 are likewise unavailing to petitioners as the same is premised on the existence of such right under PD 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Unperturbed, petitioners moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated September 27, 2007, hence, this petition.<br><br><b><center>The Issues Before the Court</center></b><br>The essential issues in this case are whether or not: (a) the subject lands are exempt from OLT Program coverage; and (b) petitioners are entitled to avail of any retention right under existing agrarian laws.<br><br><b><center>The Court’s Ruling</center></b><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i><b>A. Legal Parameters of Exemption and <br>Retention in Agrarian Reform</b></i><br><br>PD 27, which implemented the OLT Program of the government, covers tenanted rice or corn lands. The requisites for coverage under the OLT Program are the following: (a) the land must be devoted to rice or corn crops; and (b) there must be a system of share-crop or lease-tenancy obtaining therein. If either requisite is absent, a landowner may apply for exemption since the land would not be considered as covered under the OLT Program. Accordingly, <b>a landowner need not apply for <u>retention</u> where his ownership over the entire landholding is intact and undisturbed</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>If the land is covered by the OLT Program, which, hence, renders the right of retention operable, the landowner who cultivates or intends to cultivate an area of his tenanted rice or corn land has the right to retain an area of not more than seven (7) has. thereof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> on the condition that his aggregate landholdings <b>do not exceed 24 has</b>. as of October 21, 1972. <b>Otherwise, his entire landholdings are covered by the OLT Program without him being entitled to any retention right</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Similarly, by virtue of LOI 474, if the landowner, as of October 21 1976, owned <b>less than 24 has</b>. of tenanted rice or corn lands, but additionally owned (<i>a</i>) other agricultural lands of more than 7 has., whether tenanted or not, whether cultivated or not, and regardless of the income derived therefrom, or (<i>b</i>) lands used for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban purposes, from which he derives adequate income to support himself and his family, his entire landholdings shall be similarly placed under OLT Program coverage, <b>without any right of retention.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As stated in DAR Administrative Order No. 4, series of 1991, or the “Supplemental Guidelines Governing the Exercise of Retention Rights by Landowners Under Presidential Decree No. 27,” issued on April 26, 1991:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>B. Policy Statements<br><ol><li>Landowners covered by PD 27 are entitled to retain seven hectares, except those whose entire tenanted rice and corn lands are subject of acquisition and distribution under Operation Land Transfer (OLT). An owner of tenanted rice and corn lands may not retain these lands under the following cases:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>If he, as of 21 October 1972, owned more than 24 hectares of tenanted rice and corn lands;<br><br></li><li>By virtue of LOI 474, if he as of 21 October 1976, owned less than 24 hectares of tenanted rice or corn lands, but additionally owned the following:<br><br>- Other agricultural lands of more than seven hectares, whether tenanted or not, whether cultivated or not, and regardless of the income derived therefrom; or<br><br>- Lands used for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban purposes, from which he derives adequate income to support himself and his family. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</li></ol></li></ol></blockquote><br>Subsequently, or on June 10, 1998, Congress passed RA 6657 which modified the retention limits under PD 27. In particular, Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of RA 6657 states that covered landowners are allowed to retain a portion of their tenanted agricultural land not exceeding an area of five (5) has. and, further thereto, provides that an additional three (3) has. may be awarded to each child of the landowner subject to certain qualifications. While landowners who have not yet exercised their rights of retention under PD 27 are entitled to the new retention rights provided by RA 6657, a landowner who filed an application under RA 6657 shall be subject to the limitations stated under LOI 474 as above stated.<br><br><b><i>B. Propriety of the Denial of<br>the Petition for Exemption</i></b><br><br>Petitioners sought exemption of the subject lands from the OLT Program of the government by claiming ownership thereof on the basis of a sale thereof by the registered owners, i.e., Sps. Vales, executed on March 3, 1972. However, said transaction, in order to be valid and equally deemed as binding against the tenants concerned, should be examined in line with the provisions of the May 7, 1982 DAR Memorandum, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Transfers of ownership of lands covered by a Torrens Certificate of Title duly executed prior to October 21, 1972 <b><u>but not registered with the Register of Deeds concerned before said date</u></b> in accordance with the Land Registration Act (<u>Act No. 496</u>) <b><u>shall not be considered a valid transfer of ownership insofar as the tenant-farmers</u> are concerned and therefore the land shall be placed under [the OLT Program].</b><br><br>Transfer of ownership of unregistered lands (ownership may be evidenced by tax declaration, deeds of conveyance) executed prior to October 21, 1972, whether registered or not with the Register of Deeds concerned pursuant to <u>Act No. 3344</u> may be considered a valid transfer/conveyance as between the parties subject to verification of the due execution of the conveyance/transfer in accordance with the formalities prescribed by law.<br><br>In order that the foregoing transfers of ownership mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs <b><u>may be binding upon the tenants, such tenants should have knowledge of such transfers/conveyance prior to October 21, 1972, have recognized the persons of the new owners, and have been paying rentals/amortization to such new owners</u></b>. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Tersely put, the May 7, 1982 DAR Memorandum provides that tenants should (a) have actual knowledge of unregistered transfers of ownership of lands covered by Torrens Certificate of Titles prior to October 21, 1972, (b) have recognized the persons of the new owners, and (c) have been paying rentals/amortization to such new owners <b><u>in order to validate the transfer and bind the tenants to the same.</u></b><br><br>In the case at bar, it is undisputed that the subject sale was not registered or even annotated on the certificates of title covering the subject lands. More importantly, the CA, which upheld the final rulings of the DAR Secretary and the OP, found that the tenants categorically belied having actual knowledge of the said sale, and that the tenants still recognized Sps. Vales as the landowners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In this regard, petitioners failed to show any justifiable reason to warrant a contrary finding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, keeping in mind that the factual findings of the CA are generally accorded with finality absent any sufficient countervailing reason therefor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> it may be concluded that petitioners failed to comply with the requirements stated under the May 7, 1982 DAR Memorandum. As a result, the subject sale could not be considered as valid, especially as against the tenants and/or their relatives – particularly, herein respondents. The subject lands were therefore correctly placed under the OLT Program of the government, which thereby warranted the denial of the petition for exemption.<br><br><i><b>C. Propriety of the Denial of<br>the Petition for Retention</b></i><br><br>Anent the issue on retention, suffice it to state that Sps. Vales had no right to retain the subject lands considering that their aggregate landholdings, consisting of 58.6060 has.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> exceeded the 24-hectare landholding limit as above-explained. Consequently, the subject lands would fall under the complete coverage of the OLT Program, without any right of retention on petitioners’ part, either under PD 27 or RA 6657, being mere successors-in-interest of Sps. Vales by virtue of intestate succession. In this respect, the denial of the petition for retention was likewise proper.<br><br><b><i>D. Propriety of the Reconsideration of the<br>DAR Secretary’s December 11, 2002 Order </i></b><br><br>Finally, the Court finds no merit in petitioners’ claim that the December 11, 2002 Order of the DAR Secretary granting the petitions for exemption and retention had already attained finality and can no longer be reconsidered, reversed or modified, especially on a second motion for reconsideration which is a prohibited pleading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In his September 25, 2003 Order, the DAR Secretary explained that a “palpable mistake”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and “patent error”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> had been committed in determining the date of the filing of respondents’ motion for reconsideration, which upon review, was shown to have been timely filed, warranting reconsideration of his earlier order. Settled is the rule that issues of retention and non-coverage of a land under agrarian reform are within the domain of the DAR Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> By virtue of such special competence, he should be given an opportunity, even on a second motion for reconsideration, to rectify the errors he may have committed. The time-honored rule is that if a remedy within the administrative machinery can still be had by giving the administrative officer concerned every opportunity to decide on the matter that comes within his jurisdiction, then such remedy should be priorly exhausted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Besides, rules of procedure are construed liberally in administrative proceedings as administrative bodies are not bound by the technicalities applicable to courts of law, hence, should not be used to override substantial justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>All told, the Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the denial of the tribunals <i>a quo</i> of the petitions for exemption and retention herein considered.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
