No. 205353, the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc ruled that the administrative claim for the second quarter of 2006 was belatedly filed on July 23, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; This is consistent with Section 112(A) of the Tax Code, as amended, reckoning the two-year period from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax.</i> –<br><br>(A) <i>Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. –</i> Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <i>within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales,</i> except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: <i>Provided, however</i>, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (b) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP):<i> Provided, further,</i> That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods of [sic] properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volumes of sales. . . . (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>With the close of the second taxable quarter of 2006 being June 30, 2006, petitioner should have filed its administrative claim for this quarter on or before June 30, 2008, and not on July 23, 2008.&nbsp; This applies the clear text of Section 112(A).<br><br>The June 8, 2007 case of <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i> explained that “it is more practical and reasonable to count the two-year prescriptive period for filing a claim for refund/credit of input VAT on zero-rated sales from the date of filing of the return and payment of the tax due which, according to the law then existing, should be made within 20 days from the end of each quarter.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The September 12, 2008 case of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mirant Pagbilao Corporation</i> abandoned <i>Atlas</i> when it ruled that “[t]he reckoning frame would always be the end of the quarter when the pertinent sales or transaction was made, regardless when the input VAT was paid,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> applying Section 112(A) of the Tax Code and not other provisions that pertain to erroneous tax payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Thus, the 2013 <i>San Roque</i> case clarified the effectivity of the <i>Atlas</i> and <i>Mirant</i> doctrines on when to reckon the two-year prescriptive period as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, which held that claims for refund or credit of input VAT must comply with the two-year prescriptive period under Section 229, should be<i> effective only from its promulgation on 8 June 2007 until its abandonment on 12 September 2008 in Mirant.&nbsp; The Atlas doctrine was limited to the reckoning of the two-year prescriptive period from the date of payment of the output VAT.</i>&nbsp; Prior to the Atlas doctrine, the two-year prescriptive period for claiming refund or credit of input VAT should be governed by Section 112(A) following the <i>verba legis</i> rule.&nbsp; The <i>Mirant </i>ruling, which abandoned the Atlas doctrine, adopted the verba legis rule, thus applying Section 112(A) in computing the two-year prescriptive period in claiming refund or credit of input VAT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Since July 23, 2008 falls within the window of effectivity of <i>Atlas</i>, petitioner’s administrative claim for the second quarter of 2006 was filed on time considering that petitioner filed its original VAT return for the second quarter on July 25, 2006.<br><br>We note that there were dissents submitted by other members of this court in the 2013<i> San Roque</i> case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; The ponente of a case, however, always writes a decision for this court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions docketed as G.R.
