MC04-8838 and MC05-9048 to 9055.<br><br>Appellant Mildred M.

Florentino, Ruzzel C. Crisostomo, Ma. Reinaluz De Guzman, Arvin M. Ariguin, Lester Duyao, Rosalyn A. Fernandez and Renante B.

The informations were similarly worded, except for the name of the person and the amount defrauded, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the period covering April 2004 to October 2004, in the City of Mandaluyong, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to defraud RUZZEL S.

Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution established that on different occasions, appellant represented herself to be capable of deploying workers for a fee to South Korea. Believing on such representation, the victims parted with their money and waited for appellant’s instructions. Upon receipt of the initial payments made by the victims, appellant issued either receipts or petty cash vouchers. Afterwhich, appellant stopped seeing them and failed to deploy them. Appellant yet demanded additional placement fee and made instructions to meet them at Greenwich Restaurant in Shaw Blvd. in Mandaluyong City. Prior to said meeting, the victims went to the National Bureau of Investigation (<i>NBI</i>) to complain about appellant’s activities. They likewise informed the NBI of their scheduled meeting with appellant, hence, the plan for entrapment operation where appellant was arrested. Upon her arrest, the NBI agents took from her the marked money. She was, likewise, found positive for yellow fluorescent smudges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Appellant, for her part, raised the defense of denial and claimed that she herself was an applicant and a victim of Llanesa Consultancy. She denied having transacted with the victims and explained that she was shocked when NBI agents invited her while she was attending mass in Mandaluyong City. As to the receipts and petty cash vouchers, she admitted having signed them but only upon instructions of a certain Susan Carillo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On October 10, 2008, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> against appellant, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused <b><i>MILDRED SALVATIERRA y MATUCO</i> GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the above-entitled cases and hereby sentences her accordingly, thus:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. MC05-8838, for Violation of R.A. 8042, otherwise known as The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, sentences her to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P200,000.00;<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. MC05-9048, for Estafa involving Ruzzel S.

The appellate court likewise modified the penalties on the<i> estafa </i>cases. The dispositive portion of the appealed decision is hereafter quoted for easy reference:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, in view of the foregoing, the assailed Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City (Branch 211) in Criminal Case No. MC04-8838 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> in so far as it adjudged accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of large-scale illegal recruitment in violation of R.A. No. 8042 or “The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995.” The fine imposed upon accused-appellant is increased to P500,000.00.<br><br>The assailed Joint Decision in Criminal Cases Nos.

The Joint Decision is <b>MODIFIED</b>, in so far as the penalty imposed.

Said confinement was confirmed in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated July 26, 2012. Appellant filed a Manifestation in Lieu of Supplemental Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> since her defenses and relevant issues have been exhaustively and substantially discussed in her appellant’s brief; while appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed its Supplemental Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on September 20, 2012.<br><br>We affirm appellant’s conviction with modification, however, on the penalties imposed.<br><br>The crime of illegal recruitment is defined and penalized under Sections 6 and 7 of RA 8042, or the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Definition</i>. – For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, and includes referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13 (f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: <i>Provided,</i> That any such non-licensee&nbsp; or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. It shall likewise include the following acts, x x x:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group.<br><br>The persons criminally liable for the above offenses are the principals, accomplices and accessories. In case of juridical persons, the officers having control, management or direction of their business shall be liable.<br><blockquote>SEC. 7.&nbsp; <i>Penalties</i>. –<br><br>(a) Any person found guilty of illegal recruitment shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than twelve (12) years and a fine of not less than Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00) nor more than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>(b) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) nor more than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein.</blockquote><i>Provided, however</i>, That the maximum penalty shall be imposed if the person illegally recruited is less than eighteen (18) years of age or committed by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority.</blockquote><br>It is necessary that the prosecution prove the concurrence of the following elements: (1) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of “recruitment and placement” under Article 13 (b) of the labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code (now Section 6 of RA 8042) and (2) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers.&nbsp; In the case of illegal recruitment in large scale, a third element is added: that the offender commits any of the acts of recruitment and placement against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In this case, appellant engaged in recruitment when she represented herself to be capable of deploying workers to South Korea upon submission of the pertinent documents and payment of the required fees. As appellant claimed to be the liaison officer of Llanesa Consultancy Services, the victims believed that she indeed had the capability to deploy them abroad.&nbsp; All the witnesses and the supposed victims identified appellant as the one who made such representation and received the payments they made evidenced by the petty cash vouchers and receipts she signed. Moreover, appellant was caught in an entrapment operation when she received the amount demanded allegedly as additional requirement before they can be deployed abroad. It was, likewise, certified to by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Licensing Division that neither appellant nor Llanesa Consultancy Services were licensed to recruit workers for overseas employment. It is also clear from the evidence presented that the crime of illegal recruitment was committed by appellant against five persons.<br><br>Clearly, we find no reason to disturb the RTC’s findings as affirmed by the CA, that appellant committed the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale.<br><br>We likewise agree with the appellate court that appellant may also be held liable for<i> estafa.</i> The very same evidence proving appellant’s criminal liability for illegal recruitment also established her criminal liability for <i>estafa</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The elements of <i>estafa</i> are: (a) that the accused defrauded another by abuse of confidence or by means of deceit, and (b) that damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is caused to the offended party or third person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In this case, as testified to by the victims/witnesses, appellant defrauded the victims by making them believe that she has the capacity to deploy them to South Korea as workers, even as she did not have the authority or license for the purpose. Because of this enticement, the victims parted with their money in varying amounts as placement fees to appellant. Consequently, the victims suffered damages as the promised employment abroad never materialized and the money they parted were never recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Now on the appropriate penalties.<br><br>As the crime was committed in large scale, it is an offense involving economic sabotage and is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P500,000.00 nor more than P1,000,000.00. The CA thus aptly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>The prescribed penalty for <i>estafa</i> under Article 315<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the RPC, is <i>prision correccional</i> maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum, if the amount of the fraud is over P12,000.00 but does not exceed P22,000.00. If the amount exceeds P22,000.00, the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional P10,000.00, provided that the total penalty shall not exceed 20 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In this case, the amounts defrauded are the following:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Case Number</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Person Defrauded</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Amount Defrauded</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Criminal Case No. MC05-9048</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Ruzzel Crisostomo</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P83,500.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Criminal Case No. MC05-9049</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Renante B.

Clearly, the modification made by the CA on the RTC computation of the minimum term is improper. The minimum term imposed which is 6 years, 8 months and 21 days of <i>prision mayor</i> is way above the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the RPC. Although the minimum term imposed by the RTC which is 4 years is within the range, we further modify the same and make it 4 years and 2 months in all the cases.<br><br>The maximum term, on the other hand, shall be that which could be properly imposed under the rules of the RPC, which in this case shall be 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years. The incremental penalty, therefore, shall be added to the maximum period of the prescribed penalty, which is anywhere between 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, in Criminal Case No. MC05-9048, the amount defrauded is P83,500.00 which is P61,500.00 more than P22,000.00. Six years shall be added to 6 years, 8 months and 21 days making the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence to 12 years, 8 months and 21 days.
