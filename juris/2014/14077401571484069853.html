Rana likewise backfilled a portion (subject backfilling) of the perimeter fence separating the Rana and Uy properties without erecting a retaining wall that would hold the weight of the added filling materials. The matter was referred to the Office of the Barangay Captain of Lahug<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> as well as the Office of the Building Official of Cebu City (OBO),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> but to no avail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Proceedings</b><br></center><br>On September 19, 1997, Wong, Sps.

Rana countered that prior to the construction of their residence, there was no existing road and they merely developed the subject portion which abuts their gate in view of the rolling terrain. They claimed that Wong and Sps. Ong do not have any need for the subject portion because their property is facing an existing road,<i> i.e</i>., Justice Street. They likewise denied having undertaken any backfilling along the boundary of the Uy property considering the natural elevation of their own property, which renders backfilling.unnecessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>After the filing of Sps. Rana's Answer, Wong, <i>et al.</i>, in turn, filed a Motion for Leave to be Allowed to Bring in Heavy Equipment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> for the intermediate development of the Wong-Ong property with a view to the use of the subject road as access to their lot. Notwithstanding Sps. Rana's opposition, the RTC granted Wong, <i>et al.'s</i> motion in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated November 27, 1997 (November 27, 1997 Order), the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, as prayed for, the motion is hereby GRANTED. Consequently, the plaintiffs are hereby allowed<b> to use heavy equipments/machineries in order to develop the area and make use of the right of way which is located between the [Wong-Ong and Rana properties]</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Despite the limited tenor of the November 27, 1997 Order, Wong, <i>et al.</i>, on May 23 and 24, 1998, proceeded to level the subject portion, which, in the process, hampered Sps. Rana's ingress and egress to their residence, resulting too to the entrapment of their vehicle inside their garage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Feeling aggrieved, Sps. Rana, on June 19, 1998, filed a Supplemental Answer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> praying for: (<i>a</i>) the restoration of the soil, boulders, grade, contour, and level of the subject portion; and (<i>b</i>) payment of moral damages, actual and consequential damages, and exemplary damages.<br><br>Meanwhile, on December 8, 1997, Sps. Rana filed with another branch of the same trial court a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> for Recovery of Property and Damages against Sps. Uy, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. CEB-21296</b>. They alleged that in October 1997, they caused a resurvey of their property which purportedly showed that Sps. Uy encroached upon an 11-square meter (sq. m.) portion along the common boundary of their properties. Their demands for rectification as well as barangay conciliation efforts were, however, ignored. Thus, they prayed that Sps. Uy be ordered to remove their fence along the common boundary and return the encroached. portion, as well as to pay moral damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses. After the filing of Sps. Rana's complaint, Civil Case No. CEB-21296 was consolidated with Civil Case No. CEB-20893.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In response thereto, Sps. Uy filed an Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> averring that prior to putting up their fence, they caused a relocation survey of their property and were, thus, confident that their fence did not encroach upon the Rana property. In view of Sps. Rana's complaint, they then caused another relocation survey which allegedly showed, however, that while they encroached around 3 sq. m. of the Rana property, Sps. Rana intruded into 7 sq. m. of their property. Hence, they posited that they had "a bigger cause than that of [Sps. Rana] in [so] far as encroachment is concerned."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Accordingly, they prayed for the dismissal of Sps. Rana's complaint with counterclaim for damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the RTC appointed three (3) commissioners to conduct a resurvey of the Uy and Rana properties for the purpose of determining if any encroachment occurred whatsoever.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b><center>The RTC Ruling<br></center></b><br>On December 20, 2002, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in the consolidated cases.<br><br>In <b>Civil Case No. CEB-20893</b>, the RTC found that: (<i>a</i>) Sps.

Ong the use of the subject portion and affected the market value of their property; (<i>c</i>) Sps. Uy have no intention of using the subject portion for ingress or egress considering that they built a wall fronting the same; and (<i>d</i>) Wong, <i>et al.'s</i> manner of enforcing the November 27, 1997 Order caused damage and injury to Sps. Rana and amounted to bad faith. In view of these findings, the RTC declared that the parties all acted in bad faith, and, therefore, no relief can be granted to them against each other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Separately, however, the RTC found that the backfilling done by Sps. Rana on their property exerted pressure on the perimeter fence of the Uy property, thereby constituting a nuisance. As such, the former were directed to construct a retaining wall at their own expense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, in <b>Civil Case No. CEB-21296</b>, the RTC, despite having adopted the findings of Atty.

Based on case law, however, the term "nuisance" is deemed to be "so comprehensive that it has been applied to almost all ways which have interfered with the rights of the citizens, either in person, property, the enjoyment of his property, or his comfort."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Article 695 of the Civil Code classifies nuisances with respect to the object or objects that they affect. In this regard, a nuisance may either be: (a) a public nuisance (or one which "affects a community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the annoyance, danger or damage upon individuals may be unequal"); or (b) a private nuisance (or one "that is not included in the foregoing definition" [or, as case law puts it, one which "violates only private rights and produces damages to but one or a few persons"]).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence further classifies nuisances in relation to their legal susceptibility to summary abatement (that is, corrective action without prior judicial permission). In this regard, a nuisance "may either be: (a) a nuisance <i>per se</i> (or one which "affects the immediate safety of persons and property and may be summarily abated under the undefined law of necessity");<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> or (b) a nuisance <i>per accidens</i> (or that which "depends upon certain conditions and circumstances, and its existence being a question of fact, it cannot be abated without due hearing thereon in a tribunal authorized to decide whether such a thing does in law constitute a nuisance.")<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b>It is a standing jurisprudential rule that unless a nuisance is a nuisance per se, it may not be summarily abated</b>. In <i>Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc. v. Jac Liner, lnc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court, citing other cases on the matter, emphasized the need for judicial intervention when the nuisance is not a nuisance<i> per se,</i> to wit:<br><br>In <i>Estate of Gregoria Francisco v. Court of Appeals,</i> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>Respondents can not seek cover under the general welfare clause authorizing the abatement of nuisances without judicial proceedings. That tenet applies to a <b>nuisance per se</b>, or one which <b>affects the immediate safety of persons and property and may be summarily abated under the undefined law of necessity.</b> The storage of copra in the quonset building is a legitimate business. By its nature, it can not be said to be <b>injurious to rights of property, of health or of comfort of the community</b>. If it be a<b> nuisance <i>per accidens</i></b> it may be so proven in a hearing conducted for that purpose. It is not <i>per se</i> a nuisance warranting its summary abatement without <b>judicial intervention.</b><br><br>In <i>Pampanga Bus Co., Inc. v. Municipality of Tarlac</i> where the appellant-municipality similarly argued that the terminal involved therein is a nuisance that may be abated by the Municipal Council <i>via</i> an ordinance, this Court held: "Suffice it to say that <b>in the abatement of nuisances the provisions of the Civil Code-(Articles 694-707) must be observed and followed</b>. This appellant failed to do."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Aside from the remedy of summary abatement which should be taken under the parameters stated in Articles 704.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (for public nuisances) and 706<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (for private nuisances) of the Civil Code, a private person whose property right was invaded or unreasonably interfered with by the act, omission, establishment, business or condition of the property of another may file a civil action to recover personal damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Abatement may be judicially sought through a civil action therefor<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> if the pertinent requirements under the Civil Code for summary abatement, or the requisite that the nuisance is a nuisance <i>per se</i>, do not concur. To note, the remedies of abatement and damages are cumulative-; hence, both may be demanded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In the present cases, Wong, <i>et al</i>. availed of the remedy of judicial abatement and damages against Sps. Rana, claiming that both the <b>elevated and cemented subject portion</b> and the <b>subject backfilling</b> are "nuisances" caused/created by the latter which curtailed their use and enjoyment of their properties.<br><br>With respect to the <b>elevated and cemented subject portion</b>, the Court finds that the same is not a nuisance <i>per se. </i>By its nature, it is not injurious to the health or comfort of the community. It was built primarily to facilitate the ingress and egress of Sps. Rana from their house which was admittedly located on a higher elevation than the subject road and the adjoining Uy, and Wong-Ong properties. Since the subject portion is not a nuisance <i>per se</i> (but actually a nuisance <i>per accidens</i> as will be later discussed) it cannot be summarily abated. As such, Wong,<i> et al. 's </i>demolition of Sps. Rana's subject portion, which was not sanctioned under the RTC's November 27, 1997 Order, remains unwarranted. Resultantly, damages ought to be awarded in favor of Sps. Rana particularly that of (<i>a</i>) <b>nominal damages</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> - for the vindication and recognition of Sps. Rana's right to be heard before the court prior to Wong, et al. 's abatement of the subject portion (erroneously perceived as a nuisance per se) - and (<i>b</i>) <b>temperate damages</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> - for the pecuniary loss owing to the demolition of the subject portion, which had been established albeit uncertain as to the actual amount of loss.<br><br>Sps. Rana's entitlement to the above-mentioned damages, however, only stands in theory. This is because the actual award thereof is precluded by the damage they themselves have caused Wong, <i>et al.</i> in view of their construction of the subject portion. As the records establish, Sps. Rana, without prior consultation with Wong, <i>et al. </i>and to their sole advantage, elevated and cemented almost half<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the 10-meter wide subject road. As homeowners of Peace Valley Subdivision, Wong, <i>et al.</i> maintain the rights to the unobstructed use of and free passage over the subject road. By constructing the subject portion, Sps. Rana <b>introduced a nuisance per accidens that particularly transgressed the aforesaid rights. </b>Thus, for the vindication and recognition of Wong,<i> et al. '</i>s rights, Sps. Rana should be similarly held liable for <b>nominal damages</b>. Under Article 2216 of the Civil Code,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[62]</sup></font> courts have the discretion to determine awards of nominal and temperate damages <b>without actual proof of pecuniary loss</b>, as in this case. Assessing the respective infractions of the parties herein, the Court finds it prudent to sustain the CA's verdict offsetting the damage caused by said parties against each other. The Court can, however, only concur with the CA in result since the latter inaccurately applied,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> as basis for its ruling, the<i> in pari delicto</i> principle enunciated in the case of <i>Yu Bun Guan v. Ong</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (<i>Yu Guan</i>). In said case, the Court discussed the <i>in pari delicto </i>principle with respect to the subject matter of inexistent and void contracts, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><center><b><i><u>Inapplicability of the in Pari Delicto Principle</u></i></b><br></center><br>The principle of <i>in pari delicto</i> provides that when two parties are equally at fault, the law leaves them as they are and denies recovery by either one of them. However, this principle does not apply with respect to inexistent and void contracts. Said this Court in <i>Modina v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><br>"The principle of <i>in pari delicto non oritur 'actio </i>denies all recovery to the guilty parties inter se. It applies to cases where the nullity arises from the illegality of the consideration or the purpose of the contract. When two persons are equally at fault, the law does not relieve them. The exception to this general rule is when the principle is invoked with respect to inexistent contracts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (emphasis supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Clearly, no void or inexistent contract is herein at issue, hence, the Court's disagreement with the CA's invocation of <i>Yu Guan</i> in this respect.<br><br>As for the <b>subject backfilling</b> touching the perimeter fence of the Uy property, records show that the said fence was not designed to act as a retaining wall<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> but merely to withhold windload and its own load.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Both the RTC and the CA found the subject backfilling to have added pressure on the fence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> consequently endangering the safety of the occupants of the Uy property, especially considering the higher elevation of the Rana property. With these findings, the Court thus agrees with the courts <i>a quo</i> that there is a need for Linda Rana to construct a retaining wall<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> which would bear the weight and pressure of the filling materials introduced on their property. The Court, however, observed that neither the RTC nor the CA specified in their respective decisions the backfilled areas which would require the retaining wall. Due to the technicality of the matter, and considering that the due authenticity and genuineness of the findings/recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the OBO and the accompanying sketch<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> thereto were not specifically denied by Sps. Rana,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the required retaining wall shall be constructed in accordance with the said sketch which showed the area backfilled.<br><br><b>B. Civil Case No. CEB-21296 For Recovery of Property.</b><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="40%"><br>Now, with respect to Civil Case No. CEB-21296, the Court finds that the CA erred in affirming the RTC's dismissal thereof considering that it was determined that Sps.

Having sufficiently proven their claim, Sps. Rana are, therefore entitled to the <b>return of the 2 sq.m. encroached portion</b>. Corollary thereto, compliance by Linda Rana with the directive in Civil Case No. CEB-20893 to build a retaining wall on their property shall be held in abeyance pending return of the encroached portion.<br><br><ol start="3" type="A"><li><b>Claims Common to Both Civil Case No. CEB-20893 and Civil Case No. CEB-21296: Malicious Prosecution of Both Cases, Moral and Exemplary Damages, Attorney's <u>Fees, and Litigation Expenses.</u></b><br></li></ol><br>As a final matter, the Court resolves the claims common to both Civil Case No. CEB-20893 and Civil Case No. CEB-21296, particularly those on malicious prosecution, as well as moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.<br><br>As the Court sees it, the filing by the parties of their respective complaints against each other was not clearly and convincingly shown to have been precipitated by any malice or bad faith, sufficient enough to warrant the payment of damages in favor of either party. As correctly pointed out by the CA, malicious prosecution, both in criminal and civil cases, requires the presence of two (2) elements, namely: (a) malice; and (b) absence of probable cause. Moreover, there must be proof that the prosecution was prompted by a sinister design to vex and humiliate a person; and that it was initiated deliberately knowing that the charge was false and baseless.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Hence, the mere filing of a suit which subsequently turns out to be unsuccessful does not render a person liable for malicious prosecution, for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> As the aforementioned elements were not duly proven, the claims for malicious prosecution are hereby denied.<br><br>With respect to the claims for moral damages, although the Court found the parties to have sustained nominal damages as a result of the other parties' acts, an award of moral damages would nonetheless be improper in this case. Article 2217 of the Civil Code states that "[m]oral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury. Though incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's wrongful act for omission." Corollary thereto, Article 2219 of the same code (Article 2219) states that "[m]oral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases: (1) A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries; (2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries; (3) Seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts; (4) Adultery or concubinage; (5) Illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest; (6) Illegal search; (7) Libel, slander or any other form of defamation; (8) Malicious prosecution; (9) Acts mentioned in Article 309; [and] (10) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35."<br><br>Here, it was not proven that the damage caused by (<i>a</i>) Sps. Rana against Wong, <i>et al.</i>, arising from the elevation and cementing of the subject portion and the subject backfilling, and (<i>b</i>) Sps. Uy against Sps. Rana, by virtue of their 2 sq. m. encroachment, could be characterized as a form of or had resulted in physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, or any other similar injury. Neither was it convincingly shown that the present controversies fall within the class of cases enumerated under Article 2219. Therefore, no moral damages should be awarded.<br><br>Similarly,. the Court deems that an award of exemplary damages would be inappropriate since these damages are imposed only "by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Bluntly placed, the Court does not view the present matters of such caliber. Hence, there is no reason to grant the parties' claims for the same.<br><br>Lastly, considering that neither of the parties was able to successfully prove (<i>a</i>) their claims for malicious prosecution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (<i>b</i>) their entitlement to moral and exemplary damages,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> and (c) the attendance of any of the circumstances under Article 2208<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of the Civil Code, their respective claims for attorney's fees and litigation expenses against each other are also denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated July 13, 2005 and the Resolution dated June 18, 2010 in CA-G.R.
