Napoleon L. Cuaton (Cuaton), the Officer-in-Charge of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs–Special Operation Unit, Caloocan City Police Station, received a call from a concerned citizen regarding the rampant sale of illegal drugs in <i>Barangay</i> 18, Caloocan City.&nbsp; Thus, P/Supt. Cuaton organized a team, composed of several police officers headed by Police Officer 3 (PO3) Ferdinand Modina (Modina), to conduct surveillance and a possible buy-bust operation in the said area.&nbsp; The team immediately proceeded to the target area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On April 8, 2006, at around one o’clock in the morning, the team arrived at <i>Barangay</i> 18, Caloocan City.&nbsp; PO3 Modina and PO2 Joel Rosales (Rosales) alighted from their vehicle and approached a group of six persons playing <i>cara y cruz</i>; PO3 Modina posed as a bettor.&nbsp; While watching the game, PO3 Modina saw a man, later identified to be Valencia, place a plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance as a bet.&nbsp; Thereupon, PO3 Modina introduced himself as a police officer, confiscated the plastic sachet, and arrested Valencia.&nbsp; The other persons who were playing <i>cara y cruz</i> scampered away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When asked to empty his pockets, Valencia brought out another transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from his right pocket.&nbsp; PO3 Modina then apprised Valencia of his constitutional rights.&nbsp; Valencia was then brought to the police station, together with the confiscated transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At the police station, the two plastic sachets that were confiscated from Valencia were turned over to PO2 Randulfo Hipolito (Hipolito) for investigation.&nbsp; The plastic sachets were then marked by PO2 Hipolito as “CVC-1” and “CVC-2” and were placed in a sachet marked “SAID SOU EVIDENCE dtd 04-08-06.”&nbsp; PO2 Hipolito then prepared the request to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory for the examination of the contents of the plastic sachets that were confiscated from Valencia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon examination, the white crystalline substance contained in the plastic sachets confiscated from Valencia yielded a positive result for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b></center><br>Valencia denied the allegations against him.&nbsp; He claimed that, at the time of the incident, he was standing in front of his house when several men came running from an alley.&nbsp; Thereupon, he saw that two of his neighbors were already handcuffed and are already being escorted by three (3) armed men clad in civilian clothes.&nbsp; One of the armed men then asked him if he knew where a certain “Fe” resides.&nbsp; When Valencia told them that he did not know where “Fe” resides, the armed men brought him to the police station together with his two neighbors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At the police station, Valencia was immediately placed in a cell.

No. 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 pertinently provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 11. <i>Possession of Dangerous Drugs.</i> – The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos ([P]500,000.00) to Ten million pesos ([P]10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess any dangerous drug in the following quantities, regardless of the degree of purity thereof:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing quantities, the penalties shall be graduated as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) Imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from Three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) to Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00), if the quantities of dangerous drugs are less than five (5) grams of opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, marijuana resin or marijuana resin oil, methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu,” or other dangerous drugs such as, but not limited to, MDMA or “ecstacy,” PMA, TMA, LSD, GHB, and those similarly designed or newly introduced drugs and their derivatives, without having any therapeutic value or if the quantity possessed is far beyond therapeutic requirements; or three hundred (300) grams or more but less than five hundred (500) grams of marijuana.</blockquote><br>The elements of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, are the following: <i>first,</i> the accused was in possession of an item or object, which is identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; <i>second,</i> such possession was not authorized by law; and <i>third,</i> the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the prosecution of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and, in sustaining a conviction therefor, the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> must definitely be shown to have been preserved.&nbsp; This requirement necessarily arises from the illegal drug’s unique characteristic that renders it indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise.&nbsp; Thus, to remove any doubt or uncertainty on the identity and integrity of the seized drug, evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the accused-appellant; otherwise, the prosecution for illegal possession of dangerous drugs under R.A. No. 9165 fails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>There must be strict compliance with the prescribed measures to be observed during and after the seizure of dangerous drugs and related paraphernalia, during the custody and transfer thereof for examination, and at all times up to their presentation in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In this regard, Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 outlines the procedure to be observed by the apprehending officers in the seizure and custody of dangerous drugs, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) <b>The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused</b> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote><br>Further, Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9165 similarly provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 21.&nbsp; Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precurses and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs <b>shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated</b> and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items; </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>x x x x (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>The rule on chain of custody under the foregoing enactments expressly demands the identification of the persons who handle the confiscated items for the purpose of duly monitoring the authorized movements of the illegal drugs and/or drug paraphernalia from the time they are seized from the accused until the time they are presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Moreover, as a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.&nbsp; It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.&nbsp; These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Crucial in proving the chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items immediately after they are seized from the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Gonzales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court explained that:<br><br><blockquote>The first stage in the chain of custody rule is the marking of the dangerous drugs or related items. <b>Marking, which is the affixing on the dangerous drugs or related items by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his initials or signature or other identifying signs, should be made in the presence of the apprehended violator immediately upon arrest.</b> The importance of the prompt marking cannot be denied, because succeeding handlers of dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference. Also, the marking operates to set apart as evidence the dangerous drugs or related items from other material from the moment they are confiscated until they are disposed of at the close of the criminal proceedings, thereby forestalling switching, planting or contamination of evidence. <b>In short, the marking immediately upon confiscation or recovery of the dangerous drugs or related items is indispensable in the preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>To prove the chain of custody of the seized plastic sachets, which were confiscated from Valencia, the prosecution presented PO3 Modina, who testified that:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

When it was handed by PO3 Modina it was marked by the investigator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>A perusal of the foregoing testimonies of PO3 Modina and PO2 Rosales shows that there are significant lapses in the chain of custody of the plastic sachets that were confiscated from Valencia.&nbsp; Indeed, while the prosecution was able to prove that the two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance that were confiscated from Valencia were marked as “CVC-1” and “CVC-2” by PO2 Hipolito, after the same were turned over to him at the police station for investigation, there was no showing that the marking had been done in the presence of Valencia or his representatives.<br><br>Further, although PO3 Modina testified that he turned over the said plastic sachets to PO2 Hipolito, who subsequently made the request for examination of the contents of the plastic sachet, it was not clear who actually brought the plastic sachets to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.&nbsp; It is likewise unclear who actually received the confiscated plastic sachets in the PNP Crime Laboratory and who exercised custody and possession of the same after it was examined and before it was presented before the RTC.<br><br>Verily, the records are bereft of any evidence, which would clearly show that the said plastic sachets were indeed marked in the presence of Valencia.&nbsp; Nor was there any evidence as to the identity of the individual who brought the seized plastic sachets from the police station to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.&nbsp; That the plastic sachets that were confiscated from Valencia were not marked in his presence or that of his representative and the indeterminateness of the identities of the individuals who had actually taken custody of the plastic sachets effectively broke the chain of custody, which thus taints the integrity of the sachets of shabu that were presented before the RTC.&nbsp; The foregoing lapses create reasonable doubt as to whether the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance that were presented before the RTC are the same ones that were confiscated from Valencia.<br><br>In <i>Gonzales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused for the failure of the prosecution to prove that the arresting officers therein had marked the confiscated sachet of <i>shabu</i> in the presence of the accused and its failure to identify the individual who brought the sachet of <i>shabu</i> to the PNP Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; The foregoing circumstances, the Court ruled, are fatal to the prosecution’s case, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Although PO1 Dimla, the State’s lone witness, testified that he had marked the sachet of <i>shabu</i> with his own initials of “ED” following Gonzales’ arrest, <b>he did not explain, either in his court testimony or in the joint affidavit of arrest, whether his marking had been done in the presence of Gonzales, or done immediately upon the arrest of Gonzales</b>.&nbsp; Nor did he show by testimony or otherwise who had taken custody of the sachet of <i>shabu</i> after he had done his marking, <b>and who had subsequently brought the sachet of <i>shabu</i> to the police station, and, still later on, to the laboratory.&nbsp; Given the possibility of just anyone bringing any quantity of <i>shabu</i> to the laboratory for examination, there is now no assurance that the quantity presented here as evidence was the same article that had been the subject of the sale by Gonzales</b>.&nbsp; The indeterminateness of the identities of the individuals who could have handled the sachet of <i>shabu</i> after PO1 Dimla’s marking broke the chain of custody, and tainted the integrity of the <i>shabu</i> ultimately presented as evidence to the trial court.&nbsp; We hardly need to reiterate that the chain of custody, which Section 1(b) of DDB Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002, <i>supra</i>, explicitly describes as “the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction,” demands such record of movements and custody of seized items to include the identities and signatures of the persons who held temporary custody of the seized item, the dates and times when such transfers of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Similarly, in <i>Fajardo v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the prosecution failed to establish that the plastic sachets containing <i>shabu</i> were marked in the presence of the accused therein; the individual who actually brought the confiscated plastic sachets to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination was also not identified by the prosecution.&nbsp; The Court likewise acquitted the accused therein, ruling that:<br><br><blockquote>Another phase of the first link to the chain of custody is the marking of seized items.&nbsp; <b>The rule requires that it should be done in the presence of the apprehended violator and immediately upon confiscation to ensure that they are the same items that enter the chain and are eventually the ones offered in evidence.&nbsp; Evidently, the marking was not done at the scene of the crime.</b> In fact, PO1 Bernardo testified that it was an investigator of the crime laboratory, whose name he cannot recall, who made the markings.&nbsp; Indeed, PO1 Bernardo could not explain the actual markings.<br><br>The prosecution miserably failed to establish the crucial first link in the chain of custody.&nbsp; The plastic sachets, while tested positive for <i>shabu</i>, could not be considered as the primary proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i> because the persons from whom they were seized were not positively and categorically identified by prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; <b>The prosecution likewise failed to show how the integrity and evidentiary value of the item seized had been preserved when it was not explained who made the markings, how and where they were made.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The third link in the chain should detail who brought the seized <i>shabu</i> to the crime laboratory, who received the shabu at the crime laboratory and, who exercised custody and possession of the shabu after it was examined and before it was presented in court. Once again, these crucial details were nowhere to be found in the records.</b>&nbsp; PO2 Tugo allegedly brought them to the crime laboratory but he was not presented to affirm and corroborate PO1 Tuscano’s statement, nor was any document shown to evidence the turnover of the seized items. The Request for Laboratory Examination was signed by a certain Police Senior Inspector Rodolfo Tababan.&nbsp; But his participation in the custody and handling of the seized items were never mentioned by the prosecution witnesses.<br><br><b>Considering these huge discrepancies in the chain of custody, the claim of regularity in the conduct of police operation will certainly not hold water.</b>&nbsp; It bears stressing that the presumption of regularity only arises in the absence of contradicting details that would raise doubts on the regularity in the performance of official duties.&nbsp; Where the police officers failed to comply with the standard procedure prescribed by law, there is no occasion to apply the presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Although the Court has ruled that non-compliance with the directives of Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution’s case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the prosecution must still prove that (a) there is a justifiable ground for the non-compliance, and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Further, the non-compliance with the procedures must be justified by the State’s agents themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The arresting officers are under obligation, should they be unable to comply with the procedures laid down under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, to explain why the procedure was not followed and prove that the reason provided a justifiable ground.&nbsp; Otherwise, the requisites under the law would merely be fancy ornaments that may or may not be disregarded by the arresting officers at their own convenience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Thus, in <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court stressed that:<br><br><blockquote>Respecting the team’s non-compliance with the inventory, not to mention the photograph, requirement of R.A. No. 9165, the same does not necessarily render void and invalid the seizure of the dangerous drugs.&nbsp; There must, however, be <b><b>justifiable grounds to warrant exception therefrom, and provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved</b></b> by the apprehending officer/s.<br><br>For the saving clause to apply, it is important that <b>the prosecution should explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had been preserved</b>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <i>[N]on-compliance</i> with the strict directive of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 is <i>not necessarily fatal</i> to the prosecution’s case; police procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence may still have lapses, as in the present case.&nbsp; <b><b>These lapses, however, must be recognized and explained in terms of their <i>justifiable grounds</i> and the <i>integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized must be shown to have been preserved</i>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis ours)<br><br></b></blockquote></blockquote>The arresting officers in this case tendered no justification in court for their non-compliance with the procedures.&nbsp; Indeed, a thorough perusal of the records of this case yielded no result as to any explanation or justification tendered by the apprehending officers as regards their non-compliance with the procedures laid down under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.&nbsp; It was thus a grave error for the RTC and the CA to rule that there was an unbroken chain of custody despite the failure of the arresting officers to mark the confiscated plastic sachets in the presence of Valencia and to identify all the individuals who took custody of the same from the time the said plastic sachets were confiscated until the time they were presented in the RTC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in consideration of the foregoing disquisitions, the Decision dated May 25, 2011 and the Resolution dated September 26, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
