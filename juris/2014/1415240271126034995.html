He noted that Am-Phil had six (6) contractual employees, while he was a regular employee who had a good evaluation record.&nbsp; He pointed out that Am-Phil was actually then still hiring new employees.&nbsp; He also noted that Am-Phil's sales have not been lower relative to the previous year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In response, Am-Phil's three (3) officers gave him two options: (1) be retrenched with severance pay or (2) be transferred as a waiter in Am-Phil’s restaurant, a move that entailed his demotion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On March 17, 2004, Am-Phil sent Padilla a memorandum notifying him of his retrenchment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Padilla was paid separation pay in the amount of ?26,245.38.&nbsp; On April 20, 2004, Padilla executed a quitclaim and release in favor of Am-Phil.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On July 28, 2004, Padilla filed the complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> for illegal dismissal (with claims for backwages, damages, and attorney’s fees), which is now subject of this petition.&nbsp; Apart from Am-Phil, Padilla impleaded Am-Phil’s officers: Luis L. Vera, Jr., Winston L. Chan, Robert B. Epes, Richmond S. Yang, John Arthur Latinazo, and Eunice D. Tugab.<br><br>For its defense, Am-Phil claimed that Padilla was not illegally terminated and that it validly exercised a management prerogative.&nbsp; It asserted that Padilla was hired merely as part of an experimental marketing program.&nbsp; It added that in 2003, it did suffer serious and adverse business losses and that, in the first quarter of 2004, it was compelled to retrench employees so as to avoid further losses.&nbsp; Am-Phil also underscored that Padilla executed a quitclaim and release in its favor.&nbsp; With respect to its impleaded officers, Am-Phil claimed that the complaint should be dismissed as they have a personality distinct and separate from Am-Phil.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On May 9, 2005, Labor Arbiter Eric V. Chuanico (Labor Arbiter Chuanico) rendered the decision finding that Padilla was illegally dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; He noted that Am-Phil failed to substantiate its claim of serious business losses and that it failed to comply with the procedural requirement for a proper retrenchment (i.e., notifying the Department of Labor and Employment).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; He also held that the quitclaim and release executed by Padilla is contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Finding, however, that Padilla failed to show bad faith on the part of Am-Phil’s officers, Labor Arbiter Chuanico dismissed the complaint with respect to the latter and held that only Am-Phil was liable to Padilla.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of Labor Arbiter Chuanico’s decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Prescinding from the forgoing, this office orders the respondent to pay the complainant limited backwages from the time of his dismissal up to the time of rendition of this judgment. The computation of backwages as prepared by the NLRC Computation Unit is herewith attached and made an integral part of this decision. Given that the position had already been abolished and since separation pay had already been received by the complainant, reinstatement is no longer viable [sic] remedy under the present situation.<br><br>As the complainant was constrained to hire the services of a lawyer, attorneys [sic] fees are ordered paid equivalent to ten percent of the total award thereof [sic]. Complainants [sic] claim for damages are [sic] denied for lack of merit.<br><br>For failure of the complainant to properly substantiate that individual respondents are guilty of bad faith or conduct towards him (in Sunio et. al. vs. NLRC GRN L 57767 [sic] January 31, 1984) only respondent Am-Phil Food Concepts, Inc. is held solidarily liable towards [sic] the complainant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>On August 15, 2005, Am-Phil filed an appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> with the National Labor Relations Commission.&nbsp; Apart from asserting its position that Padilla was validly retrenched, Am-Phil claimed that Labor Arbiter Chuanico was in error in deciding the case despite the pendency of its motion for leave to file supplemental rejoinder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Through this supplemental rejoinder, Am-Phil supposedly intended to submit its audited financial statements for the years 2001 to 2004 and, thereby, prove that it had suffered business losses.&nbsp; Am-Phil claimed that its right to due process was violated by Labor Arbiter Chuanico’s refusal to consider its 2001 to 2004 audited financial statements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On February 28, 2007, the National Labor Relations Commission issued the resolution affirming Labor Arbiter Chuanico’s ruling, albeit clarifying that Labor Arbiter Chuanico wrongly used the word “solidarily” in describing Am-Phil’s liability to Padilla.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>With respect to Am-Phil’s claim that Labor Arbiter Chuanico erroneously ignored its 2001 to 2004 audited financial statements, the National Labor Relations Commission noted that a supplemental rejoinder was not a necessary pleading in proceedings before labor arbiters.&nbsp; It added that, with the exception of the 2004 audited financial statements, all of Am-Phil’s relevant audited financial statements were already available at the time it submitted its position paper, reply, and rejoinder, but that Am-Phil failed to annex them to these pleadings.&nbsp; The National Labor Relations Commission added that, granting that this failure was due to mere oversight, Am-Phil was well in a position to attach them in its memorandum of appeal but still failed to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Holding that Labor Arbiter Chuanico could not be faulted for violating Am-Phil’s right to due process, the National Labor Relations Commission emphasized that:<br><br><blockquote>[O]mission by a party to rebut that which would have naturally invited an immediate pervasive and stiff competition creates an adverse inference that either the controverting evidence to be presented will only prejudice its case or that the uncontroverted evidence speaks the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The dispositive portion of this National Labor Relations Commission resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the instant appeal is DIMISSED for lack of merit. Accordingly, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.<br><br>However, the word “solidarily” in the last sentence of the decision should be deleted to conform with the Labor Arbiter’s finding that the complainant-appellee failed to properly substantiate that individual respondents-appellants were guilty of bad faith or conduct towards him.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated April 27, 2007, the National Labor Relations Commission denied Am-Phil’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Am-Phil then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>On February 25, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dismissing Am-Phil’s petition for certiorari and affirming the National Labor Relations Commission’s February 28, 2007 and April 27, 2007 resolutions.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals denied Am-Phil's motion for reconsideration in its July 3, 2009 resolution.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Am-Phil insists on its position that it was denied due process and posits that the National Labor Relations Commission’s contrary findings are founded on “illogical ratiocinations.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; It asserts that the evidence support the conclusion that Padilla was validly dismissed, that it was an error to ignore the quitclaim and release which Padilla had executed, and that Padilla’s retrenchment was a valid exercise of management prerogative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>For resolution is the issue of whether respondent Paolo Jesus T. Padila was dismissed through a valid retrenchment implemented by petitioner Am-Phil Food Concepts, Inc.&nbsp; Related to this, we must likewise resolve the underlying issue of whether it was proper for Labor Arbiter Eric V. Chuanico to have ruled that Padilla was illegally dismissed despite Am-Phil’s pending motion for leave to file supplemental rejoinder.<br><br><b>Am-Phil’s right to due<br>process was not violated </b><br><br>Am-Phil faults Labor Arbiter Chuanico for not having allowed its motion for leave to file supplemental rejoinder that included its 2001 to 2004 audited financial statements as annexes.&nbsp; These statements supposedly show that Am-Phil suffered serious business losses. Thus, it claims that its right to due process was violated.<br><br>Am-Phil’s motion for leave to file supplemental rejoinder,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated May 20, 2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> was filed on May 31, 2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> well after Labor Arbiter Chuanico promulgated his May 9, 2005 decision.&nbsp; Common sense dictates that as the motion for leave to file supplemental rejoinder was filed after the rendition of the decision, the decision could not have possibly taken into consideration the motion.&nbsp; Giving consideration to a motion filed after the promulgation of the decision is not only unreasonable, it is impossible. It follows that it is completely absurd to fault Labor Arbiter Chuanico for not considering a May 31 motion in his May 9 decision<br><br>Even if we were to ignore the curious fact that the motion was filed <i>after </i>the rendition of the decision, Labor Arbiter Chuanico was under no obligation to admit the supplemental rejoinder.<br><br>Rule V of the 2002 National Labor Relations Commission Rules of Procedure (2002 Rules), which were in effect when Labor Arbiter Chuanico promulgated his decision on May 9, 2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 4.

ALC Industries, Inc.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Due process is satisfied when the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their respective sides of the controversy. In <i>Mariveles Shipyard Corp. v.

Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel</b>. The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.</blockquote><br>In <i>Sebuguero v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> this court explained the concept of retrenchment as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Retrenchment . . . is used interchangeably with the term "lay-off." It is the termination of employment initiated by the employer through no fault of the employee's and without prejudice to the latter, resorted to by management during periods of business recession, industrial depression, or seasonal fluctuations, or during lulls occasioned by lack of orders, shortage of materials, conversion of the plant for a new production program or the introduction of new methods or more efficient machinery, or of automation. Simply put, it is an act of the employer of dismissing employees because of losses in the operation of a business, lack of work, and considerable reduction on the volume of his business, a right consistently recognized and affirmed by this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>As correctly pointed out by Am-Phil, retrenchment entails an exercise of management prerogative.&nbsp; In <i>Andrada v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this court stated:<br><br><blockquote>Retrenchment is an exercise of management’s prerogative to terminate the employment of its employees<i> ­en masse</i>, to either minimize or prevent losses, or when the company is about to close or cease operations for causes not due to business losses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>Nevertheless, as has also been emphasized in <i>Andrada</i>, the exercise of management prerogative is not absolute:<br><br><blockquote>A company’s exercise of its management prerogatives is not absolute. It cannot exercise its prerogative in a cruel, repressive, or despotic manner. We held in<i> F.F. Marine Corp. v. NLRC</i>:<br><blockquote>This Court is not oblivious of the significant role played by the corporate sector in the country’s economic and social progress. Implicit in turn in the success of the corporate form in doing business is the ethos of business autonomy which allows freedom of business determination with minimal governmental intrusion to ensure economic independence and development in terms defined by businessmen. Yet, this vast expanse of management choices cannot be an unbridled prerogative that can rise above the constitutional protection to labor. Employment is not merely a lifestyle choice to stave off boredom. Employment to the common man is his very life and blood, which must be protected against concocted causes to legitimize an otherwise irregular termination of employment. <u>Imagined or undocumented business losses present the least propitious scenario to justify retrenchment.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Underscoring supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Thus, retrenchment has been described as “a measure of last resort when other less drastic means have been tried and found to be inadequate.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Retrenchment is, therefore, not a tool to be wielded and used nonchalantly.&nbsp; To justify retrenchment, it “must be due to business losses or reverses which are serious, actual and real.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><i>There are substantive requirements relating to the losses or reverses that must underlie a retrenchment.&nbsp; That these losses are serious relates to their gravity and that they are actual and real relates to their veracity and verifiability.&nbsp; Likewise, that a retrenchment is anchored on serious, actual, and real losses or reverses is to say that the retrenchment is done in good faith and not merely as a veneer to disguise the illicit termination of employees.&nbsp; Equally significant is an employer’s basis for determining who among its employees shall be retrenched.&nbsp; Apart from these substantive requirements are the procedural requirements imposed by Article 283 of the Labor Code.</i><br><br>Thus, this court has outlined the requirements for a valid retrenchment, each of which must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">that the retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely <i>de minimis</i>, but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">that the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">that the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one month pay or at least ½ month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">that the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in good faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees’ right to security of tenure;

</b><br><br>Am-Phil’s 2001 to 2004 audited financial statements, the sole proof upon which Am-Phil relies on to establish its claim that it suffered business losses, have been deemed unworthy of consideration.&nbsp; These audited financial statements were mere annexes to the motion for leave to admit supplemental rejoinder which Labor Arbiter Chuanico validly disregarded.&nbsp; No credible explanation was offered as to why these statements were not presented when the evidence-in-chief was being considered by the labor arbiter.&nbsp; It follows that there is no clear and convincing evidence to sustain the substantive ground on which the supposed validity of Padilla’s retrenchment rests.<br><br>Moreover, it is admitted that Am-Phil did not serve a written notice to the Department of Labor and Employment one (1) month before the intended date of Padilla’s retrenchment, as required by Article 283 of the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>While it is true that Am-Phil gave Padilla separation pay, compliance with none but one (1) of the many requisites for a valid retrenchment does not absolve Am-Phil of liability.<br><br><b>Padilla’s quitclaim and release<br>does not negate his having been<br>illegally dismissed&nbsp; </b><br><br>It is of no consequence that Padilla ostensibly executed a quitclaim and release in favor of Am-Phil.&nbsp; This court’s pronouncements in <i>F.F. Marine Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which similarly involved an invalid retrenchment, are of note:<br><br><blockquote>Considering that the ground for retrenchment availed of by petitioners was not sufficiently and convincingly established, the retrenchment is hereby declared illegal and of no effect. The quitclaims executed by retrenched employees in favor of petitioners were therefore not voluntarily entered into by them. Their consent was similarly vitiated by mistake or fraud. The law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by employees pressured into signing by unscrupulous employers minded to evade legal responsibilities. As a rule, deeds of release or quitclaim cannot bar employees from demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled or from contesting the legality of their dismissal. The acceptance of those benefits would not amount to estoppel.&nbsp; The amounts already received by the retrenched employees as consideration for signing the quitclaims should, however, be deducted from their respective monetary awards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In sum, the Court of Appeals committed no error in holding that there was no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission in affirming the May 9, 2005 decision of Labor Arbiter Eric V.
