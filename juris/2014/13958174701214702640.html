(formerly Intel Philippines Manufacturing, Inc.) is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. It is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and exporting advance and large-scale integrated circuit components.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It is registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as a Value-Added Tax (VAT) taxpayer with Certificate of Registration bearing RDO Control No. 94-048-02621.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It is likewise registered with the Board of Investments (BOI) as a preferred pioneer enterprise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) is the government official vested with the power and authority to refund any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected under the <u>National Internal Revenue Code of 1997</u>, as amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (hereafter NIRC or Tax Code).<br><br>For the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of 1999, Silicon seasonably filed its Quarterly VAT Return on April 22, 1999 reflecting, among others, output VAT in the amount of P145,316.96; input VAT on domestic purchases in the amount of P20,041,888.41; input VAT on importation of goods in the amount of P44,560,949.00; and zero-rated export sales in the sum of P929,186,493.91.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On August 6, 1999, Silicon filed with the CIR, through its One-Stop-Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center of the Department of Finance (DOF), a claim for tax credit or refund of P64,457,520.45 representing VAT input taxes on its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods and capital equipment which are attributable to zero-rated sales for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999.<br><br>Due to the inaction of the CIR, Silicon filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the CTA on March 30, 2001, to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period. The petition was docketed as <i>CTA Case No. 6263</i>.<br><br>The CIR filed its Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated June 1, 2001 raising, among others, the following special and affirmative defenses: (1) that Silicon failed to show compliance with the substantiation requirements under the provisions of Section 16(c)(3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of <u>Revenue Regulations No. 5-87</u>, as amended by <u>Revenue Regulations No. 3-88</u>; and (2) that Silicon has not shown proof that the alleged domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment on which the VAT input taxes were paid are attributable to its export sales or have not yet been applied to the output tax for the period covered in its claim or any succeeding period and that the alleged total foreign exchange proceeds have been accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i>.<br><br>During the pendency of the case, Silicon manifested that it was granted by the DOF a tax credit certificate equivalent to 50% of its total claimed input VAT on local purchases of P19,896,571.45 or for the amount of P9,948,285.73. Hence, the CTA Division limited its review on the amounts of P9,896,571.45<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and P44,560,949.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on August 10, 2000, Silicon filed a second claim for tax credit or refund in the amount of P20,411,419.07 for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.<br><br>To toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period, Silicon filed on June 28, 2002 with the CTA a Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was docketed as <i>CTA Case No. 6493</i>.<br><br>The CIR filed an Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> asserting, among others, that Silicon’s claim for refund/tax credit in the amount of P20,411,419.07 was not duly substantiated and that said claim for refund is not subject to zero-percent (0%) rate of VAT under Sections 106(A)(2)(a)(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and 108(B)(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the NIRC.

The CTA Second Division held that the export sales invoices have no probative value in establishing its zero-rated sales for VAT purposes as the same were not duly registered with the BIR and the required information, particularly the BIR authority to print, was likewise not indicated therein in violation of the provisions of Sections 113,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 237<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and 238<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the NIRC.

No. 209 and CTA E.B. No. 219.<b><i><br><br><b><i>Decision of the CTA <i>En Banc</i> (CTA E.B. Nos. 209 &amp; 219) <br><br></i></b></i></b>On <u style="font-weight: bold;">February 18, 2008</u>, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> rendered the herein first assailed Decision in CTA E.B. No. 219 partially granting the petition for review and ordering the CIR to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of Silicon Philippines in the reduced amount of P2,139,431.00 representing its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000. After reviewing the records, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> stated that the amount of P13,916,752.43 may be a valid claim for tax credit or refund which is composed of input VAT on local purchases of P11,777,321.43 and input VAT on importations of P2,139,431.00. However, because Silicon is a BOI-registered entity with 100% exports and sales of properties or services made by VAT-registered suppliers to Silicon are automatically zero-rated, there is no VAT that has to be passed on to Silicon. Consequently, Silicon would not gain input taxes on its purchases of goods, properties or services. Thus, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> ruled that in the absence of any clear and convincing proof that Silicon’s local suppliers passed on or shifted the VAT on such domestic purchases to Silicon, Silicon cannot claim the amount of P11,777,321.43 as input tax credits on its domestic purchases for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.<b><i><b><i><br><br></i></b></i></b>On <u style="font-weight: bold;">February 20, 2008</u>, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> also rendered the second assailed Decision in CTA E.B. No. 209 denying the petition for review for lack of merit. After it reviewed and examined the invoices and other documentary evidence of Silicon for the first quarter of 1999, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> found that Silicon’s valid input VAT for refund was only P9,531,635.69. But since the DOF had already granted Silicon a tax credit certificate on January 24, 2002 in the amount of P9,948,285.73, the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> held that Silicon is no longer entitled to refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for its input tax for the first quarter of 1999.<b><i><b><i><br><br><b><i>The Consolidated Petitions before this Court&nbsp; <br><br></i></b></i></b></i></b>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 184360</span>, petitioner Silicon assails the Decision dated February 20, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2008 of the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> in CTA E.B. Case No. 209.<br><br>In its Memorandum, Silicon discussed two important issues. One, whether the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> erred in denying its claim for refund of input VAT derived from domestic purchases of goods and services attributable to its zero-rated sales on the ground of failure to imprint the words “TIN-VAT” and “ZERO-RATED” on its export sales invoices. And two, whether the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> erred in denying Silicon’s claim for refund on the ground that Silicon failed to prove its input VAT derived from its importation of capital goods and equipment and in not considering the recommendation and findings of the Court-commissioned Independent Certified Public Accountant that Silicon has substantially supported its export sales, importation of capital goods/equipment and its input VAT on local purchases.<b><i><b><i><b><i><br><br></i></b></i></b></i></b>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 184384 &amp; 184361</span>, Silicon and the CIR assail the Decision dated February 18, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2008 of the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> in CTA E.B. No. 219 which ordered the CIR to refund, or issue a tax credit certificate to Silicon for the amount of P2,139,431.00 (from the original claim of P20,411,419.07) representing its unutilized excess input VAT on domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.<br><br>The issues raised in the three petitions boil down to (1) whether the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> correctly denied Silicon’s claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for its input VAT for its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment attributable to zero-rated sales for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999; and (2) whether the CTA <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> correctly ordered the CIR to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of Silicon for the reduced amount of P2,139,431.00 representing Silicon’s unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.<b><i><b><i><b><i><br><br></i></b></i></b></i></b>Notwithstanding the above issues, we emphasize that when a case is on appeal, this Court has the authority to review matters not specifically raised or assigned as error if their consideration is necessary in reaching a just conclusion of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the present case, while the parties never raised as an issue the timeliness of Silicon’s judicial claims, we deem it proper to look into whether the petitions for review filed by Silicon before the CTA were filed within the prescribed period provided under the Tax Code in order to determine whether the CTA validly acquired jurisdiction over the petitions filed by Silicon.<b><i><b><i><b><i><br><br></i></b></i></b></i></b>The pertinent provision, Section 112(C) (formerly subparagraph D)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the NIRC reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 112. <span style="font-style: italic;">Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax</span>. –<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(C) <span style="font-style: italic;">Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made</span>. – In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <span style="font-weight: bold;">within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents</span> in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.<b><i><b><i><b><i><i><br><br></i></i></b></i></b></i></b>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application <span style="font-weight: bold;">within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period</span>, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied.)<b><i><b><i><b><i><br></i></b></i></b></i></b></blockquote>The above-mentioned provision expressly grants the CIR 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim for refund or tax credit. In addition, the taxpayer is granted a 30-day period to appeal to the CTA the decision or inaction of the CIR after the 120-day period.<b><i><b><i><b><i><br><br></i></b></i></b></i></b>Meanwhile, the charter of the CTA, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1125, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote>Section 7.

Moreover, if the CIR fails to decide within the 120-day period provided by law, such inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application for tax refund which the taxpayer can elevate to the CTA through a petition for review.<br><br>In the recently decided consolidated cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (San Roque for brevity) this Court stressed the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30 day period provided under Section 112(C) of the NIRC. Therein, we ruled that<br><blockquote>x x x The application of the 120+30 day periods was first raised in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aichi,</span> which adopted the <span style="font-style: italic;">verba legis</span> rule in holding that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional. The language of Section 112(C) is plain, clear, and unambiguous. When Section 112(C) states that “the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents,” the law clearly gives the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim. Resort to the courts prior to the expiration of the 120-day period is a patent violation of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a ground for dismissing the judicial suit due to prematurity. Philippine jurisprudence is awash with cases affirming and reiterating the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Such doctrine is basic and elementary.<br><br>When Section 112(C) states that “the taxpayer affected <span style="font-weight: bold;">may</span>, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals,” the law does not make the 120+30 day periods optional just because the law uses the word “<span style="font-weight: bold;">may</span>.” The word “may” simply means that the taxpayer <span style="font-weight: bold;">may or may not</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">appeal</span> the decision of the Commissioner within 30 days from receipt of the decision, or within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period. Certainly, by no stretch of the imagination can the word “may” be construed as making the 120+30 day periods optional, allowing the taxpayer to file a judicial claim one day after filing the administrative claim with the Commissioner.<br><br>The old rule that the taxpayer may file the judicial claim, without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision if the two-year prescriptive period is about to expire, cannot apply because that rule was adopted before the enactment of the 30-day period. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The 30-day period was adopted precisely to do away with the old rule, so that under the VAT System the taxpayer will always have 30 days to file the judicial claim even if the Commissioner acts only on the 120</span><sup style="font-weight: bold;">th</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> day, or does not act at all during the 120-day period.</span> With the 30-day period always available to the taxpayer, the taxpayer can no longer file a judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT without waiting for the Commissioner to decide until the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>To repeat, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax exemption, is construed strictly against the taxpayer. One of the conditions for a judicial claim of refund or credit under the VAT System is compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods. Thus, strict compliance with the 120+30 day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper, whether before, during, or after the effectivity of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas</span> doctrine, except for the period from the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003 to 6 October 2010 when the <span style="font-style: italic;">Aichi</span> doctrine was adopted, which again reinstated the 120+30 day periods as mandatory and jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Philex Mining Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, which was consolidated with the case of San Roque, this Court denied Philex’s claim for refund since its petition for review was filed with the CTA beyond the 120+30 day period. The Court explained:<br><blockquote>Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philex’s case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim <span style="font-weight: bold;">long after</span> the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas</span> case, Philex’s judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing.</span> Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas </span>doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirant</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Aichi</span> doctrines, Philex’s judicial claim was indisputably filed late.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas</span> doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">inaction </span>of the Commissioner on Philex’s claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, “deemed a denial” of Philex’s claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philex’s failure to do so rendered the “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise. Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Also, in the recent case of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Dash Engineering Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court likewise denied the claim for tax refund for having been filed late or after the expiration of the 30-day period from the denial by the CIR or failure of the CIR to make a decision within 120 days from the submission of the documents in support of its administrative claim. We held:<br><blockquote>Petitioner is entirely correct in its assertion that compliance with the periods provided for in the abovequoted provision is indeed mandatory and jurisdictional, as affirmed in this Court’s ruling in <i>San Roque</i>, where the Court <i>En Banc</i> settled the controversy surrounding the application of the 120+30-day period provided for in Section 112 of the NIRC and reiterated the <i>Aichi</i> doctrine that the 120+30-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional. Nonetheless, the Court took into account the issuance by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (<i>BIR</i>) of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 which misled taxpayers by explicitly stating that taxpayers may file a petition for review with the CTA even before the expiration of the 120-day period given to the CIR to decide the administrative claim for refund. Even though observance of the periods in Section 112 is compulsory and failure to do so will deprive the CTA of jurisdiction to hear the case, such a strict application will be made from the effectivity of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 on January 1, 1998 until the present, except for the period from December 10, 2003 (the issuance of the erroneous BIR ruling) to October 6, 2010 (the promulgation of <i>Aichi</i>), during which taxpayers need not wait for the lapse of the 120+30-day period before filing their judicial claim for refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>After a careful perusal of the records in the instant case, we find that Silicon’s judicial claims were filed late and way beyond the prescriptive period. Silicon’s claims do not fall under the exception mentioned above. Silicon filed its Quarterly VAT Return for the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of 1999 on April 22, 1999 and subsequently filed on August 6, 1999 a claim for tax credit or refund of its input VAT taxes for the same period. From August 6, 1999, the CIR had until December 4, 1999, the last day of the 120-day period, to decide Silicon’s claim for tax refund. But since the CIR did not act on Silicon’s claim on or before the said date, Silicon had until January 3, 2000, the last day of the 30-day period to file its judicial claim. However, Silicon failed to file an appeal within 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period, and it only filed its petition for review with the CTA on March 30, 2001 which was <b>451 days late</b>. Thus, in consonance with our ruling in <i>Philex</i> in the <i>San Roque ponencia</i>, Silicon’s judicial claim for tax credit or refund should have been dismissed for having been filed late. The CTA did not acquire jurisdiction over the petition for review filed by Silicon.<br><br>Similarly, Silicon’s claim for tax refund for the second quarter of 2000 should have been dismissed for having been filed out of time. Records show that Silicon filed its claim for tax credit or refund on August 10, 2000. The CIR then had 120 days or until December 8, 2000 to grant or deny the claim. With the inaction of the CIR to decide on the claim which was deemed a denial of the claim for tax credit or refund, Silicon had until January 7, 2001 or 30 days from December 8, 2000 to file its petition for review with the CTA.
