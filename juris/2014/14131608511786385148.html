				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 19 July 2011 affirming the conviction by the Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 82, of appellant Ronaldo Bayan <i>y</i> Neri for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and sentencing him to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a P500,000.00 fine.<br><br>Appellant was charged following a “buy-bust” operation.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information against appellant reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 5th day of July 2003, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, not authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did then and there, willfully and unlawfully sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as broker in the said transaction, zero point zero three (0.03) grams of <i>Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride </i>known as <i>Shabu, </i>a dangerous drug. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><br>When arraigned, appellant pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; Trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses PO2 Emeterio Mendoza, Jr. (PO2 Mendoza), who acted as <i>poseur</i>-buyer, and PO3 Ferdinand de Guzman (PO3 de Guzman), a back-up operative who assisted PO2 Mendoza.&nbsp; Their testimonies sought to establish the following facts:<br><br>Police operatives from the Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU) of the Novaliches Police Station conducted a buy-bust operation on 5 July 2003 based on a tip from an informant that a certain Ronaldo Bayan and Irene Bayan (Irene) were engaged in illegal drug trade in <i>Barangay </i>Capri, Novaliches, Quezon City.&nbsp; The team leader, PO3 de Guzman, narrated that the buy-bust team conducted a surveillance at Barangay Capri where they were able to confirm that an illegal drug activity was ongoing in the house of appellant.&nbsp; PO2 Mendoza prepared the pre-operation report which was submitted to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Mendoza was assigned as the <i>poseur</i>-buyer while PO3 de Guzman acted as one of his backups.&nbsp; At about 7:40 p.m. of the same day, the team proceeded to the target place.&nbsp; The buy-bust team was strategically positioned in the area while the informant and PO2 Mendoza went directly to the house of appellant.&nbsp; When appellant opened the door, the informant introduced PO2 Mendoza to appellant as the buyer of <i>shabu.</i>&nbsp; Appellant’s live-in partner, Irene, was likewise present during the introduction.&nbsp; PO2 Mendoza readily gave the 100-peso bill to appellant in exchange for the small plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Immediately after the exchange, PO2 Mendoza placed his hand on appellant’s shoulder, introduced himself as a police officer and arrested appellant.&nbsp; Irene meanwhile tried to escape but PO3 de Guzman was able to arrest her.&nbsp; PO3 de Guzman recovered from Irene’s possession dried <i>marijuana</i> leaves wrapped in a newspaper.&nbsp; Appellant and Irene were brought to the police station where PO2 Mendoza put his markings “EM” on the plastic sachet he received from appellant.&nbsp; Thereafter, they brought the plastic sachet to the crime laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The forensic chemist issued an Initial Laboratory Report which revealed that the heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet with markings “EM” containing 0.03 gram of white crystalline substance was found positive for <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his defense, appellant denied the charge against him.&nbsp; He claimed that he and Irene were walking on their way home when they were blocked by five men at the corner of Guyabano Street and Amparo Capri Street.&nbsp; Appellant recognized one of them as Isagani Mateo, who frequently displaces them whenever they sell in the market.&nbsp; The five men frisked, handcuffed, and brought them to Station 4, Novaliches, Quezon City.&nbsp; Thereat, they were asked to remove their clothes and they were frisked again.&nbsp; Appellant saw a sachet of <i>shabu </i>and <i>marijuana </i>on top of a table.&nbsp; They were forced by one of the policeman to point to the objects under threat of physical harm, while their photographs were being taken.&nbsp; They were also asked to sign a document which they were not able to read.&nbsp; Later that night, they were brought to the fiscal’s office for inquest without the presence of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 20 February 2007, the RTC rendered a Decision finding appellant guilty of violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and sentencing him to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a P500,000.00 fine.&nbsp; Irene was likewise found guilty for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and was sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to thirteen (13) years as maximum and to pay a fine in the amount P300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court gave credence to the testimonies of the members of the buy-bust team.<br><br>After receiving a copy of the trial court's Decision, the two accused seasonably filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; On 19 July 2011, the appellate court acquitted Irene for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 but appellant’s conviction was affirmed <i>in toto</i>.<br><br>The appellate court held that the prosecution established the consummation of the sale through the testimony of the <i>poseur-</i>buyer.<br><br>Appellant appealed his conviction before this Court, adopting the same arguments in his Brief before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Appellant maintains that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of appellant due to the glaring inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses.&nbsp; Appellant points out that PO2 Mendoza spoke of an alleged informant while PO3 de Guzman mentioned a concerned citizen who called the police station to inform them of an illegal drug trade.&nbsp; Appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to present the buy-bust money as proof of the illegal sale of <i>shabu.&nbsp;</i> Appellant argues that since the buy-bust money was the consideration of the alleged sale, failure to adduce it in evidence is tantamount to failure to establish the elements of the crime.<br><br>Appellant’s arguments deserve scant consideration. Jurisprudence dictates that minor inconsistencies do not affect the credibility of the witness.&nbsp; We have held that “discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details, and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime, do not impair their credibility. Testimonies of witnesses need only corroborate each other on important and relevant details concerning the principal occurrence.&nbsp; In fact, such minor inconsistencies may even serve to strengthen the witnesses’ credibility as they negate any suspicion that the testimonies have been rehearsed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Failure to present the buy-bust money is not fatal to the prosecution’s cause.&nbsp; It is not indispensable in drug cases since it is merely corroborative evidence, and the absence thereof does not create a hiatus in the evidence for the prosecution provided the sale of dangerous drugs is adequately proven and the drug subject of the transaction is presented before the court. Neither law nor jurisprudence requires the presentation of any money used in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In every prosecution for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must be sufficiently proved:&nbsp; (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, all these elements were duly established.&nbsp; Appellant was caught<i> in flagrante delicto </i>selling<i> shabu</i> through a buy-bust operation conducted by the operatives of SDEU of the Novaliches Police Station.<br><br>The <i>poseur</i>-buyer, PO2 Mendoza, positively testified that the sale took place and appellant was the author thereof, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">What happened after you were tasked as<i> poseur</i>-buyer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">We proceeded to the subject of our operation.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Where was that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No. 17 Guyabano Street, Barangay [Capril], Novaliches, Quezon City.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What time was that, what time did you arrive there?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">About 7:40.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">7:40 in the evening?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.
