Under the deed of conditional sale, Castillo agreed to sell his property to Olivarez Realty Corporation for P19,080,490.00.

However, the corporation only paid P2,500,000.00 of the purchase price. Contrary to the agreement, the corporation did not file any action against the Philippine Tourism Authority to void the latter’s title to the property. The corporation neither cleared the land of the tenants nor paid them disturbance compensation. Despite demand, Olivarez Realty Corporation refused to fully pay the purchase price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Arguing that Olivarez Realty Corporation committed substantial breach of the contract of conditional sale and that the deed of conditional sale was a contract of adhesion, Castillo prayed for rescission of contract under Article 1191 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.

Neither did Castillo clear the property of the tenants within six months from the signing of the deed of conditional sale.

According to Castillo, the deed of conditional sale clearly states that the corporation “assume[d] the responsibility of taking necessary legal action”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> against the Philippine Tourism Authority, yet the corporation did not file any case. Also, the corporation did not pay the tenants disturbance compensation. For the corporation’s failure to fully pay the purchase price, Castillo claimed that he had “all the right to pray for the rescission of the [contract],”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and he “should not be held liable . . . for any alleged damages by way of litigation expenses and attorney’s fees.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 2005, Castillo filed a request for admission,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> requesting Dr. Olivarez to admit under oath the genuineness of the deed of conditional sale and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-19972.

As to why it withheld payments from Castillo, it set up the following affirmative defenses: First, Castillo did not file a case to void the Philippine Tourism Authority’s title to the property; second, Castillo did not clear the land of the tenants; third, Castillo allegedly sold the property to a third person, and the subsequent sale is currently being litigated before a Quezon City court.<br><br>Considering that Olivarez Realty Corporation and Dr. Olivarez’s answer tendered an issue, Castillo properly availed himself of a motion for summary judgment.<br><br>However, the issues tendered by Olivarez Realty Corporation and Dr. Olivarez’s answer are not genuine issues of material fact.

The corporation knew of this adverse claim when it entered into a contract of conditional sale. It even obligated itself under paragraph C of the deed of conditional sale to sue the Philippine Tourism Authority. This defense, therefore, is sham.<br><br>Contrary to petitioners’ claim, there is no “obvious ambiguity”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> as to which should occur first — the payment of the disturbance compensation or the clearing of the land within six months from the signing of the deed of conditional sale. The obligations must be performed simultaneously.

The performance of the obligation to pay disturbance compensation did not depend on any condition.

Olivarez Realty Corporation should have paid the tenants disturbance compensation upon execution of the deed of conditional sale.<br><br>With respect to Castillo’s obligation to clear the land of the tenants within six months from the signing of the contract, his obligation was an obligation with a resolutory period. The obligation to clear the land of the tenants took effect at once, specifically, upon the parties’ signing of the deed of conditional sale. Castillo had until October 2, 2000, six months from April 5, 2000 when the parties signed the deed of conditional sale, to clear the land of the tenants.<br><br>Olivarez Realty Corporation, therefore, had no right to withhold payments of the purchase price. As the trial court ruled, Olivarez Realty Corporation “can only claim non-compliance [of the obligation to clear the land of the tenants in] October 2000.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> It said:<br><br><blockquote>. . . it is clear that defendant [Olivarez Realty Corporation] should have paid the installments on the P5 million downpayment up to October 8, 2000, or a total of P4,500,000.00. That is the agreement because the only time that defendant [corporation] can claim non-compliance of the condition is after October, 2000 and so it has the clear obligation to pay up to the October 2000 the agreed installments. Since it paid only P2,500,000.00, then a violation of the contract has already been committed. . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup></blockquote><br>The claim that Castillo sold the property to another is fictitious and was made in bad faith to prevent the trial court from rendering summary judgment.

Yet, even before the sixth month arrived, Olivarez Realty Corporation withheld payments for Castillo’s property. It even used as a defense the fact that no case was filed against the Philippine Tourism Authority when, under the deed of conditional sale, Olivarez Realty Corporation was clearly responsible for initiating action against the Philippine Tourism Authority. These are oppressive and malevolent acts, and we find Castillo entitled to P500,000.00 moral damages and P50,000.00 exemplary damages:<br><br><blockquote>Plaintiff Castillo is entitled to moral damages because of the evident bad faith exhibited by defendants in dealing with him regarding the sale of his lot to defendant [Olivarez Realty Corporation].

In the reply/motion to dismiss the complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> they filed with the Court of Appeals, petitioners argued that Castillo failed to pay the correct amount of docket fees. Stating that this action is a real action, petitioners argued that the docket fee Castillo paid should have been based on the fair market value of the property. In this case, Castillo only paid P4,297.00, which is insufficient “if the real nature of the action was admitted and the fair market value of the property was disclosed and made the basis of the amount of docket fees to be paid to the court.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Thus, according to petitioners, the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>Castillo countered that his action for rescission is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation. Thus, the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Tanauan City did not err in assessing the docket fees based on his prayer.<br><br>We rule for Castillo. In <i>De Leon v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> this court held that an action for rescission of contract of sale of real property is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation. In <i>De Leon</i>, the action involved a real property. Nevertheless, this court held that “it is the nature of the action as one for rescission of contract which is controlling.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Consequently, the docket fees to be paid shall be for actions incapable of pecuniary estimation, regardless if the claimant may eventually recover the real property. This court said:<br><br><blockquote>. . . the <i>Court in Bautista v. Lim</i>, held that an action for rescission of contract is one which cannot be estimated and therefore the docket fee for its filing should be the flat amount of P200.00 as then fixed in the former Rule 141, §141, §5(10). Said this Court:<br><blockquote>We hold that Judge Dalisay did not err in considering Civil Case No. V-144 as basically one for rescission or annulment of contract which is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation (1 Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed, p. 55; Lapitan vs. Scandia, Inc., L-24668, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 479, 781-483).<br><br>Consequently, the fee for docketing it is P200, an amount already paid by plaintiff, now respondent Matilda Lim. (She should pay also the two pesos legal research fund fee, if she has not paid it, as required in Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3870, the charter of the U.P. Law Center).</blockquote>Thus, although eventually the result may be the recovery of land, it is the nature of the action as one for rescission of contract which is controlling. The Court of Appeals correctly applied these cases to the present one. As it said:<br><blockquote>We would like to add the observations that since the action of petitioners [private respondents] against private respondents [petitioners] is solely for annulment or rescission which is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation, the action should not be confused and equated with the "value of the property" subject of the transaction; that by the very nature of the case, the allegations, and specific prayer in the complaint, sans any prayer for recovery of money and/or value of the transaction, or for actual or compensatory damages, the assessment and collection of the legal fees should not be intertwined with the merits of the case and/or what may be its end result; and that to sustain private respondents' [petitioners'] position on what the respondent court may decide after all, then the assessment should be deferred and finally assessed only after the court had finally decided the case, which cannot be done because the rules require that filing fees should be based on what is alleged and prayed for in the face of the complaint and paid upon the filing of the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Although we discussed that there is no rescission of contract to speak of in contracts of conditional sale, we hold that an action to cancel a contract to sell, similar to an action for rescission of contract of sale, is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation. Like any action incapable of pecuniary estimation, an action to cancel a contract to sell “demands an inquiry into other factors”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> aside from the amount of money to be awarded to the claimant. Specifically in this case, the trial court principally determined whether Olivarez Realty Corporation failed to pay installments of the property’s purchase price as the parties agreed upon in the deed of conditional sale. The principal nature of Castillo’s action, therefore, is incapable of pecuniary estimation.<br><br>All told, there is no issue that the parties in this case entered into a contract to sell a parcel of land and that Olivarez Realty Corporation failed to fully pay the installments agreed upon. Consequently, Castillo is entitled to cancel the contract to sell.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on certiorari is <b>DENIED</b>.
