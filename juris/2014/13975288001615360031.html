The February 11, 2011 CA Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>A perusal of the Petition revealed there were impediments to the Court’s subsequent action thereon:<br><blockquote>1. the Petition was not filed in the nick of time inasmuch as the Court could not have pursued action on or before September 9, 2010 which was supposedly the last day specified on the<b> Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review dated August 23, 2010, postmarked August 24, 2010, and received by this Court on September 13, 2010</b> for the simple reason that this <b>Division apparently received a copy of the Motion only on September 14, 2010, and the <i>Rollo</i> was forwarded to the Office of the <i>ponente</i> only on January 5, 2011</b>.&nbsp; Certainly, parties and counsel should not assume that Courts are bound to grant the time they pray for.&nbsp; By parity of reasoning, a motion that is not acted upon in due time is deemed denied.<br><br>2. there was no competent evidence regarding petitioners’ <b>identity</b> on the attached Verification and Certification Against Forum Shopping as required by Section 12, Rule II of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice which now requires a photocopy of petitioners’ competent evidence of identity.</blockquote><br>Accordingly, petitioners’ Petition for Review dated September 9, 2010 is hereby <b>DISMISSED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><div align="right">[Emphases supplied]<br></div></blockquote><br><i><b><u>The&nbsp; Antecedents:</u></b><br></i><br>The controversy stemmed from a complaint for recovery of possession and declaration of ownership filed by the heirs of Amada Aguila-Zaulda, namely, Eleseo A.

No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>In this case, the petitioners complied with the requirements laid down in the above quoted provision.<br><br>Records show that on March 10, 2010, petitioners timely filed a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the RTC decision (dated January 20, 2010, received by petitioners on February 25, 2010), but the same was denied in the RTC Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 4, 2010, copy of which was received by petitioners on <b>August 10, 2010.</b>&nbsp; Thus, they had <b>until August 25, 2010</b> within which to file a petition for review pursuant to said Section 1, Rule 42.<br><br>On <b>August 24, 2010</b>, petitioners filed their Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review before the CA, paying the docket and other lawful fees and deposit for costs and prayed for an additional period of fifteen (15) days from August 25, 2010 or <b>until September 9, 2010</b>, within which to file the said petition.<br><br>On <b>September 9, 2010</b>, they filed the Petition for Review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that the petition for review before the CA was filed within the additional fifteen (15) day period prayed for in their motion for extension of time to file it, which was filed on time by registered mail. To repeat, the petition was filed on <b>September 9, 2010</b>, within the fifteen (15) day period requested in their motion for extension of time to file the petition.<br><br>As earlier stated, the Motion For Extension Of Time To File Petition For Review, which was filed through registered mail on August 24, 2010, was filed on time.&nbsp; It was physically in the appellate court’s possession long before the CA issued its Resolution on February 11, 2011, dismissing the petition for review for being filed out of time.&nbsp; The record shows that <b>1]</b> the <b>CA</b> received the motion for extension of time to file petition for review on <b>September 13, 2010; 2]</b> the <b>CA Division</b> received the motion on <b>September 14, 2010</b>; and <b>3]</b> the ponente’s office received it on <b>January 5, 2011</b>.<br><br>Indeed, there was a delay, but it was a delay that cannot be attributed at all to the petitioners.&nbsp; The almost four (4) months that lapsed before the records reached the <i>ponente’s</i> office was caused by the gross incompetence and inefficiency of the division personnel at the CA.&nbsp; It was the height of injustice for the CA to dismiss a petition just because the motion for extension reached the <i>ponente’s</i> office beyond the last date prayed for. Clearly, the petitioners were unreasonably deprived of their right to be heard on the merits because of the CA’s unreasonable obsession to reduce its load. In allowing the petitioners to be fatally prejudiced by the delay in the transmittal attributable to its inept or irresponsible personnel, the CA committed an unfortunate injustice.<br><br>The petitioners could not also be faulted that the motion for extension of time was received by the CA on September 13, 2010.&nbsp; The rules allow parties to file a pleading by registered mail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; They are not required to ensure that it would be received by the court on or before the last day of the extended period prayed for. Though no party can assume that its motion for extension would be granted, any denial thereof should be reasonable.<br><br>Granting that the petition was filed late, substantial justice begs that it be allowed and be given due course.&nbsp; Indeed, the merits of petitioners’ cause deserve to be passed upon considering that the findings of the RTC were in complete contrast to the findings of the MCTC which declared petitioners as the lawful owners entitled to possession of the lots in question.<br><br>In <i>Montajes v. People of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> petitioner therein, due to erroneous computation, filed his petition for review before the CA two (2) days after the expiration of the requested 15-day extension period.&nbsp; The Court held in that case that being a few days late in the filing of the petition for review did not automatically warrant its dismissal and where strong considerations of substantial justice were manifest in the petition, the stringent application of technical rules could be relaxed in the exercise of equity jurisdiction.&nbsp; It found that the circumstances obtaining in that case merited the liberal application of the rule absent any intention to cause delay.<br><br>As regards the competent identity of the affiant in the Verification and Certification, records<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> show that he proved his identity before the notary public through the presentation of his Office of the Senior Citizen (OSCA) identification card.&nbsp; Rule II, Sec. 12 of the <i>2004 Rules on Notarial Practice </i>requires a party to the instrument to present competent evidence of identity.&nbsp; Sec. 12, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12. Competent Evidence of Identity. – The phrase “competent evidence of identity” refers to the identification of an individual based on:<br><br>(a) at least one current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual, such as but not limited to, passport, driver’s license, Professional Regulations Commission ID, National Bureau of Investigation clearance, police clearance, postal ID, voter’s ID, <i>Barangay</i> certification, Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) e-card, Social Security System (SSS) card, PhilHealth card, <b>senior citizen card</b>, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) ID, OFW ID, seaman’s book, alien certificate of registration/immigrant certificate of registration, government office ID, certificate from the National Council for the Welfare of Disabled Persons (NCWDP), Department of Social Welfare and Development certification [as amended by A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC dated February 19, 2008]; or<br><br>(b) the oath or affirmation of one credible witness not privy to the instrument, document or transaction who is personally known to the notary public and who personally knows the individual, or of two credible witnesses neither of whom is privy to the instrument, document or transaction who each personally knows the individual and shows to the notary public documentary identification.</blockquote><br>It is clear from the foregoing provisions that a <b>senior citizen card</b> is one of the competent identification cards recognized in the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. For said reason, there was compliance with the requirement.&nbsp; Contrary to the perception of the CA, attachment of a photocopy of the identification card in the document is not required by the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.&nbsp; Even A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC, amending Section 12 thereof, is silent on it.&nbsp; Thus, the CA’s dismissal of the petition for lack of competent evidence on the affiant’s identity on the attached verification and certification against forum shopping was without clear basis.<br><br>Even assuming that a photocopy of competent evidence of identity was indeed required, non-attachment thereof would not render the petition fatally defective.&nbsp; It has been consistently held<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that verification is merely a formal, not jurisdictional, requirement, affecting merely the form of the pleading such that non-compliance therewith does not render the pleading fatally defective.&nbsp; It is simply intended to provide an assurance that the allegations are true and correct and not a product of the imagination or a matter of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith.&nbsp; The court may in fact order the correction of the pleading if verification is lacking or it may act on the pleading although it may not have been verified, where it is made evident that strict compliance with the rules may be dispensed so that the ends of justice may be served.&nbsp; The Court, in <i>Altres v. Empleo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> issued guidelines based on previous jurisprudential pronouncements respecting non-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of a defective, verification as well as on certification against forum shopping, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x<br><br>2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.<br><br>x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>Again, granting arguendo that there was non-compliance with the verification requirement, the rule is that courts should not be so strict about procedural lapses which do not really impair the proper administration of justice.&nbsp; After all, the higher objective of procedural rule is to ensure that the substantive rights of the parties are protected.&nbsp; Litigations should, as much as possible, be decided on the merits and not on technicalities.&nbsp; Every party-litigant must be afforded ample opportunity for the proper and just determination of his case, free from the unacceptable plea of technicalities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In <i>Coca-Cola Bottlers v. De la Cruz,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> where the verification was marred only by a glitch in the evidence of the identity of the affiant, the Court was of the considered view that, in the interest of justice, the minor defect can be overlooked and should not defeat the petition.<br><br>The reduction in the number of pending cases is laudable, but if it would be attained by precipitate, if not preposterous, application of technicalities, justice would not be served.&nbsp; The law abhors technicalities that impede the cause of justice.&nbsp; The court's primary duty is to render or dispense justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; “It is a more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties, <i>giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases</i> while actually resulting in more delay, if not miscarriage of justice.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> [Italicization supplied]<br><br>What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor, or property on technicalities.&nbsp; The rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice.&nbsp; Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> At this juncture, the Court reminds all members of the bench and bar of the admonition in the often-cited case of&nbsp; <i>Alonso v. Villamor</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Lawsuits, unlike duels, are not to be won by a rapier's thrust. Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts. There should be no vested rights in technicalities.</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The February 11, 2011 and March 6, 2012 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 05379 are <b>SET ASIDE</b>.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> petitioners’ Motion For Extension Of Time To File Petition For Review filed with the Court of Appeals and gives due course to their Petition for Review.&nbsp; The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the Court of Appeals for decision on the merits of the petition.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Abad,</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><div align="right"><b><u>March 25, 2014</u></b><br></div><br><center><b>N O T I C E&nbsp; OF J U D G M E N T</b><br></center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on ___<u><b>March 17, 2014</b></u>___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on March 25, 2014 at 10:55 a.m.<br><br><br><center>Very truly yours,<br><b>(SGD)<br>LUCITA ABJELINA SORIANO</b><br><i>Division Clerk of Court</i></center><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 42-44.
